Jardine and built in 1872-73 for Ansche Chesed. A man named Simeon Abrahams conveyed land to the congregation for a burial ground in 1842. This cemetery was on 88th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. By 1879, there had not been a burial in twenty-six years. It was removed sometime in between 1897 and 1911. In 1930, Rodeph Sholom moved to its present location at 7 West 83rd Street on the Upper West Side. The Romanesque temple house and sanctuary, designed by Charles B. Meyers, were built between 1929‚Äì30 and dedicated on Purim in March 1930.

Part VI, Chapter 171 and ) (\\"FTCA\\") is a 1946 federal statute that permits private parties to sue the United States in a federal court for most torts committed by persons acting on behalf of the United States. Historically, citizens have not been able to sue their state‚Äîa doctrine referred to as sovereign immunity. The FTCA constitutes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, permitting citizens to pursue some tort claims against the government. Limitations Under the FTCA, \\"[t]he United States [is] liable ... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but [is not] liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\\" . Federal courts have jurisdiction over such claims, but apply the law of the State \\"where the act or omission occurred\\". (b). Thus, both federal and State law may impose limitations on liability. The FTCA exempts, among other things, claims based upon the performance, or failure to perform a \\"discretionary function or duty\\". The FTCA also exempts a number of intentional torts. However, the FTCA does not exempt intentional torts committed by \\"investigative or law enforcement officers\\", thus allowing individuals aggrieved by the actions of law enforcement officers to have their day in court. The Supreme Court affirmed this so-called \\"law enforcement proviso\\" in Millbrook v. United States, where a federal prisoner was allowed to bring a claim against the United States for intentional torts committed by federal prison guards in the scope of their employment.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-10362_2d9g.pdf Under the FTCA, a tort claim against the United States must be presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after the claim accrues, or it is time-barred. 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2401(b). The Supreme Court of the United States has limited the application of the FTCA in cases involving the military. This is the Feres doctrine.. FTCA is the \\"exclusive means by which a party may sue the United States for money damages ... in tort\\" (28 USC ¬ß 2679. Exclusiveness of remedy). Accordingly, an FTCA action \\"can be brought only in a United States District Court\\" (28 USC ¬ß 1346(b)). Regarding the timing of filing, FTCA's ¬ß 2401(b) states that the action must be brought \\"within two years after the claim accrues,\\" or \\"within six months after ... notice of final denial of the claim by the agency\\". History The \\"Federal Tort Claims Act\\" was also previously the official short title passed by the Seventy-ninth Congress on August 2, 1946 as Title IV of the Legislative Reorganization Act, 60 Stat. 842, which was classified principally to chapter 20 (¬ß¬ß 921, 922, 931‚Äì934, 941‚Äì946) of former Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary. That Title IV of the Legislative Reorganization Act act of August 2, 1946 was substantially repealed and reenacted as sections 1346 (b) and 2671 et seq. of this title by act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 982, the first section of which enacted this title (Tort Claims Procedure).28 U.S.C. ¬ß2671, Additional Notes, \\"Short Title\\" Section as found on the Legal Information Institute Online, Cornell University Law School The Act was passed following the 1945 B-25 Empire State Building crash, where a bomber piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William F.

Some accepted, but others initiated a lawsuit that resulted in landmark legislation. The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, for the first time, gave American citizens the right to sue the federal government.\\" Although the crash was not the initial catalyst for the bill, which had been pending in Congress for more than two decades, the statute was made retroactive to 1945 in order to allow victims of that crash to seek recovery.State Ins.

Recording and release While discussing the 2006 remix of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts at a dinner party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written but that did not have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail. \\"Strange Overtones\\" is the first single off the album Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. The track was released for free on August 4, 2008, as a DRM-free MP3 available only through the album's website. This is part of the unorthodox Internet-based marketing scheme the two used to promote the album, inspired by the success of Radiohead's 2007 album In Rainbows and the self-promotional strategies of Nine Inch Nails for the albums Year Zero, Ghosts I‚ÄìIV, and The Slip. In September 2008, Jon Yeo created a music video for the track featuring the paintings of Eno. A live recording of the song also appeared on Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour ‚Äì David Byrne on Tour: Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno, released on May 11, 2009. The song was also featured on the soundtrack album to Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, along with several other David Byrne compositions. In 2020, the song was covered by the indie rock group Whitney on their covers album, Candid. Composition Eno has also said the album is about \\"paint[ing] a picture of the human trying to survive in an increasingly digital world;\\" themes that are explored in this song. \\"Strange Overtones\\" has been described as \\"a song about writing a song\\"‚Äîthe subject of the song struggles to write innovative music, but is overheard by a neighbor using beats that are \\"twenty years old.\\" In terms of the genre of music, both Byrne and Eno have called it \\"electronic Gospel\\"‚Äîthe backing tracks are the kind of electronic music for which Eno is known, paired with hopeful and inspiring lyrics from Byrne‚Äî this song in particular features an uptempo backing track. Eno had been thinking about Gospel for several years, but couldn't write lyrics to hopeful songs.

It's quite easy to make just digital music and it's quite easy to make just human music, but to try and make a combination is sort of, exciting, I think.\\" Byrne considered his job as lyricist to \\"bring more humanity\\" to Eno's instrumentals, which can be \\"cold and academic.\\" Reception The song was downloaded over 40,000 times in its first three days of availability.

However, they were always overshadowed by the larger Korean communities in neighbouring Brazil and Argentina, and since the late 1990s, their population has fallen significantly. Migration history The first Korean immigrants to Paraguay came from Busan on a two-month journey by sea to Buenos Aires and then overland to Asunci√≥n, finally arriving on 22 April 1965. Exact numbers of migrants are difficult to calculate because Paraguay offered on-the-spot visas to all foreigners, and did not distinguish between those who came to settle in the country as opposed to those who intended to remain only temporarily; 120,000 Koreans arrived in Paraguay between 1975 and 1990, according to official figures, but many migrated onwards to Brazil, both legally and illegally. Paraguay's 1982 census showed 2,700 Koreans in Paraguay, but this was believed to have undercounted the actual population by as much as an order of magnitude. By 1999, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimated that 10,428 Koreans resided in the country, but by just two years later, that figure fell by more than 40% to 6,190. The population continued to decline after that, though less sharply; , Koreans in Paraguay had fallen to the fifth-largest group of Koreans in Latin America, and 24th largest in the world. Between 2009 and 2011, the population remained roughly stable. Of the 5,205 South Korean nationals or former nationals in Paraguay in 2011, 499 had become Paraguayan nationals, the vast majority (4,641 persons) had permanent residency, 16 were international students, and 49 had other kinds of visas. Business and employment The early Korean migrants who settled in Paraguay engaged in a variety of agricultural and commercial work, including beekeeping and door-to-door sales of imported clothing. By the early 1980s, many were involved in importing consumer electronics as well. Some also opened convenience stores in poorer neighbourhoods; they gained attention for remaining open through the siesta, unlike many of their competitors. The second generation have largely moved away from manual labour or small retail business, and entered into the liberal professions, such as medicine, law, pharmacy, architecture, and accountancy. Language and education Koreans in Paraguay opened their own school in 1972, the Colegio Coreano del Paraguay (), to provide cultural and language education to their youth. It is located in the San Vicente neighbourhood of Asunci√≥n. A Korean American Presbyterian church opened another school, the Colegio Presbiteriano Cerritos, in Villa Elisa (in the Asunci√≥n metropolitan area) in 1992. Little language shift is observed from Korean-dominance to Spanish-dominance among members of the Korean community in Paraguay, including those born locally; this contrasts sharply with the rapid shift from Korean- dominance to English-dominance among Korean Americans, especially of the second generation. Many Koreans in Paraguay send their children to study in universities in the United States and Europe; as of 2007, there were also roughly 100 Paraguay-born Koreans studying at universities in South Korea. They typically view English, rather than Spanish, as the most prestigious and economically important language to learn. Religion Korean Christian missionaries are active among indigenous communities in Alto Paran√° department. Korean churches in Ciudad del Este include Jard√≠n del Dios and Iglesia de la Asamblea de Dios.

After Italy surrendered to the Allies, he took refuge in the Spanish Embassy. Aware of the threat to Jews, he first began to help them find shelter in Spanish safe houses. After the Spanish ambassador moved to Switzerland, Perlasca posed as the Spanish consul, tricking Nazi officials and saving the lives of more than 5,000 Jews in Hungary in 1944 during the Holocaust. The film was made by Rai Uno and aired as a two-part TV film. The Village Voice deemed this account as \\"more courageous than Spielberg.\\" Background The movie is adapted from the book, La banalit√† del bene ‚Äì Storia di Giorgio Perlasca (2002) by Enrico Deaglio, about the achievements of an Italian man in saving Jews in Hungary in 1944. During World War II, Perlasca worked at procuring supplies for the Italian army in the Balkans. In the autumn of 1943, he was appointed as an official delegate of the Italian government with diplomatic status and sent to eastern Europe with the mission of buying meat for the Italian army. On October 8, Italy surrendered unconditionally to the Allied forces. Italian citizens in Hungary were then considered the enemy of the Hungarian Government, which was allied with Germany, and were at risk of arrest and internment. During this period, the Hungarians had forced Jews of Budapest into a ghetto, and they began deporting them to Nazi death camps, even as the Russians advanced on the eastern front. Some of the film's scenes feature other historical persons. For instance, Perlasca rescued two children from deportation and certain death while observed by Adolf Eichmann, who was in Hungary overseeing deportation of Jews to concentration and death camps. The film refers to Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who issued papers to protect tens of thousands of Jews. After the war, Perlasca returned to his home in Padua. In post-war Italy Perlasca spoke of his efforts and wanted to receive recognition, but was largely ignored due to his fascist connections (He had fought on the side of fascism in Spain, for example). Plot The film starts in a Budapest Hotel with a narrative introduction by Perlasca. His chambermaid warns him of a raid of Hungarian Arrow Cross storm troopers coming to arrest him. He escapes and manages gets to the railway station, where he tries to sneak onto a sheep transport wagon. Discovered by a local officer named Gl√ºckmar he is arrested (as Italy has surrendered to the Allies, Italian citizens in Hungary are considered enemies). While he is being taken away, an Allied air strike hits the station and Perlasca escapes. He goes to an upper-class party to get information from Contessa Eleonora about Resistance members who can help him leave the country. Another squad of troopers, led by Captain Bleiber, arrive on the scene and arrest some guests, including Italian military officers. The contessa uses her Hungarian social rank to get Perlasca out safely and sends him to Professor Bal√°zs, a doctor. Perlasca finds he is sheltering Jews who have left the ghetto, at a time when they are being deported to Nazi death camps. Perlasca spends the night at his clinic, but the place is investigated by Bleiber and his Lieut. Nagy. Escaping the immediate threat, the Jews leave the house in fear and most are caught and killed by Bleiber and his forces, who had been waiting outside. Perlasca survives with Magda, a young Jewish woman, and her daughter Lili. They reach the Spanish Embassy where, thanks to a safe-passage letter signed by Francisco Franco, he gains an audience with the ambassador Sanz Briz. He sends them to a Spanish safe house, protected by embassy sovereignty. They are accompanied by a local Hungarian Jewish lawyer working for the embassy. At the safe house, Perlasca meets more refugees from the clinic, and Eva and S√°ndor, a Jewish couple. He helps get groups to collaborate within the house. He and the lawyer leave the house for s drink but upon his return he recognizes that the house was indeed cleaned up illegally by the Arrow Cross soldiers. He begins searching for Magda first in the railway station where the fascists have already started to gather and load the Jews to wagons ready to roll out. For the second time, he confronts Gl√ºckmar, who helps him . Perlasca is sent to the SS-F√ºhrer of the station who is easily bribed and thus lets him compile a list of Jews needed by the Spanish Embassy. He cheats with the list and actually calls more people to his truck than it is permitted, except Magda, who isn't on the train. He then visits an Arrow Cross Interrogation base, where he finds a lot of executed Jews but saves those few who survived the torture with Magda among them. Returning to the Embassy, Briz tells him that the Spanish are withdrawing from Hungary and ceasing to operate. This is the point where Perlasca decides to take on the role of a so-called consul and to lie, saying he is of Spanish nationality and have others call him \\"Jorge\\". He refuses to let the Arrow troopers in and acts as if the Embassy is still functioning and is therefore sovereign territory. He organizes education, alert duty and supplies within these buildings. He visits G√°bor Vajna, the Arrow Cross Interior Minister of Hungary as consul and claims that the Jews housed by the Spanish are Sephardi Jews. Meanwhile, Lt. Nagy ‚Äì according to the local rules ‚Äì forces the protected Jews to the streets to clear debris caused by air raids. He then attempts to escort the group to the railway station for deportation, but is stopped again by a dispatch reporting Perlasca's and Vajna's agreement. Then comes the aforementioned encounter with Adolf Eichmann where Perlasca saves the lives of two siblings. He then falsifies 5000 'Schutzbriefs' (protection letters) when he is informed of his own Spanish passport waiting for him at the Hungarian border. He still chooses to stay because Magda's life is in danger. A final raid on the safehouse results in Nagy taking all the Jews (except a half dozen of them who remain in hiding) to the Danube bank, while Perlasca is attending a ball where he tries to borrow a train-wagon for his prot√©g√©s to be sent to Switzerland. While running away from the safehouse, Magda's father is shot on sight by a young militiaman, who tries to test him by asking him to recite the prayer, \\"Our father, who art in ... \\". As a Jew he can not do so, and the soldier yells, \\"Where is our father?\\" When S√°ndor responds, \\"I don't know where he is,\\" he is shot immediately. Perlasca and the few remained Jews find shelter at Professor Bal√°zs' flat. At the Danube river the 1944/45 Danube executions take place and despite recruiting aid from Major Gl√ºckmer, Perlasca arrives too late to the scene. He manages to save only Eva. Upon hearing the news of plans to burn down the Budapest ghetto and its inhabitants, he decides to convince the Jewish community to take up arms and to fight if necessary. He also makes his final visit to Vajna's office and, with a successful bluff, he convinces him to let the ghetto stand and thus be freed by the Red Army days later. In the final scenes, Cpt. Bleiber is seen hanged in the street and Perlasca leaves the city with the help of Gl√ºckmer, who was originally ordered to arrest him because of his previous fascist affiliations.

With more than 30 years in broadcasting, Bryan's career includes major-market program director and morning show duties, serving as host and producer of several syndicated programs, and ventures online and in television. Career=Early years= At age 17, visiting family near Augusta, Georgia, Gary Bryan heard a horrible broadcaster and believed he could do a better job as a radio personality. He met with the station manager at WTWA in Thomson, Georgia and began working the following day. Bryan is a veteran broadcaster, having served as program director at such stations as KKRZ (Z100) in Portland, Oregon, which he put on the air in 1984, and KUBE in his hometown of Seattle. Under his guidance, KUBE achieved all-time record FM ratings for the Seattle market in 1988. Bryan programmed ABC Radio's flagship FM station in New York City, WPLJ, while also serving as morning host. He then shifted his focus exclusively to performing morning hosting duties, appearing on-air at WHTZ in New York, the most- listened-to station in the United States at the time, and KFRC in San Francisco. In early 1995, while at KFRC, Bryan drew national attention and controversy when he rewrote \\"Iko Iko\\" into a parody called \\"Ito Ito\\", mocking Lance Ito, the judge presiding over the O.J. Simpson murder trial. After protests by several interest groups, Bryan was brought up on charges before the city of San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. He was found \\"guilty\\" but, as Bryan told the press, \\"they recommended I be demoted and take a cut in pay. Fortunately, they have no authority, so I told them to screw off\\". Bryan made his first feature film appearance in Metro, a 1997 release starring Eddie Murphy. In 1998, Bryan assumed morning host duties on KJR-FM in Seattle. =K-Earth 101= Bryan joined the staff of KRTH (K-Earth 101) in Los Angeles in June 2002 and began hosting the morning show. He moved to afternoon drive in February 2005 and returned to the morning shift in May 2006. From May 2003 to October 2008, Bryan and KRTH raised more than $1 million in support of the Bob Hope Hollywood USO at LAX through three radiothons, a golf tournament, and a raffle featuring a Jeep Wrangler customized by Jesse James. In July 2008, Bryan announced a joint venture with Blueprint Entertainment, a Canadian television company, to produce a TV show highlighting selected morning shows from radio stations throughout the country. Bryan is currently partnering with Lou Pizarro from Operation Repo and EGA Productions to develop reality TV concepts for cable and streaming video. He also produces a podcast called Mobshot featuring former mafia tough-guy Vince Ciacci. In addition to hosting the K-Earth 101 morning show, Bryan serves as the announcer on the annual Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Rewind with Gary Bryan Rewind with Gary Bryan is weekly nationally syndicated radio program hosted by Gary Bryan. Originally an oldies-oriented show, it has shifted to a classic hits format centered on music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The show, originating from KRTH, is produced through Bryan's production company, Radio Genius Productions, LLC and syndicated via United Stations Radio Networks. In 2009, Rewind combined its production efforts and affiliate network with those of oldies program Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember, which was also distributed by United Stations. The show became known as Dick Clark Presents Rewind with Gary Bryan for several years before dropping Clark's name and adjusting its format from oldies to classic hits. Awards and honors Bryan was named a \\"Legend of Radio\\" at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Seattle, Washington, in 1998. He was name \\"Patriot of the Year\\" by the Bob Hope Hollywood USO in June 2005. Personal life Bryan's birth date is January 15. Born at the Navy Hospital in Philadelphia, Bryan grew up as Navy brat, moving around the country with his family. By the time he graduated high school, Bryan had lived in Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Norfolk, Virginia, Bath, Maine, San Diego, Los Angeles and Gray, Georgia. He graduated from Cascade High School in Everett, Washington. He has been married since the age of 19 to his wife, June. They have 4 children, Jack, Kate, Marie and Grace and 4 grandchildren, Eva, Jesse, Zoey and John.

It was circumscribed by Swiss mycologist Victor Fayod in 1889 for Conocybe-like species with partial veils. The genus has since been expanded to include species lacking partial veils. Taxonomic details The genus Pholiotina is defined as small thin Mycena- like mushrooms, with an hymenoderm pileipellis, a dry cap surface, cystidia that are sub-capitate to blunt, and spores which are rusty brown in deposit. Spores of mushrooms of this genus are thick walled, smooth and have a germ pore. Victor Fayod designated Pholiotina blattaria as the type species of Pholiotina, but this name was used for many different species of Pholiotina with partial veils and it is unclear which species is really P. blattaria, which makes it a nomen dubium. He designated a lectotype for this species in the same publication, and microscopic examination revealed that this specimen belongs to the species P. vexans, making P. vexans the current type species of Pholiotina. Some authors considered Pholiotina part of the genus Conocybe. However, a molecular phylogenetics study has shown that, while Pholiotina as currently defined is polyphyletic, the three clades that have been placed in Pholiotina are more closely related to other genera than to Conocybe. The two genera can be distinguished microscopically: Pholiotina contains a differentiated central zone called a mediostratum that is lacking in Conocybe. Additionally, most Pholiotina species have cystidia with rounded to tapered tips, compared to the enlarged, globular cystidial tips of Conocybe. In a 2007 publication, Hausknecht and Krisai-Greilhuber devised an infrageneric classification that includes the sections Piliferae and Vestitae, and the series Aeruginosa, Aporos, Appendiculata, Brunnea, Coprophila, Filipes, Keniensis, Mairei, Pygmaeoaffinis, Resinosocystidiata, Sulcata, Teneroides, Utriformis, and Vexans. However, a 2013 study by T√≥th et al. found Pholiotina as it is currently defined to be polyphyletic, with one clade forming the sister group to Descolea, another forming the sister group to Bolbitius and another forming the sister group to Galerella nigeriensis. All the species of Pholiotina with partial veils and some species without, including the type species, P. vexans, formed a monophyletic clade closely related to Descolea. It is likely that the species in this clade will be kept as Pholiotina species, while the species in the other two clades will be removed to other genera, but this has not happened yet. This study also found some of the sections named by Hausknecht and Krisai-Greilhuber to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Notable species Pholiotina rugosa is the most commonly known species of this genus, although in most field guides this species is known as Conocybe filaris, which is a junior synonym. It is a deadly poisonous species. Pholiotina also includes the psychoactive species P. cyanopus and P. smithii. Since Pholiotina under the current definition is polyphyletic, some of these species will likely be moved to other genera.

The Colonial Office was a government department of the Kingdom of Great Britain and later of the United Kingdom, first created to deal with the colonial affairs of British North America but needed also to oversee the increasing number of colonies of the British Empire. Despite its name, the Colonial Office was never responsible for all Britain's Imperial territories; for example protectorates fell under the purview of the Foreign Office, British India was ruled by the East India Company until 1858 (thereafter being succeeded by the India Office as a result of the Indian Mutiny), whilst the role of the colonial office in the affairs of the Dominions changed as time passed. It was headed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, also known more informally as the Colonial Secretary. First Colonial Office (1768‚Äì1782) Prior to 1768, responsibility for the affairs of the British colonies was part of the duties of the Secretary of State for the Southern Department and a committee of the Privy Council known as the Board of Trade and Plantations. In 1768 the separate American or Colonial Department was established, in order to deal with colonial affairs in British North America. With the loss of thirteen of its colonies, however, the department was abolished in 1782. Responsibility for the remaining colonies was given to the Home Office, and subsequently in 1801 transferred to the War Office. War and Colonies Office (1801-1854) and Second Colonial Office (1854‚Äì1966) The War Office was renamed the War and Colonial Office in 1801, under a new Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, to reflect the increasing importance of the colonies. In 1825 a new post of Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies was created within this office. It was held by Robert William Hay initially. His successors were James Stephen, Herman Merivale, Frederic Rogers, Robert Herbert and Robert Henry Meade. In 1854, the War and Colonial Office was divided in two, and a new Colonial Office was created to deal specifically with the affairs in the colonies and assigned to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Colonial Office did not have responsibility for all British possessions overseas: for example, both the Indian Empire (or Raj) and other British territories near India, were under the authority of the India Office from 1854. Other, more informal protectorates, such as the Khedivate of Egypt, fell under the authority of the Foreign Office. The increasing independence of the Dominions ‚Äì Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa ‚Äì following the 1907 Imperial Conference, led to the formation of a separate Dominion Division within the Colonial Office. From 1925 onwards the UK ministry included a separate Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. On 16 April 1947 the Irgun placed a bomb at the Colonial Office which failed to detonate. The plot was linked to the 1946 Embassy bombing. After the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the Dominion Office was merged with the India Office to form the Commonwealth Relations Office. In 1966, the Commonwealth Relations Office was re-merged with the Colonial Office, forming the Commonwealth Office. Two years later, this department was itself merged into the Foreign Office, establishing the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Colonial Office had its offices in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building in Whitehall. The Colonial Office List From 1862, the Colonial Office published historical and statistical information concerning the United Kingdom's colonial dependencies in The Colonial Office List,; though between 1926 and 1940 it was known as The Dominions Office and Colonial Office List.. It later became known as the Commonwealth Relations Office Year Book and Commonwealth Office Year Book. In addition to the official List published by the Colonial Office, an edited version was also produced by Waterlow and Sons.See, for example, . It can be difficult to distinguish between the two versions in library catalogue descriptions. For example, The Sydney Stock and Station Journal of 3 December 1915 commented:.

Until March 2012, it was the main source of electricity for the nearby Alcan Lynemouth Aluminium Smelter. It is located on the coast of Northumberland, north east of the town of Ashington in north east England. The station has stood as a landmark on the Northumberland coast since it opened in 1972, and had been privately owned by aluminium company Rio Tinto Alcan throughout its operation until December 2013, when RWE npower took over. In January 2016 it was acquired by Energetick√Ω a pr≈Ømyslov√Ω holding. The station is one of the most recently built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420 megawatts (MW), was one of the smallest. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetick√Ω a pr≈Ømyslov√Ω holding (EPH). The station converted to biomass in 2018, ending its use of coal. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. History In 1968, Alcan had applied for planning permission for the construction of a new aluminium smelter in Northumberland at Lynemouth. Later that year, Alcan was granted the permission and site preparation would soon begin. However, to meet the electric demand of the new smelter, a power station would also be needed to be built. Therefore, Lynemouth Power Station was constructed only from the aluminium smelter. The smelter and power station were constructed in southeast Northumberland to lower high unemployment numbers. The site was chosen because of the nearby Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery was sunk in 1909 and Lynemouth Colliery in 1927. In 1968 the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift has no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed at the end of the conveyor belt. Both buildings were designed by architects Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, with engineering consultation from Engineering & Power Consultants Ltd. The power station was constructed by Tarmac Construction and the smelter by M.J. Gleeson Company. Both the power station and smelter were brought into operation in March 1972. Design and specifications Electricity is fed from the power station to the smelter by a 24 kilovolt connection The boiler house and turbine hall have a steel frame with aluminium cladding. Other structures include a single tall chimney of reinforced concrete, and coal delivery and sorting plant. The station's boiler house houses three 380 MWth International Combustion boilers, which were fuelled by pulverised bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam a 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420 MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolts (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132 kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310 MW of the 420 MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110 MW was fed into the national grid. Since the closure of the smelter, all generation goes to the grid. Between 1999 and 2000, the power station was given a turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's condensers were also refurbished. The condenser refurbishment was carried out by Alstom. These improvements saw an increase in the station's generating capacity, thermal efficiency and MWh production. Operations=Coal supply and transport= merry-go-round system The power station was the leading coal customer in Northumberland, burning 1,200,000 tonnes of coal a year, with a weekly coal consumption between 25,000 and 27,000 tonnes. The station has relatively limited coal storage facilities, and was only able to hold three to four weeks worth of its fuel. The station was designed specifically to burn coal from the Northumberland coalfields. The neighbouring Ellington Colliery originally fed coal directly to the power station using a conveyor belt from its Bewick Drift Mine, situated from the station. Within a year of the power station opening, 3,000 men were employed between the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries, producing over two million tons of coal a year, the majority of it being sold to the power station. In 1994, Ellington Colliery connected underground with Lynemouth Colliery, but coal continued to be taken straight to the power station's coal sorting area using conveyor belts. This supply was supplemented by coal from local opencast mines. However, Ellington Colliery was forced to close when it flooded in January 2005. The station burned the colliery's remaining coal stock after it closed, and since then coal had been sourced from opencast mines in Northumberland and Scotland, but then a small amount of import was necessary. Coal was then delivered to the station mainly using rail transport and was unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station used the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also served the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and then the line was only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines was brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal was graded and washed at the station prior to being burned. With only one significant opencast in the local area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, there was a need for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal could see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources would not be as vulnerable to interruptions and would have fixed, contracted prices. The station was not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which had been booked by power stations closer to them. This meant that coal for the power station needed to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station was Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth was the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There were currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval had been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have had too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it would not have been an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007. =Water use= For creating the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming away from the turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that is used in the Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea. Water used in the steam cycle is taken from the local mains water, supplied by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is used in the station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused. Operating close to the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four times as fast as in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, primarily for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats. =Ash removal= Ash from the station is usually either landfilled or recycled in the construction industry Fly ash and bottom ash are two byproducts made through the burning of coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material in the construction industry and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter. =Biomass usage= In December 2003 the Environment Agency granted permission for the plant to co-fire biomass fuels in the station. Since 2004 three different types of biomass fuel been in use at Lynemouth; Sawdust and Wood pellets from FSC certified forests and Olive residues. These fuels are mixed with the coal on the conveyor belt into the power station. In 2004 11,000 tonnes of biomass fuel were used in the station. Biomass conversion ambitions have increased, with the site currently aiming to be 100% biomass fired from 2015. The station earned the world class OHSAS 18001 health and safety certificate in 2003, ahead of Alcan's global targets. All of the station's staff were required to take place in safety audits to improve working practice at the station. The certificate was presented to the station's manager by Wansbeck MP Denis Murphy on 15 March 2003. The station's attention to health and safety was further recognised on 6 June 2007 when they were honoured by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) with a RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Award at the Hilton Birmingham Metropole Hotel. Workers at the station had been audited by RoSPA for 10 years before receiving the award. =Coastal defence= In late 1994, the power station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This led to a sea defence system being constructed to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had been used as a coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a ¬£2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall. Environmental impact The power station's use of biomass since 2004 has been part of an attempt to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) output. In 2002 and 2004 the station met its targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest CO2 emissions in the north of England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year. However, generally the station reduced it CO2 emissions by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and European standards. Windfarms In 2006 a proposal was made by Hawthorn Power, an offshoot of UK Coal, to construct three tall wind turbines on an unused part of the station's coal sorting area, north of the power station. Permission was granted for the turbines in February 2008. In July 2010, it was revealed that the project's new developer, Clipper Windpower, would be using the site to erect the country's first super-efficient wind turbines, called Liberty Wind Turbine. However, this meant the height of the turbines would increase from to . Each turbine would have a rating of 2.5 MW, but only three turbines would be built. The wind farm would produce enough electricity to provide power for 1,690 houses. One turbine is expected to be erected initially, while environmental issues are assessed. ScottishPower Renewables also have permission to build 13 wind turbines near the aluminium smelter. They were initially refused planning permission, which they submitted in November 2006. This was because their site is spread over two council boundaries and Wansbeck Council approved the scheme, but Castle Morpeth refused. An appeal hearing was given in April 2008, and permission was eventually granted in January 2009 for the construction of up to 13 turbines, producing 30 MW of electricity. Future of the station Following a visit to the station by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 3 July 2009, it became apparent that Rio Tinto Alcan were hoping to be able to demonstrate Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology at the station in the future, using \\"pre-combustion\\" CCS technology. This would have involved treating the coal prior to burning so that less CO2 was produced, with any remaining CO2 being pumped under the North Sea into an aquifer. However, due to the economic climate, Rio Tinto did not commit the funding for the project themselves, and did not secure any of the required ¬£1 billion European Union funding available for demonstration of CCS technology. In November 2009 it was announced that a variety of energy experts were preparing for the ¬£1 billion bid to the Government for investment. The plans included a pipeline into the North Sea, and the upgrading of one of the station's generating sets from 140 MW to around 375 MW, to safeguard the supply of electricity to the aluminium smelter. The European Commission (EC) claimed that Alcan is in breach of their operating licence as the station has failed to \\"significantly reduce its emissions\\". The UK Government contested the allegations, as the power station and smelter combined then provided 650 jobs and a contribution of ¬£100,000,000 to the local economy, in an area heavily affected by the loss of traditional heavy industry. They lost the court case over it and on 22 April 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the plant was subject to the emission limit values of the European directive on Large Combustion Plants. As a consequence, the station has to have at least ¬£200 million worth of adaptations made to it so that it conforms to the directive, or be shut down. A date has not yet been given for it to conform, but two options for saving the station are the CCS project, or a switch from coal to biomass as a fuel. Lynemouth's future came further under threat in March 2011, following carbon cutting measures announced in the 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station would cost an extra ¬£40 million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal would cost an additional ¬£170 million a year. Cultural use and visual impact Lynemouth power station's tall chimney can be seen over a stretch of the Northumberland coast. Since its construction, the station has made appearances in a small number of films shot locally. These include: *Seacoal ‚Äì a film made by Amber Films in 1985. The station is features heavily as a backdrop in the beach scenes, where the characters are working, collecting seacoal. Photographer Mik Critchlow (who would later become involved with Amber Films' sister company Side Gallery) also documented the seacoalers at Lynemouth, between 1981 and 1983. He also used the power station as an industrial backdrop to some of his images. *Billy Elliot ‚Äì a 2000 film directed by Stephen Daldry. The power station and the smelter both feature as an industrial backdrop in the film's cemetery scenes. The power station's coal sorting area is used to represent a colliery. The chimneys of both the power station and the smelter are strong landmarks on the local coastline, and can be seen over a stretch of coast, from Cresswell down to South Shields pier.

Its gaining command was the Air Rescue Service of Military Air Transport Service.In January 1966, Military Air Transport Service Became Military Airlift Command and Air Rescue Service became Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. Air Rescue Service returned to its original designation in 1989. The 305th supported local peacetime rescue operations while maintaining combat deployable status. It also participated in foreign training exercises with Brazil, Honduras and Venezuela. The squadron's peacetime operations included the recovery of eleven seamen from a sinking Canadian freighter in Lake Erie and the transport of fourteen workers critically injured from a factory accident. Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter In late 1965, the unit began to replace its SA-16s with Boeing HC-97 Stratofreighters, and in January 1966 it was redesignated as the 305th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. During 1966 and 1967 the unit provided rescue cover for Operation Hi-Cat, which involved research on turbulance at high altitude by Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The squadron was called to active duty following the USS Pueblo incident in January 1968 and deployed personnel and equipment to the Far East. While on active duty, it earned both an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award and a Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/ Palm. It was returned to reserve status in June 1969. Other deployments included locations in Libya, Spain, North Africa, Greece, Germany, Italy, England, Iceland, and Southeast Asia. 305th Squadron Lockheed HC-130H Hercules In 1972 the unit upgraded to Lockheed HC-130 Hercules aircraft, which gave the squadron the capability to refuel rescue helicopters. The unit participated in the test and evaluation of the Air Force's C-130 Self-Contained Navigation System and also provided support for space shuttle missions. Four years later, the squadron added its first rotary wing aircraft when it was assigned Sikorsky HH-3 Jolly Green Giant helicopters. It continued to operate a combination of HC-130s and HC-3s until 1992. For part of this period, it also flew the CH-3 cargo model of the H-3. AF Reserve HH-3 hoisting crewmen in 1981 In 1985, Major Larry Brooks and his crew earned the Koran Kolligan, Jr. Trophy, the highest safety award in the Air Force, for successfully landing their severely disabled HH-3 helicopter after one of the engines exploded. During the 1980s, the 305th also provided rescue coverage for tactical fighter and Army units deploying from the United States to Europe. In 1991, pararescue personnel from the squadron deployed to the Persian Gulf to support the Liberation of Kuwait campaign. The squadron deployed personnel and aircraft to Naval Air Station Keflav√≠k, Iceland, during and after the Gulf War. In 1992, with the drawdown of active and reserve forces, the squadron's HC-130 Hercules aircraft were transferred to active duty units and its HH-3 Jolly Green helicopters were retired. The 305th was inactivated on 30 September 1992. =Current era: 1993‚Äìpresent= In October 1993 the squadron was again activated on paper at Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base, Arizona. On 1 March 1994, the 71st Special Operations Squadron at Davis‚ÄìMonthan was inactivated and the 305th assumed its mission, personnel and assets when the 71st returned to Davis‚ÄìMonthan from a six-month tasking for Operation Provide Comfort II. On 19 May 1994, the 305th was credited with its first save since reactivation. One of its crews completed a rescue using night vision goggles and a Stokes litter to hoist an injured Army specialist from a sixty degree mountain slope that was surrounded by forty to sixty foot trees. Ten months after beginning its conversion to HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters the squadron was tasked to support Provide Comfort II . The squadron deployed three HH-60G Pave Hawks and 95 personnel and accomplished 315 combat sorties during this deployment. It trained for combat search and rescue and performed search and rescue operations primarily in the Southwestern United States. The 305th also supported counterdrug operations to civilian agencies from 1994. In 2002, the 305th Rescue Squadron was activated for one year under a partial mobilization order to participate in Operations Enduring Freedom and Southern Watch at Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait. From April through July 2005 the squadron again deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom. During this time the squadron flew several rescue missions, including the recovery of Marcus Luttrell, the lone surviving SEAL team member engaged in Operation Red Wings in the mountains east of Bagram, Afghanistan. Upon its return to the United States in August, the unit deployed to Louisiana and Texas to assist in the rescue of thousands of people in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In 2005, Air Force Reserve Command expanded its rescue organization at Davis Monthan. The 305th was reassigned to the newly activated 943rd Rescue Group and was joined by the 306th Rescue Squadron, which provided a separate unit for pararescue personnel. From January through March 2007 the squadron again deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom. During the deployment, it rescued 14 injured US military personnel from a crashed Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter. It deployed again from March to September 2008 and flew over 340 combat sorties and assisted in saving the lives of over 480 people and two military dogs. The 305th Rescue Squadron is the first and only Air Force Reserve helicopter unit to gain the ability to operate from shipboard.

Both words, kirk and church, derive from the Koine Greek Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫œåŒΩ (Œ¥œâŒºŒ±) (kyriakon (d≈çma)) meaning Lord's (house), which was borrowed into the Germanic languages in late antiquity, possibly in the course of the Gothic missions.

To Duck or Not to Duck is a 1943 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on March 6, 1943, and stars Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. Plot summary Elmer Fudd is hunting ducks with his dog Laramore. After missing Daffy several times (\\"Confidentially, those hunters couldn't hit the broad side of a DUCK!\\" snickers Daffy to the audience) and leaving a duck-shaped hole in the clouds after each shotgun blast, Elmer manages to graze Daffy with a load of buckshot; this merely blows off his tail-feathers but causes him to fall. Laramore ensures there is a pillow waiting to cushion Daffy's landing. Daffy then gives the dog a lesson in how to retrieve a duck. When Laramore takes the duck to Elmer, Elmer apologizes for shooting him, explaining that he had to \\"pwug\\" Daffy because he is \\"a gweat spoowtsman\\". An indignant Daffy sits up and heatedly retorts that Elmer doesn't know the meaning of fair play (\\"What chance has a poor little fluffy winged creature like me against a well- equipped hunter like you?!\\") and adds that Elmer wouldn't be so tough without various accoutrements, including his big shotgun, knife and even his hunter's apparel - which Daffy actually removes from Elmer. He finishes his tirade asking what protection he has got (\\"A bullet-proof vest, I suppose!\\") and inadvertently opens his feathered chest to reveal one (\\"How did that get there?\\"). Subsequently, he challenges Elmer to a \\"fair\\" fight. Intimidatingly, Daffy maneuvers Elmer into a boxing ring which is surrounded by many duck spectators The burly referee of the fight is also a duck, named Ducky Wheeze. He struggles to stop laughing at pathetic Elmer long enough to introduce him; when he finally does, Elmer stands up and meekly says, \\"Hewwo.\\" The crowd boos overwhelmingly; only Laramore, from separate and otherwise empty bleachers, cheers; he is immediately knocked over by various objects thrown at him from the crowd. The referee gives Daffy \\"Good to His Mother\\" Duck a resounding, loving introduction. The duck spectators cheer wildly; Laramore, back in his spot in the separate and otherwise empty bleachers, boos; he is again knocked over by thrown objects. Before the match starts, the referee exhorts the two opponents to \\"fight clean\\", turning to wink at the duck spectators who, knowing what is coming, collectively shout, \\"Oh, brother!\\" The referee then calls \\"no rough stuff -- none of THIS! Or THIS! Or like SO!\\", each time demonstrating an illegal move on Elmer and knocking him silly. Daffy, in turn, picks up where the referee left off, asking, \\"You mean none of THIS? Or THIS?\\", manhandling (or duckhandling) Elmer similarly, and leaving him beaten up. At this point, Laramore suggests that there is \\"something awfully screwy about this fight, or my name isn't Laramore. And, it isn't.\\" As Elmer is slouched in his corner, Daffy beats up on him once more before the referee calls them out to shake hands. Daffy manipulates Elmer into \\"choosing\\" which of Daffy's hands to shake, and the result is Elmer being bashed on the head with a hammer. He falls to the mat as the referee rings the bell for Round 1, then rushes over to provide a ridiculously fast ten-count. He then declares Daffy Duck the winner and new champion. Elmer, perplexed, walks over and says, \\"I'm not the one to compwain, Mr. Wefewee, but I thought you said no wough stuff! None of THIS! Or THIS! Or wike SO!\\" as he demonstrates the same illegal moves which were exhibited on him earlier on both the referee and Daffy.

The building was owned and designed by Modernist architect Richard Neutra in 1950. It served as the studio and office for Neutra's architecture practice from 1950 until Neutra's death in 1970. The building has been declared a Historic Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed for sale in 2007 at an asking price of $3,500,000. Richard Neutra Architect Richard Neutra (1892-1970), a native of Vienna, Austria, moved to Los Angeles in 1925 to work with Rudolph Schindler on Frank Lloyd Wright's Barnsdall Park project. In 1929, Neutra became famous in his own right with the completion of his landmark Modernist Lovell House in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. Over the next 20 years, Neutra became one of the recognized innovators and leaders of Modernist architecture. Construction and architecture of the Neutra Office Building Neutra built the Silver Lake office building in 1950 to house his own architectural practice. Neutra designed the building with his son, Dion Neutra, acting as project architect and Red Marsh as the contractor. The one-story office building includes two reception areas, two conference rooms, and a large open office space. The building also includes two residential units with an enclosed garden at the rear of the building. The building has been carefully preserved by Neutra's son, Dion. Many original built-ins and design details remain intact, including custom strip lighting, acoustic tiles, exposed ducting, operable louvers, and blue Aklo glass. Operation as Neutra's design studio The building has been called \\"a piece of L.A. history since most of (Neutra's) L.A. buildings were probably dreamed up in this very office.\\" Jay Platt of the Los Angeles Conservancy has said of the building's significance, \\"The real importance of the office is that it provided the creative environment in which Neutra produced all of his now famous homes.\\" In fact, his early works pre-date the building, but it was in this building that Neutra designed many of his landmark buildings, including the U.S. Embassy in Karachi, Pakistan, the Los Angeles Hall of Records, the Gettysburg Cyclorama Building, the Orange County Courthouse, and the Huntington Beach Public Library. The building remained the site of the Neutra architectural practice even after Neutra's death in 1970; Dion Neutra continued the practice at the site until the 1990s. Historic designation Known mostly for his residential designs, the Neutra Office Building in Silver Lake is Neutra's only surviving commercial structure with Neutra's original design. The Neutra web site describes the building as \\"the only surviving example of Neutra commercial design that is still intact.\\" Marketing materials for the building call it \\"a pristine example of the work of one of the seminal architects of the Modernist movement\\" and \\"the only remaining example of Neutra commercial design, still with its original look.\\" The building was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #676) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 2000 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Listing of the building for sale in 2006 Building in 2008 After 56 years of being owned by the Neutra family, the building was listed for sale in November 2006 at an asking price of $3,500,000. The sale was conditioned on the buyer accepting a protective conservation easement, which Dion Neutra considered essential to prevent his father's work from disappearing. He told the National Trust for Historic Preservation: \\"I'm hoping to find a suitable steward while I'm alive that would take care of the building into the foreseeable future.\\" The marketing brochure compared the building to works of art by Gustav Klimt and Jackson Pollock and went so far as to say: \\"The purchase of this icon would be equivalent to acquiring the last remaining Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece.\\" One critic wrote of Dion's \\"delusional price comparison of his father's office building to the paintings of Klimt & Pollack.\\" As of July 2008, after 20 months on the market, the Neutra web site continued to list the building for sale.

It is an annex building of the Council of the European Union (its main building is the Europa building) and is located at Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat 145. History Work began in 2001, with construction starting in 2004 when the old building was demolished. It was finished in 2006. The building was built and is owned by the Lex 2000 company, with the Council having long term rent on the building and the option to buy. Due to the increase in office space, Lex 2000 has had to finance renovation of nearby apartments to compensate. It is built on the site of a private mansion, similar to the neighbouring R√©sidence Palace which was demolished instead of renovated in order to create a much larger modern building. Extra space for the EU institutions were needed in time for the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. At the time, the existing building, Justus Lipsius, could not be extended due to residential areas and the then existing conservation orders on the adjacent R√©sidence Palace (later partially demolished and renovated to become the Europa building), thus Lex became a new project to satisfy the need for more office space. Lex seen from the south The first plans were submitted in 1988 by the company which built Espace L√©opold, however they were deemed too ambitious by the local authorities. It was intended to be tall, serving as a gateway into the area together with the Charlemagne building opposite. The authorities demanded a reduction of 20 metres, giving it 15 floors instead of the planned 20, in order to preserve the visual dominance of the Berlaymont building and the Cinquantenaire arcades. Features There are three basement floors for technical services - though the car park was built with less than 200 spaces as it was deemed the public transport links compensated for lack of car parking spaces. The main entrance has direct links to the metro and rail stations with the ground floor being occupied by a large restaurant.

In 2008 he was third in the Olympic trials and the Visa Championships and again wound up an alternate to the 6-man team. This was due to the fact that his strongest events overlapped with those of Paul Hamm and Morgan Hamm, and the team needed gymnasts who were stronger in other disciplines. After Paul Hamm was injured, Bhavsar was selected to the team which earned a bronze medal. He attended Ohio State University and won the NCAA title with that team.

History  zoome was launched by ACCA Networks on January 30, 2007. However, zoome was overshadowed by Nico Nico Douga, which was launched at the same time, and zoome lurked in an unremarkable state until the end of the year. zoome's popularity boomed via Hatsune Miku at the end of 2007. Nico Nico Douga, the fostering site of the voice synthesis software, became involved in a scandal which caused some of its members to move to zoome. Dwango, the owner of Nico Nico Douga, had registered the copyright of a Hatsune Miku song to the copyright management group JASRAC under the name \\"Dwango\\", without permission from the song's author, sparking outrage among Vocaloid fans. Sometime before the scandal broke out, ACCA had opened a Vocaloid video hosting circle , which was officially recognized by Hatsune Miku's developer, Crypton Future Media. The scandal on Nico Nico Douga and the official recognition in zoome lured many members away from Nico Nico Douga to zoome. As a result, Hatsune Miku videos became one of the mainstays of zoome, and zoome became a leading competitor able to challenge Nico Nico Douga's monopoly of the video hosting service industry in Japan. In addition, events of 2008 greatly aided zoome in its development. Stage6 was closed and the majority of the Japanese Stage6 users migrated to zoome. Also, zoome continued to benefit from various happenings within Nico Nico Douga, particularly worthy of note is when Dwango announced the complete purge of anime MAD Movies from Nico Nico Douga in July. Many creators of MAD Movies moved to zoome because of this announcement. On June 2, 2008, the zoome site split from ACCA Networks and became its subsidiary, zoome Co., Ltd. On July 21, 2011, zoome announced that it would shut down all its services on August 31, 2011.

It was first recorded during the late Ming dynasty as a multi-trick taking game,Lo, Andrew (2003) 'Pan Zhiheng's 'Xu Yezi Pu' (Sequel to a Manual of Leaves)- Part 1.' The Playing Card: Journal of the International Playing-Card Society, 31 (5). pp. 221-229. a type of game that may be as old as T'ienkiu (\\"Heaven and Nines\\"), Colecci√≥n por fasc√≠culos - Juegos de Cartas, Ediciones Altaya, Barcelona (1997), in cooperation with Naipes Heraclio Fournier, Vitoria, Spain. revised in its rules and published in an authorized edition by Emperor Kao Tsung in 1130 AD for the information of his subjects. Meaning \\"watch the pot\\", it is very possibly the ancestor of all rummy games.Sid Sackson, Card Games Around the World, pg. 7, Dover publications (1994), Adapted to the western taste by Sir William Henry Wilkinson, British sinologist and Consul-General in China and Korea in the mid-1890s, it belongs to the same family as Mahjong and the mid-nineteenth century Mexican card game Conquian, whose name probably derives from the Chinese card game Kon Khin. Another related game is Kuwaho or Cuajo from the Philippines. Variants of the Qing version of the game are still played in China and Vietnam such as T·ªï t√¥m.  History  During the Ming dynasty, the game was called ÁúãËôé (Pinyin:\\"Kanh«î\\") meaning \\"Watching the Tiger\\" or \\"D«íuh«î\\" (ÊñóËôé), \\"Competing with the Tiger\\". It was a multi-trick game where players try to take tricks with one or three cards with the latter composed of different types of melds. By the late Qing dynasty, the rules as recorded by Wilkinson and Stewart Culin had changed considerably.Berry, John (2003) 'Chinese Money- Suited Cards.' The Playing Card: Journal of the International Playing-Card Society, 31 (5). pp. 230-235. The game was now called \\"Kanh√∫\\", \\"Watching the Lake\\" (ÁúãÊπñ) or \\"Watching the Pot\\" (ÁúãÂ£∫). It was no longer a trick-taking game but a draw-and-discard game. However, there were vestigial remnants in the composition of the melds. The changes may have occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries when trick-taking fell in favour of shedding type games like M√≤h√∫ (ÈªòÂíå) and P√®ngh√∫ (Á¢∞Âíå) which are regarded as the ancestors to Mahjong.Lo, Andrew (2004) 'China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong.' In: Mackenzie, C. and Finkel, I., (eds.), Asian Games: The Art of Contest. New York: Asia Society, pp. 216-231. The various homonyms of hu, whether they mean harmony, pots, or points is equivalent to \\"meld\\". Ming version Money- suited 30-card deck. The original Ming game was a multi-trick-taking game for two or three players. The following rules were written by Pan Zhiheng in 1613. It uses a Madiao deck but strips it of the suit of Tens with the exception of the Thousand Myriad card. The remaining thirty cards are arranged from lowest to highest: *Cash (11 cards): 9 Cash to 1 Cash, Half Cash, Zero Cash (this suit is in reverse order like in Madiao) *Strings of Cash (9 cards): 1 to 9 Strings *Myriads of Strings (10 cards): 1 to 9 Myriad, Thousand Myriad Like all Chinese card games, play is counter-clockwise. The eldest is chosen by drawing the highest card. If there are two players, each will get 13 cards with four going to the stock, which isn't used. With three players, each gets nine cards with three going to the stock. The eldest can lead with singles or three card melds, others follow with the exact number of cards. Each captured card is worth 1 point but there are bonus points for method of capture. If singles are thrown, it can be beaten by a card from a higher suit; an exception is the Thousand Myriad which can only beat other Myriads. Winning with the 5 Myriad awards 2 bonus points while winning with the 8 Myriad gives 3 bonus points. Three types of melds can be led: *Gibbons: Three-card sequences from the same suit that can be beaten by Gibbons from a higher suit or a higher Gibbon from the same suit. Having a Gibbon in a higher suit is more important than its rank. Remember that Cash Gibbons are in reverse order. The Half Leopard (sequence of 1, Half, Zero Cash) beats all String and Cash Gibbons. Winning with the Half Leopard or with the Thousand Myriad Gibbon (8, 9, Thousand Myriad) awards 1 bonus point. *Leopards: Three of a kinds that can only be beaten by higher Leopard or the Hero. A meld of three 1s is called Leopard 1 and goes up to Leopard 9. *Special: If a special combo is led, it can only be beaten by higher specials. Winning with any special awards bonuses. From lowest to highest: **Pangolin (3 points): 7 Cash, 3 Strings, 3 Myriad (Pan witnessed its invention sometime between 1609-1613) **Poverty (4 points): 8 Cash, 2 Strings, 2 Myriad **Tiger (5 points): 9 Cash, 1 String, 1 Myriad **Chariot (6 points): Zero Cash, 9 Strings, Thousand Myriad **Leopard 9 (7 points): 9 Cash, 9 Strings, 9 Myriad **Wealth (8 points): Zero Cash, 9 Strings, 9 Myriad **Hero (9 points): 1 String, 1 Myriad, Thousand Myriad Qing version=Suits= This game is played by two or more persons with one complete pack of one hundred and twenty cards. There are four copies of each card. The three suits in the deck are: *Cash: From 1 to 9 Cash.Stuart Culin, The Game of Ma-Jong, vol. XI, pgs. 153-168, Brooklyn Museum Quarterly (1924). This is in progressive order. *Strings of Cash: From 1 to 9 Strings *Myriads of Strings: From 1 to 9 Myriad The three extra cards that act as wild cards: *Red Flower: Originally the Zero Cash *White Flower: Half Cash *Old Thousand: Thousand Myriad =Melds= In the Qing version of the game the following triplets are called ng√°n (eyes) which are descended from Ming special combos: *1, 2, and 3 Cash *Red Flower, 9 Strings, Old Thousand (Compare with the Chariot) *White Flower, 8 Strings, 9 Myriad (2nd highest cards of each suit under the Ming ranking) *9 Cash, 1 String, 1 Myriad (Tiger) *8 Cash, 2 Strings, 2 Myriad (Poverty) *8 Cash, 3 Strings, 2 Myriad (According to Culin)/ Red Flower, 9 Strings, 9 Myriad (Tcheng Ki-tong and Wilkinson, compare with Wealth) *7 Cash, 3 Strings, 3 Myriad (Pangolin) A winning hand must contain at least one of the above combinations called \\"eyes\\" and the remaining cards must be arranged in one or more combinations called p√°t tsz (boys), a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, or three cards of the same rank. All aces (1s), the red flower, white flower, and old thousand, may be added to these \\"eyes\\", to the sequences or triplets to form a winning hand. The dealer is chosen by drawing a card from the pack and counting the players up to the number of the card drawn. The dealer deals the first card to himself and fourteen others to each of the players, so that in the end he has fifteen. As this is the number needed for a winning hand, and the dealer alone has this number, he is the only player with the chance to win on the cards dealt to him. Either he wins or discards one card to the player on his left who now has the chance to take that card or buy one from the stock to see if he wins or discards. The third player then has his turn of play and so on. The first to show a winning hand composed of \\"eyes\\", sequences and combinations, wins the game, usually played for money bet in a pot. English version The King holding the 9 ‚ô• In 1891 Sir William induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the \\"extra cards\\" and two Jokers. As the years passed, his passion for the game became so great that in his last books he was designated as William \\"Khanhoo\\" Wilkinson. =Deck of cards= The money-suited packs can be adapted from two English 52-card decks, removing all cards ‚ô†, except for the J's ‚ô†, Q's ‚ô† and K's ‚ô†, and the 10s, J's, Q's, K's ‚ô¶, ‚ô£, ‚ô•. Add one Joker and a Khanhoo 61-card deck will have been formed. =Game play= Distribute fifteen cards one by one or in batches of two or three to each player and stock the remaining cards face down to the table to form a stock pile. In turn, the first player draws, melds if possible and discards one face up to the table to form a waste pile. Then the next player draws, melds if possible and discards one to the table. If a thrown card suits any of the players, it must be melded immediately so that all the other players can see why that player needed that card. But if a player draws a card from the stock pile, it needs not to be shown until he is able to lay all his cards at once. The aim of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, such as 50 or 100 points, wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or more rounds of games. =Meldings= The Queen holding the 8 ‚ô£ { border=\\"1\\" + SCORES -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three A's, being two of the same suit  align=\\"center\\"  Aces  align=\\"center\\"  1 point -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three cards or more of the same suit melded in sequence  align=\\"center\\"  Sequence  align=\\"center\\"  1 point -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three cards of the same rank, each one from a different suit  align=\\"center\\"  Triplet  align=\\"center\\"  2 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Six cards of the same rank align=\\"center\\"  Double Triplet  align=\\"center\\"  10 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  J ‚ô†, Q ‚ô†, K ‚ô†  align=\\"center\\"  Courts  align=\\"center\\"  3 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  J's ‚ô†, Q's ‚ô†, K's ‚ô†  align=\\"center\\"  Double Courts  align=\\"center\\"  10 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  J ‚ô† + 7's ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  J's Royal Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Q ‚ô† + 8's ‚ô£  align=\\"center\\"  Q's Royal Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  K ‚ô† + 9's ‚ô•  align=\\"center\\"  K's Royal Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  A ‚ô• \\\\+ 2 ‚ô£ + 3 ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  Khanhoo  align=\\"center\\"  5 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  A's ‚ô• \\\\+ 2's ‚ô£ + 3's ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  Double Khanhoo  align=\\"center\\"  15 points } =Scores= In a game of less than 5 players, the best possible hand would score 29 points (besides 5 for full hand): Double Khanhoo (15 points), any Double Triplet (10 points) and any one of the Royal Groups (4 points) equals 29 points. The smallest possible score would be 2: Two sequences of 9 and 6 cards or two of 8 and 7 cards respectively. Though sequences score so little they are of great use in filling a hand. Not only does a long sequence take up a large proportion of the 15 cards, but a sequence of more than 3 cards is exceedingly useful, as either a card can be thrown away in order to declare full hand, or used in a triplet, without spoiling the sequence. =Settling= At the close of a game players may pay or receive the difference between their scores, as at Skat. Thus if A wins with 52 when B stands at 49, and C and D at 47 each, A receives 3 from B and 5 each from C and D, or 13 in all - B 2 each from C and D, 4 in all, less his 3 paid to A, or a net sum of 1. C and D pay in all 7 each, 5 to A and 2 to B, receiving nothing, as they tie for last place. Points may be anything, from counters to bank notes. =Penalties= The penalty for a misdeal is to be deducted from the dealer's score or added to that of each of his opponents, at the option of the latter. Dealing out of turn is not considered a misdeal, nor is the exposure of a card while dealing. In the former case the rightful dealer may claim the deal at any time before the first card is dealt; in the latter, the player whose card is exposed may call for a new deal. In a three- to-four-hand game, a player calling \\"bump\\" may be challenged by any of his opponents to show his cards, and if the cards shown would not make a trick with the card thrown, 5 points are taken from his score or added to the score of each of his opponents, and the elder hand which effected the bump may take the trick into his hand as though he had not gained it by bumping. The cards shown by the offender are not, however, considered exposed and may be used to form tricks. =Strategy= Khanhoo is not only a game of chance, depending on the distribution of the cards or the sequence in which the cards are being drawn. It is also a game of skill and expertise, specially in a two-handed game. Evaluation *Consider if you have too many pip cards to go for a quick knock or if you have top ones like the 7 ‚ô¶, 8 ‚ô£, 9 ‚ô•, A ‚ô•, 2 ‚ô£, 3 ‚ô¶, enough Courts or even a Joker to take the game further. Memorization *Remember the cards that have already been played, so that you know which combinations can not be formed anymore. Analysis *Take into account that during the play many top cards may be drawn from the stock pile or thrown by the other players, changing the course of your strategy. This will force you to decide which cards should be thrown and the implication of your decision. *Note that whomever knocks is granted 5 points and that may be crucial for the advantage in the game. *With three, four or more players, cards that might safely be thrown in the two-hand game are often dangerous because an opponent can now bump. In such games it is most advisable to hold the two 7's ‚ô¶, the two 8's ‚ô£ or the two 9's ‚ô•, since the chances are that someone will throw the J, Q or K (as the case may be), enabling you to bump. *The Joker is the most valuable card in the pack, since it may take the place of any card required, even of one all specimens of which have been played. *The deal is not necessarily an advantage to the dealer; hence the penalty for a misdeal is a fine and not the passing of the deal. =Variation= A variation of the game can be played by using three decks comprising 90 cards, plus two Jokers to form a new sequence of meldings. The Jack holding the 7 ‚ô¶ { border=\\"1\\" + SCORES -----  align=\\"center\\"  Nine A's, three of each suit  align=\\"center\\"  Triple Aces  align=\\"center\\"  6 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Nine cards of the same suit  align=\\"center\\"  Triple Sequence  align=\\"center\\"  3 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Nine cards of the same rank, three from each suit  align=\\"center\\"  Triple Triplet  align=\\"center\\"  9 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three J's ‚ô†, Q's ‚ô†, K's ‚ô†  align=\\"center\\"  Triple Courts  align=\\"center\\"  12 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Two J's ‚ô† + 7 ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  J's Reverse Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Two Q's ‚ô† + 8 ‚ô£  align=\\"center\\"  Q's Reverse Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Two K's ‚ô† + 9 ‚ô•  align=\\"center\\"  K's Reverse Group  align=\\"center\\"  4 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three J's ‚ô† + three 7's ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  J's Triple Sequence  align=\\"center\\"  8 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three Q's ‚ô† + three 8's ‚ô£  align=\\"center\\"  Q's Triple Sequence  align=\\"center\\"  8 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three K's ‚ô† + three 9's ‚ô•  align=\\"center\\"  K's Triple Sequence  align=\\"center\\"  8 points -----  align=\\"center\\"  Three A's ‚ô• \\\\+ three 2's ‚ô£ + three 3's ‚ô¶  align=\\"center\\"  Triple Khanhoo  align=\\"center\\"  25 points } =Features= ;Deck There are only three suits in the deck: Nine cards from Ace through Nine, six Courts and one Joker (One Joker in a 2-hand game or two in a 3-hand game), which can replace any card. ;Special cards Only the A ‚ô•, 2 ‚ô£ and the 3 ‚ô¶ may be used to form a Khanhoo, and only the 7 ‚ô¶, 8 ‚ô£ and the 9 ‚ô•, with their respective Courts, may be used to form a Royal Group. ;Deal Players cut for the deal, the lowest card winning. Each player receives fifteen cards dealt one at a time or in batches of two or three. The player sitting left of the dealer receives one extra card and has the privilege of leading first. Where the number of players is 4 or 8, the player who cuts the highest card may, before the cards are dealt, elect to go \\"orphan\\". In this case he receives six cards dealt one at a time. Should he happen to be the original leader, he will receive an extra card making seven in all. ;Direction of play The game of Khanhoo moves clockwise. ;Stock All discarded cards are placed face upwards on the table in order of rejection, so that the previous- last card is covered by the last one played. When the stock is exhausted before a full hand is declared, the heap of rejected cards is turned over, so as to face downwards on the table, forming a new stock then. ;Bump In a game for three players the possession of a thrown-out card may be claimed by the third player seated to the right of the player who discarded that card, once he can meld it immediately, after which the game proceeds in the order of play. If four or more players take part in the game, two or more players may request the throw-out card once their meld, except for a \\"sequence\\", scores higher than any other, having preference to the card the player in the order of play sitting left to the player who discarded that card. This action is called \\"bump\\" because one of the players is bumped by another. ;Four-to-five- hand game The four-hand game can also be played with one complete pack of 120 cards, plus one Joker. If five or more play, up to five Jokers may be added, each additional one increasing the element of chance in the game. The game proceeds exactly as in the case of three players. ;Orphan Khanhoo When four or more players take part in the game, the highest card may elect to go \\"orphan\\". There will be then a stock of nine cards left. The game proceeds exactly as with three players, except that there are now two or more players who can bump, instead of one. But for the first and second players, either the third, fourth or the other players in the order of play may claim this privilege, the fourth player being subjected to the third and the third to the challenge of the second. The superior trick, declared in number of points, gets the bump in whomsoever hand it may be, although with equal combinations the elder hand has the first right to bump in the order of play. ;Trio, Quartette and Cache The following additions to the number of possible tricks may add an interesting feature to the game: *Trio: Three cards of the same suit and rank equals 6 points. *Quartette: Four cards of the same suit and rank equals 12 points. *Cache: When any of the players has a natural \\"trio\\" obtained without bumping, that player may place them face downwards on the table and declare them to be a \\"cache\\". Upon the fourth card being thrown by any of the other three players, he is then entitled to bump it and claim \\"Quartette by Cache\\", scoring in addition to the 12 points for quartette, 5 more for full hand. The play ceases, counting begins and a new deal takes places, just as though he had knocked. A natural \\"quartette\\" also has this privilege, without the need for Cache.

The documentary is critical of excessive consumerism and promotes sustainability. Filmmaker Annie Leonard wrote and narrated the film, which was funded by Tides Foundation, Funders Workgroup for Sustainable Production and Consumption, Free Range Studios and other foundations. Free Range Studios also produced the documentary, which was first launched online on December, 2007. The documentary is used in elementary schools, arts programs, and economics classes as well as places of worship and corporate sustainability trainings. By February 2009, it had been seen in 228 countries and territories. According to the Los Angeles Times , the film had been translated into 15 languages and had been viewed by over 12 million people. Contents The 22-minute video presents a critical vision of consumerist society, primarily American, under the conditions of globalization. It purports to expose \\"the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create an increasingly sustainable and just world.\\" The video is made up of seven chapters: Introduction, Extraction, Production, Distribution, Consumption, Disposal, and Another Way. The video is against dividing the materials economy into a linear system composed of extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. Instead, it adds people, the government, and the corporations, viewing all of them as they operate and influence each other simultaneously changing human life profoundly as a result. In other words, in contradistinction to the linear understanding, the video shows the economy as a cardinal dimension of human existence itself. Leonard's thesis \\"you cannot run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely\\" is supported throughout the video by statistical data. Although the video itself doesn't give attribution to her information, the producers provide an annotated script that includes footnotes with explanations and sources for some of her assertions: *\\"... more than 50% of our federal tax money is now going to the military...\\" She cites the War Resisters League website, which differs from government reports that put the figure at around 20-25%;Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget, irs.gov WRL explains the difference in that it doesn't count trust funds like Social Security (since this revenue is not obtained directly from income taxes), considers veterans benefits as part of \\"past military\\" spending, and includes 80% of the debt interest payments under the rationale that most debt would have been avoidable with reduced military spending.Where Your Income Tax money really Goes, warresisters.org *\\"Of the 100 largest economies on Earth now, 51 are corporations.\\" She cites ,itself a revised edition of which bases this claim on the 1999 figures of GDP and corporate sales as reported by FortuneFortune Magazine, July 31, 2000. and the World Development Report 2000. *\\"We [The U.S.] have 5% of the world's population but we're consuming 30% of the world's resources and creating 30% of the world's waste.\\" She cites , who says, \\"...in 1990 the United States, with about 5 percent of the world's population, was using about one-quarter of the energy being used by all nations.\\" and a chapter in Global Environmental Issues that puts the US production of waste at around 10 billion tons per year before the turn of the millennium. *\\"80% of the planet's original forests are gone.\\" She cites the Natural Resources Defense Council website, which says that only about 20% of the world's original wilderness forests remain.The Canadian Boreal Forest, National resources Defense Council and the website for the Rainforest Action Network.ran.org Rainforest Action Network *\\"Forty percent of waterways in the US have become undrinkable.\\" She cites a source which she quotes in a footnote as actually having said, \\"Today, 40 percent of our nation‚Äôs rivers are unfishable, unswimmable, or undrinkable\\". *\\"In the Amazon alone, we‚Äôre losing 2000 trees a minute.\\" She cites , which puts the Amazon deforestation rate in 1995 at a year. *\\"Each of us in the U.S. is targeted with more than 3,000 advertisements a day.\\" This particular figure comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics which itself cites a 1999 Albuquerque Journal article by columnist Ellen Goodmancited as on a figure of 3,000 ads viewed by young Americans on television, the internet, billboards, and magazines.See here for a list of concerns with this particular statement Despite the specific wording of this article (\\"The average young person views more than 3000 ads per day...\\"), Annie Leonard specifies that she is referring to ads targeted, not necessarily viewed. *\\"Each of us in the United States makes 4 pounds (2.04 kg) of garbage a day.\\" She cites the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website, which states that 245.7 million tons of municipal solid waste was produced in 2005.Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2005 Facts and Figures reiterates this figure. *\\"Dioxin is the most toxic man made substance known to science. And incinerators are the number one source of dioxin.\\" She cites Mocarelli et al. Leonard also quotes what Victor Lebow said in 1955 regarding economic growth: :\\"Our enormously productive economy... demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption... we need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate.\\" Reaction The Story of Stuff has been subject to public discussion, especially after The New York Times published a front- page article about the video on May 10, 2009.Leslie Kaufman, A Cautionary Video About America‚Äôs ‚ÄòStuff‚Äô, The New York Times, May 10, 2009 Even before The New York Times article, The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook pointed to The Story of Stuff as a successful portrayal of the problems with the consumption cycle, and says it is an engaging attempt to communicate circular economics. Ralph Nader called the film \\"a model of clarity and motivation.\\" John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace, called it a \\"mega-hit on three levels\\". It also attracted the attention of conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, who characterized the video as an \\"anti-capitalist tale that unfortunately has virtually no facts correct.\\"Debunking Story of Stuff, Glennbeck.com, September 22, 2009 Influenced by such commentary, the Montana school board opposed the screening of the film in a biology classroom in a 4‚Äì3 vote.Viral Video 'The Story of Stuff' Is Full of Misleading Numbers, Fox News, May 14, 2009Jesse Froehling, The Politics of Stuff, Missoula Independent, February 19, 2009Missoula School Board Bans Story of Stuff, Yes!

She received her medical degree in Chicago, Illinois, and her Masters in Los Angeles, California. After marrying Eugene Ziskind, they opened their own practice. Somerfeld-Ziskind was later chair of the psychiatry department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Early life and education Esther Somerfeld was born in 1901 in Chicago. She was the daughter of Russian and Romanian immigrants, Matilda and Emanuel Somerfeld, Esther worked her way through school during the 1920s as a secretary and as an editor for the Journal of the American Medical Association. While she planned to become a social worker, Somerfeld-Ziskind changed her mind to pursue pre-med at the University of Chicago. She received her medical degree at Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1925. That year, Somerfeld-Ziskind interned at Los Angeles County General Hospital and later completed a pediatric residency at Los Angeles Children's Hospital. She married Eugene Ziskind in 1928, whom she had met during her undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. She left pediatrics and joined him on the path of specializing in neurology and psychiatry. In 1934, Somerfeld-Ziskind went on to earn her Masters of Arts in Psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles. Career and research She and her husband, Eugene Ziskind, started their own small psychiatric practice on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles during the Depression. They only charged patients at half price, and often received payment in the form of gifts. They had some expertise in treating disorders with convulsions. In 1938 they were using Metrazol to create convulsions in a patient with Parkinson's diseases which gave favourable results. This was remarkable as there were few ways of mitigating this disease, however Metrazol therapy was generally abandoned in 1941.Metrazol Therapy, FairStateHospital.com, Retrieved 18 November 2015 In 1953, she and her husband were cofounders along with Eugene's two brothers, social worker Louis Ziskind and attorney David Ziskind, of Gateways Hospital and Mental Health Center.Aushenker, Michael.

Later in life, Somerfeld-Ziskind worked extensively as a faculty member of the medical school at the University of Southern California, teaching child psychiatry, group therapy, and psychopathology. Throughout her career, Somerfeld-Ziskind and her husband worked together to research the use of insulin, lithium, and electroconvulsive therapy to treat psychiatric disorders.

She and her husband began lecture-discussion groups at the old Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, which were the first group therapy sessions in the city. In 1987, they received an Honorary Award for distinguished service by the Southern California Psychiatric Society in 1987. Personal life An accomplished classical pianist, Somerfeld-Ziskind owned two baby grands. She often hosted performances of eight-handed compositions that she played with friends. She was also an avid reader, and belonged to two book discussion clubs. Until the last year of her life, she wrote book reviews for the journal of the American Psychiatric Association, analyzing texts of 1,000 pages or more. While her husband of 65 years died in 1993, Somerfeld-Ziskind lived to be 101 years old.

The main access to this grove is by road or hiking across country. The grove is estimated at about with sequoias sprawling across the divide forming the Middle and South Forks of the Tule River. History In 1928, the wildfire burned more than , which left a large clearing in the forest. In 1987, a lawsuit was filed against the Solo Timber Sale by the Sierra Club to stop logging the groves. The judgement made for that lawsuit was that the groves would be restored to their natural state. The 1990 Mediated Settlement Agreement (MSA) to the Sustainable land management plan extended the grove boundaries and prohibited timber harvesting within the groves. In 1992, President Bush visited the large sequoias and boosted the terms by completely protecting them from harvesting, mining, and development. In 2008, another wildfire burned about 12% of the grove. In 2017, the Pier Fire burned through a large section of the grove. The fire killed 53 giant sequoias greater than in diameter, of which 31 were at least in diameter. The high mortality rate was caused by a combination of poor management of local fuel loads and climate change. Wildlife Before there were laws to protect the trees in the grove, more than 500 acres of non- sequoia trees were destroyed, and more than 70% of the groves were logged. The forest still has many different kinds of species of trees standing including ponderosa pine trees, willow trees, dogwood trees, white fir trees, black oak trees, incense cedar trees, and the rarest of them all, the largest sugar pine tree located at the north side of the forest. The smaller plants underfoot are fern, grasses, and forbs. Wildfires Black Mountain Grove gets fire threats from around the area; for example, from Long Canyon or South and Middle Fork. There was a lot of dead wood around Black Mountain Grove, the dead wood, or just the high fuel in general, has not been removed since 2003; which means, it would burn a good portion of the sequoias if it were to catch on fire. This high fuel load caused the MSA to demand a ‚Äúfuel load reduction plan,‚Äù which included plans for logging. Unfortunately this dense fuel load would go on to fuel two devastating wildfires in 2008 and 2017. Climate change has also been a contributing factor to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires.

It has served as a major ferry terminal, the western terminus of the Queen Anne's Railroad, and the nominal western terminus of Maryland Route 18 (which is aligned in a north/south direction near Love Point). Two notable landmarks once stood at the Love Point area; the Love Point Light and Hotel Love Point, both of which are destroyed. Today, Love Point is primarily a residential area. Etymology Love Point's name dates back to at least 1694 and is often explained in local legends. Most of these legends are variations of the same basic story where two lovers die either at Love Point or in the nearby waters. Depending on the specific variation, the lovers are either Native American, European settlers, or one of each. In many versions of the story the couple's love is forbidden, and this is what leads to their death. Another element present in some versions is that their bodies are found washed ashore in an embracing position. An unrelated explanation states that sailors going up the Chester River had to luff their sails as they rounded Love Point due to a strong northwesterly wind. According to this explanation, the point came to be known as \\"Luff Point\\" and over the years the name changed to \\"Love Point\\".

In 1592 Robertson records that Barbara Lawson, daughter of John Lawson owned the lands of Bonshaw and that by the 1690s they were in the hands of the Dundonald family, the Cochranes, the mansion house now being in utter ruins. A Charter of sasine under the Great Seal of Queen Anne was issued to the successors of the deceased Alexander Cochrane of Bollingshaw on 20 March 1706.Bonshaw Papers. Scottish National Archives. The mansion house has been long demolished and all that remains are the entrance gateposts, an ice house and possibly the Moot hill and justice hill.

Reid dug into this Druidical Mound or Moot Hill several times and found nothing to help explain its age or purpose. Most maps do not show the ice house which lies to the east of the driveway and some confusion in the descriptions may have arisen from misidentification of the ice house, limekiln and the Hutt Knowe. In the grounds of the present farm are curved ditches which are shown to have held water, either as ornamental ponds or for some practical purpose now unknown. The site had an apple orchard within the last 50 years or so, for John Hastings remembers raiding it.Hastings, John (2006), the Younger. Oral Communications to Roger S.Ll. Griffith. Stair Given that Bonshaw was the 'seat' of the Bollingshaw Barony it is likely that in addition to any other uses the two mounds of Hutt Knowe and Knockenlaw were respectively the Moot hill and justice or Gallows hill of the barony, where the laird would exercise his right of 'pit and gallows' until 1747 when the right was abolished as one of many measures linked to the 1745 Jacobite rising.

Prior to joining the New Haven, McHenry had been chief engineer and a receiver of the Northern Pacific Railway and later the chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Biography He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on January 25, 1859. He attended the Pennsylvania Military College at Chester, Pennsylvania. He first started working on the railroad in 1883 as a rodman doing surveying on the Black Hills branch of the Northern Pacific Railroad. He progressed from rodman to chainman, draftsman, leveler, transitman, assistant engineer, division engineer, principal assistant engineer, and from November 1, 1893 to January 1, 1896, he was the chief engineer. Starting on October 1, 1904 he was the first vice-president of the Consolidated Railway. He was also in charge of construction, operation and maintenance of the trolley lines owned by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He was the fourth vice-president, New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, in charge of the electrical department. While working for the Northern Pacific, McHenry performed two notable engineering feats, and made one memorable marketing suggestion: * In the 1880s McHenry was the principal assistant engineer on Stampede Pass during the construction of Stampede Tunnel, linking western Washington and especially the Puget Sound ports of Seattle and Tacoma to the East by rail. * In the early 1890s McHenry was tasked with locating a line from the vicinity of Logan westward to Butte, Montana. During the course of this work McHenry discovered Homestake Pass, the pass which Interstate 90 now crosses the Continental Divide in Montana. * In 1893, McHenry was in Chicago visiting the Columbian Exposition. While there, he visited the Korean display and noticed the prominent ying-yang symbol (or Monad) in the Korean flag. He suggested the suitability of this symbol to the Northern Pacific General Passenger Agent Charles S. Fee and circa 1896 the symbol was adopted as the logotype of the newly reorganized Northern Pacific Railway. McHenry died on August 21, 1931 in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Legacy McHenry, North Dakota was named by the Northern Pacific for him. Frances, Washington was named by McHenry for his wife, whose middle name was Frances.

() is a Greek company organizing and conducting games of chance. It is headquartered in Athens and for many years OPAP was a state-owned gambling monopoly. The company holds the exclusive rights to organize and manage numerical lotteries and sports betting games in Greece. In 2013 the privatization of the company was completed through the sale of the State's remaining 33% stake to the Emma Delta investment scheme. History In the 1950s, an effort to upgrade Greek sport and improve its infrastructure began. In this framework, the General Secretariat for Sports (Greek: Œì.Œì.Œë) was established in 1957. In order to secure funding, the idea to utilize revenue from football prognostics - following the example of other European countries - came to fruition. With this aim, OPAP was established in 1958 as a private legal entity under the umbrella of the General Secretariat for Sport. At the same time of its establishment, a Royal Decree institutionalized the first game OPAP introduced named PRO-PO (the Greek Acronym for Football Prognostics) which was organised along the lines of Italy's Toto Calcio. PRO-PO was launched in March 1959, a few months before the introduction of the Football League First Division and part of its revenues contributed to funding the newly created division. Initially there were no exclusive agencies and games players at partner corner-shops/kiosks, dairies, e.t.c while geographically the game was limited to Athens, Thessaloniki and Piraeus. From March, the establishment of agencies gradually began in large regional cities. = The early years = PRO-PO enjoyed success from the start. This was due, in part, to strong advertising campaigns. In the 1960s the game saw various improvements such as the paying out winnings for slips with 11 correct predictions. OPAP was present in 70 cities and in 1966 it had reached 795 agencies. During this period, it moved its headquarters to Panepistimiou Street, opposite the National Library. In March 1965, OPAP launched its second game, named \\"6 from 36\\", an adaptation of a similar German game, the establishment of which was provided in the same royal decree as PRO-PO. There were 36 games on each slip and players had to predict 6 that would result in a draw with the most goals scored. The game was initially met with approval but its slips dropped quickly resulting in the game being stopped in April 1966. This resulted in PRO-PO being the only game for decades to come. = Dictatorship era = During the military junta period, OPAP experienced impressive growth, helped by the promotion of sport by the dictatorial regime. Agencies shot up to 2,000 from 900 and in 1974 revenues amounted to 1.3 billion drachma, up from 176 million drachma in 1966. The increase in agency profit margins, from 5% to 10%, contributed to this expansion as did the introduction of group systems and the valuable gifts that were drawn (cars, trips etc.) since 1965. = Political changeover = After the end of the dictatorship, the impressive growth of OPAP continued. In 1981 agencies amounted to 2,952 and revenue stood at 7.3 billion drachma. At the same time, the management of its sponsorship became more transparent and was subject to parliamentary scrutiny. OPAP funds contributed to the creation of hundreds of stadiums, closed gymnasiums and other sporting cites throughout the country, while its sponsorship were no longer limited to sport but extended to culture too. At the end of the decade, agencies had reached 4,000 in number and two more games were introduced, LOTTO and PROTO, the conduct of which led to the significant upgrading of the Organization's computerization. = Listing in the stock exchange = The organization's growth continued at high rates in the next decade. It was characterized by the launch and operation of many new games, starting with LOTTO in 1990 and PROTO in 1992; and followed by PROPOGOAL in 1996 and TZOKER in 1997. Besides, 2000 was an important year in OPAP's history as Pame Stoixima, the first legal sports betting game, was launched in Greece. This game would quickly turn into OPAP's most profitable product. In 1999, OPAP turned into a Societe Anonyme, under the name OPAP S.A. and the duration of this legal entity form was set at 100 years. In 2001 OPAP got listed in the Athens Stock Exchange through a law, according to which, the State could dispense up to 49% of the company's share capital to investors. Initially 5% of the total stock was dispense and the State proceeded with more stock pack sakes in 2002, 2003 and 2005, with its stake being reduced at 33,6%. In 2003, following a bilateral agreement between the Greek State and the Republic of Cyprus, OPAP S.A. established OPAP Cyprus Ltd, which is primary responsible for the organization, conduct and marketing of the company's games in Cyprus. = Change in ownership = On 11 October 2013, the State sold its remaining stake in the organization (33% of the share capital) to a private equity fund Emma Delta which paid 622 million EUR to the former major shareholder, Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), for the acquisition of this stake.  Hellenic Lotteries  In July 2013, the HRADF and Hellenic Lotteries S.A. signed a concession agreement for the exclusive right to operate the Hellenic Republic's State Lotteries for a period of 12 years. Hellenic Lotteries S.A. is a consortium of OPAP Investment Limited (67%), Intralot Lotteries Limited (16.5%) and Scientific Games (16.5%). The total value of the financial consideration for the Hellenic Republic included the upfront fee of 190 million euros in cash and a guaranteed minimum income of 580 million euros (over a 12-year period).  Horse Races S.A.  In November 2015, OPAP subsidiary, Horse Races S.A. acquired the 20-year horse-race betting licence from HRADF, at the price of 40 million euros. Betting on horse racing in Greece had been run by state-owned group ODIE. The first Greek races organised by OPAP subsidiary Horse Races S.A. were held in the town of Markopoulo Attica, on Friday 22 January 2016.

Controversy=Involvement in Stanleybet shutdown= In November 2008, the government of Greece shut down the Greek operations of Liverpool-based Stanleybet International, a European gambling company. Stanleybet had recently opened two offices in Greece and was to be a major competitor to OPAP. The government acted on OPAP's public complaints and raided Stanleybet offices on 7 November 2008, confiscating their assets. One of the complaints expressed by protests during the 2008 Greek riots was the government's fast action in acting on behalf of OPAP to remove competition, whereas for issues affecting public safety or the rights of the people the government has been popularly thought to be slow-acting.

The definition of conservative talk is generally broad enough that libertarian talk show hosts are also included in the definition. The format has become the dominant form of talk radio in the United States since the 1987 abolition of the Fairness Doctrine. History=Early years= Notable early conservatives in talk radio ranged from commentators such as Paul Harvey and Fulton Lewis (later succeeded by Lewis's son, Fulton Lewis III) to long-form shows hosted by Clarence Manion, Bob Grant, Alan Burke, Barry Farber and Joe Pyne. Because of the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policy requiring controversial viewpoints to be balanced by opposing opinions on air, conservative talk did not have the dominance it gained in later years, and liberal hosts were as common on radio as conservative ones. Furthermore, the threat of the Fairness Doctrine discouraged many radio stations from hiring controversial hosts. By the 1980s, AM radio was in severe decline. Top 40 radio had already migrated to the higher fidelity of FM, and the few remaining AM formats, particularly country music, were headed in the same direction or, in the case of formats such as MOR, falling out of favor entirely. Talk radio, not needing the high fidelity required for music, became an attractive format for AM radio station operators. However, in order to capitalize on this, operators needed compelling content. = Deregulation of talk radio = Rush Limbaugh (seen in the studios for The Rush Limbaugh Show) emerged as one of conservative talk's earliest and most influential hosts. Conservative talk radio did not experience its significant growth until 1987, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to abolish the Fairness Doctrine. The Fairness Doctrine had previously required radio stations to present contrasting views. Subsequent to the FCCs decision to stop using the rule, radio stations could then choose to be either solely conservative or entirely liberal. Another form of deregulation from the American government came from the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed companies to own more radio stations and for some shows to become nationally syndicated. Before the deregulation, radio stations were predominantly owned by local community leaders. In 1999, following the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, more than 25% of US Radio stations had been sold, with many more being sold each day. As of 2011, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), an industry giant owns over 800 radio stations across the United States, and its largest contract is with Rush Limbaugh, worth $400 million over a span of 8 years. Clear Channel Communications rose to become a major figure in talk radio in the United States; although it only owned one major \\"flagship\\" caliber radio station (KFI Los Angeles), Clear Channel owned a large number of key AM stations in other large markets, allowing it to establish a national presence. Thus, the deregulation from the abolishment of the Fairness Doctrine and the institution of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have assisted conservative talk radio as a whole gain popularity throughout the United States. =The rise of conservative talk radio= Paul Harvey receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 Michael Medved, originally a film critic, joined the early wave of conservative talk hosts in the 1990s. Within the next decade, conservative talk radio became the dominant form of commercial talk radio in the United States; those stations that had homogenized to an all-conservative format soon came to garner more listeners than those that followed the older full-service model (at the time, progressive talk radio did not have enough hosts for a station to field an all-liberal lineup). By 1991, Limbaugh had become the number one most syndicated radio host and AM radio had been revived. With multiple large- market stations now owned by a small number of companies, syndicated programs could be disseminated more easily than before. During the late 1990s, political t radio (other than Limbaugh) was still only a portion of the talk radio environment; other subgenres such as lifestyle talk (Laura Schlessinger), truck talk (Bill Mack, Dale Sommers) or paranormal talk (Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM) and general interest political interviews and talk (Jim Bohannon, Joey Reynolds) generally made up AM talk station's lineup. The September 11, 2001 attacks brought on a wave of nationalism and a desire to rally around the United States and its government, which was led at the time by the Republican Party. This environment led to a large increase in national conservative talk radio hosts: The Glenn Beck Program, The Sean Hannity Show, The Laura Ingraham Show, Batchelor and Alexander (which follows a news magazine format) and The Radio Factor all launched into national syndication at this time; The Savage Nation, which had launched nationwide a year prior, saw a large increase in syndication around this time as well. The success of conservative talk radio led to imitation attempts with progressive talk radio in the mid-2000s, led by the launch of Air America Radio. However, Air America suffered from weaker stations and inexperienced management and ceased operations in 2010. By the end of the decade, the format was near extinction. Even longtime noncommercial progressive talk outlet Pacifica found itself in serious financial difficulties, being forced to end local operations of its New York outlet WBAI in 2019. = Audience and advertising = Sean Hannity was part of the early 2000s wave of new national conservative talkers. Listeners of conservative talk radio in the United States have predominantly been white and religious Americans as they are more prone to being ideological conservatives. Furthermore, men were more likely to be listeners of conservative talk radio than women. Recent Arbitron polls have shown that the vast majority of conservative talk radio station listeners are males over the age of 54, with less than 10 percent of the listener base aged 35 to 54. It is also shown that less than one tenth of one percent of conservative talk radio listeners participate (or call in) to the hosts to make comments. This specific knowledge of the audience assists advertisers in their goal to attract potential customers, and the stations found that listeners of conservative talk radio are more involved and responsive in AM radio in comparison to music listeners of FM radio. Talk radio programs allow for a more personal approach to their shows, which helped contribute to the rise of revenue and popularity of conservative talk radio stations: Thus, advertisers have found that AM listeners have more trust in the radio personality and use that to their advantage. = Controversy = The controversial nature of political talk radio exposes hosts to boycott campaigns against their advertisers. One such campaign was instigated during the Rush Limbaugh‚ÄìSandra Fluke controversy that spanned from February to March 2012, in which syndicated host Rush Limbaugh made comments against a Georgetown University Law student, Sandra Fluke, calling her a 'slut' under the logic that only a slut would use so much birth control as to be unable to afford it without government-mandated insurance coverage. After the comments were broadcast, Sandra Fluke called Rush Limbaugh a misogynist. Limbaugh made a public apology on his show. Fluke refused to accept it, calling the apology insufficient. In response to these events, 12 sponsors withdrew their support of Limbaugh's show. Sean Hannity and Michael Savage, two nationally syndicated hosts, began a feud that began in January 2014. The conflict started when Savage decided to move the live broadcast of his show, The Savage Nation, from his original 6-9 p.m. ET timeslot (which is timed to mid-afternoon in the Pacific Time Zone; Savage originates his program from San Francisco and it was formerly an afternoon drive show for that market) to 3‚Äì6 p.m. ET, directly challenging the New York-based Hannity on the East Coast after Cumulus Media dropped Hannity's show from their stations in major markets and picked up Savage from the Talk Radio Network to be syndicated by their Westwood One division. = Internet broadcasting = A few conservative talk radio hosts also syndicate their shows on the internet. In 2011, Glenn Beck started his own television channel initially through Viacom networks, however as of 2014 Suddenlink Communications is the outlet for the channel. TheBlaze, which also has an internet-radio component on their website employs Beck and many other hosts on their shows. The radio channel, TheBlaze Radio Network broadcasts on the internet as well as on satellite radio, Sirius XM. Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs radio show is also streamed on the internet through iHeartRadio, which ClearChannel Communications owns as well. =Future= Dennis Miller, with no prior experience in radio, hosted a national conservative talk show from 2007 to 2015. There has been a relative dearth of new radio hosts launched into national syndication since the late 2000s, in part due to personnel declines at local talk stations; most new national hosts have jumped to talk radio from other media (examples include Dennis Miller, a stand-up comic; Fred Thompson, Herman Cain and Mike Huckabee, all former Republican Presidential candidates; the late Jerry Doyle, an actor; and Erick Erickson, a professional blogger). This has also opened up opportunities for less orthodox hosts than were common in the 1990s and 2000s; civil libertarian/nationalist Alex Jones, who spent most of the 2000s as a radio host heard primarily on shortwave, began securing syndication deals with mainstream conservative-talk radio stations during the presidency of Barack Obama. The genre has also lost ground in listenership. By 2014, at which point Limbaugh had been moved to less-listened-to stations in a number of major markets including New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and was no longer the most-listened-to radio host in the United States. In that position for over a decade, by this point classic hits disc jockey Tom Kent had surpassed Limbaugh estimating he had nearly 10 million more listeners across his numerous programs (unlike Limbaugh, Kent hosts multiple shows, tallying at least 50 hours a week on air, spanning numerous formats from classic hits to top-40 radio, as opposed to Limbaugh's singular three-hour daily program).Tom Kent Radio Network history \\"TKRN reaches 400 station affiliate mark with over 23 million weekly listeners!\\" This figure encompasses all of Kent's various programs. NPR's drive-time programs, Morning Edition and All Things Considered, surpassed Limbaugh in 2016.

The smallest species is probably Amoria dampieria frequently around 20 mm. Biology Amoria are nocturnal and prey on other gastropods and on bivalves. They generally inhabit areas with well sorted coarse sand. Some Amoria species have been noted to bite people when they are handled. The bite is followed by a mild sting, but no long-term effects have been noted. Fossil history The first Amoria appear in the Eocene and Late Miocene from Victoria. Judging from anatomical features, Amoria are close to the genus Cymbiola from which they descended in the Tertiary. Cymbiola are related to Tethyan species of the Late Miocene of Indonesia, Java. Taxonomy Amoria includes 20-30 species. The following species have been recognized: * Amoria benthalis McMichael, 1964 - Queensland, New South Wales * Amoria canaliculata McCoy, 1869 - Queensland * Amoria chaneyi Morrison, 2012 * Amoria damonii Gray, 1864 - Western and Northern Australia * Amoria dampieria Weaver, 1960 - Dampier Archipelago * Amoria diamantina Wilson, 1972 - Western Australia * Amoria ellioti (Sowerby II, 1864) - Western Australia * Amoria exoptanda (Reeve, 1849) - Southern Australia * Amoria grayi Ludbrook, 1953 - Western Australia * Amoria guttata McMichael, 1964 - Queensland * Amoria hansenae Morrison, 2012 * Amoria hunteri (Iredale, 1931) - Eastern Australia * Amoria jamrachi Gray, 1864 - Western Australia * Amoria jansae van Pel & Moolenbeek, 2010 * Amoria lineola Bail & Limpus, 2009 * Amoria macandrewi (Sowerby III, 1887) - Western Australia * Amoria maculata (Swainson, 1822) - Eastern Australia * Amoria mihali H.

The park is located two or three miles north of Ormond Beach, Florida on North Beach Street. History small shell midden at Nocoroco Approximately seven thousand years ago, during the Archaic Period, indigenous people found plentiful fish and shellfish at this site in the shelter of a barrier island to the east. The site was inhabited approximately twelve hundred years ago by the Timucuans, whose descendants were discovered there by Europeans. Alvaro Mexia visited Nocoroco in 1605, just as European acculturation had begun. Mexia's expedition explored down the east coast of Florida at the behest of the Spanish governor. This late St. Johns period site represents one of the last Timucuan strongholds in northeastern Florida. All that remains today of these native peoples are the shell middens, which help modern archaeologists document their lives. The British occupation began in 1763 when Great Britain received Florida from Spain in a trade. The site of the village of Nocoroco was part of a British land-grant called Mt. Oswald, held by Richard Oswald. His plantation grew indigo and rice. After its return to the Spanish in 1783, the area was likely cultivated until many plantations were destroyed near the beginning of the Second Seminole War in 1835. Site Archeology The midden at Nocoroco is mainly composed largely of a black earth accumulation, with pockets of shell and a few larger shell accumulations., Florida Historical Society. The Florida Historical Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 4 (April 1949), p344-345 The midden differs from most common middens in the region, which are mostly shell. Shell types include Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria mercenaria, Tagelus plebeius, Arca sp., Donax variabilis, Geukensia demissa, Sinistrofulgur perversum, and Hexaplex fulvescens. Animal bones were not preserved well and typically were quite fragmentary. Among mammals, the most prevalent source of food seems to have been deer, but other types of bones, such as fish, turtle and alligator remains, were all present. NRHP listing On May 7, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a site significant for its information potential in the area of aboriginal history. Present day Today the site of the village of Nocoroco is marked by a large fountain sculpture, called the \\"Tomokie Fountain\\", created by Frederick Dana Marsh. The fountain is Marsh's artistic interpretation of the legend of Tomokie, whose arrogance in drinking from a sacred spring was paid for with his life and those of all his band. According to information at the site, references to the legend date back more than one hundred years.

It accepts an argument that determines the location of the temporary file, and the prefix of its generated filename. After \`mkstemp\` was added to the Single UNIX Specification, the function \`tempnam()\` was deprecated, because the latter carried the risk that a temporary file with the same name could be created by another thread or process within the time from when the caller obtains the temporary filename and attempts to create it. \`mkstemp\` does not suffer from this problem.

Mechanism The \`mkstemp\` function generates a filename according to the supplied argument for the template, and attempts to create it. It repeats this process until a file has been successfully created. After this, it opens the file and returns the file descriptor to the caller, with the data buffer that was passed to the function with the template now containing the new filename. The file can be deleted immediately after the \`mkstemp\` call returns to prevent other processes from opening it, but the file can still be used because the calling process will still have a valid file descriptor. Older versions of \`mkstemp\` created the file with an umask of 0666, resulting in the temporary files being readable and writable to all users, and thus presenting a security vulnerability; this is mitigated by setting the umask manually before calling \`mkstemp\`.

Leskien's hypothesis was that phonetic shifts do not occur randomly or haphazardly, but instead are the product of directly observable conditions. Among the students that Leskien taught are: Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay, Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Karl Verner and Adolf Noreen. Thus Leskien can be seen as a key founder of modern comparative linguistics, particularly in the fields of Baltic and Slavic languages. In his 1881 essay , Leskien formulated Leskien's Law, a sound law devised to describe a particular aspect of sound change in Lithuanian. According to this law long vowels, along with the diphthongs ie and uo, with an acute intonation are shortened in the final syllable of a word. Leskien is also the author of , a guide to Old Church Slavonic (3rd ed. 1898; 8th, revised and enlarged edition 1962). Although superseded in places by more recent studies, the book is still in print and remains in use by scholars to the present day. With Karl Brugmann, he edited Litauische Volkslieder und M√§rchen (‚ÄúLithuanian Folk Songs and Tales‚Äù; 1882).

Although some of the largest cities operate city buslines most people prefer to use a petit taxi for point-to-point transport within city limits.  Regional transport  For journeys to regional destinations beyond the city limits you can choose between buses (public buses for nearby destinations and private \\"luxury\\" buses for long distance and even cross-country) or the so- called grand taxi.Tourist information on transport in Morocco  Petits Taxis  A petit taxi is a smaller model car painted in the designated color, which differs from city to city. It has a maximum capacity of three passengers plus the driver. There are special stops for petits taxis, often combined with a grand taxi stop, where these taxis are allowed to park and wait for customers. However, in most cases customers will signal or shout for a taxi when an empty one passes. Normally a customer hires the complete taxi for his trip and pays a fare for that trip: it doesn't matter if one is alone or with a party of up to three. When there is still a vacant seat the driver might pick up another passenger if he spots a potential customer for a trip in more or less the same direction. In most cities the drivers use a few fixed tariffs for popular destinations depending on the distance and also time of day (more expensive late at night). Taxis in busy cities like Casablanca or Marrakech are generally more expensive than in a city like Nador. To prevent abuse by drivers of (mainly) foreign tourists some cities require a petit taxi to use a meter. In that case the fare depends on distance travelled. After 9 p.m. fares are generally 50% higher. Tourist-information brochures advise tourists to insist on using the meter or agree on a fixed price in advance. Petits taxis are small cars such as a Fiat Uno, Peugeot 205 and similar sized models using diesel as fuel. In general the cars used are quite old (mostly from the 1990s); often the interior is overhauled and/or is a state of disrepair - at least in comparison with European standards. However some newer models, mainly Dacia Logans (which are being produced in Morocco) can be seen regularly. To allow passengers to carry luggage most cars are equipped with a simple open wooden box on the roof where oversized goods are placed without anything to secure it. As the speed inside the city limits is never high this method doesn't lead to many accidents. The sides of this roof-rack is also the place where petit taxi is printed together with their local registration number. = Colors = Petit taxis coloured in yellow at the center of Tetouan city, Morocco.

Normally a grand taxi is a shared vehicle: at the main taxi stands many grands taxis gather. It is a type of share taxi system but without timetables or government influence. Each taxi will drive a more or less fixed route to a set destination and all passengers looking for transport to that destination or somewhere along the route used share one grand taxi. When the taxi is full (maximum 4 passengers on the rear seat and two on the front-passenger chair) he will depart. He might depart earlier if it takes too long to wait for a full car and/or when he expects to pick up more passengers along the route. Although this shared use is cheap, it isn't always very comfortable for longer trips in hot summers: 7 people (including driver) are packed in a 1970s to '80s four door Mercedes without air conditioning. Many people prefer to charter a complete taxi and agree on a fixed price before departure. Grands taxis are almost exclusively older Mercedes-Benz W123 sedans using diesel fuel. In some extremely rare exceptions Opel Senators serve as a grand taxi. Grands taxis originating in the same region all have to paint their car the same color; quite often white, ochre or olive green. The colors of the grands taxis from one region usually differ from the color of the petits taxis of that same region; in Marrakech however, both are ochre. Small red plaques at the front and/or rear indicate their city of origin and a registration number. Development of taxi transport services New taxi cabs ready to use in Morocco New taxi cabs ready to use in Morocco Starting from 2014, Mustapha Chaoun, the secretary general of the national union of transport professionals, said that \\"45,000 taxis all over Morocco have to be renovated.\\" Chaoun added that these taxis should be renovated gradually because there are some administrative problems that should be fixed first. Morocco decided to offer owners of the grand taxis a subsidy of 80,000 dirhams if they wish to buy a new vehicle, In parallel with this government project, the Renault automobile company in Tangier reportedly said earlier that it would offer a discount of MAD10,000 for taxi drivers who wish to replace their old Mercedes 240 Diesel with a new Dacia Lodgy.http://www.lavieeco.com/news/economie/grands-taxis-le-renouvellement-a- deja-commence-a- casablanca-29821.htmlhttp://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2015/03/153072/grand- taxis-morocco-113-new-taxis-already-service/ Since the beginning of 2015, Grand Taxis have notably seen renewed mainly by the Dacia Lodgy, SsangYong Rodius(2nd gen), Mercedes Vito and other 7 seats vans.

He was a vital part of Galway's great \\"Three-in-a-Row\\" side of the mid-1960s.http://www.hoganstand.com/Galway/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=88755 The \\"Dunmore Dynamo\\" was the scourge of all right half backs up and down the county for a decade. The groundwork for Leydon's outstanding career was laid from an early stage. He attended the great footballing college, St. Jarlath's College of Tuam, the home of so much football tradition. In 1960, the Dunmore man helped St. Jarlath's to an All-Ireland Colleges Championship. That year Leydon was also in the Galway minor team which convincingly won the All- Ireland title, winning the Connacht final against Roscommon by 20 points and then overwhelming Cork in the All-Ireland final, 4-09 to 1-05. His first Connacht senior medal came in 1963 when Galway hammered Leitrim by 14 points in the final. They then accounted for Kerry by four points in the All-Ireland semi-final. They lost to Dublin in the final but the big breakthrough came the next year when Kerry were toppled by the Connacht champions in the final, with Leydon marking Denis O'Sullivan, one of many formidable wing-backs he came up against in his time. Further success was to follow for the tribesmen when Enda Colleran captained them to another victory over Kerry in the 1965 final and a six-point win in the decider against Meath the following September. That victory ensured a memorable \\"Three-in-a-Row\\" for Galway. It would be 32 years before the county would win another one. Leydon featured in the 1971 final when Offaly beat them by three points. The Dunmore man himself quit the intercounty scene in 1972 when his job with Cantrell and Cochrane forced him to move to Cork to take up a position as regional manager for Munster. After having won six or seven Galway Championships with Dunmore, he started playing for Nemo Rangers in Cork who, at that time, did not enjoy the same reputation nationally as they were later to achieve as one of the best club footballing sides in Ireland. Since that time Nemo Rangers have won several All-Ireland Club Championships but Leydon's only final came in 1975 when they were beaten by two points by a very strong UCD side. In 1999, Leydon was voted on the Galway \\"Team Of The Millennium\\".

The Syrian government said the explosion was the result of an accidental detonation of an ammunition dump, but later reports suggested it was the result of a Syrian chemical weapons experiment. Official version The explosion happened in Musalmiya, a city in northern Syria near Aleppo, on 26 July 2007. Officials said that high summer temperatures of up to 50 ¬∞C set off explosive materials at a military missile base, causing the ammunition dump to explode. Fifteen Syrian nuclear personnel were reportedly killed, (as well as reports of 10 Iranian engineers),The Spies Inside Damascus Foreign Policy Magazine, BY RONEN BERGMAN, 19 September 2013 and 50 were wounded. Syria said the blast was \\"not the result of sabotage.\\" Skepticism Jane's Defence Weekly published an article in September 2007 explaining purported inaccuracies in the Syrian account. They wrote that the explosion happened at 4:30 a.m., the coolest time of the day, when temperatures would not have reached 50 ¬∞C. They also reported that the site was a secret weapons complex that contained an underground silo with a Scud D missile that Iran and North Korea had delivered to Syria. Instead of high temperatures, the explosion was caused when fuel caught fire in a laboratory as Syrian and Iranian engineers attempted to load a mustard gas warhead onto a Scud-D missile. Fifteen Syrian nuclear technicians and \\"dozens\\" of Iranian engineers died in the explosion, according to Jane's report. The blast also sent a chemical cloud of mustard gas as well as Sarin and VX nerve gas across the facility. At least three North Korean missile engineers were killed in the blast as well. Syria is believed to have an active chemical weapons program as well as several hundred Scud missiles. The reports coincided with speculation about the Israeli air strike on Syria earlier in September 2007, which was reported to have targeted a nuclear facility.

Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. The wind farm was built by Caithness Energy using General Electric GE2.5XL 2.5 MW wind turbines, and it supplies electricity to Southern California Edison. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon. It is one of the largest land-based wind farms in the world. It officially opened in September 2012. Details The wind farm is located in eastern Oregon in both Morrow and Gilliam counties, with the majority of the turbines to be in Gilliam County. Oregon provided tax incentives to the developer to help land the facility, but the project is expected to provide Gilliam County with about $5 million annually in taxes and fees when it is operating. Shepherds Flat is entirely on private property approximately southeast of the city of Arlington between Oregon Route 19 and Oregon Route 74. Construction on the project is expected to employ 400 people to build of power lines and of roads on the wind farm. Plans for the project first came in 2002 for a 105 megawatt project, with the plan changed to larger project in 2004. The project was then submitted to the state in 2006 with plans to have the first phase online in 2008. Early plans called for 303 turbines and a generating capacity of 909 megawatts. At the time, it would have doubled the capacity for wind-generated power in Oregon. The farm is divided into several sections, with the Willow Creek Wind Farm between two of the larger segments. Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. The project design now includes 338 GE2.5XL turbines built by GE Wind Energy, each with a capacity to produce 2.5 megawatts, and used for the first time in United States. These turbines and a ten-year service contract cost a total of $1.4 billion, the largest expense on the estimated $2 billion project. In December 2010, the Department of Energy (DOE) offered a $1.3 billion loan guarantee for the project. The insurance fee for the loan guarantee would be paid from federal stimulus money through the Financial Institution Partnership Program.DOE LPO finalizes deal on the World‚Äôs largest Wind Project to date United States Department of Energy, 17 December 2010. Accessed: 18 December 2010. Generating capacity will be 845 megawatts, producing an estimated 2 billion kWh each year, enough to provide electricity to 235,000 homes. Once operational, the facility will have about 35 permanent employees. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic benefit of $16 million annually for Oregon. In April 2011, Google announced they had invested $100 million in the project, part of a $500 million investment package announced by General Electric and including as investors, also, subsidiaries of Itochu Corp. and Sumitomo Corporation.

It is located 45 km south of Tell Mozan, the site of ancient Urkesh.  History  The history and identity of Tell Arbid have been emerging as the result of recent excavations. It is now clear that the most prosperous period for the ancient Arbid was the IIIrd millennium B.C.Polish- Syrian Expedition to Tell Arbid 2015 The site was heavily occupied during the Early Dynastic period that started c. 2900 BC, primarily during Ninevite 5 (2900-2600 BC). In northern Mesopotamia this is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I‚ÄìII period. The ruins of an extensive city dated to the Ninevite 5 period cover almost the entire site. Other contemporary sites in this area of Khabur River basin are Hamoukar and Chagar Bazar. Later, the occupation continued during the Early Dynastic III period (Early Jezirah III, 2600-2350 BC). The site was occupied only sporadically in the Akkadian, Mitanni, Neo- Babylonian and the Hellenistic period. Archaeology= History of research = The initial excavation of Tell Arbid was performed by a British Museum team led by M.E.L. Mallowan. The operation ran from 1934 to 1936.

A first preliminary Report of the Excavation Project of the \\"Institut f√ºr Orientalistik der Universit√§t Wien\\" and Archaeos at Tell Arbid, Syria, Sector D = Archaeological discoveries = Tell Arbid is a multicultural site. It comprises a large main tell and 4 smaller mounds, together covering about 38 hectares with a height of around 30 meters. The main tell consists primarily of Mittanni, Akkadian, Early Dynastic, and Ninevite 5 layers with the latter two including monumental buildings. In the Bronze Age, it was a medium-sized city located between the largest centers of the region in the 3rd millennium BC: Tell Brak (ancient Nagar) and Tell Mozan (ancient Urkish). It was inhabited from the Ninevite 5 period through the Hellenistic period, i.e., from about 2750 BC to the 2nd century BC. The main period of occupation occurred in the Bronze Age; the youngest remains ‚Äì from the Neo-Babylonian and Hellenistic periods ‚Äì are scarce. The most important features include a Ninevite 5 temple (the so-called Southern Temple) with a ramp leading to it, uncovered in 2008. Another sacral building, the so-called Southwestern Temple, was found on the western side of the tell. The excavators also identified graves from different periods ‚Äì Ninevite 5 culture, Khabur culture (1950‚Äì1500 BC), and two richly-furnished women‚Äôs graves from the Mitanni period (1500‚Äì1300 BC). The city was in its heyday in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. Residential and economic quarters, as well as official and sacral buildings, date to this period. The finds from the Akkadian period are fewer and include whole vessels and architectural remains. Traces of settlement dating to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC were found only in some parts of the site. The Mitanni-period layers yielded residential houses and graves. After a settlement hiatus, which lasted until the Neo-Babylonian period, domestic structures reappeared; finds from this period include cylinder seals. The excavators also discovered the remains of a caravanserai from the 3rd millennium BC. The excavations at Tell Arbid yielded a rich assemblage of 577 zoomorphic and 67 anthropomorphic clay figurines, dated to the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC. Stone beads (made of carnelian and lapis lazuli, among others), cylinder seals, and stone tools were also found. An interesting group of objects consists of 40 terracotta chariot models, preserved whole or in fragments, dating from the Ninevite 5 culture to the Khabur culture.

Nationalism may manifest itself as part of official state ideology or as a popular non-state movement and may be expressed along civic, ethnic, cultural, language, religious or ideological lines. These self-definitions of the nation are used to classify types of nationalism. However, such categories are not mutually exclusive and many nationalist movements combine some or all of these elements to varying degrees. Nationalist movements can also be classified by other criteria, such as scale and location. Some political theorists make the case that any distinction between forms of nationalism is false. In all forms of nationalism, the populations believe that they share some kind of common culture. A main reason why such typology can be considered false is that it attempts to bend the fairly simple concept of nationalism to explain its many manifestations or interpretations. Arguably, all types of nationalism merely refer to different ways academics throughout the years have tried to define nationalism. This school of thought accepts that nationalism is simply the desire of a nation to self-determine.  Ethnic nationalism  Ethnic nationalism defines the nation in terms of ethnicity, which always includes some element of descent from previous generations, i.e. genophilia. It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group and with their ancestors, and usually a shared language. Membership in the nation is hereditary. The state derives political legitimacy from its status as homeland of the ethnic group, and from its duty to protect of the partly national group and facilitate its family and social life, as a group. Ideas of ethnicity are very old, but modern ethnic nationalism was heavily influenced by Johann Gottfried von Herder, who promoted the concept of the Volk, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Theorist Anthony D. Smith uses the term 'ethnic nationalism' for non-Western concepts of nationalism, as opposed to Western views of a nation defined by its geographical territory. The term \\"ethnonationalism\\" is generally used only in reference to nationalists who espouse an explicit ideology along these lines; \\"ethnic nationalism\\" is the more generic term, and used for nationalists who hold these beliefs in an informal, instinctive, or unsystematic way. The pejorative form of both is \\"ethnocentric nationalism\\" or \\"tribal nationalism,\\" though \\"tribal nationalism\\" can have a non-pejorative meaning when discussing African, Native American, or other nationalisms that openly assert a tribal identity.  Civic nationalism  Civic nationalism is the form of nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy from the active participation of its citizenry, from the degree to which it represents the \\"will of the people\\". It is often seen as originating with Jean-Jacques Rousseau and especially the social contract theories which take their name from his 1762 book The Social Contract. Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Membership of the civic nation is considered voluntary. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in countries such as the United States and France. Corsican nationalists sometimes shoot or spray on the traffic signs, damaging the French version of names State nationalism is a variant of civic nationalism, often (but not always) combined with ethnic nationalism. It implies that the nation is a community of those who contribute to the maintenance and strength of the state, and that the individual exists to contribute to this goal. Italian fascism is the best example, epitomized in this slogan of Benito Mussolini: \\"Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato\\" (\\"Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State\\"). It is no surprise that this conflicts with liberal ideals of individual liberty, and with liberal-democratic principles. The revolutionary Jacobin creation of a unitary and centralist French state is often seen as the original version of state nationalism. Francoist Spain is a later example of state nationalism. However, the term \\"state nationalism\\" is often used in conflicts between nationalisms, and especially where a secessionist movement confronts an established \\"nation state\\". The secessionists speak of state nationalism to discredit the legitimacy of the larger state, since state nationalism is perceived as less authentic and less democratic. Flemish separatists speak of Belgian nationalism as a state nationalism. Basque separatists and Corsican separatists refer to Spain and France, respectively, in this way. There are no undisputed external criteria to assess which side is right, and the result is usually that the population is divided by conflicting appeals to its loyalty and patriotism. Critiques of supposed \\"civic nationalism\\" often call for the elimination of the term as it often represents either imperialism (in the case of France), patriotism, or simply an extension of \\"ethnic\\", or \\"real\\" nationalism.  Expansionist nationalism  Expansionist nationalism is an aggressive and radical form of nationalism that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism or recovering formerly owned territories. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the 'Scramble for Africa' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Japanese empire, and the Balkans countries of Albania (Greater Albania), Bulgaria (Greater Bulgaria), Croatia (Greater Croatia), Hungary (Greater Hungary), Romania (Greater Romania) and Serbia (Greater Serbia). What distinguishes expansionist nationalism from liberal nationalism is its acceptance of chauvinism, a belief in superiority or dominance. Nations are thus not thought to be equal to their right to self- determination; rather some nations are believed to possess characteristics or qualities that make them superior to others. Expansionist nationalism therefore asserts the state's right to increase its borders at the expense of its neighbors.  Romantic nationalism  Romantic nationalism, also known as organic nationalism and identity nationalism) is the form of ethnic nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy as a natural (\\"organic\\") consequence and expression of the nation, race, or ethnicity. It reflected the ideals of Romanticism and was opposed to Enlightenment rationalism. Romantic nationalism emphasized a historical ethnic culture which meets the Romantic Ideal; folklore developed as a Romantic nationalist concept. The Brothers Grimm were inspired by Herder's writings to create an idealized collection of tales which they labeled as ethnically German. Historian Jules Michelet exemplifies French romantic-nationalist history.  Cultural nationalism  Cultural nationalism defines the nation by shared culture. Membership (the state of being members) in the nation is neither entirely voluntary (you cannot instantly acquire a culture), nor hereditary (children of members may be considered foreigners if they grew up in another culture). Yet, a traditional culture can be more easily incorporated into an individual's life, especially if the individual is allowed to acquire its skills at an early stage of his/her own life.Daniele Conversi (2008) Democracy, Nationalism and Culture: A Social Critique of Liberal Monoculturalism Sociology Compass 2 (1), 156‚Äì182 . Cultural nationalism has been described as a variety of nationalism that is neither purely civic nor ethnic.Nielsen (1999). The nationalisms of Catalonia, Quebec and Flanders have been described as cultural.Kymlicka, Will. (1999). Misunderstanding nationalism. In R. Beiner (Ed.), Theorizing nationalism (pp. 131-140). Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 133; Nielsen, Kai. (1999). Cultural nationalism, neither ethnic nor civic. In R. Beiner (Ed.), Theorizing nationalism (pp. 119-130). Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 126  Revolutionary nationalism  Revolutionary nationalism, also known as radical nationalism, is an ideological theory that calls for a national community united by a shared sense of purpose and destiny. It was first attributed to adherents of the revolutionary syndicalism and heavily promulgated by Benito Mussolini. This intellectual synthesis of \\"radical nationalism and dissident socialist\\" formed in France and Italy at the beginning of the 20th century.  Post-colonial nationalism  Since the process of decolonisation that occurred after World War II, there has been a rise of Third World nationalisms. Third world nationalisms occur in those nations that have been colonized and exploited. The nationalisms of these nations were forged in a furnace that required resistance to colonial domination in order to survive. As such, resistance is part and parcel of such nationalisms and their very existence is a form of resistance to imperialist intrusions. Third World nationalism attempts to ensure that the identities of Third World peoples are authored primarily by themselves, not colonial powers.Chatterjee, Partha. \\"Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World,\\" University of Minnesota Press, Examples of third world nationalist ideologies are African nationalism and Arab nationalism. Other important nationalist movements in the developing world have included Indian nationalism, Chinese nationalism and the ideas of the Mexican Revolution and Haitian Revolution. Third world nationalist ideas have been particularly influential among the raft of left-leaning governments elected in South America in recent years, particularly on President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez's ideology of Bolivarianism which has been partly inspired by the anti-colonial ideals of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var.  Language nationalism  Bill 101 is a law in the province of Quebec in Canada defining French, the language of the majority of the population, as the official language of the provincial government. other forms of language nationalism is the English-only movement that advocates for the use of only the English language in English speaking nations such as the USA or Australia.  Liberation nationalism  Many nationalist movements in the world are dedicated to national liberation in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxist‚ÄìLeninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work Marxism and the National Question and his Socialism in One Country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context i.e. fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.  Left-wing nationalism  Left-wing nationalism, also occasionally known as socialist nationalism,Political Science, Volume 35, Issue 2; Class and Nation: Problems of Socialist Nationalism refers to any political movement that combines left-wing politics or socialism with nationalism. Notable examples include Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution ousting the American-backed Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Ireland's Sinn F√©in, Labor Zionism in Israel and the African National Congress in South Africa.  Liberal nationalism  Liberal nationalism is a kind of nationalism defended recently by political philosophers who believe that there can be a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights.Yael Tamir. 1993. Liberal Nationalism. Princeton University Press. ; Will Kymlicka. 1995. Multicultural Citizenship. Oxford University Press. ; David Miller. 1995. On Nationality. Oxford University Press. .

Multicultural Citizenship. Oxford University Press. .

National conservatism  National conservatism is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism, while not being nationalist or a far-right approach. Many national conservatives are social conservatives, in favour of limiting immigration, and in Europe, they usually are eurosceptics. National conservatism is related to social conservatism, and as such may be heavily oriented towards the traditional family and social stability.  Schools of anarchism which acknowledge nationalism  Anarchists who see value in nationalism typically argue that a nation is first and foremost a people; that the state is parasite upon the nation and should not be confused with it; and that since in reality states rarely coincide with national entities, the ideal of the nation state is actually little more than a myth. Within the European Union, for instance, they argue there are over 500 ethnic nationsEurominority (in English) within the 25 member states, and even more in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Moving from this position, they argue that the achievement of meaningful self-determination for all of the world's nations requires an anarchist political system based on local control, free federation, and mutual aid. There has been a long history of anarchist involvement with left- nationalism all over the world. Contemporary fusions of anarchism with anti- state left-nationalism include some strains of Black anarchism and indigenism. In the early to mid 19th century Europe, the ideas of nationalism, socialism, and liberalism were closely intertwined. Revolutionaries and radicals like Giuseppe Mazzini aligned with all three in about equal measure.Hearder (1966), p. 46-47, 50. The early pioneers of anarchism participated in the spirit of their times: they had much in common with both liberals and socialists, and they shared much of the outlook of early nationalism as well. Thus Mikhail Bakunin had a long career as a pan-Slavic nationalist before adopting anarchism. He also agitated for a United States of Europe (a contemporary nationalist vision originated by Mazzini).Robert Knowles. \\"Anarchist Notions of Nationalism and Patriotism\\" In 1880‚Äì1881, the Boston-based Irish nationalist W. G. H. Smart wrote articles for a magazine called The Anarchist.The Raven, No. 6. Similarly, anarchists in China during the early part of the 20th century were very much involved in the left-wing of the nationalist movement while actively opposing racist elements of the anti- Manchu wing of that movement.  Religious nationalism  Religious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, church, or affiliation. This relationship can be broken down into two aspects; the politicisation of religion and the converse influence of religion on politics. In the former aspect, a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Another political aspect of religion is the support of a national identity, similar to a shared ethnicity, language or culture. The influence of religion on politics is more ideological, where current interpretations of religious ideas inspire political activism and action; for example, laws are passed to foster stricter religious adherence.Juergensmeyer, Mark. \\"The Worldwide Rise of Religious Nationalism\\",Journal of International Affairs, Summer 1996, 50, 1.  Pan-nationalism  Pan-nationalism is usually an ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the 'nation' is itself a cluster of related ethnic groups and cultures, such as Slavic peoples. Occasionally pan-nationalism is applied to mono-ethnic nationalism, when the national group is dispersed over a wide area and several states - as in Pan-Germanism.  Diaspora nationalism  Diaspora nationalism, or as Benedict Anderson terms it, \\"long-distance nationalism\\", generally refers to nationalist feeling among a diaspora such as the Irish in the United States, Jews around the world after the expulsion from Jerusalem (586 BCE), the Lebanese in the Americas and Africa, or Armenians in Europe and the United States.Humphrey, Michael. 2004. Lebanese identities: between cities, nations and trans-nations. Arab Studies Quarterly, Winter 2004. Anderson states that this sort of nationalism acts as a \\"phantom bedrock\\" for people who want to experience a national connection, but who do not actually want to leave their diaspora community. The essential difference between pan- nationalism and diaspora nationalism is that members of a diaspora, by definition, are no longer resident in their national or ethnic homeland. Traditionally 'Diaspora' refers to a dispersal of a people from a (real or imagined) 'homeland' due to a cataclysmic disruption, such as war, famine, etc. New networks - new 'roots' - form along the 'routes' travelled by diasporic people, who are connected by a shared desire to return 'home'. In reality, the desire to return may be eschatological (i.e. end times orientation), or may not occur in any foreseeable future, but the longing for the lost homeland and the sense of difference from circumambient cultures in which Diasporic people live becomes an identity unto itself.

She won a $5000 scholarship to study music abroad after winning a contest between the best high school singers in New England. When Julius and Anna Nathanson, playing in Freeman's Goldene Kaleh in Boston, happened to hear Kressyn, they persuaded her to join their chorus. She played small roles with Max Gebil in Khuppah-kleyd (Wedding dress), with Ludwig Satz in Der gazlen (The Thief) and with Leon Blank in The Three Brides.

In 1933 she married Jacobson and they toured in Argentina, Berlin, England, France, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. She played the leading role (Esther) in Joseph Green's 1937 film Der Purimshpiler opposite her husband, with Zigmund Turkow as a traveling Purim player.

Fossil remains of Mythunga dated back to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous, and the animal itself was found to be a close relative of another Australian ornithocheirid called Ferrodraco. Discovery and naming Mythunga is known from a partial skull, holotype QM F18896 found in April 1991 by Philip Gilmore in marine rocks of the late Albian-age Toolebuc Formation at Dunluce Station west of Hughenden, Queensland. Only the middle snout and corresponding parts of the lower jaws are known, including the rear of a left premaxilla, the lower parts of both maxillae, the rear dentaries and a right splenial. They were three-dimensionally preserved, associated in a chalk nodule. It represents a subadult individual. The fossil was prepared by Angela Hatch of the Queensland Museum, both by mechanical means and by an acid bath. The type species Mythunga camara was named and described by Ralph Molnar and R. A. Thulborn in 2007/2008. The generic name is that of the constellation Orion in the local aboriginal language. The specific name, from Latin camera, \\"room\\", refers to the camerate air spaces in the bone. Mythunga was redescribed by Adele Pentland and Stephen Poropat in 2018, benefiting from further preparation of the specimen. At that time it was still the most completely known pterosaur of Australia. No more than twenty pterosaur fossils were known from that continent, most of them teeth and bone fragments.Adele H. Pentland; Stephen F. Poropat, 2018, \\"Reappraisal of Mythunga camara Molnar & Thulborn, 2007 (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea, Anhangueria) from the upper Albian Toolebuc Formation of Queensland, Australia\\". Cretaceous Research Description The wingspan of Mythunga was in 2007 estimated at . However, that was done under the assumption that the first preserved teeth were located on the left premaxilla which would imply that Mythunga was a relatively short- snouted form with a skull length of . In 2018, it was concluded that they had been confused with a maxillary tooth and replacement tooth and that the skull length was likely between and , with a corresponding wingspan of between . In 2007, two autapomorphies were suggested, unique derived traits. Firstly, the teeth in the rear dentary of the lower jaw were relatively tall (half the depth of the supporting bone at that point). Secondly, the three hindmost maxillary teeth were widely spaced. In 2018 however, the first trait was rejected, as it could not be reliably established where the dentary ended. Another autapomorphy was now proposed: the outer sides of the jaws are undulating because of the bulging tooth sockets. The entire piece has a preserved length of . As with most pterosaurs, the snout was hollow, with a supporting internal boxwork of bone, as could be observed at breaks. The jugal bone apparently extended to a point below the front of the large skull opening, the nasoantorbital fenestra. There are at least eight teeth in each maxilla. That is also the minimal number in the dentary. The teeth are relatively short, conical and moderately recurved. Their cross-section is oval. They are widely spaced at equal distances. Classification In 2007, Mythunga was provisionally thought to belong to a group of plesiomorphic, and thus possibly basal, pterodactyloids: the Archaeopterodactyloidea. In 2010, Alexander Kellner and colleagues placed Mythunga within the Anhangueridae.Kellner, A.W., Rich, T.H., Costa, F.R., Vickers-Rich, P., Kear, B.P., Walters, M. & Kool, L. 2010. \\"New isolated pterodactyloid bones from the Albian Toolebuc Formation (western Queensland, Australia) with comments on the Australian pterosaur fauna\\". Alcheringa 34: 219‚Äì230 In 2018, it was recovered by a cladistic analysis in the Anhangueria. Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis by Pentland et al. (2019). In the analysis, they recovered Mythunga as a member of the family Ornithocheiridae, more precisely within the subfamily Ornithocheirinae as the sister taxon of Ferrodraco.

Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won‚Äôt Save Us or the Environment, Chapter 13, \\"The Design of Environmentally Sustainable and Appropriate Technologies\\", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, , 464 pp. As an aspect of engineering disciplines Every engineering discipline is engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR). These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a \\"cap and trade\\" has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a \\"bubble\\" over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a \\"stack-by-stack\\" and \\"pipe-by-pipe\\" approach, i.e. the so-called \\"command and control\\" approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M;) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life- cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach. Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, . # Waste reduction; # Materials management; # Pollution prevention; and, # Product enhancement. Green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. The effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings. It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when viewed through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects. Sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood. All four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product. The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames. Accomplishments from 1992 to 2002 *The World Engineering Partnership for Sustainable Development (WEPSD) was formed and they are responsible for the following areas: redesign engineering responsibilities and ethic to sustainable development, analyze and develop a long term plan, find solution by exchanging information with partners and using new technologies, and solve the critical global environment problems, such as fresh water and climate change *CASI Global was formed mainly as a platform for corporates and governments to share best practices; with a mission to promote the cause and knowledge of csr & sustainability. Thousands of corporates and colleges across the world are now a part of CASI Global with a view to support this mission. CASI also offers Global Fellow programs on finance / operations / manufacturing / supply chain / etc. with a dual specialization in Sustainability. The idea is every professional has inculcate sustainability within their core function & industry. http://www.casiglobal.us/ *Developed environmental policies, codes of ethics, and sustainable development guidelines *Earth Charter was restarted as a civil society initiative *The World Bank, United Nations Environmental Program, and the Global Environment Facility joined programs for sustainable development *Launched programs for engineering students and practicing engineers on how to apply sustainable development concepts in their work *Developed new approaches in industrial processes  Sustainable housing  In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatt hours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. Residential sector itself uses 18% of the total energy generated and therefore, incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number. Basic Sustainable construction practices include : # Sustainable Site and Location: One important element of green that is often overlooked happens to simply be where we choose to build. Avoiding inappropriate sites such as farmland and locating the site near existing infrastructure, like roads, sewers, stormwater systems and transit, allows builders to lessen negative impact on a home's surroundings. # Water Conservation: Conserving water can be economically done by installing low-flow fixtures that often cost the same as less efficient models. Water can be saved in landscaping applications by simply choosing the proper plants. # Materials: Green materials include many different options. Most often, people assume that \\"green\\" means recycled materials. Although that recycled materials represent one option, green materials also include reused materials, renewable materials like bamboo and cork, or materials local to your region. Remember, a green material does not have to cost more or be of lesser or higher quality. Most green products are comparable to their non-green counterparts. # Energy Conservation: Probably the most important part of building green is energy conservation. By implementing passive design, structural insulated panels (SIPs), efficient lighting, and renewable energy like solar energy and geothermal energy, a home can benefit from reduced energy consumption or qualify as a net-zero energy home. # Indoor Environmental Quality: The quality of the indoor environment plays a pivotal role in a person's health. In many cases, a much healthier environment can be created through avoiding hazardous materials found in paint, carpet, and other finishes. It is also important to have proper ventilation and ample day lighting. =Savings= # Water Conservation: A newly constructed home can implement products with the WaterSense label at no additional costs and achieve a water savings of 20% when including the water heater savings and the water itself. # Energy Conservation: Energy conservation is definitely the most intensive when it comes to cost premiums for implementation. However, it also has the largest potential for savings. Minimum savings can be achieved at no additional cost by pursuing passive design strategies. The next step up from passive design in the level of green (and ultimately the level of savings) would be implementing advanced building envelopematerials, like structural insulated panels (SIPs). SIPs can be installed for approximately $2 per linear foot of exterior wall. That equals a total premium of less than $500 for a typical one-story home, which will bring an energy savings of 50%. According to the DOE, the average annual energy expense for a single family home is $2,200. So SIPs can save up to $1,100 per year. To reach the savings associated with a net-zero energy home, renewable energy would have to be implemented on top of the other features. A geothermal energy system could achieve this goal with a cost premium of approximately $7 per square foot, while a photovoltaic system (solar) would require up to a $25,000 total premium.

It lies approximately north-east of Lipsk, east of August√≥w, and north of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. History Its creation dates back to the years 1562-1569, in which the Wo≈Çkusz manor house was built (as the seat of the Perstu≈Ñ forester) to service the surrounding villages of osoczniks - guards of the royal forest (Le≈õne Bohatery, Staro≈ºy≈Ñce, Kurianka and the peasant village of Skieblewo). Before 1560, a mill was built here on the then important route running from Grodno to Prussia. The mill served the above-mentioned Osock villages. In 1667, the manor in Wo≈Çkusz and the entire Perstu≈Ñska and Prze≈Çomska Primeval Forests were handed over by King Jan Kazimierz to Camaldolese from Wigry, who started intensive forest exploitation here and charged high fees for the right to enter the forest and use the meadows; They also opened an inn in Wo≈Çkusz. In 1700, the rights of the Camaldolese monks to the forest forests were questioned. Royal Commissioners and them. King Augustus II took from the Camaldolese large part of the lands, incl. the farm and the manor house in Wo≈Çkusz, while the abbey owned the mill on the Wo≈Çkuszanka river. A small settlement centered around a mill, a farm and an inn did not develop into a fairly large village until the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, the reason for which was the migration of farmers from the nearby Osockie village - Le≈õne Bohatery, which was destroyed by a fire at that time. An attraction is the monument located in the forest near Wo≈Çkusz right on the border with Belarus. It is a symbolic grave of the staff captain Wieczys≈Çaw Aleksandrowicz, officer of the 29th artillery brigade from the Smolensk Governorate. He died in February 1915 in the fight against the Germans, probably right next to the bridge on Wo≈Çkuszanka (there is a memorial chapel there) and his body was moved and buried in the place where the monument stands. After the war, the father, also a tsarist officer, took his son's body to be buried in his homeland, and in the place of the grave he erected a monument with an inscription crowned with a huge cross.

It was intended to supplement, and eventually supersede the largely obsolete Type 38 15 cm howitzer, which had been in service since the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Over one thousand units were produced beginning in 1931. Design A Japanese cannoneer is taking aim For a weapon of modern design the Model 91 (1931) 105 mm howitzer is by U. S. standards an extremely crude-looking piece. It is much smaller and lighter than the German and U. S. howitzers of the same caliber, weighing even less than the standard guns used in Europe in World War I. Despite its lightness and its appearance of not having been quite finished, it is capable of throwing a shell very nearly as far as can the heavier and far more formidable looking German 105 mm howitzer. The Type 91 10 cm howitzer was a standard 105 mm artillery piece of extremely light construction relative to range and weight of projector. It can be identified by its demountable spade plates, long cradle extending almost to muzzle end of tube, a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, Split trail, and interrupted screw breech mechanism. It was designed to be towed by a team of six horses.US Department of War.

Combat record Type 91 10 cm howitzer was used in large numbers in front line combat service from the time of the invasion of Manchuria through the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars, the Second Sino-Japanese War and in most fronts during the Pacific War. The Type 91 was typically assigned to field artillery regiments together with 75 mm field guns.

It was a licensed copy of a 1905 Krupp design. The Type 38 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 38th year of Emperor Meiji's reign (1905).War Department Special Series No 25 Japanese Field Artillery October 1944 By 1941 it was thoroughly obsolete and relegated to second-line service. History and development Interest in the Krupp 105mm field gun was expressed by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in November 1904, during the height of the Russo-Japanese War. As warship production in Japan had priority during the 1890s, the technology and industrial infrastructure to construct medium or large caliber weapons was reserved for the Imperial Navy, as a consequence, the first twenty units were imported from Germany in 1905.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. p. 97 Further units were produced under license in Japan by the army's Osaka Arsenal under the direction of arms designer General Arisaka Nariakira from 1907, and began appearing in front line combat units from 1911. After experience in the First World War, the Type 38 was upgraded to the \\"C\\" version, with a lengthened bore and modified carriage to permit a higher angle of fire. This modified version was already obsolete by the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but continued to be used by reserve and second-line forces through the end of World War II. Design The Type 38 105mm field gun was a conventional design, with crew seats on the gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydro-spring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces It was designed to be towed by a team of eight horses, or by an arms tractor. The Type 38 105 mm field gun was capable of firing high- explosive, armor-piercing warhead, shrapnel, incendiary, smoke and illumination and gas shells.Bishop. The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II Combat record Type 38 10 cm field gun was initially at the Battle of Tsingtao in China during World War I. It was later used in rear echelon formations in the puppet state of Manchukuo and in various campaigns in mainland China during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s. Due to its obsolescence, it was not encountered by Allied forces in the Pacific.Taki, Imperial Japanese Army Some units were also used for shore defense in coastal artillery batteries in the Boso Peninsula, and Tokyo Bay in the Japanese home islands In 1914, 120 guns were ordered by Russian Empire, converted to use 4.2-inch (107mm) Russian munitions for the 107 mm gun M1910. They received the designation 42-line quick-firing gun Model 1905. These guns continued service in the Soviet Red Army until World War II (there were still 88 such guns in 1936). Weapons captured by the Chinese remained in use in China by both the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang government and Chinese Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party government at least through the Chinese Civil War.

History and development In the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, Beijing Following reports based on first-hand observation of European artillery tactics in World War I by Japanese military observers, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff instructed the Army Technical Bureau to begin work on new designs to modernize Japan's largely antiquated artillery. One priority was the development of a medium caliber artillery piece that would be able to provide greater firepower than the standard 75mm artillery currently in front line service. However, Japan lacked much of the technical expertise or industrial infrastructure to develop such as weapon, and initial prototypes issued as the \\"Type 7 10cm cannon\\" and the \\"Type 12 10cm cannon\\" were rejected as unsatisfactory. However, with the incorporation of advancement in design taken from contemporary Schneider designs, the Type 14 10 cm cannon was finally accepted into service in 1925. However, due to technical and budgetary issues, only a total of 64 units were produced. Type 14 on Taki's Imperial Japanese Army page Design The Type 14 10 cm cannon was similar in design to the earlier Type 38 10 cm cannon, which was in turn based on a 1905 Krupp design, but is notable in that it was the first design done independently in Japan. It had an interrupted screw breechblock, a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, heavy wooden wheels, and a split trail.US Department of War, TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces Ammunition was semifixed, with high-explosive, armor- piercing, shrapnel, and gas shells, and time fuzes for smoke and incendiary projectiles.US Department of War, TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces It was designed to be transportable by a team of eight draft horses. However, in 1931, a tractor was designed for use with the Type 14, with a 50-horsepower diesel engine, which greatly increased its transportability, albeit at a top speed of eight miles per hour. Combat record The Type 14 10 cm cannon proved disappointing in terms of range and accuracy, and was not regarded as a successful design.

In 1778 the court sent a special commission to investigate, which found for the villagers and relieved them of additional requirements. An appeal suspended the ruling.

It lies approximately south- east of August√≥w and north of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. The village has a population of 920. History The territories of the present Sztabin Commune were once inhabited by the Yotvingians. In 1506, King Alexander Jagiellon gave a part of this land to the Chreptowicz family. The village was founded by Adam Chreptowicz before 1598, at the river crossing, on the route from August√≥w to Knyszyn. At the beginning of its existence, it was called Osinki for over a century and a half. In 1627, a Uniate church was built here from the Adam Chreptowicz foundation, which stood in the place of the Orthodox chapel founded in 1513 by Teodor Chreptowicz. Around 1656, the church was renamed the Roman Catholic churchGrzegorz Sosna, Antonina Troc-Sosna: Zapomniane dziedzictwo. Nie istniejƒÖce ju≈º cerkwie w dorzeczu Biebrzy i Narwi.

Jakuba Aposto≈Ça w Sztabinie The name Sztabin was introduced in 1760 by Joachim Chreptowicz, Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He marked out a triangular market and a network of streets. The settlement became the main shopping center of Krasnoborski estates (Chreptowicz, and later Brzostowski). At the end of the 17th century, it began to transform into an urban center. In 1766 Sztabin obtained the royal privilege for fairs and fairs. The town is known mainly for the social and economic experiments of Count Karol Brzostowski. In the 1820s he founded the so-called the Republic of China. He freed the peasants from serfdom, set up a school and introduced compulsory free education in his estates, modernized agriculture (introduced crop rotation and new tools), built a hospital to which he brought a doctor, introduced a penal code, founded a savings and loan fund. He built a glassworks, a brickyard, a sawmill, and a cast iron factory (he built a turf ore remelting furnace), bringing the declining estate to flourish. Thanks to him, a parish was established in 1895, and a marina at Biebrza was built. After his death (1854) he gave his property to peasants in a perpetual lease, but the Russian authorities annulled his will. Sztabin slowly lost its importance and in 1897 he was deprived of city rights. Sztabin's population took an active part in the national liberation struggles. During the January Uprising, a branch of colonel Konstanty Ramotowski \\"Wawr\\" operated in the area, whose camp at the Goat Market in the August√≥w Forest was the site of one of the major battles in this region. According to the 1921 Census, Sztabin was inhabited by 500 people, among whom 437 were Roman Catholic, 1 Orthodox and 62 Mosaic. At the same time, all residents declared Polish nationality. There were 83 residential buildings in the village.Skorowidz miejscowo≈õci Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: opracowany na podstawie wynik√≥w pierwszego powszechnego spisu ludno≈õci z dn. 30 wrze≈õnia 1921 r. i innych ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç urzƒôdowych., t.

Released theatrically on July 26, 1943, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Plot While driving his car, Woody sees a sign that reads: \\"Conserve gas & tires. Is this trip really necessary?\\" Woody refers to himself as a \\"necessary evil\\" while changing his appearance briefly into a devilish version of itself with deranged eyes and speeds down the road after changing back again. While cresting a hill, he runs out of gas and rolls to the gas station below. The gas attendant asks to see Woody's \\"ABC\\" book (see below), and Woody hands him an alphabet book. Insulted, the attendant grabs a hammer and knocks Woody's car into a salvage yard. Woody decides to steal gasoline from the wrecked vehicles in the lot. He unknowingly siphons gas from a parked police car. A cop chases Woody around the salvage yard. They get caught up in stacks of tires, and Woody ends up riding the cop like an automobile out of the yard and end up crashing into a large storage unit of gasoline which explodes, killing them both. In Heaven, the cop leaves the \\"Wing Rationing Board\\" with a small pair of wings. He starts chasing Woody again when he realizes that the wings Woody has received are much larger. Woody's appearance Walter Lantz had been criticized from the start that Woody's garish appearance was detrimental to the appeal of the burgeoning star. The addition of white gloves on Woody's hands (like those of cartoon counterparts Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny) marked the first notable attempt at giving the woodpecker a more streamlined character design. By the following film, The Barber of Seville, Woody's appearance would get a complete makeover, making Ration Bored the last Woody Woodpecker film featuring the original manic design. Production notes * This is the only Woody Woodpecker entry to be directed by storyman Milt Schaffer and animator Emery Hawkins. They filled in for the previous series directors Walter Lantz and Alex Lovy; Lantz had stopped directing films for several years and Lovy had left the studio after working on The Dizzy Acrobat to serve in the war. With the next entry, The Barber of Seville, they would be replaced by veteran animator James \\"Shamus\\" Culhane as series director.Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \\"1943\\". The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia * This is also the final time Kent Rogers would voice Woody before his death in a World War II plane crash on July 9, 1944. Cultural references Ration Bored is a spoof on army rationing. During World War II United States citizens were asked to conserve gasoline and rubber, as well as other items and food supplies. Decisions on rationing were made by a Ration Board, hence the punning title. The gas station attendant refers to a ration book as an \\"ABC book\\". During the 1940s war ration, American automobiles were classified as either A, B, C, T, or X. The ending title card asks viewers to buy war bonds.

It is the result of the merger of the Conservative Congregation Beth Israel and the Reform Temple Judea. Beth Israel was founded in 1860 as an Orthodox congregation. Members worshiped in leased premises, first on Sutter Street, and then a larger space on Mission Street. In 1879 the congregation completed its first building on Turk Street, but soon outgrew it, and in 1891 constructed a new synagogue building on Geary Street. In 1908 it constructed a larger synagogue building on Geary Street, where it remained until 1969. By this time the congregation had moved to Conservative Judaism. The congregation's rabbis were M. Wolf (1860‚Äì1874), A. (Nahum) Streisand (1874‚Äì1878), Aron J. Messing (1878‚Äì1890), Meyer Solomon Levy (1890‚Äì1916), Herman Lissauer (1916‚Äì1926), and Elliot M. Burstein (1927‚Äì1969). Joseph Rabinowitz was cantor from 1891 to 1943. Temple Judea was founded in 1953, the first Reform synagogue built in San Francisco in almost 125 years. Its first rabbi was Robert W. Shapiro, and he was succeeded by Irving Reichert and then Herbert Morris in 1962. In 1964 Temple Judea completed a synagogue building at 625 Brotherhood Way. The two synagogues merged in 1969, adopting practices from both congregations, and moving to Temple Judea's building. Morris became the rabbi of the combined congregation, and Burstein became rabbi emeritus. Morris retired in 1998, was succeeded by Evan Goodman. Goodman left in 2006, and was succeeded by Rosalind Glazer. Early history=Congregation Beth Israel=Early premises Congregation Beth Israel was founded as an Orthodox synagogueKahn (2002), p. 188. in San Francisco in 1860, and subsequently became \\"the first conservative congregation west of Chicago\\".Our History, Beth Israel Judea website.Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 62. From 1860 to 1874 the congregation worshiped in a leased building on Sutter Street between Dupont and Stockton Streets. During this period the rabbi was M. Wolf.See Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 63 and Landman (1943), Vol. 9, p. 357. Beth Israel then leased a larger building on Mission Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets for four years, led by A. (Nachum/Nahum) Streisand.Sherman (1996), p. 207. Born in Posen in 1819, Streisand had been a student of Akiva Eiger, and had served as a maggid (itinerant preacher) in the Ukraine and in Posen. In 1869, he emigrated to the United States, where he served as rabbi of New York City's (then) Orthodox Congregation Shaare Zedek. He moved from New York to San Francisco in 1874 to take the position of rabbi at Beth Israel. Streisand was succeeded by Aron J. Messing in 1877 or 1878,According to Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 63, and Landman (1943), Vol. 9, p. 357, Streisand served until 1878, and was succeeded that year by Messing. According to Kahn (2002), p. 188, Messing served at Beth Israel from 1877 to 1890. Also, Messing's Hebrew Primer for the Hebrew Free School of San Francisco, which describes Messing as 'Rabbi Congregation \\"Beth Israel\\"' was published in 1887 in San Francisco. and died in San Francisco in January 1879. Messing was also born in Posen, in 1839American Phrenological Journal (April 1868), p. 147. or 1840, and studied divinity at the University of Graz. He emigrated to the United States in 1866, to serve as rabbi of New York City's Beth Israel Bikur Cholim.According to American Phrenological Journal (April 1868), p. 147\\\\. According to Kahn (2002), p. 188, Messing first moved to Chicago. In 1870 he moved to San Francisco's Congregation Sherith Israel, but could not convince the members to become Orthodox, and returned to Chicago three years later. He return to San Francisco to serve at the then-Orthodox Beth Israel. When he joined Beth Israel, it had eighty member families, and within a year that had more than doubled. Beth Israel was considered a \\"Polish\\" congregation at the time, but had many German-Jewish members, and Messing gave his sermons in German.Kahn (2002), p. 496. Though services were traditional, the congregation instituted \\"strict rules of decorum\\",Kahn (2002), p. 149. which were given in some detail in its 1878 constitution.Kahn (2002), p. 195. These included prohibitions against gathering outside the sanctuary, talking during services, entering or leaving at various times during the services, praying out loud or with \\"all manner of intonations\\", wearing the tallit over the head, taking off the tallit before the end of services, or bringing in children under 6 years of age. The constitution also detailed exactly when congregants had to stand during the services.Kahn (2002), pp. 195‚Äì196. To accommodate continued growth, the congregation built its first synagogue on Turk Street between Jones and Taylor Streets, and dedicated it in 1879. The congregation outgrew the Turk Street building and, in 1891, built a new synagogue at 1411 Geary Street, near Octavia.Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 63.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 9, p. 134. Geary Street Messing had served as rabbi until 1890, and was succeeded that year by M.S. (Myer Solomon) Levy.Landman (1943), Vol. 9, p. 357. Levy was born in England in January 1852 and raised there, the son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London.American Jewish Year Book Vol. 5, p. 75. Myer Solomon had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man.See Rosenbaum (2009), p. 66, Rosenbaum (1987), p. 22 and Isaac (2009), p. 15. An early supporter of Zionism,Rosenbaum (1987), p. 22.Rosenbaum (2009), p. 108. he had served as a rabbi in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873, where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in San Jose. He then served at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland for ten years, but found the congregation not traditional enough for him, and moved to Beth Israel.See Rosenbaum (2009), pp. 66 and 108, Rosenbaum (1987), p. 23, Olitzky and Raphael (1996), p. 54 and Zarchin (1964), p. 128. At Beth Israel he \\"organized a Hebrew School and a Sunday School, a sisterhood, and a men's club\\".Zarchin (1964), p. 128. During his tenure, the congregation's religious orientation was Modern Orthodox. Joseph Rabinowitz joined Beth Israel as cantor the year the synagogue building at 1411 Geary Street was constructed. A \\"rich baritone\\" from a \\"famous family of Lithuanian cantors\\", he sang at Beth Israel until 1943. Despite Beth Israel's traditionalism, he was accompanied by both a mixed choir (that included women), and an organ. In 1905, the congregation started construction of an even larger synagogue building on 1839 Geary Street between Fillmore and Steiner Streets.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 21, p. 344. It was nearing completion when it was destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. At the time, the congregation had 200 member families, and an income of $15,800 (today $). Services were held on Shabbat and the Jewish holidays. The congregational school had 250 students and five teachers. The members re-built at the 1839 Geary Street location, and dedicated the building in 1908.Congregation Beth Israel Judea records, 1862-1999, Judah L. Magnes Museum website. An \\"imposing brick-and-steel\\" structure, it had an \\"elaborate wood-carved bimah\\" and stained-glass windows. Known as the Geary Street Temple, it was \\"the most visible symbol of traditional Judaism in the city for more than half a century\\".Rosenbaum (2009), pp. 212‚Äì213. Herman Lissauer succeeded Levy as rabbi in 1916, the year he graduated from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA).de Haas (1934), p. 251. By 1919, the congregation had 325 member families. The congregational school held classes five days a week, and had 250 students and twelve teachers. Lissauer would serve until 1926, then move to San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El, and subsequently become head of the Warner Bros. Research Department.Andersen (1995). Lissauer was succeeded in 1927 by Elliot M. (Maurice) Burstein, who would remain rabbi at Beth Israel for over four decades. Born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1899, Burstein graduated from Columbia College in 1919. He was ordained at the JTSA in 1923, where he also earned a Master of Hebrew Literature degree.Zarchin (1964), p. 116. Burstein was politically liberal and a Zionist, and served for five years as the president of the Zionist Organization of San Francisco. During his tenure, Beth Israel \\"gravitated towards Conservative Judaism\\". =Temple Judea= Temple Judea was founded in 1953, the first Reform synagogue built in San Francisco in almost 125 years. Robert W. Shapiro was the congregation's first rabbi. In 1957 it purchased land on Stanley Drive, and convinced the city to change the street's name to Brotherhood Way. In the late 1950s Irving F. Reichert served as Temple Judea's part-time rabbi for three years.Rosenbaum (2009), p. 320. Reichert had formerly served as rabbi of Tremont Temple/Scarsdale Synagogue in the Bronx from 1923 to 1930, and San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El from 1930 to 1947, before retiring from the pulpit at age 53.Olitzky & Raphael (1996), pp. 66, 225, 226. He was a strong anti- Zionist who supported the creation of the American Council for Judaism (ACJ), and following his retirement from Emanu-El, he served for five years as the executive director of the ACJ's western region. Herbert Morris was hired as rabbi in 1962. Born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1930, Morris's first rabbinic position had been two years as a chaplain with the United States Navy in Japan in 1956. He subsequently served as a chaplain for the San Francisco Police Department.Cohn (2003). The year after Morris joined, Temple Judea sold some of the still-undeveloped land on Brotherhood Way to the Jewish Community Center. That same year the synagogue began construction of a new building, which it completed in 1964 at 625 Brotherhood Way. Merger to present In 1969 the Congregation Beth Israel and Temple Judea merged, after three major potential impediments were resolved: the synagogue would have a \\"restricted kosher kitchen\\", Temple Judea's Friday night Torah readings would continue, and the rabbi would still perform intermarriages. Temple Judea's Morris became the rabbi of the combined congregation, and Beth Israel's Burstein became rabbi emeritus. The new congregation moved to Temple Judea's building on Brotherhood Way. The Geary Street Temple eventually became derelict, but was purchased in the late 1980s and renovated by designer Tony Duquette. In 1989, soon after the renovations were complete, it burnt down, and a post office was later built in its place.See New Fillmore (November 2008) and New Fillmore (August 2009). At the merged Beth Israel Judea, Friday night services were Reform-oriented, while Saturday morning services had \\"a Conservative feel\\". Morris created a new High Holy Day prayerbook for the congregation \\"combining liturgy of the Reform and Conservative movements\\". He created a Bar and Bat Mitzvah program for adults, and was a \\"firm supporter of women's causes [and] civil rights\\". He also supported Israel, and introduced the practice of confirmation class trips there. In 1976 the congregation built a religious school, and by 1995 there were 486 member families. Morris retired in 1998, and Beth Israel Judea hired Evan Goodman as his successor.Wall (2006). Goodman had previously served as rabbi of Beth El in San Mateo, California for five and a half years. Morris died in 2003, while Goodman served at Beth Israel Judea until leaving in 2006 to take a position at Temple Israel in New Rochelle, New York. That year Rosalind Glazer, a graduate of the Reconstructionist rabbinical college, joined as rabbi. In the late summer of 2011, the congregation hired Rabbi Danny Gottlieb, who was previously rabbi of Temple Kol Ami in Thornhill, Ontario. , Beth Israel Judea was a member of the Reform movement.Congregation Beth Israel Judea (C807), Union for Reform Judaism website. The rabbi was Danny Gottlieb.Rabbi, Beth Israel Judea website. Since February 23, 2014, Congregation Beth Israel Judea has shared its space with Or Shalom Jewish Community.

History and development The Type 92 10 cm cannon was developed from 1923‚Äì1924, as a long range alternative to the Imperial Japanese Army's existing 75 mm field artillery. Production was delayed due to technical issues, notably a desire by the army to reduce the weight of the weapon to a minimal level, and additional requirements issued by the army in 1927 to increase the range of the yet-to-be-completed weapon to . A suitable prototype was finally completed in 1932, and, after extensive testing, went into production and combat service in 1934. A total of 180 units were produced. Type 92 on Taki's Imperial Japanese Army This piece appears to have almost completely replaced the Type 14 10 cm cannon. It has all the standard features of the 1930‚Äì1936 period of Japanese gun design. In traveling position the tube is retracted by means of a winch and locked to the cradle. The most remarkable fact about the Type 92, aside from its appearance, is the great range that it attains with a 35-pound shell in proportion to its unusually low weight. It has been reported that the weapon is rarely fired at extreme ranges, which require the use of a supercharge, because of malfunctions in the recoil system caused thereby. Some years ago troubles with the recoil system were so frequent that extra glands and packing for the recoil cylinders were carried in the firing battery, and replacing them was equivalent to first-echelon maintenance in U.S. practice. Difficulties were also reported when the weapon was fired at or near the limits of traverse. Whether this was due to a unique \\"bug\\" in the design of the Type 92 or was inherent in the use of spade-plate stabilization is not known. The Type 92 is stabilized by three spade plates for each trail. Both spade plates and trail blocks are demountable. Design Readily recognized by its long slender gun barrel and split carriage trail, the Type 92 10 cm cannon was designed particularly for long-range fire. The recoil system was hydro-pneumatic and it had a distinctive three-step interrupted thread breechblock. It fired a shell up to with standard high- explosive shells, and also had provisions for special long-range shells that could reach , as well as chemical, armor-piercing, smoke and incendiary shells.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces The gun barrel was extremely long, making field transport very cumbersome.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan page 59 The gun was normally tractor-drawn using its large wooden wheels with solid rubber tires, but could also be pulled by a five-ton truck. Its greatest drawback was that it had spade plates on each trail leg that had to be pounded into the ground to anchor the gun in place. Combat record Despite design issues with transportability, the Type 92 10 cm cannon was very successful and was used for long-range counter-battery and bombardment roles. It was first used in combat with the IJA 7th Independent Heavy Field Artillery Regiment at the Battle of Nomonhan against the Soviet Red Army. It later was used in the Battle of the Philippines in 1942 during the assaults on Bataan and Corregidor Island, and it was transported to Guadalcanal and used in the bombardment of Henderson Field. Surviving examples A surviving gun is displayed in front of the Veterans Hall in Arcata, California. It has the serial number 136, and was made at the Osaka Infantry Armory. Another surviving gun is located in front of the Rome-Floyd Parks and Recreations center in Rome, GA. It has the serial number 33, and was made in Osaka, Japan. This gun, which is known as \\"Pistol Pete\\", was captured December 1942 at Guadalcanal. A third gun is located at The Istana, Singapore. It was presented to the leader of the returning victorious British forces to Singapore, Lord Louis Mountbatten, following the official Japanese surrender to the British in 1945 at the end of WWII.

He played the first six games of the 1971 VFL season before succumbing to a thigh injury which would keep him out of the side for the rest of the year. St Kilda made the Grand Final that year. He was St Kilda Football Clubs leading goalkicker in 1972 and participated in the finals series, but again missed out on playing in the decider when Carlton defeated the Saints in the Preliminary Final, on the back of a seven-goal effort from Alex Jesaulenko. A consistent performer up forward, only four times in his league career did he fail to kick a goal in a game. He topped St Kilda's goal-kicking in 1972 with 53 goals, including four in their Elimination Final win over Essendon. As a cricketer, Stephens was a left-handed middle order batsman and appeared in a total of four first-class matches in the 1970/71 and 1971/72 Sheffield Shield seasons. On his debut against Queensland at the MCG he made his highest score of 48 in the second innings. Stephens finished his career with a disappointing 123 runs at 15.37.

It was established by the UCLA African Activist Association in 1970 and named after the Swahili word for comprehension, understanding, or being.Ufahamu Home Page The journal is published three times a year and is available from the University of California's eScholarship website. It is \\"the longest running ... graduate student journal in the United States.\\" Ufahamu is published in English, with occasional poetry or articles in African and European languages. It is indexed in the MLA International Bibliography, Africa-Wide Information, and Historical Abstracts. Origin and purpose Ufahamu was conceived in 1969 by a group of graduate students active in UCLA's African Activist Association and African Studies Center, after a black-white confrontation at the 1969 African Studies Association in Montreal, where the black caucus critiqued African studies scholars and journals for being \\"overwhelmingly white and male.\\" The journal was established with an \\"activist orientation\\" to act \\"as a pressure group with regard to the sociopolitical problems relating to Africa,‚Äù and to provide a forum for new perspectives on Africa and sharp discussion. Since its founding, the journal served as a platform for scholars across the diaspora, giving voice to \\"Africans and Afro- Americans, students, non-academics and academics.\\" Topics Ufahamu publishes writing aimed at both general readers and scholars, and publishes material \\"supportive of the African revolution\\", about Africa and the African diaspora. This has included articles about African history, politics, economics, sociology, anthropology, law, planning and development, and literature. It also publishes work on racism, inequality, and language use, such as the use of \\"coloured\\" in the South African context. It has published analyses of \\"crucial influences\\" in the study of postcolonial Africa and reviews of modern African art by African critics, drawing favorable comparisons with Wole Soyinka's journal Transition. Editors The journal was initially edited by seven graduate students: Robert Cummings, Salih El Arifi, Sondra Hale, Adolfo Mascarenhas, Reynee Pouissant, Joy Stewart, and Allen Thurm. By the third volume in 1973, it had an editor-in-chief. Editors such as Es'kia Mphahlele tried to use the journal to \\"actualise African modernity\\" and encourage the emergence of modern African literature. Impact The journal published the first articles of some of the most cited scholars in African studies, including Walter Rodney, whose essays became the book How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, John Thornton, and Sondra Hale. Influential articles from Ufahamu include Judith Van Allen's 1975 essay on the Igbo Women's War of 1929, Sondra Hale on the controversy over genital cutting, Edward Alpers on African economic history and underdevelopment, Christopher Ehret on African history, and articles on the limitations of universal literary critiera, Garveyism, and trance in Nigerian theater. The journal has been described by scholars as an important part of the \\"black radical tradition,\\" and is credited for introducing important terms in African studies, such as Ali Mazrui's concept of \\"Afrabia\\" and for contributing to the nature and direction of African studies. Controversy The journal was sometimes banned as a \\"militant African activist\\" journal. The apartheid South African government banned the spring 1982 edition of the journal for publishing papers from a recent conference of the African Activist Association, which criticized the government and was titled \\"From Apartheid and Imperialism to the Total Liberation of Southern Africa.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Publications established in 1970 African studies journals Academic journals edited by students University of California, Los Angeles 1970 establishments in California ","title":"Ufahamu"},{"id":"18625519","text":"Burczak is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Czarna Bia≈Çostocka, within Bia≈Çystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

It was first formulated in Metaphors We Live By. In Women, Fire and Dangerous Things, Lakoff expands on the foundations of experientialism with research into the nature of categories. Basic realism Experientialism is especially a response to the objectivist tradition of transcendental truth most prominently formulated by Immanuel Kant. Although experientialism states that there is no \\"purely rational\\" detached God's-eye view of the world which is external to human thought, it still requires a commitment to what Lakoff and Johnson call \\"basic realism\\". Most importantly, this involves acknowledging the existence of a mind-independent external world and the possibility of stable knowledge of that external world.

It is the second film in the Ang√©lique series, based upon the novels by Anne and Serge Golon, and a sequel to Ang√©lique, Marquise des Anges. It was made as a co-production between France, Italy and West Germany.Klossner p.256 It was made at the Billancourt Studios in Rome and the Cinecitta Studios in Rome. Location shooting took place at Versailles. The sets were designed by the art director Ren√© Moulaert. Synopsis After the execution of Jeoffrey de Peyrac, Ang√©lique finds refuge at the Cour des Miracles and the boss Calembredaine; he turns out to be her childhood friend and first love Nicolas. With his help she finds her children. After a fight between two rival gangs, Nicolas is shot and Ang√©lique is arrested and sent to the Ch√¢telet. She asks the captain to let her go rescue her children, he agrees but she has to come back to spend the night with him. Ang√©lique goes to the headquarters of the Grand Co√´rse and rescues her children. She brings them to Barbe and asks her to take care of them because she has a debt to pay. Ang√©lique returns to the Ch√¢telet where the captain is waiting for her. He tries to kiss her but they struggle and he falls down. She escapes and flees to Barbe who now works in an old run-down inn called \\"Le coq Hardi\\". After persuading the owner 'Ma√Ætre Bourjus' to employ her, Ang√©lique renames the inn \\"Le masque rouge\\"; it is a big hit in Paris. One day she meets her old enemy, Monsieur, brother of the king, accompanied by his noblemen. A tragedy occurs, \\"Le masque rouge\\" burns to the ground and Ang√©lique swears revenge. She calls on her friend Claude le Petit aka \\"Le po√®te crott√©\\". He writes pamphlets in which they accuse the noblemen surrounding Monsieur. The king disapproves of what his brother did but he doesn't like what the poet is doing and has him hanged, another death on Angelique's conscience. He sends his best policeman to her, the former lawyer of Jeoffrey, Desgrez, who realizes she is planning to kill herself. He promises her a license to make and sell chocolate and 50.000 livres as compensation for the loss of \\"Le masque rouge\\", on the condition that she accepts that the Poet Crotte's death was not her fault and that she stops publishing the remaining pamphlets so that Monsieur's name isn't mentioned. In her new establishment she then encounters her cousin Philippe de Plessis- Belli√®res. They have a passionate affair, but Ang√©lique wants him to marry her so she blackmails him with an old secret. Eventually Philippe asks her to be his wife and he introduces her to the court.

Biography = Early life = Veranis was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, to first generation Italian immigrants. Upon their arrival to the U.S. they settled in a lower-class neighborhood in Dorchester. His father Anthony Sr. died when he was still a child leaving his mother to raise and support him on her own. By the age of twenty-seven, he had a fleeting resemblance to actor Eric Close. His mother Theresa had cried often for her troubled son Anthony during his hardships and was very close to him. He had an older brother Ralph who died on October 2, 2019. Tony had been in trouble with the law before, but had successfully made comebacks each time which pleased her. When he was young his parents would take him to the Mechanics Hall, Worcester to watch the fights, but when Veranis started his boxing career she could not bare to see her son fight, but enjoyed hearing the crowds cheering for him. Veranis told a Boston Herald reporter several months before his gangland murder, \\"Boxing got me out of trouble - it does that for a lot of kids.\\" He had \\"Tony\\" tattooed on the fingers of one of his hands and \\"Luck\\" on the other. He stood at 5'9\\" and weighed during his boxing career between 148 and 195 pounds and had a badly broken nose as seen in boxing photographs c. 1957 from years of boxing, fighting in prison and on the street. He was raised a Catholic. He trained with Joe DeNucci, George W. Holden, Joseph Barboza, Rocco DiSiglio, Rico Sacramone and Edward G. Connors' younger brother James. He attended public high school in Boston and was considered by officials in the Massachusetts correctional system to be a \\"persistent delinquent\\" when he was prepubescent to the time of a teenager. As Veranis was incarcerated in 1950 at Lyman Correctional School, he was anonymously involved in the Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency (UJD) study conducted by Harvard University professors Sheldon Glueck and Eleanor (Touroff) Glueck, discovering the causes of juvenile delinquency and adult crime and assessing the overall effectiveness of correctional treatment in controlling criminal careers. = Boxing career = As a teenager he was sent to the Lyman Correction School (now the Lyman School for Boys), the United States' first reform school located in Westborough, Massachusetts. While serving time there, infamous boxer and fight manager Clement Stein Jr. saw him in bouts and got him enlisted in an amateur boxing league when he was released. He boxed with an orthodox stance. In 1957, at the age of eighteen he became a professional welterweight boxer. During his professional boxing career he was sponsored by the boxing equipment and sportswear company Ben Lee. Friends later said that he was quiet, polite and anxious to do well. On December 8, 1956, he fought against Al Pepin in Portland, Maine, which was his professional boxing debut. On January 28, 1957, he impressed the audience by defeating the boxer 150-pound Gunboat Steeves in Boston, Massachusetts. On February 21, 1957, he knocked out Guy LaConte in Revere, Massachusetts. On February 27, 1957, he knocked out Don Vincent in the second round. Veranis fought against Boston native boxer Mickey Dwyer in a six-round bout in Boston, Massachusetts, and outscored him. On April 22, 1957, he knocked down Mark Murray in Holyoke, Massachusetts, three times and defeated him. On May 16, 1957, Veranis completed in his first main event against Joe Klein and won. On June 11, 1957, he knocked down competitor Norm Gautreau in Boston in 1:55. On July 25, 1957, he fought Eddie Prince and was hard pressed to win an eight- round split decision. On August 27, 1958, he fought against Gene Lopes, as a last minute substitute replacement in Fall River, Massachusetts, and won. He later fought Gene Lopes again on September 12, 1957, and knocked him out again in the seventh round. On November 19, 1957, he fought against Roy Tiger Steele in Boston and won. During this match, Veranis was said by boxing officials to have \\"avenged the only blemish on his record with an easy decision.\\" When boxing against Bobby Murphy on December 3, 1957, he dropped Murphy in the seventh round. Murphy rose up off the ring floor but was badly battered when referee Eddie Curley called a stop to the match. On December 17, 1957, he fought against Barry Allison, who at the time was the New England Middleweight champion. His middleweight title was not at stake though, and Veranis was disqualified. On February 13, 1958, Veranis knocked out Silby Ford for a mandatory eight count in the fifth round. He broke Ford's jaw and dislodged several teeth that sent him down. Ford was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital following Anthony's victory. On March 1, 1958, he fought for the New England Middleweight Champion title against Barry Allison whose title was up for grabs and lost. On March 17, 1958, he fought his last professional match against Joe Devlin. Suffering from blackouts After boxing Gunboat Steeves (he had previously boxed against him on February 28, 1957) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, he started to suffer from severe headaches. He was knocked out by Joe Devlin in every round. After the fight he passed out and was taken to Boston City Hospital where he remained in a coma until June 1958. This was his last professional boxing match. In September 1964 after returning to the ring and fighting Pineapple Stevenson, he blacked out while fighting, and woke up in the hospital again. During that match he had put Pineapple Stevenson in a coma. Anthony himself started to suffer from extremely bad migraines, nausea, blurry vision with the inability to focus, and temporary mood swings that changed his behavior. It is unknown if he sought professional rehabilitation at a hospital to help these symptoms that plagued him. He told to a friend, \\"I thought my life was over when I couldn't fight anymore. I was filled with self-pity, I started drinking again and I got into trouble.\\" It is also thought that not being able to box anymore caused him severe depression which brought him to start drinking heavily and becoming incapacitated with alcohol on a regular basis. Out of 25 matches he won 15, although never was able to obtain the welterweight championship belt as it was not available to him the first time and lost it in 1958, lost two matches and was disqualified from one. =Criminal career= He was arrested for an unidentified crime on December 23, 1963, and sent to Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Norfolk. While incarcerated at the prison was an altar boy at prison masses. Father John Fitzgerald of St. Joseph's Church in Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Norfolk later said, \\"He wanted to get straightened out, and I think he did. He was a wonderful boy who'd run with a bad crowd. He frequently stopped in to see me and Father Peter Hart after he got out, and everything seemed to be all right. He took me to the fights, and he was with respectable fellows.\\" After his father suffered a heart attack and could not work, he worked on a construction crew. He became indebted to loan sharks. =Death and afterward= On April 25, 1966, a month after his release from prison John Martorano beat Anthony savagely and shot him in the head in Quincy, Massachusetts. Martorano had his corpse dumped in the Blue Hills Reservation off Route 128 in Dedham, Massachusetts.

Early life Kambi, which means \\"helper and protector\\" in Sanskrit, spent the first years of his life in the McGill Ghetto section of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His father Olu Dara was a jazz trumpeter and his mother Fannie Ann Jones was a Postal Service worker. He has one sibling, a brother named Jabari who assumes the alias Jailhouse Jambi. While in Montreal, Kambi would listen to his neighbour's rap records. Career Kambi had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager, he enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Shamit \\"MC Pankaj\\" Kumar. Kambi first went by the nickname Kid Kambi before adopting his more commonly known alias of Kambi Kam. Despite the substantial buzz for Kambi in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal.

Early life James Freney was a native of County Kilkenny, and from a respectable family who had been wealthy and powerful in the region since the 13th century, having their seat at Ballyreddy Castle. But during the 1650s they lost their lands and were reduced in status. His father, John Freney, was a servant working at the home of one Joseph Robbins at Ballyduff, Thomastown. In 1718 he married Robbins's housemaid, Alice Phelan, and their son James was born the following year at Alice's father's home at Inistioge. He received a good education locally, including tuition in the Robbins household‚Äîand in 1742 moved to Waterford where he opened a pub with his wife Anne. Criminal career Unable to pay the exorbitant fees charged by the town corporation, the couple closed up their pub and moved back to Thomastown. Here, Freney fell in with the Kellymount highway gang, led by fellow Thomastown man John Reddy. Their colleagues would in time number Richard Dooling, John Anderson, Felix Donnelly, James Bolger, Michael Millea, John Reddy, George Roberts, Edmond Kenny, James Larrassy and a man called Hackett. Proclaimed an outlaw in January 1748 (old calendar), Freney surrendered in April 1749. Joseph Robbins's brother, a lawyer, and Lord Carrick helped Freney work out a deal with the chief justices in which Freney would be allowed to emigrate. It is believed this deal was procured because the authorities feared executing him would make him a folk hero and lead to further disturbances. The rest of the Kellymount band were not so lucky. Bolger, Kenny, Larrassy, Millea, Reddy, Hackett, Dooling and Roberts all went to the gallows. Reddy was imprisoned while Donnelly escaped to England but was eventually hanged in Kilkenny. Later life His autobiography, The Life and Adventures of Mr James Freney, was a huge success upon its publication in 1754. Thackeray, in reading the book, delighted in Freney's \\"noble na√Øvet√© and simplicity of the hero as he recounts his own adventures\\". Thackeray includes Freney in the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon, where he has Barry encounter Freney on the highway. The incident appears also in the film Barry Lyndon (in the film, Barry refers to the man about to rob him as \\"Feeney\\"). Local landmarks named after him include Freney's Rock and Freney's Well, and he was the hero of The Ballad of the Bold Captain. Death It is not known where or how long he was abroad, if at all, but by 1776 he had settled at the port of New Ross and worked as a customs official, a post he held until his death in on 20 December 1788. He was buried in Inistioge. Works *The Life and Adventures of James Freney, commonly called Captain Freney (Dublin: S. Powell 1754), 146pp.; Do., (Dublin: C.M.

It contains three buildings, including the titular gristmill (believed to be one of the oldest in the county, and a dam, all dating to the colonial era or the early years of American independence. They are interspersed within the club's golf course, and actually come under the ownership of the Open Space Institute. Little is known about who built the structures, and when. Their architecture suggests they are among the oldest buildings in Garrison, some of the few extant examples of vernacular architecture in the hamlet. They were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a historic district in 1992. Geography and properties The district is bounded on the east by Route 9D, the north by Lower Station Road, the south by Arden Brook and the west by a dirt path that goes from Lower Station to the brook. Other NRHP-listed properties are nearby: The Birches is across 9D, the Mandeville House across Lower Station and Wilson House a short distance to the west down Lower Station, which leads to the train station and the neighboring Garrison Landing Historic District. Castle Rock is visible to the east atop a nearby mountain. The three buildings and one structure, all contributing resources, are located between the fairways of the golf course. The most noticeable building in the district is the red frame one-and-half-story farmhouse visible from the nearby intersection. It sits on a slight slope to the nearby Hudson River. Its shingle siding was applied later over painted weatherboard. The main block retains more of its original furnishing and layout than the kitchen wing. Five hundred feet () south of the farmhouse is a New World Dutch barn, in the traditional wood-frame style with large wagon doors at each end. It is sided in weathered clapboard. To its northwest sits the millpond, and at the other end is the gristmill, where the landscape begins to descend more steeply to the river. It is a -story building that has been converted to an apartment in part. In addition to that there have been other renovations and deterioration to the property over the years. The last property in the district is the dam. It is made of locally quarried stone and begins east of the mill, following a natural fall line at the northwest corner of the district. History There is little, if any, mention of the mill, barn or farmhouse in early histories or maps of the Garrison area. Although the architectural styles and building materials strongly suggest a mid- to late 18th century construction date, similar buildings are known to have been erected in the Hudson Valley as late as 1820. The framing system of the farmhouse is more commonly found in the lower valley, in areas closer to New York City that were settled earlier, and more study is needed, especially given the high integrity of the structure. The earliest landowner known to have developed property in the area was Jacob Mandeville, a New York City businessman who leased in the area from Beverley Robinson in 1735 and built his still-extant home just outside the district. It is possible that he could have built the farm and mill before the Revolution, but there is no record that would prove this. His landlord was a Virginian who had married into the Philipse family, whose vast landholdings extended from the Garrison area almost to what is today known as Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx, was like his in- laws a Loyalist during the Revolution who actively fought for the crown. The Robinson and Philipse lands were confiscated during the war, and after the colonists' victory he left for England. Mandeville was allowed to live out his life on the (now subdivided) property he had leased, and after his death in 1784 it was purchased by his son-in-law, Joshua Nelson. Nelson further subdivided the property, and in 1792 sold the parcel including the district. From him it passed through several other owners, who appear to have continued to farm and mill. The last of these, Thomas Arden and his family, acquired the property in 1820 and continued to own it for the rest of the century. In 1899, the Ardenia Corporation, a local conservation organization, took title and, shortly afterward, leased it to the newly formed Highlands Country Club for use as part of its golf course. As Garrison became a popular area to build large riverside estates, the properties remained untouched but were also largely ignored by any historians of the area. In 1934, however, Thomas Hotchkiss, a Peekskill man working for the Historic American Buildings Survey, visited what he described as the \\"Galloway Farmhouse\\", then in use as a greenskeeper's lodge, and wrote a brief report as well as taking photographs and making sketches. Hotchkiss noted the unique historicity of a group of buildings that were so old having survived the later surge of local development, and documented some features of the buildings, particularly the mill wheel's exterior gearing, that have since been lost. In 1986 it came under the control of the Open Space Institute (OSI), as part of a parcel that became Arden Point State Park. OSI renovated the mill, and has allowed the club to continue its use as a golf course, since that preserves the original agricultural character of the surrounding land.
