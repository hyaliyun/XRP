Over time the name has passed from the legend to a place in the valley.  Description  The name means \\"stag leap\\" and it is a narrow, gorge-like section of the ravine-shaped central portion of the H√∂llental (\\"hell valley\\") with rock faces up to 130 metres high. It is also called the H√∂llenpass (\\"hell pass\\"). It is located on the parish boundary between Breitnau and Buchenbach. The Hirschsprung gorge was only 9 metres wide before the upgrade of the road. The southern Hirschsprung rocks have been tunnelled under by the J√§gerpfad (\\"hunter‚Äôs path\\"), which ran alongside the H√∂llenbach (or Rotbach) stream, but has been closed since 2009 due to the danger of falling rocks and rockface collapse.H√∂llental - Schwarzwald at www.schwarzwald-netz.com. Retrieved 27 Dec 2017. Eight hundred metres up the valley is the station on the H√∂llental Railway that is named after the Hirschsprung. Today it is only used as a crossing loop and is not open to passengers. The impressive size of this station in what is a very thinly populated region is due to the fact that additional locomotives used to be coupled onto trains here in order to pull or push them up the ramp to Hinterzarten.Until 1933, rack railway locomotives had been used for this purpose; even after that pusher locomotives were needed for heavy trains on this steep incline. Until 2001 there was a kiosk below the Hirschsprung at the eponymous car park along the B 31 road.Die Zeitung h√§tte ich gerne noch etwas ausgefahren at www.badische-zeitung.de. Retrieved 27 Dec 2017.  Legend  According to the legend, a knight from nearby Falkenstein Castle went on a deer hunt in the H√∂llental valley. After some time he sighted a splendid stag and took up the chase. But the stag made it difficult for him, because he was fast and agile; nevertheless the hunter did not give up and pressed on after the animal. Driven by fear of death the stag sprang in a mighty leap over the gorge and thus escaped his pursuer.Hirschsprung ‚Äì Sage at www.schwarzwald- netz.com. Retrieved 27 Dec 2017. Today such an event is hardly conceivable in view of the width of the gorge at this point, but at the time it would not have been entirely impossible for the gorge was only 9 metres wide and a stag could jump up to ten metres.  Stag monument  In 1856 the parish of Falkensteig erected a wooden stage on the occasion of the wedding of Grand Duke Frederick of Baden and Princess Louise of Prussia . In 1874 forest taxator, Schilling, had a new stag put up. This occasion was the first Gathering of German Foresters (Versammlung der deutschen Forstm√§nner) in Freiburg. After this monument was destroyed in a storm, in 1887 the last wooden monument was put up on the rocks. It lasted until 1904.badische- zeitung.de: Buchenbach: TIERISCH, 25 October 2010, retrieved 4 February 2012 In 1907 donations enabled a 350 kg and 2.50-metre-high bronze stag to be erected It was designed by a sculptor named G√ºnther and made in the Heidelberg Zinc Ornaments Factory.Ines Fuchs: S√ºdwest: Angeschossen und anges√§gt: H√∂llent√§ler Hirsch wird restauriert, in: Badische Zeitung dated 15 September 2010, retrieved 21 September 2010 When, in 2010, the H√∂llental was closed to traffic for four weeks, the forestry commission used the opportunity to lift the stag off the hill on 6 August using a crane lorry. The foresters responsible for Falkenstein took 130SWR Landesschau dated 26 October 2010 hours to remove the five layers of colour and repair the stag which had numerous bullet holes - around 35 entry holes and about 70 exit holes - and a sawn-off leg. The entry holes were already oxidised, hence it is suspected that it was made between the end of the war and the early post-war period. The reason for the number of exit holes being double the number of entry holes is because the bullets were split by iron rods in the interior before exiting through the external bronze skin. In addition a wasp‚Äôs nest was found inside the sculpture. The monument was painted green and a time capsule was placed inside that commemorated the restoration. On 10 October the stag was placed on a trailer and transported from Himmelreich (part of Buchenbach) to the Red Deer Days in H√§usern as part of a Red Stag Tour (Tour de Rothirsch) with stops in Feldberg, Schluchsee and St. Blasien.

It offers educaci√≥n infantil (preschool) to bachillerato (senior high school) level courses. History The Spanish Institute of Lisbon was established by Ministerial Decree on 12 September 1932 (Gaceta de Madrid, 21 September 32), proposed by the Ministerio de Estado (Ministry of State), provisionally placing in the Casa da Espa√±a, sharing premises with the Consulado y la C√°mara de Comercio (Consulate and Chamber of Commerce) along Rua do Salitre. The first director was professor D. Jose Hernandez Almendros. In 1933, by order 251 of the Ministerio de Estado, the institute was given the name Hermenegildo Giner of R√≠os, according to the desire of the Spanish residents in the city, national entities and proposal of the Ambassador to Spain. At the end of the 1935-36 course year, the management of the Instituto and the Escuelas de Ense√±anza Primaria were unified a building along Rua Mousinho da Silveira. After reaching a certain prominence in Portuguese society, following their work organized regularly with the Portuguese national radio (La Hora Espa√±ola), the Institute faced a severe crisis at the end of the 1953-54 calendar year. During these years it operated along Rua Actor Tasso, but continued to have problems financially, resulting in the delay of the opening of the 1975‚Äì1976 school year. At that time, it moved operations to its current location, at Rua Direita do Dafundo, in the estate Quinta de S√£o Jo√£o do Rio, a historic monument ordered constructed by the Count of Cantanhede in 1649. In 1993 a new pavilion was constructed with two classrooms for the 1999‚Äì2000 school year, in addition to remodeling of the patios and overall improvement of facilities. The library has steadily, over time, been enriched by important donations (with some of the oldest books dating to 1789). Many notable people have lectured at the institute, including D. Manuel A. Ivot Leon, eminent professor of history and American studies; D.Eugenio Montes, renowned poet and professor of literature; and others, including Gerardo Diego, who lectured several courses. As can be expected, there was a special attention placed on Portuguese studies, supported by the library and well-known personalities, including the illustrious historian Fidelino Figueiredo.

She was also known for commonly carrying a bottle of rum to the ring to spit at people as part of her performance. Professional wrestling career Yasukawa made her pro wrestling debut in a winning effort against Yuuri Haruka at the Shin-Kiba 1st Ring in Tokyo, Japan. In the first month of 2013, Yasukawa captured her first pro wrestling championship alongside tag team partners Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo and Saki Kashima. The trio won a tournament to decide the inaugural Artist of Stardom Champions. However, the team was forced to vacate their title three months later as a result of Act Yasukawa injuring her cervical spine. On November 4, 2013, Yasukawa defeated Dark Angel to win the Wonder of Stardom Championship in the puroresu-honored venue, Korakuen Hall. Yasukawa retained the championship until June 2014, when she was forced to vacate the title due to thyroid deterioration related to Graves' Disease. During this time, Yasukawa underwent cataract surgery. While in recovery,Yasukawa continued to be involved in Stardom shows by selling merchandise and being part of the ring crew. Yasukawa returned to the ring on December 7, 2014, teaming up with Kellie Skater in a losing effort against Kairi Hojo and Koguma. At the Stardom 4th Anniversary Show at Korakuen Hall, Yasukawa defeated Mayu Iwatani to win her second Wonder of Stardom Championship. She is the first of only three people thus far to hold the title twice. On February 22, 2015, Yasukawa was scheduled to challenge Yoshiko for the World of Stardom Championship in the main event of a Korakuen Hall show. However, the match resulted in a no contest when Yoshiko began to shoot on Yasukawa, legitimately assaulting her to the point that the match had to be stopped. Following the match, Yasukawa, with a bloody and badly swollen face, was rushed to a Tokyo hospital, where she was diagnosed with fractured cheek, nasal and orbital bones, which would require surgery. The incident received mainstream attention in Japan and became known as . On May 1, Yasukawa was forced to vacate the Wonder of Stardom Championship due to the facial fractures inflicted on her earlier in the year. Yasukawa eventually returned to the ring on September 23, 2015. On December 1, Yasukawa announced she would retire from professional wrestling on December 23. In her retirement match, Yasukawa and Kyoko Kimura defeated Haruka Kato and Kairi Hojo. Afterwards, Yasukawa continued working for Stardom as the manager of the Oedo Tai stable. Personal life Yasukawa was born in Misawa, but her family moved regularly due to her father's work in the Japan Self-Defense Forces. As a child, Yasukawa dreamed of becoming a samurai. Her parents supported her passion by guiding her into Kendo. However, when Yasukawa reached middle school she was informed there were no samurai in modern Japan. During this time, Yasukawa suffered from a near-blindness in her right eye, mental illness, and bullying. At some point during her childhood, Yasukawa attempted suicide. In high school, Yasukawa found solace by joining the drama club: Yasukawa attended the Japan Institute of the Moving Image. After being cast in the 2011 stage production of Wrestler Girls, Yuzuki Aikawa approached Yasukawa and offered her a chance to audition as a wrestler for Stardom. She agreed, but after training for only three months, Yasukawa fell ill and was advised by her doctor not to wrestle. Instead, Yasukawa chose to take medication that would leave her infertile but strengthen her body enough that she would be cleared to join Stardom. In her free time, she enjoys cooking and gardening. Yasukawa's life was the subject of the 2015 Japanese documentary Gamushara.

It rhymes in Serbo-Croatian. It can be heard at football matches, by members of Serbian nationalist groups Obraz, the 1389 Movement and the Serbian Radical Party, and in papers in support of Serb general Ratko Mladiƒá. Although the slogan No≈æ, ≈æica, Srebrenica appears on huge banners at games, public meetings and events in the Republika Srpska and Serbia, Serb authorities do not react to it. Occasionally \\"Biƒáe repriza!\\" (There Will Be a Repeat!) is added to the slogan, celebrating the killings and threatening a future massacre.

On 11 March 2014, a friendly match between youth teams from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in the stadium \\"Doktor Milan Jeliƒá\\" in Modriƒça was terminated after 60 minutes due to improper chanting of No≈æ, ≈æica, Srebrenica in the stands. The referee stopped the match for a few minutes within the first half of the game following hateful anti-Bosniak chants from the audience. The audience was reacting to the exclusion of Milan Gajiƒá, a player for the Serbian OFK Belgrade, who verbally assaulted Bosniak judge Elvis Mujoviƒá. The crowd shouted \\"Ubij Turƒçina\\" (Kill the Turk!), an ethnic slur used by Serbs in reference to Bosniaks.

She has been dubbed as the Queen of the mountains, running ultramarathons while climbing the heights of Mount Everest. Some of her career highlights include five wins at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB), former World Record holder for 24 Hours, and winner of the 2006 IAU 100 km World Championships. Lizzy conducted climate change work with the British Antarctic Survey and holds a PhD in Physical oceanography from the University of Southampton. Early life Hawker grew up in Upminster, a suburb of London. Visiting Zermatt in the Swiss Alps at the age of six, she fell for the mountains, to which she would relocate later in life. Career Hawker's first taste of long-distance running was the London Marathon in 2000. Hawker first ran the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) in 2005. Although she had never owned a pair of trail- running shoes until 10 days before the race she won it at her first attempt. In all she won the race a record five times. She completed her Ph.D. in physical oceanography then realized she was not meant to be a researcher, and put her focus on long distance running in the mountains. After the first race, The North Face offered her sponsorship, which Hawker accepted. She continued to work as a researcher for the British Antarctic Survey until 2007, when she relocated to the Laufschule Scuol, a training centre in the Swiss Alps. In the intervening years, Hawker won the 2006 IAU 100km World Championships, and in 2007 set the record for running the 199 miles between Mount Everest South Base Camp and Kathmandu, Nepal, in 77 hours 36 minutes. The 2010 IAU 100 km World Championships saw Hawker lead the way for most of the race, battling with her compatriot Ellie Greenwood but she faded towards the end to take bronze behind Greenwood and Monica Carlin of Italy, the previous year's third-place finisher. This also earned her a bronze in the jointly hosted IAU 100 km European Championships. In 2011, she set the women's world record for distance run in 24 hours with 153.5 miles in Llandudno, Wales. She also improved on her Everest record with a time of 71 hours 25 minutes. The following year Hawker won the UTMB, the 100-mile Run Rabbit Run in Colorado, and the 155-mile Spartathlon while setting a new women's record. She beat her Everest Base Camp‚ÄìKathmandu time in 2013, completing the distance in 63 hours. Hawker says that she has suffered few injuries in her career, except in the two years up to 2015, when she suffered six stress fractures. She has a reputation for recovering quickly after major races. While training for the UTMB, Hawker ran along the footpath of the Tour de Monte Rosa many times. This experience led her to create a new race, the Ultra Tour Monte Rosa, which runs for 93 miles from Gr√§chen to Zermatt, on through villages in Italy, before returning to the start point. It incorporates more than 32,000 feet of ascent and descent over technical terrain. The inaugural \\"Zero Edition\\" took place in August 2015. Hawker ran, hiked and climbed 1,600 km across the Himalayas in Nepal in 2016. She is the author of Runner: A short story about a long run, her account of finishing the Ultra Trail Tour du Mont Blanc as first woman. Personal life Hawker gained a PhD in physical oceanography in 2005 from Southampton University, while working for the British Antarctic Survey, studying climate change along the Antarctic coastline. She lives in Switzerland, and is a keen skier, climber and mountaineer. Hawker is a strict vegetarian since five years old.

Early life Alfred Schreyer was born on 8 May 1922 in Drohobych in east Galicia, then part of Poland, to a Jewish family. His father, Benno, was a chemist at the Austrian company Gartenberg & Schreyer, and his mother, Leontina, was a pharmacist. His cousin J√≥zef Schreier was a mathematician.Ich war immer Schreyer. Welt Online 30 January 2007; retrieved, 10 October 2011 Second World War In September 1939, Drohobych was occupied by German forces. Shortly thereafter, Schreyer witnessed the occupying forces turn the rabbis to the road on the date of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. In October that same year, the town came under Soviet occupation. The family lost their house and Schreyer's father was forced to work in the paraffin factory. Working as a member of a vocal quartet with the appearance of a Soviet culture brigade, Schreyer purchased for his father working boots for the wet work in the factory, using his first eighty rubles.Wie haben Sie den Krieg √ºberlebt, Herr Schreyer? In: FAZ 14. Mai 2010; retrieved, 26 February 2015. At the start of the German-Soviet War in June 1941, Drohobych became part of the district of Galicia under the General Government. The German occupiers directed local Jews, including Schreyer, to the Drohobych ghetto. In 1942, Schreyer began working as a carpenter in a forced labour camp. Following the dissolution of the camp in 1943, he began working in a warehouse for the Carpathian Oil Company. He was taken to the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp on 14 April 1944. Schreyer remarked, \\"But this hell was only limbo, compared with what was to come.\\" In October 1944 he was transferred to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, and on 4 November that year he was sent to the Buchenwald camp in Block 59. Schreyer stated, \\"until 6 April 1945 when we were evacuated, I weighed only 39 kilos, had bulges in the legs and was a living corpse.\\" On the march Schreyer fell into a group of German prisoners. A fellow inmate said to him quietly \\"look out\\" (German: \\"Pass auf\\") and pushed him into a ditch. Schreyer referred to this event as \\"his salvation\\". After a few hours he was taken by a Hitler youth to the next village. Schreyer's father died in early August 1942, together with around 5000 Jews from Drohobych in Belzec extermination camp. His mother escaped from Belzec but was caught and shot with 11,000 others and buried in a mass grave.Herr Schreyer, nicht Nr. 56001. In: Zeit Online, 19. April 2001; retrieved, 10 October 2011. Shortly before death he moved to Warsaw, where he died. After the war Initially, Schreyer worked as an interpreter for Soviet troops in Saxony. He was repatriated in August 1946 and later moved to Belarus. There, he spoke to a violinist and began to study again. On 5 January 1949, he married a woman named Ludmilla. He had two children, both of whom have been living in Germany since 1993. Schreyer's wife died a few years before him. Before his death, Schreyer was the last Jew living in Drohobych born before the Second World War. On his 90th birthday, Schreyer was awarded the highest award in Poland in the cultural sector, the Gloria Artis Medal of Cultural Merit by the Polish Minister of Culture. With this award his efforts for the preservation of Polish culture have been recognised internationally. In 2011, Paul Rosdy produced a film detailing Schreyer's life entitled \\"The Last Jew of Drohobych\\" (German: Der letze Jude von Drohobycz).

It began operations in April 2000 and closed in 2005. The website was founded by Bruce Forman and Eric Eisner, son of Michael Eisner. The site was known for its raunchy, politically incorrect content, and its target demographic (described by Eisner as \\"people who watch South Park, listen to Howard Stern and read Maxim) were males aged 16 to 25. History Eric Eisner and Bruce Forman met at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, where they both earned their MBA degrees in June of 1999. They got the idea for a site targeting young men during their final months at UCLA. Eisner and Forman were 26 and 28 respectively when they put up the initial seed money for Romp.com in 2000 and followed that by drawing in $15 million from private investors. The site attracted nearly 200,000 users during its first six weeks. The company had 35 employees at one point, though it downsized to 14 in the fall of 2000. By March of 2001, Romp.com had 600,000 registered users. Romp.com started a subscription service called \\"The Romp Mafia\\" in March 2001, attracting 11,000 subscribers in its first three weeks. Content Romp.com was primarily known for its flash animation video series. The site also featured message boards (called \\"spew boards\\"), chat rooms, and softcore images of women. Some of Romp.com's web series included: * Booty Call - a choose your own adventure game, co-created by Julian Max Metter and Cate McManus, in which users played as ladies' man Jake (voiced by Metter) and guided him in his quest to get laid. Booty Call was Romp.com's flagship show. *Tardz - a series about mentally-challenged white collar professionals *The Adventures of Bill and Ted - an animated series following the adventures of Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy *Sex and the Inner City - a parody of the then-new HBO series Sex and the City *Coach Bigot - an animated series about a stereotypically bigoted redneck little league coach *Officer Krupt - an interactive series about a corrupt police officer Expansion to film, television, and magazines Romp.com quickly began to expand from the web to a full-fledged entertainment company. In the fall of 2000, Romp.com signed a development deal with Mandalay Sports Entertainment to produce reality game shows. Two projects developed by the company included Peephole, which involved people on the street being offered money to do outrageous things while contestants bet on how far the people on the street will go to get the money, and The Hunt, which followed contestants on a cross-country scavenger hunt, but neither made it to the air. Romp.com signed a deal with H&S; Media to create a mini-magazine of repurposed content to accompany H&S;'s Maxim-esque men's magazine The Edge. Romp.com was in final talks with H&S; to create a standalone Romp magazine, but that never came to fruition when H&S; went bankrupt in fall of 2001. After downsizing four employees and cutting the site's staff to 11, Forman announced plans for Romp.com to shift its focus from original web programming to traditional media in May 2001, concluding \\"it is mission impossible to make money off the Internet with original programming.\\" Romp.com's production company offshoot, Romp Studios, independently produced Jake's Booty Call, a feature-length version of the site's popular series Booty Call, in 2003. The film, which was co-written and co-directed by Eric Eisner and Booty Call co-creator/star Julian Max Metter, was acquired by National Lampoon for distribution.

Biography Ayres Borghi-Zerni was born in Buenos Aires in 1895 to a musical family. Her father was Edgardo Zerni, an Italian operatic tenor of modest reputation, and her aunt was Adele Borghi, a prominent mezzo-soprano admired by Giuseppe Verdi himself. Little is known about Ayres's early years. She studied singing in Milan under a teacher called Bonanno and made her debut in 1914 at the Teatro dal VermeLa Voce Antica. Borghi Zerni, Ayres\\" as Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen. In the next two years she made a number of successful appearances on Italian provincial stages, amongst which was the Teatro della Pergola in Florence where in 1916 she appeared as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. In 1917 Ayres Borghi-Zerni toured South America, where she sang Lucia di Lammermoor in Gaetano Donizetti's opera of the same title and Violetta in Verdi's La traviata at the Gran Teatro de La Habana, National Theatre of Venezuela and the Teatro Arbeu in Mexico. The following year Ayres Borghi- Zerni made her first appearance at an important Italian opera house - Teatro Comunale di Bologna, where she performed Gilda in Rigoletto and Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula. This signed the beginning of her important career: in the following ten years (1918-1928) Borghi-Zerni was invited to sing at the most prominent theatres of Italy, amongst which were the Teatro Costanzi in Rome (in 1918 and 1922), the Teatro Massimo in Palermo (in 1919), the Teatro San Carlo in Naples (in 1919, 1920, 1924, 1925 and 1928), the Teatro La Fenice in Venice (in 1921, 1926 and 1927) and the Teatro Regio in Turin (in 1922). It seems quite strange, though, that she never appeared at the Teatro alla Scala. Apart from the greatest Italian stages, Borghi-Zerni was tremendously successful in at The Royal Opera House in London, where in 1919 she sang Violetta in La traviata. She also made guest appearances at the Teatro Liceo in Barcelona (also in 1919, in Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Lucia di Lammermoor and Rigoletto) and the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo (in 1920, in La traviata, Rigoletto (as a partner of the great tenor Beniamino Gigli) and the world premiere of Raoul Gunsbourg's new opera Satan). Ayres Borghi-Zerni's career did not last long, as she seems to have retired from the stage in 1928. She gave her last performances as Violetta and Lucia in 1928 (at the Teatro San Carlo and Politeama Reinach in Parma), and after this point her life is unknown. Discography Despite her dazzling career, Ayres Borghi-Zerni made relatively few recordings. She is best known for singing the role of Gilda in one of the first complete versions of Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto (with Giuseppe Danise as Rigoletto and Carlo Broccardi as Duca). This notable set was recorded by La voce del padrone in 1916 in Milan with the company of La Scala under the direction of Carlo Sabajno. Apart from this recording, Borghi-Zerni is known to have made six sets for Columbia Records, which include arias from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia and Verdi's La traviata and Rigoletto, but they are lesser-known.

It was assented to on 30 March 1908 and repealed on 16 June 2016. History Australia imported livestock from several countries with livestock diseases in the 18th century. By the late 19th century, quarantine measure were implemented. After federation in 1901, the state premiers agreed to transfer the administration of quarantine to the federal government in 1906. Two years later the Quarantine Act 1908 was passed, providing a national approach to quarantine for the first time. When the Act was passed, sea travel was the only way that people and goods could reach Australia, and the main concern was protecting the country from outbreaks of \\"quarantinable disease\\", such as the bubonic plague, yellow fever, smallpox, cholera and leprosy. The Act was amended more than 50 times in its 108 years of existence, as biosecurity risks in Australia changed over time, and the broader concept of biosecurity came to include \\"protection of the economy, environment and human health from negative impacts associated with entry, establishment or spread of exotic pests and diseases\\"; a more proactive approach.

Repeal and replacement In 2015, the Biosecurity Act 2015 replaced most of the Quarantine Act 1908, which was wholly repealed on 16 June 2016 by the Biosecurity (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2015. The new Act was a major reform of the Quarantine Act, in particular in its strengthening and modernising the biosecurity legislation in Australia. New requirements included how the then Department of Agriculture and Water Resources would manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, people and vessels entering Australia.

Kranke is known for the design and conduct of clinical studies and for performing systematic reviews in the context of perioperative medicine. He published numerous papers on research focussed on evidence-based medicine and interventional and observational trials on postoperative nausea and vomiting and other issues in conjunction with perioperative medicine and associated topics. The area of his clinical responsibility and interest, among others, is the safe provision of anesthesia and analgesia in obstetrics and gynecology.  Biography  Kranke studied medicine at the University of W√ºrzburg from 1994 to 99, followed by a practical year (PJ) at the University of Heidelberg and at the Cantonal Hospital of Baden Switzerland. In 2000 he was promoted to doctor of medicine (\\"magna cum laude\\"). In 2005 he was approved as medical specialist in anesthesiology (consultant anesthetist) and was habilitated in the same year with a work on the application of evidence-based medicine in the perioperative period with special focus on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).Habilitation thesis in the catalogue of the German National Library He also holds an MBA since 2005. In 2007 he was named senior physician at the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care at the University of W√ºrzburg. There he heads the clinical research since 2008. In 2009 he was named full professor of anesthesiology at the University of W√ºrzburg. Kranke also holds special titles for intensive care medicine, pain management palliative care, emergency medicine, acupuncture and medical quality management (Bavarian chamber of physicians) as well as qualifications with respect to the conduct of clinical trials (phase II to IV). The working group \\"clinical studies\\" and trial management, headed by Kranke,Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care, University Hospitals of W√ºrzburg compiles systematic reviews on interventions in health care with associated economic benefit assessment according to the criteria of the cochrane collaboration, other systematic reviews and has a coordinating role with respect to clinical trials.  Scientific contribution  The main area of expertise and emphasis of Kranke's scientific work was in the area of observational and interventional trials on risk factors for PONVC. C. Apfel, P.

St. Mary's was built in 1868 on the site of an earlier church built there in 1838. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese of Perth. The church and graveyard overlook the Swan River in the Swan Valley district. The church can seat 150 people and is open by appointment only. History On 5 August 1839 the foundation stone for the original church was laid, and opened fifteen months later by Governor John Hutt on 29 November 1840. It was built on land owned by the Church Mission Society and in memory of Lucy Yule, the wife of Magistrate T.N. Yule who died and was the first person buried on the site in 1838. The land was believed to be the site of a landing during James Stirling's expedition in 1827. The church was built with an octagonal layout and could hold about 100 people. It was consecrated in 1848 and remained in use until 1869. Rev. William Mitchell was the first Minister to attend the church. A new (and the current) rectangular church was built in 1868-69 immediately adjacent to the old octagonal church. It was designed by Richard Roach Jewell and consecrated by Bishop Matthew Hale on 10 March 1869. The adjoining graveyard includes graves of many notable European settlers of the Swan River Colony from 1838.

The parish church was completed in 1682 and the enclos paroissial comprises the church, an ossuary and calvary. The south porch dates to 1632. Statuary in the church includes Saint Hernin, to whom the church is dedicated, Saint Corentin, Saint Michael, Saint Gu√©nol√©, Saint Catherine, John the Baptist, a piet√† and Saint Peter. It is a listed historical monument since 1972. Eglise paroissiale Saint-Hernin The calvary The enclos paroissial calvary is 6 metres high and was erected in around 1530. It is thought to have been executed by the workshop who carved the calvary at Brasparts. The base incorporates an altar suggesting that the calvary was at one time used for open air services. The pedestal placed on this base is rectangular and from it emerge the crucifixion cross and two tau shaped gibbets, and at the base of these there is a 'Vierge de Piti√©\\" or piet√† carved from kersanton stone featuring the Virgin Mary supporting Jesus' body assisted by Mary Magdalene and John the Evangelist. On the central shaft bearing the crucifixion cross there is a relief carving of Saint Michael slaying the dragon and at the top of the shaft is an arrangement including depictions of three marmousets (small grotesque carvings) who support statues of the Virgin Mary (on the right) and John the Evangelist (on the left). Both these statues are in ronde bosse. The figure of Jesus is carved from granite and is in high relief whereas the good and bad robbers on the two side gibbets, their bodies contorted, were carved from kersanton stone. The ossuary The ossuary dates to 1697 and was restored in 1965. It became the Saint Anne chapel once the use of ossuaries ceased. Decoration includes Saint Anne reading to the Virgin Mary. The calvary at Kerbreudeur The Kerbreudeur calvary Nearby Saint-Hernin is the remarkable Kerbreudeur calvary, built in around 1450 and reckoned to be the oldest calvary in western Brittany. It is carved from granite from Sca√´r. The Kerbredeur Calvary has been attributed to the \\"Atelier de Sca√´r\\", who were also responsible for the Tronoen calvary at Saint-Jean Trolimon. The calvary comprises a rectangular base formed into a large niche within which are several bas-relief panels. Outside of this niche is a relief showing Saint Michael slaying a dragon and Saint Catherine of Alexandria with her wheel and carrying a sword. She wears a crown. Also outside the niche is a relief depicting the nativity and the Adoration of the Magi and another depicts the mouth of hell. The bas-reliefs inside the niche include depictions of Jesus' baptism and his resurrection as well as a scene showing Adam and Eve being thrown out of the Garden of Eden. Also outside the niche there is a relief showing the procession where Jesus and the two robbers carry their crosses to Golgotha. The procession is led by the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. Jesus is helped by Simon of Cyrene. There is also a depiction of the flagellation. Above the roof of the niche are the crucifixion cross and the gibbets of the good and bad robber on cube- shaped pedestals. On the face of the base facing northwest there is a sculpture depicting God on a throne, surrounded by angels The following are photographs of the bas-reliefs.

Its prime foundations were the Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w, the Gniezno Cathedral and the Pozna≈Ñ Cathedral (later re-built in different styles). Polish Romanesque architecture was influenced by the Polish Pre-Romanesque style. Most of Romanesque buildings in Poland can be found in Greater Poland, Kuyavia, Silesia and Lesser Poland regions. Many Polish Romanesque buildings represent the characteristic Brick Romanesque style due to limited stone resources. Majority of these buildings are churches, rotundas and chapels.

The author asserts that all culture and civilization of Russia and Eastern Slavs in general, including political institutions, social order, scientific and technological advances, have their ultimate origin in the Western Civilization and its creative potential. These achievements were culturally imported through imitation, emulation, influence of Western element in Russia (dynastic and demographic) and import of technology and, in contemporary times, industrial espionage. The author claims that not a single contribution of science, arts, technology and other aspect of Western civilization has its origin in Russia and that every alleged cultural and scientific achievement of Russia from its late medieval inception to the Space Race has been a copy of prior Western achievements. The book was well received by critics in its era.

The hospital offers a wide array of services. Services including a specially designed senior services including a Senior ER and an Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) Unit. History In 1951, the hospital opened in Hialeah in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida. A Seventh-day Adventist minister, Elder W. 0. Reynolds, then pastor of the Miami Temple church, bought a block of land, with a down payment of $5,000 and a mortgage for $45,000. The hospital was set up in the largest of three buildings on the property, with doctors' offices, laboratory and X ray and maternity in the others. The medical staff began with Dr. L. L. Andrews, an Adventist physician of long practice in Miami and Dr. A. W. McCorkle, whose home was Lake Worth, Florida, and began his practice at the Hialeah Hospital in December, 1951. By 1956 the original 30-bed capacity was inadequate, and financial resources were sufficient to begin a program of expansion. At that time six additional patient rooms were added, and the capacity was increased to 50 beds. The addition included a large main nursing station and a surgery unit consisting of three operating rooms and a central supply room. The doctors' building, which houses the offices and examining rooms of four physicians, was built at the same time. As dramatic growth elevated Hialeah to the eight largest city in the State of Florida, Hialeah Hospital has grown to be one of the largest privately owned hospitals in the state. Due to the rapid influx of Hispanic-Americans, the hospital became largely bilingual in both Spanish and English. Services Hialeah Hospital, part of Tenet Healthcare's Florida region, has been serving the medical and health care needs of central to north Miami-Dade County since 1951.

Monument 17697 in the Estonian Kultuurim√§lestiste riiklik register A hiis is a term in Estonian used to denote a sacred natural site, often a tree covered hilltop. History of hiis scholarship The written use of the term hiis is first recorded in 1694 in a Christian catechism against the breaking of the First Commandment. In 18th century Christian writings the term was used generally to refer to pagan cult buildings, as well as any supposed creatures inhabiting such a place. The term hiis regained importance during the emergence of Estonian identity and nationalism during the late 18th and 19th C. (see also Estonian nationalism). Estonian language scholars began to take an interest in their own culture -early etymological attributions of the word included a connection to the Egyptian Isis (Christfried Ganander, 1789), or to the Estonian Hiid [giant] (Kristjan Jaak Peterson, 1822) - both used the term to refer to a creature or deity, not a place. The term was also used as a prefix to refer to supernatural creatures. In the early 20th century the term began to be used for places, such as groves, thought to be the sites of pagan worship -these descriptions of hiis sites could be colorful and idealised, heavily influenced by Estonian nation-identity building. This reintroduction caused a self-reinforcing stereotype to develop in the body of the Estonian people. More serious attempts at scientific study of hiis sites began in the late 19th C. and continued in the 20th C. Jaan Jung claimed, on the basis of his collection of folklore, that hiis were hilltop sacrificial sites, which drew people from distance for the rituals done there. Jung also collected data on pre-historic sites in Estonia he identified as hiis. In the early 20th C. a hiis was taken by scholars to be a forested hilltop site generally, but could also refer to bogs, or even flat ground. Towards the mid 20th century, researchers such as Oskar Loorits, began to view hiis sites as having some connection to the dead, supported by parallels in Uralic folklore. This view matched a pattern in other contemporary scholarship that placed importance on death or cults of the dead as being of great importance in development of religious activities. However poor datability of folklore stories led to all such sites being lumped under \\"pre-historic religion\\" with not further insights. In the second half of the 20th C. the primary method of research was linguistic analysis and etymology - though the word hiis is not known to have any parallel in other terms relating to trees, the usage has been analysed to refer to forests, thickets, single notable tree, or supernatural creatures. Linguistic connections to the Sami terms sii'da or siei'de [sanctury or altar] were explored but could not be supported; connection to the Germanic hii√∞i or hii√ûi ['side' or 'part', can also mean 'nest'] were also considered. Excavative archaeology of hiis sites has been done. Generally the sites show no evidence of habitation, with finds being generally rare also. notes three types of sites attributed to be hiis: #Hills, typically prominent or anomalous, often the sites include stone graves - he considers such sites may have been common during the late Bronze and early Iron Age. #Plain sites, lacking any distinguishing feature - associated with nearby (<2 km) settlements, and lacking any connection to dates before the late Iron Age. #\\"Hidden sites\\" - places in isolated locations such as bogs - in (limited) references in Estonian folklore journeys to such places were connected with personal journeys focused on healing (pilgrimage). Jonuks considers that the hilltop sites were abandoned as religious practices changed. Relationship with Christian church Some Christian churches in Estonia are suspected to have been built on formerly sacred sites - this includes two churches on Saaremaa Island (Valjala Church and P√∂ide Church). The subject is (as of 2011) poorly researched; however churches established in the 13th C. are known to be built in association with cemeteries that date to pre-historic period (late Iron Age).

It dates to the 18th dynasty reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. The painting depicts an elegantly dressed woman with much jewelry. She holds her head upright and faces straight ahead, her right arm is bent and held up, her left is held at hip height. In her left hand she holds a Menit. Her white garment is slightly translucent and in many places her body can be seen underneath it. Her wig is finely worked with a crown of flowers on top. A small perfume cone on top of her head is made of grease or fat. As a symbol it indicates Tjepu's membership in the upper layer of society. Her name and role as \\"Lady of the House\\" are inscribed behind her head. The complete image showed Tjepu behind Nebamun, her son. Nebamun shared the grave with another sculptor, Ipuki. The depiction of the mother in this position is unusual, as most graves depict the owner's wife in this location. Perhaps this diversion from usual practice indicates a special connection between Nebamun and Tjepu. The space was probably free for the mother because Nebamun married the widow of Ipuki (and made use of his grave) and she was already depicted with Ipuki. Son and mother stand before a shrine, where they bring an offering for the Beautiful Festival of the Valley in honour of the deity Amun. In accordance with tradition, Tjepu is not shown at her real age, but in an idealised, youthful form. The image is dated to the late 18th Dynasty, in the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III (1390-1353 BC). The clothing of Tjepu conforms to the fashion of this time. It was painted on the plaster of the walls of the tomb. The image entered the Brooklyn Museum in 1916 as part of the collection of Charles Edwin Wilbour, where it remains a key piece of the ancient Egyptian collection to this day (inventory number 65.197). Thus it has been the title image of catalogues of the collection since 1999 and also appeared on the title page of the catalogue edited for the travelling exhibition of pieces from the Brooklyn Museum in Berlin in 1976.

As a consolidation Act, it did not change the substantive law, although certain Acts were amended and repealed.  Background  This was a consolidation Act which brought together a number of enactments on petroleum. It dealt with rights and licences to search for and get petroleum; the application of criminal and civil law to offshore activities; authorisations for submarine pipelines; and the decommissioning of offshore installations and pipelines. The main Acts which were to be consolidated were the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934; the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975; the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982; and the Petroleum Act 1987, Parts I and II. The Act vested all rights to the UK‚Äôs petroleum resources in the Crown; a right first established by the Petroleum Production Act 1934 (24 & 25 Geo. 5 c. 36). It also established the right to grant licenses to ‚Äòsearch and bore for and get‚Äô petroleum, to the Oil and Gas Authority; this was through the retrospective application of the Energy Act 2016. The Act also made provision for the abandonment of offshore installations and pipelines. The Act also puts into statute the objective of maximising the economic recovery of the UK‚Äôs offshore oil and gas resources (by means of the Infrastructure Act 2015). The Act repealed in their entirety the Petroleum Production Act 1934 (24 & 25 Geo. 5 c. 36) and the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. (1975 c. 74). It also amended the Petroleum Act 1987 (1987 c. 12) Parts I and II concerning the abandonment of Offshore Installations and the licensing of petroleum production. Provisions Part I Petroleum (sections 1 to 9) Section 4 has further clauses on licence provisions. Section 50 of the Infrastructure Act 2015 appended this section. It defines 'associated hydraulic fracturing' as more than 1,000 cubic metres of fluid per stage, or more than 10,000 cubic metres of fluid in total. In addition, conditions were attached that mean no fracking can take place at a depth shallower than 1,000 meters, and that soil and air monitoring must be put in place. The regulations state that \\"The associated hydraulic fracturing will not take place within protected groundwater source areas\\". 'Protected groundwater source area' does not appear to be defined. Part II Offshore activities Section 10 applied UK criminal law to acts or omissions which takes place on, under or above an offshore installation which would constitute an offences under UK criminal law. Section 11 applied UK civil law to acts or omissions which takes place on, under or above an offshore installation which would constitute an offences under UK civil law.

It depicts a Soviet military officer armed with a TT pistol who is raising his unit for an attack during World War II. This work is regarded as one of the most iconic Soviet World War II photographs, yet neither the date nor the subject is known with certainty. According to the most widely accepted version, the photograph depicts junior politruk , minutes before his death on 12 July 1942, in Voroshilovgrad Oblast, Ukraine. History Over the years Alpert gave several contradictory versions of the event, with dates ranging from autumn 1941 to 1943. However, it is unlikely that it is a 1943 photograph, as the M43 tunic with shoulder boards is not being worn, and the collar differs from that on the M43. He was consistent in that he did not know the officer's name, and that the photograph's title kombat (\\"commander of a battalion\\") was likely inaccurate ‚Äì after he took it, he overheard that \\"the kombat is killed\\" and tentatively associated this message with the subject of the photograph. After the war Alpert received numerous letters claiming identification of the officer, but only one was confirmed by a joint investigation by Komsomolskaya Pravda and administration of Lugansk Oblast undertaken in the 1970s. According to this reconstructed version, Yeryomenko was the political commissar in his unit. When the commander was wounded, he took command and raised the unit for a counterattack against the German offence. He died within minutes after that. Legacy The photograph was reused in numerous publications, sculptures, artworks and commercial products, both in the Soviet Union and abroad.

Khofe alaei becomes easier to read than the original Zakhireye Khwarazmshahi. The Khafi Alayee is a pocket book so that a reader can easily carry it in a journey as manual of emergency medicine. Khoffi Alayee, means Alayee Book, because it was dedicated to AlƒÅ ud-Dƒ´n Atsiz, - Alayee, the young prince of Khwarazmian dynasty (died 1156).  Contents  The Khoffi Alayee was originally written in two parts so that physicians could put each part in one of his boots while he was on traveling by horse. Therefore, this book is a prototype of what is today called a pocket book. The first part has two articles: the first containing sixteen chapters and the second seven chapters. The second part has seven articles with 23 chapters. The second part is about etiology of diseases, treatment as well as personal hygiene. Gorgani in the introduction of this book announced that the contents would be the essential practical emergency topics. Gorgani wrote that medical knowledge can be divided into two parts: theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge. Practical knowledge further divides into branches but the most fundamental is personal hygiene. Gorgani wrote that another important task of the physician is to predict and identify the disease (prognosis), the diagnosis of the patient's condition and course of the disease and the patient's life expectancy. Gorgani wrote that the theoretical science must be evidence based and helps to distinguish the normalities and abnormalities of the patient. Also, if someone was sick, then the duty of physician is to start the medical procedures for treatment of the patient with the: prescribe directives, regulation of nutrition till proper cure. The scientific part of the book itself.  Linguistic study  As a frequently used scientific Persian medical textbook of its own time, the text also has socio-linguistic peculiarities that are attractive for linguistic researchers. For example, in Khofe Alayee in the case of a patient that has mild fever it states \\"To release patient from temperature, the home must be cooled down and the patient would be worn a dresses which allows the cold air can reach into his lungs, not reach to his body.\\" The word of the home and the patient both are in passive form, but the cold air is active and can reach into his lungs. From the viewpoints of a linguistic researcher the above-mentioned sentence reflects the writers vision and shows how the patient is objectified. The words of the home and the suitable dresses of the patient is a reflection of the socioeconomic situation of the patient. In fact the correct name of this book is \\"Khofe alaei\\" because in Arabic language khof means boot and khofe means related to boot. As mentioned above, physicians and other readers would put the books in their boots while traveling so that the books be near their hands (such as pocket book of our time).A Research Conducted on the Life and Works of Hakim Sayyid Esmail Jurjani, Mohammad Reza Shams Ardekani, Fariborz Moatar.

She was one of only two (the other being Elizabeth Johnson) who submitted schemes with the aim of receiving a reward under the 1714 Longitude Act. Life and career She was born in York and baptised in 1686 and died in London in 1743. Her parents, Priscilla and Robert Squire, were wealthy and influential. Squire moved to London in 1720 where, although involved in litigation and imprisoned for debt for three years, she used her influential connections to pursue her religiously-based longitude project and the circulation of her book, A Proposal to Determine our Longitude (two editions, 1742 and 1743) She also sent copies to Rome in the hope of gaining the support of Pope Benedict XIV. Squire was never married. She was determined to have her ideas heard, despite being a woman. She included in her book a letter that she wrote to Sir Thomas Hanmer in 1733 in which she stated, \\"‚ÄòI do not remember any Play-thing, that does not appear to me a mathematical Instrument; nor any mathematical Instrument, that does not appear to me a Play-thing: I see not, therefore, why I should confine myself to Needles, Cards, and Dice\\". Hanmer was one of the original Commissioners appointed by the 1714 Longitude Act and his response, also printed in Squire's book, indicated that \\"‚Äòthat you are to expect to lye under some Prejudice upon account of your Sex\\". Although her project was impractical, she gained the ear of a number of influential individuals, including Hans Sloane and Abraham de Moivre. She remained convinced to the end that she deserved a reward for her work. An obituary in the Daily Post referred to her as ‚Äúa Lady excellently well vers‚Äôd in Astronomy, Philosophy, and most Parts of polite Literature‚Äù. Longitude proposal Squire's proposals to determine longitude at sea drew on contemporary astronomy and other learned traditions, as well as heavily depending on her religious world view. Her books outlined a scheme that involved dividing the heavens into more than a million segments as well as a sidereal clock fixed to the position of the Star of Bethlehem at the birth of Jesus. Similarly religiously motivated searches were \\"not uncommon\\" at the time. The clock was intended to announce the time from church steeples, and she also discussed the use of marine buoys (described as artificial sea creatures) to aid mapping. When Pope Benedict XIV received Squire's communication he asked the Bologna Academy of Sciences to assess it. Their response was not positive, although they did indicate that women should be encouraged to study mathematical sciences. Squire's work was not considered within any of the minuted meetings of the British Board of Longitude and it has in the 20th century been dismissed as one of the many \\"nutty solutions\\" circulating at the time. More recently, scholars have started to take her contribution, and the responses of her contemporaries, more seriously in order to better understand the scientific and religious cultures of the period, and the importance of gender and social class in gaining a voice in debates.

It is similar to the V√©lo'v service in Lyon or V√©lib' in Paris, and using the same bicycles and stations as used in Dublin, Vienna, and Brussels. Its purpose is to cover the small and medium daily routes within the city in a climate-friendly way, eliminating the pollution, roadway noise, and traffic congestion that motor vehicles create. A Valenbisi station Operation The city council and JCDecaux manage and maintain the system. To use it, users must acquire a yearly membership. Currently the network consists of more than 275 stations to lend and return over 2750 bicycles distributed throughout the system. The stations are situated through most of the flat areas of the city with a distance of around 300 to 400 metres between each one, with many situated next to public transport stops to allow for intermodal use. Metro Stations usually have signs pointing to the locations of nearest Valenbisi stations. The bikes can be lent from, and returned to, any station in the system, making it suitable for one-way travel. Each station has between 15 and 30 parking slots to fix and lock bicycles, but in highly transited areas many stations may be close together. Subscription Use of the system is based on membership, and users can subscribe online or by visiting a service office. The Valenbisi member cards are only sent to addresses in Valencia in an attempt to prevent tourists from using the system.http://www.valenbisi.es/Abonate Stations Bike stations have generally replaced on-street car or motorcycle parking spaces, though others were placed on large pedestrian areas. Each station includes a long series of docks for bikes, with a computerized pylon at one end for completing transactions. Financing The system is paid for mostly by local car drivers with an on-street parking control system, distributed throughout much of the densely populated inner city. This money, about ‚Ç¨1 million annually, is paid to the system operator. The yearly user fee is ‚Ç¨29,12.

He shared the tomb with another sculptor named Nebamun, with whom he may have worked. Nebamun probably married Ipuki's widow and gained access to his tomb for this reason. In the grave Ipuki is depicted in front of his wife. Whether he worked on the tomb himself is unclear. The joint tomb is the last tomb of an artist in the Valley of the Nobles at Thebes; later Theban artists were buried at Deir el-Medina, where the artisans who worked on the graves lived.

This is one of the first comic books in the world to be coloured with the hyperflat technique, and printed using hexachrome, a six-color printing process. Two earth-bound children, brother and sister, Kite and Miriam have been chosen to become carriers of the Fej Farok,a powerful parasite capable of traveling through parallel universes. One day they are captured by strange Black Creatures and their destinies part ways. Now Kite, who is the younger of the two, must undertake a dangerous journey in search of his sister through a new and hostile world, a dazzling planet that its inhabitants call Lumina. Lumina is a project midway between Sci-FI and Fantasy. The project tells the story of the journey and growing up of Kite and Miriam through an imaginative evolution of amazing environments. Fraternal love, ecology and respect for all living things are the backbone themes of this story. Plot The planet, Fej Farok, brother and sister Miriam and Kite. The Fej Farok is a parasite and a deity, which can cross the membrane that separates the parallel universes, adjusting their balance if needed. It‚Äôs a creature made up of two parts ‚Äì Fej and Farok ‚Äì and each of them is hosted by two bodies, two porters, elected among the descendants of the Abyssals, very intelligent and ancient creatures that form the spiritual and religious side of Lumina. When the Fej Farok picks two individuals, the chosen ones, it literally owns their bodies and gives them unimaginable power. They become Fej (Yin), and Farok (Yang). The dawn of time and Fej Farok ruled the planet Lumina. However, the ambition and the thirst for conquest of Fej were great: he wished to conquer all the planets in the Universe, in all possible realities, using their immense powers. To achieve his goal, he needed his half Farok, which, however, did not share the destructive plans and conquerors of the counterparty. Fej so he decided to kill Farok. A few moments before being struck by the sword of Fej, Farok could be projected on a planet, of all possible worlds, in a time among all possible times. In just a few seconds to choose two innocent creatures and give them his share of the parasite and its powers. On that planet, the Earth, in the present, Fej would not be able to find the completion of his power to achieve his evil purposes. Earth, today: Miriam and Kite are two lively kids, as many of their age, divinding their time between school and friends. They‚Äôre orphans. Miriam looks after her little brother, who‚Äôs not really the easy kind, though. Miriam is a very nice young girl and careful sister but at times she can be a little bit too much harsh with herself and the people around her. Kite is a real force of nature, lazy at school and on the everyday tasks and a real daredevil on the streets while practicing his favorite hobby, the Parkour: he‚Äôs a young, flamboyant energy mix. For some time now, the two have been sharing a strange hallucination: they were both still, hand in hand, in a kind of a mesmerized state, staring at a strange geometric flame containing an immense, very brightly lit opening in its very center. Kite and Miriam have never given too much weight to these visions, till one day, at school, they got suddenly surrounded by very menacing mysterious Black Creatures. Frightened to the bones, they tried to run away, but they soon found themselves in the strange place they‚Äôd seen in their common visions. They got pushed inside the flame and from that moment on their life would‚Äôve never been the same. When they wake up, Miriam and Kite are right in the midst of a bloody battle between the Black Creatures and a powerful warrior. Above their heads a giant sprawling body materializes and grows exponentially, destroying everything around him. Behind them, a strange man in a hood speaking an incomprehensible strange language, is repeating a magical chant that sounds like an ancient rite. In no time, the two kids got parted. As is Miriam taken by a Black Creature, Kite stays on the scene, firmly clinging to the strong arm of the warrior. The gigantic creature has disappeared. Now Kite is alone, confused but very determined to find his sister. He will face a long and tough journey, alongside with and fighting against extraordinary creatures. His goal is to find Miriam and get out of that vast and dazzling planet Lumina, as the fearsome warrior Oleg and the abysmal Nohe call it.

Rangtong (; \\"empty of self- nature\\") is a philosophical term in Tibetan Buddhism that is used to distinguish the majority Madhyamaka teaching on the meaning of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ or \\"emptiness\\", namely that all phenomena are empty of an enduring and/or unchanging essence or \\"self,\\" and that this emptiness is not an absolute reality, but a mere nominal characterisation of phenomena. It is related to the prasangika approach, which argues that no syllogistic forms of reasoning should be used to debate the notion of inherent existence, but only arguments which show the logical implications and absurdity of positions based upon inherent existence. This position is the mainstream Gelugpa interpretation of Madhyamaka, one of the main Mahayana schools, which dominates Vajrayana Buddhism. Shentong (, also transliterated zh√§ntong or zhentong; literally \\"other-emptiness\\") is a position within Tibetan Madhyamaka. It applies ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ in a specific way, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality (Paramarthasatya) is \\"non-dual Buddhajnana\\" and \\"empty\\" () only of \\"other,\\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty and \\"truly existing.\\" This absolute reality is described by positive terms, an approach which helps \\"to overcome certain residual subtle concepts\\" and \\"the habit [...] of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.\\" It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner \\"to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.\\" Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292‚Äì1361), who identified absolute reality with the Buddha-nature. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism. After this suppression various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. The 19th century saw a revival of Shentong- views, and continued with the Rim√© movement. Nowadays Shentong is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the Jonang school, although it is also taught by the Sakya and Kagyu schools, where it is identified with centerless awareness. Etymology The term rangtong is not an autonym but rather arose from the shentong theorist Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, who coined the term \\"shentong\\" to characterise his own teachings and \\"rangtong\\" to refer to the teachings he opposed. Shentong literally means \\"other-emptiness\\", \\"empty\\" () of \\"other\\" (), i.e., empty of all qualities other than its own inherent existence. Yet, the term shentong also refers to Yogacara teachings, or Yogacara Madhyamaka, which includes the teachings of ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita. In the Gelugpa understanding of the Svatantrika-Prasa·πÖgika distinction, Yogacara Madhyamaka is labeled as svatantrika, and set against a strict prasa·πÖgika approach which rejects any inherent existence. Another translation of shentong is \\"extrinsic emptiness,\\" a term which is also used to refer to \\"Great MƒÅdhyamaka\\" (dbu ma chen po), a term which has also been used by Klong chen pa and Mipham to refer to Prasa·πÖgika Madhyamaka, and Tsongkhapa has also used this term. Rangtong Rangtong is the majority Tibetan teaching on the nature of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ or \\"emptiness\\", namely that all phenomena are empty of a self-nature in both the relative and absolute sense, without positing anything beyond that. This position is the mainstream Tibetan interpretation of Madhyamaka, especially by the followers of Prasa·πÖgika MƒÅdhyamaka. Tsongkhapa (1357‚Äì1419), who also wrote in response to shentong, is the most outspoken defendant of rangtong. He saw emptiness as a consequence of dependent designation, the teaching that no thing or phenomenon has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence upon conceptual designation by a conscious mind. (See Designation & \\"Conventional Truth\\".) Tsongkhapa's view on \\"ultimate reality\\" is condensed in the sort text In Praise of Dependent ArisingAlexander Berzin, In Praise of Dependent Arising c.q. In Praise of RelativityRobert Thurman, Praise of Buddha Shakyamuni for his teaching of Relativity. The Short Essence of Eloquence c.q. The Essence of Eloquency. It states that \\"things\\" do exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence: This means that conventionally things do exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing them as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence.Susan Kahn, The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness Tsongkhapa: It also means that there is no \\"transcendental ground,\\" and that \\"ultimate reality\\" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind. Susan Kahn further explains: Shentong Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, an early Tibetan exponent of the shentong view. Philosophy 33 Shentong views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is \\"empty\\" () only of \\"other\\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty. This absolute reality is the \\"ground or substratum\\" which is \\"uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.\\" Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature. The shentong-view is related to the RatnagotravibhƒÅga sutra and the Yogacara- Madhyamaka synthesis of ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind. Hookham explains the Shentong position, referring to her Kagyu teacher Khenpo Tsultrim's Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness. Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches: * \\"Sravaka meditation on non-self\\" - meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self; * \\"Cittamatra-approach\\" - meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver; * \\"Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach\\" - meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any \\"substance\\"; * \\"Prasangika-Madhyamaka approach\\" - meditation on \\"the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness.\\" In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned; * Shentong (Yogacara Madhyamaka) - meditation on Paramarthasatya (\\"Absolute Reality\\"), Buddhajnana, which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as \\"truly existing.\\" This approach helps \\"to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,\\" and \\"the habit - fostered on the earlier stages of the path - of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.\\" It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner \\"to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.\\" Origins and development The notion of sentong grew out the Tibetan attempts to reconcile the contradiction between the Madhyama stance on the emptiness of phenomena, and the later notion of an eternal Buddha-nature. The earliest shentong views are usually asserted to have been presented in a group of treatises variously attributed jointly to Asanga and MaitreyanƒÅtha, especially in the treatise known as the Unsurpassed Continuum (Uttaratantra≈õƒÅstra, also called the RatnagotravibhƒÅga), and in a body of MƒÅdhyamaka treatises attributed to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna (e.g., the DharmadhƒÅtustava, \\"In praise of the Dharmadhatu\\"). The first exposition of a shentong view is sometimes attributed to ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita ( 725‚Äì788), but most scholars argue that his presentation of Madhyamaka thought is more accurately labeled YogƒÅcƒÅra-SvƒÅtantrika-Madhyamaka. The eleventh-century Tibetan master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, a student of the Kashmiri scholar Somanatha, was possibly the first Tibetan master to articulate a shentong view, after his experiences during a KƒÅlacakra retreat. Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292‚Äì1361), who was originally a Sakya-trained lama, and joined the Jonang school with which shentong is strongly associated. In 1321 Dolpopa visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time, and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje (1284‚Äì1339) about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his shentong method. Dolpopa claimed to have extraordinary insights, and his meditational experience seems to have played a great role in the development of his shentong-stance. Dolpopa developed a new philosophical vocabulary, based on Sanskrit and Tibetan, to express his insights, presenting provisional statements on absolute reality and Buddha-nature as statements of definitive meaning, which didn't require further interpretation. Ch√∂drak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama (1454‚Äì1506), and the Sakya scholar Shakya Chokden (, 1428‚Äì1507) were also important proponents of a shentong view. In the Jonang tradition, TƒÅranƒÅtha [1575‚Äì1635] is second in importance only to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen himself. He was responsible for the short-lived renaissance of the school as a whole in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and of the widespread revitalization of the shentong theory in particular.Stearns 1999 p.68 TƒÅranƒÅtha wrote a commentary on the Heart Sutra which asserts that the Sutra, and praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ, teaches the Shentong view.Tomlin 2017 After the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Shakya Chokden by the Tibetan government in the seventeenth century, various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. In particular, the eighth Tai Situpa (1700‚Äì1774) and Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698‚Äì1755)‚ÄîKarma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas, respectively, and close colleagues‚Äîwere very instrumental in reviving shentong among their sects. Also instrumental was Situ Panchen (1700‚Äì1774), senior court chaplain in the Kingdom of Derge, a student of Katok Tsewang Norbu. \\"In the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Shentong theories in the next century. This revival was continued by Jamgon Kongtrul, a nineteenth-century ecumenical (rim√©) scholar and forceful exponent of shentong. shentong views were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. Criticisms and repression Shentong views have often come under criticism by followers of all four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, but particularly by the Gelug. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism. \\"Exclusive Rangtongpas\\", as the contemporary western Kagyu scholar S.K. Hookham would call them, have claimed that shentong views are inconsistent with the basic MahƒÅyƒÅna teaching of emptiness, because Shentongpas posit an absolute. They sometimes label shentong Madhyamaka \\"eternalistic Madhyamaka.\\" The great fourteenth-century Sakya master Buton Rinchen Drub (1290‚Äì1364) was very critical of shentong views. Gyaltsab Je and Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama, two of Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa's primary disciples, were also particularly critical of the shentong views of their time. Among Kagyupas and Nyingmapas, the noted nineteenth-century Nyingma lama Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso wrote works both supportive and critical of shentong positions, as did Miky√∂ Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama.

Early life  Campbell was the second son of Duncan Campbell of Whitestone, Kintyre in Argyll. His mother Barbara was a daughter of Hector McAlester of Loup, Argyll. He was probably educated at Glasgow in 1690. He was an officer in Dutch service from about 1704 to 1708 and became major in 4th (Scots) Horse Guards in 1711, and a lieutenant colonel in 1712. He was appointed gentleman of the buttery in 1721 and retained the post for the rest of his life. Career Campbell's family were supporters of the 2nd Duke of Argyll, who arranged his unopposed return at the 1722 British general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Buteshire. The seat, whose patron was the county's hereditary sheriff the Earl of Bute, was an alternating constituency with Caithness. Buteshire was not represented in the following Parliament, and Campbell filled a vacancy in the Elgin Burghs at a by election on 16 March 1728. The Elgin Burghs were dominated by the Earls of Kintore and the Earls of Findlater. Their rival candidates had contested the 1722 result with an election petition which took two years to resolve in favour of John Campbell (1st cousin of the Duke of Argyll, supported by Findlater) over the Jacobite candidate William Fraser. By 1727, the 3rd Earl of Kintore was keen to regain some of the privileges which had been stripped from his father after the latter's support for the 1715 Jacobite rising, and sought to win favour with the Duke of Argyll. He therefore supported Argyll's preferred candidate William Steuart, who was returned unopposed at the 1727 British general election. However, Steuart was also returned for the Ayr Burghs, for which he chose to sit, resulting in the by-election in March 1728 when Campbell was returned unopposed. Campbell was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth in 1733 and held the post for life. At the 1734 British general election, he was again returned unopposed for Buteshire. He was promoted to brigadier- general in 1735 and major-general in 1739. He followed the Duke of Argyll's Whig politics and voted with the Government until Argyll went into opposition in 1739. Campbell then voted against the Spanish convention. Buteshire was not represented in the next Parliament and he was unable to find a seat at the 1741 British general election. In 1743, he was promoted to Lieutenant-general.

(2009). Somatoparaphrenia: a body delusion. A review of the neuropsychological literature. Experimental Brain Research, 192:3, 533-551 The failure to acknowledge, for example, a limb, may be expressed verbally or as a pattern of neglect. The limb may also be attributed to another person, a delusion known as somatoparaphrenia. However, they can be shown their limb and this error is temporarily corrected.Feinberg, T., Venneri, A., Simone, A.M., et al. (2010). The neuroanatomy of asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, 81, 276-281Bottini, Gabriella; Bisiach, Edoardo; Sterzi, Roberto; Vallar, Giuseppe (2002): ‚ÄúFeeling touches in someone else's hand.‚Äù NeuroReport 13 (2), 249‚Äì252. Some authors have focused on the prevalence of hemispatial neglect in such patients. Asomatognosia is the inability to feel, recognize, or be conscious of one's own specific body parts or bodily conditions (Whishaw, 2015). Generally, asomatognosia often arises from damage to the right parietal lobe (Whishaw, 2015). Evidence indicates that damage to the right hemisphere often results from a stroke or pre- existing hemispatial neglect, or inattention to the left visual field (Antoniello, 2016) (Keenan, 2004). Individuals who suffer from somatoparaphrenia, a specific form of asomatognosia, ignore or deny ownership of a body part contralateral to the brain lesion (Feinberg, 1990). Although this condition can affect one or both sides of the body, most patients exhibit the inability to recognize limbs/body parts (i.e. arm, leg, head, breast) on the left side of their body as their own (Keenan, 2004). While individuals with asomatognosia typically suffer large lesions across several temporoparietal sectors, those with somatoparaphrenia also suffer lesions in the right medial and orbitofrontal regions of the brain (Feinberg 2010).  Patient cases  In most commonly observed instances, individuals with this condition fail to recognize and sense their left arm after suffering lesions to the right hemisphere (Keenan, 2004). In one specific instance, a patient suffering from asomatognosia tried to throw her own left arm into a garbage can because she believed it was her husband's arm repeatedly falling on her and disrupting her sleep (Keenan, 2004). Even when patients are told that the body part belongs to them, many will deny the reality and remain firm in their belief that it is not a part of them. There is a case in which a patient with severe asomatognosia had the ability to use his right hand to trace his paralyzed left arm to his own left shoulder, but still failed to acknowledge that the left arm belonged to him (Keenan, 2004). Overall, there is an interesting phenomenon in which individuals will claim that the body part belongs to someone of the opposite gender within their family. For example, women with asomatognosia tend to claim that their left arm belongs to a man (i.e. their husband) while men claim their arm belongs to a woman, such as his daughter or wife. There also exist patients that treat the arm as a child or small animal. (Keenan, 2004)  Related conditions  In addition to instances of asomatognosia in which patients deny ownership of a specific part, this condition is also associated with the following: anosognosia (unawareness or denial of illness), anosodiaphoria (indifference to illness), autopagnosia (inability to localize and name body parts), and asymbolia for pain (absence of typical reactions to pain). Out of these varieties of asomatognosia, autopagnosia is the only one in which an individual struggles to recognize the right side of their body due to lesions in the left parietal cortex (Whishaw, 2015).

Coconut is a cash crop on the island, which is converted to derivatives such as copra and coconut cream in tinned form, and also exported. Originally, the island had a profusion of coconut trees reflected in the country's name, Niue, in the local language. The Niue Development Board is responsible for planning and execution of schemes of agricultural produce, including coconut and related products. History The name of the island \\"Niue\\" is the local name for coconut. The coconut is not indigenous to the island or any of the Pacific Islands. It has been stated that it could be from Central America. It has been growing on the island since historical times. One view, by a local man, is that the plant drifted ashore and was picked up and planted at Mutalau. It could have drifted due to trade winds. Another view is that voyagers carried them in their canoes and planted them in the islands, which they visited during journey. According to local legend two men, Levei-matagi and Levei-fualoto, who travelled from Tutuila carrying gifts of coconuts given to them by the local chief, came to the island and called it the island Niue-fekai, after the name of the coconut niue. Its growth is more prominent in the island's lower terrace rather than the interior, and in villages on the eastern side; Mutalau to Lakepa on the northern part of the island account for its largest plantations. In the 1880s, coconut plantations had been created by clearing half the area of the island. A coconut cream factory closed in 1991, subsequent to hurricane damage. As of 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization reports 3,200 tonnes of coconut production, valued at INT$385,830, Note: User must define \\"Niue\\" under the \\"area\\" parameter and \\"2013\\" under the \\"year\\" parameter. from an area of with an average yield of 9,697 hectograms per ha (969.7 tons/ha). Local uses A coconut with little pulp is called kola and pona-niu. The stem on which the nut grows is called the loholoho, the flowering stage is called tome, the young shoot is named uruka, midrib of the leaf is called palelafe, the rib of each separate branch is known as kaniu. As the fruits start maturing the sponge that develops inside is called who-niu. The branches of the tree are used for making brooms, combs, etc. The dried leaf itself is used to make thatch for roofs, baskets (kato), and mats (potu). The wood of the tree is tough and heavy, and is used to make polished walking sticks. The white pulp of the nut is extracted and pressed to make coconut oil called puke-lolo, a sometimes scented oil which is used for massaging the body before taking a bath. The fibrous part of the coconut, called pulu, is used for making rope or sinnet (tona) and strings (aho). Sinnet is considered to be very strong and durable. Coconut shells, after cleaning and polishing are used for making vessels such as a water bottle. Dried coconut or copra is exported from the island. The names used in the island while presenting the coconut at one of the festivals is Fua-alu (Ulu-Ola). The coconut tree is climbed by young boys of age 8 and above, and the fruit is felled. The coconut is then sheared at the top end with a pointed rod of wood fixed on the ground. After the surface skin is removed and an opening is made to drink the coconut water contained in it. The flesh inside the coconut is then scooped out and used in cooking various dishes. The stem of the tree is affixed with a leaf, termed fona, indicating that the tree is preserved for a long time. A guest to the island is presented with a fresh coconut on arrival indicating that he is welcome to enjoy his stay in Niue.

The temples were inhabited from pre-history, by Phoenicians and then by the Greeks and Roman periods.MacGill, Thomas (1839), \\"A handbook, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta\\", p.124. In the 17th century the site belonged to Giovanni Francesco Abela. He had excavated several sites in the whereabouts, and had his country residence in the area. He had originally planned to write his will to the Order, but eventually left his villa, that was used as Malta's first museum, known as Museo di San Giacomo, and the surrounding lands to the Jesuits. The land still belonged to the Jesuits, until their expulsion in the 18th century by the Order when all their land and property was taken by the treasury. The site was excavated during the Order of St. John on the order of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca by archeologist Gio Antonio Barbaro. The temples were then extensively excavated by Sir Themistocles Zammit during the British period. Originally there were three temple complexes, but two of these have been destroyed, and only the site of Kordin III survives. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The temples are located on a plateau overlooking the Grand Harbour, originally called Kortin during the Order of St. John and now Kordin or Corradino. Other megalithic sites in the vicinity include the Hypogeum of ƒ¶al- Saflieni and the Tarxien Temples. Kordin I Kordin I was located on a terrace on the west slopes of Corradino Heights, overlooking Marsa. It consisted of small and irregular rooms, and was poorly preserved when it was discovered. It was first surveyed in the 1880s. The first excavations were made by Antonio Annetto Caruana, and were continued under Themistocles Zammit in 1908, and Thomas Ashby and Thomas Eric Peet in 1909. The temple was open to the elements and aerial bombardment during World War II. Virtually nothing remained by the 1950s, and the temple was completely obliterated after an industrial estate was built on the site in the 1960s. Kordin II Kordin II was located on the northern extent of Corradino, 137 metres away from Kordin I. It was used throughout the entire temple period, since pottery from all phases was found at the site. The chronology was difficult to figure out, and whether the entire building could be dated to the temple period is debatable. The first investigations of Kordin II were undertaken by Cesare Vassallo in 1840. The site was first excavated properly by Antonio Annetto Caruana in 1892, and excavation work continued by Albert Mayer in 1901 and was finished by Thomas Ashby and Thomas Eric Peet in 1908 and 1909. Part of the temple was destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1871 to make way for the ditch of the Corradino Lines, before excavation even began. The temple was further damaged by aerial bombardment during World War II, and no remains of the temple could be seen by the 1950s. In the 1960s, the site was built up as an industrial estate. Kordin III Kordin III is the only temple on Corradino whose remains have survived. It is located just outside the Corradino Lines, close to the Church of St. Anthony of Padua and Mariam Al-Batool Mosque. Site The Kordin III complex consists of two temples. The larger one has a standard 3-apse plan, typical of ƒ†gantija phase design. The temple has a concave facade, with the forecourt and entrance passage to the central court being stone-paved. This stone paving is unique to Kordin III, as this has not been found in any other temples of Malta. Behind the temple are some small rooms, which were possibly used as storerooms but could have also been an irregular minor temple. The first part of the temple is believed to have been built in around 3700 BC, during the Mƒ°arr phase. Most of the structure dates back to the ƒ†gantija phase, and the complex was still in use during the Tarxien phase, when the facade was rebuilt. The site is believed to have been abandoned in around 2500 BC. A 2.75 metre-long trough was found lying across the entrance to the temple's left apse, and this is generally considered as the most notable feature of the site. The trough has seven deep transverse grooves produced by grinding. It is made of hard limestone brought from over 2 kilometres away so it is highly probable that it was for grinding corn (a multiple quern) and contemporary with the temple, rather than for grinding 'deffun', the traditional Maltese roofing material, which would make it considerably more recent. Excavations and recent history The site was cleared from debris by Cesare Vassallo in the 1870s. Antonio Annetto Caruana discovered further clusters of megalithic monuments in the area in 1882, and the site was properly excavated by Thomas Ashby and Thomas Eric Peet in 1909. Other excavations were undertaken by John Davies Evans in 1953 and by David Trump in 1961. A walled enclosure was built around the temple in 1925, and it is kept locked to give it maximum protection. Like Kordin I and II, the temple was also damaged in World War II, but its remains were not built over after the war and can still be seen today. Although in poor condition, the temple is one of the most complete of the minor temples. In 2009, the viability of extending the World Heritage listing to Kordin III was examined. New excavations of the area around the temple began in 2015 by Caroline Malone and a team of students from the University of Malta. The site was managed by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna until 2016, when it was handed to Heritage Malta. It is open to the public by appointment. Kordin IV and V Two other megalithic sites known as Kordin IV and Kordin V reportedly also existed and were obliterated during the 20th century.

The objective of the operation was to destroy the Viet Cong (VC) 2nd Regiment (approximately 2,000 men) believed to be in the area and thereby prevent an attack on the Vinh Thanh Civilian Irregular Defense Group camp. The U.S. forces had the continuing objective of protecting Highway 19 and the base camp of the 1st Cavalry Division at An Khe from harassment by the VC. Background In September 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division, newly arrived in South Vietnam, carved out Camp Radcliff, its base, near the town of An Khe to ensure that Highway 19 which reached from the coast of South Vietnam to the Central Highlands city of Pleiku remained under the control of allied forces. Almost immediately the 1st Cavalry began mounting operations against communist forces in the Vinh Thanh valley, northwest of An Khe. Vinh Thanh Valley was small, approximately long and less than wide, but heavily populated and dominated by the Viet Cong. east of Vinh Thanh Valley was the Suoi Ca Valley. The two valleys were separated by a chain of heavily-forested mountains rising as much as over the river valleys. The soldiers dubbed Suoi Ca Valley \\"Happy Valley\\" (not to be confused with another American-named \\"Happy Valley\\" near the city of Danang). A trail crossing the mountains between the two valleys was named the \\"Oregon Trail.\\" The U.S. estimated that a regiment of main force VC guerrillas controlled Suoi Ca Valley. In late 1965, sweeps through the two valleys by the 1st Cavalry failed to find large numbers of VC. They were believed to have fled the valleys, but to have returned after the 1st Cavalry withdrew to its base. In early May 1966, Montagnard irregulars and U.S. Special Forces soldiers in the Vinh Thanh valley reported clashes and increased activity by the Viet Cong in the area and a possible major attack on 19 May, the birthday of North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh. 1st Cavalry Division commander General John Norton ordered Operation Crazy Horse to preempt the attack and attempt to destroy the VC regiment believed to be in the area. Norton was prepared to dedicate up to five battalions of 1st Cavalry troopers to the task. American soldiers board helicopters at An Khe during Operation Crazy Horse The operation Phase One. The Americans began Operation Crazy Horse with heavy harassing artillery fire designed to disrupt a possible attack on the CIDG camp and to prepare for a helicopter landing. The initial helicopter landing was at Landing Zone Hereford on a ridge overlooking the Vinh Thanh valley and Special Forces camp three miles (5 km) distant. Shortly after landing on May 16, Company B from the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment became engaged with a VC battalion on a ridge near the landing zone. Because of bad weather, little air support was available to the Americans who were surrounded, during a break in the rain Company C 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment was landed and moved to support Company B. After an all-night fight at close quarters, the VC withdrew leaving behind 38 bodies and having killed 28 Americans. Persuaded that they had located the VC regiment, Norton sent in two battalions on May 17 to find and pursue the VC. The 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment landed at Landing Zone Hereford while the 2/12th Cavalry touched down at Landing Zone Horse, in the mountains east of the Vinh Thanh Valley. The strategy was that the Americans would trap the VC between the two battalions, but, after initial firefights, the Americans searched eastward for several days mostly without success. American soldiers fan out from Landing Zone Hereford Last Stand at LZ Zone Hereford. On 21 May, the situation at Landing Zone Hereford had been quiet for several days. Over the protests of the company commander, an under-strength weapons platoon of 20 soldiers was left alone at the landing zone while one company of the 1st Cavalry returned to An Khe and another departed the landing zone by foot on a search and destroy mission. Less than an hour after the platoon was left alone, the VC attacked with mortars followed by an infantry assault. Within the few minutes until reinforcements could arrive, 15 American soldiers and a journalist, Sam Castan, were killed. The VC retired uncontested from the area.Christy, Michael (2012),\\"Last Stand at Landing Zone Hereford\\", Vietnam, http://www.historynet.com/last-stand-at-lz-hereford.htm, accessed 1 May 2015 Phase Two. On May 24, in the wake of the VC attack at Landing Zone Hereford, General Norton changed strategies, called off search and destroy missions temporarily as he no longer wanted his soldiers \\"to go banging around in the enemy's backyard,\\" and attempted instead to encircle the area where the VC were believed to be, cut off their escape routes, and called in artillery and airstrikes while Americans, South Korean, and South Vietnamese military units attempted to ambush VC units presumed to be fleeing the area. The peak allied strength devoted to Operation Crazy Horse was four American, one Vietnamese, one South Korean, and one CIDG (Montagnard with Special Forces advisers) battalions. One of the few significant clashes came on May 26 at Landing Zone Monkey where an American company was briefly under siege and a helicopter was shot down. By the end of May, it was apparent that most of the VC had escaped. Operation Crazy Horse was officially terminated on 5 June. Assessment Despite the failure by the Americans to engage the VC in large battles of attrition, the U.S. declared Operation Crazy Horse a success. The U.S. estimated that 507 VC had been killed at a loss of 83 Americans, 14 South Koreans, 8 South Vietnamese, and an unrecorded number of Montagnards. The operation also revealed, however, a limitation of airmobile warfare in heavily forested mountains. With only a few feasible places where helicopters could land, communist soldiers could anticipate likely landing sites and prepare to contest the landing or ambush the Americans as they fanned out from the landing zone. Three months later the 1st Cavalry was back in Binh Dinh again with Operation Thayer to attempt once again to eliminate North Vietnamese and VC influence in the province.

It is approximately long and flows through Scott Township, Blakely, and Dickson City. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is considered to be impaired by habitat alteration. It is a perennial stream, but experiences some flow loss. A waterfall system known as the Blakely Falls are on the creek, in a post-glacial valley. It also flows through a deep water gap. Channelization work was done on the creek in 1975 by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, which has had the effect of reducing flooding. Hull Creek is a second-order stream with some wetlands in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek. The creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2013, it received a habitat assessment score of 159 on a scale of 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well. Course Lackawanna River, the source of Hull Creek Hull Creek begins in a pond in Scott Township. It flows south-southwest for more than a mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southeast, flowing through a water gap alongside Pennsylvania Route 247 and entering Blakely. After several tenths of a mile, the creek crosses a highway and flows south-southwest in a much smaller valley. After some distance, it enters Dickson City and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Hull Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Hull Creek has no named tributaries. However, it does have one unnamed tributary, which joins the creek near its headwaters. Hydrology Hull Creek is considered to be an impaired waterbody. The cause of the impairment is habitat alteration and the probable source of the impairment is channelization. Additionally, runoff from Pennsylvania Route 347 and residential properties impacts the water quality of the creek in Blakely. The creek loses flow to underground mines. Hull Creek is a perennial stream. A 2013 study found the electrical conductivity of Hull Creek to range from 179.50 to 679.00 micro-Siemens per centimeter, with an average of 283.45 micro-Siemens per centimeter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The creek was found to be slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The dissolved oxygen levels in Hull Creek ranged from 30.80 to 249.02 percent, with an average of 115.69 percent. The average value was within the ideal range, but the minimum and maximum values were not. The concentration of salinity in the creek ranges from 70.95 to 310.00 parts per million, with an average concentration of 136.37 parts per million. All values were within the ideal range. At its mouth, the peak annual discharge of Hull Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 580 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 1260 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 1690 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 3460 cubic feet per second. At the border between Scott Township and Blakely, the peak annual discharge of Hull Creek as a 1 percent chance of reaching 780 cubic feet per second. Upstream of Green Cove Road, it has a 1 percent chance of reaching 710 cubic feet per second. At a private bridge approximately upstream of Green Cove Road, the peak annual discharge has a 1 percent chance of reaching 430 cubic feet per second. A mid-20th-century report estimated the volume of surface seepage into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area was estimated to be 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of seepage is much higher than a number of other streams in the area. Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Hull Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. One of the more prominent waterfalls in the watershed of the Lackawanna River, the Blakely Falls, are on Hull Creek. The Blakely Falls are a \\"picturesque\\" post-glacial gorge cut through sandstone of the lower Llewellyn Formation. The waterfalls on the creek are downstream of US Route 6. For after the waterfall, the creek has a high gradient, with rock ledges, plunge pools, and slides. The headwaters of the creek are in a wetland pond. In the reach near Pennsylvania Route 347, it has a relatively steep gradient and rock ledges are present along it. Heavy erosion and overburden piles are present along the creek further downstream. Channelization work was done on of Hull Creek in Blakely by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources in 1975. This project has substantially reduced flooding. Streambank stabilization projects have been carried out along it in Blakely. The creek is also impacted by historic mining operations downstream of a branch of US Route 6. Upstream of that highway, however, it is relatively undisturbed. The creek flows through an open concrete box culvert in its lower reaches. The culvert becomes closed for its last several hundred feet, downstream to the mouth. A mid-20th-century report found that of the watershed of Hull Creek was on coal measures. A total of of the creek's length was on coal measures. The banks of the creek contain glacial drift, with culm pile debris and eroded material. These materials are picked up by the stream, but the load is too heavy for it to carry, leading to the material to be deposited further downstream, reducing the capacity of the channel. Hull Creek flows through a deep water gap in the Lackawanna synclinorium. The water gap's upper walls contain conglomerate of the Pottsville Formation. However, the floor of the gap instead has a layer of glacial till with a thickness of . The creek also flows through a narrow gorge in the Lackawanna Valley. This gorge is cut through bedrock instead of glacial till. At least three coal beds along the creek have been mined. These are likely the New County Bed, the Dunmore No. 1 Bed, and the Clark Bed. The preglacial valley of Hull Creek is now buried. It has been described as \\"one of the best examples of a preglacial valley buried by glacial deposits\\". The preglacial course flowed through the water gap in a similar manner as its modern course, but at that point turned to the south instead of flowing along its present course. In a 2013 study, the water temperature of Hull Creek was found to range from . The average temperature was . The minimum and maximum temperatures were out of the ideal range, but the average temperature was in the ideal range. Watershed The watershed of Hull Creek has an area of . The part of the watershed that is upstream of the border between Blakely and Scott Township has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Olyphant. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Dalton. The creek also passes through the quadrangle of Carbondale. The creek's watershed is mostly in Scott Township and Blakely. However, small parts of it are in Dickson City and Archbald. Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its watershed is relatively narrow. In the upper reaches of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse and tend to be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau. Hull Creek is a source of flooding in Scott Township. It has also had a history of flooding in Blakely, although a flood control project was installed there in 1975. However, large floods in Scott Township have still caused local inundation of structures along the creek. History Hull Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on October 1, 1992. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1214683. Severe flooding events occurred on Hull Creek in July 1920 and May 1942. However, the most severe flood occurred on May 21, 1947. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Scott Township, Blakely, and Dickson City include protection of Hull Creek in their zoning plans. The rehabilitation of a bridge carrying State Route 1029 over the creek in Scott Township was once planned. Biology The drainage basin of Hull Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In southern Scott Township, Hull Creek is flanked by native trees and understory. However, further downstream, in Blakely, there is virtually no riparian buffer. Beyond this reach, the creek's riparian buffer again contains native trees and understory. At three sites on Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa observed in a sample and the total number of those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96. In the 2013 study, Hull Creek received a habitat assessment score of 159 on a scale of 0 to 200. This puts it barely into the \\"optimal\\" zone (156 to 200).

Description The castle is built in a square formation. The four wings of the castle surrounded the central courtyard. A 54-metre tower provided an entrance to the second floor of the castle. In the corners of the castle were small look-out towers, which stick out from the castle's square shape. The castle basements were used as utility rooms. The underground rooms performed various functions: a chapel, refectory, chapter house, infirmary, chamber of the commander and other specialised rooms. Entries to them lead to the gallery surrounding the courtyard. The second floor included from the side of the courtyard magazines and a granary, and an additional defensive porch within castle walls. By the main tower there is a gate to which access was provided by a former drawbridge. It was a key part of the castle's defense complex. The pre-castle fortification was placed between the town and the castle. History Plan of the Brodnica Castle The building of the Teutonic castle in Brodnica began in the fourteenth century, taking almost a whole century to complete. In 1466, the castle complex became part of the Kingdom of Poland. After a fire in 1550, the rebuilding of the castle was done so by the Starosta Rafa≈Ç Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski. During the Swedish-Polish Wars the castle began to turn into ruins. In 1785, King Frederick II of Prussia ordered do dismantle the ruins, but his orders were soon stopped by Frederick Wilhelm IV. The fate of the palace of Anna Waz√≥wna was sealed by a fire in 1945. The palace was restored in the 1960s. Currently, the castle houses a museum, and the palace a library.

Israel Washburn House is a historic house at 120 Main Street in Orono, Maine. Built in 1840, it is architecturally significant as a fine local example of Greek Revival architecture, and is historically significant as the long-time home of Governor of Maine Israel Washburn, Jr. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Washburn House is located on the east side of Main Street (United States Route 2), on a residential stretch of that road south of downtown Orono that is lined with 19th-century houses. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-gable roof, and a granite foundation. A two-story gabled wing extends northward from the rear of the main block, and there is a carriage house at the rear of the property. Most of the house is sheathed in clapboards; the front facade and the front-facing part of the wing are finished in flushboarding. The building corners are pilastered, supporting an entablature that rings the house. The front facade has a single-story porch supported by Doric columns, with a low balustrade above. The front facade of the wing has a projecting bay with paneled corners and full-height windows, and is also topped by a balcony with a similar balustrade. Windows on the ground floor of the main facade and south side are full length, with more standard-sized sash windows elsewhere. The entrance is in the left bay of the three-bay front, flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters. The interior retains period woodwork and hardware, including original oak floors with inlaid mahogany, and two fine black marble fireplaces. The house was built in 1840 by Israel Washburn, Jr., not long after his marriage, and was his home until 1863. Washburn was born into a politically prominent family, entered the legislature in 1851, and served two terms as Governor of Maine during the American Civil War. He was appointed Collector of the Port of Portland by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, a post he held until his retirement in 1877. He is best known for his prominent and vocal stance against the expansion of slavery.

The Robinsonian-style gardens are often referred to as \\"the jewel in Ireland's gardening crown\\". History The early origins of the house are unclear, with some claiming that the building was first built as a convent, perhaps dating as far back as the 16th century. The central section of the house dates from the 18th century and the sections that face the east remain unchanged, were built by the St George family. Most of these changes to the house were to reverse it to face a newly built road. During the 1780s, Benjamin Burton Doyle the High Sheriff of Carlow lived at the house. In the 1840s the Dawson Borrer family refurbished and altered the house and gardens, adding the lake that was dug as relief work for the local population during the Irish famine. Feilding Lecky Watson bought Altamont in 1923, and proceeded to extend and expand the gardens. Watson's interest was primarily in rhododendrons, planting seedlings from around the world and exchanging specimens with Sir Frederick Moore of the National Botanic Gardens. Following Watson's death in 1943, his daughter, Corona North continued her father's horticultural work. Gardens The garden sits on the banks of River Slaney which includes an ice age glen, bog garden and arboretum, with view of the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains and Mount Leinster. Some of the oaks are believed to be over 500 years old, and the varying environments provide habitats for diverse set of wildlife. The garden is home to a variety of rare azaleas, rhododendrons, magnolias, as well as wild bluebells and snowdrops. The gardens also feature a Wellingtonia, the Sequoiadendron giganteum or Giant Redwood, which was planted to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo. A trust was set up in the early 1990s to preserve the estate of 100 acres. Following the death of Corona North, ownership of the house and gardens was transferred to the Irish State, and is operated by the Office of Public Works.

He played college football at Texas A&M;, and was drafted by the New York Jets in the fifth round in the 2015 NFL Draft. Early years A native of Navasota, Texas, Harrison attended Navasota High School, where played just two seasons of football for the Rattlers and was teammates with offensive lineman Aleon Calhoun. In his junior year, Harrison helped Navasota to a 10‚Äì1 record and a berth to the UIL Region III-3A Division I final, which the Rattlers lost 28‚Äì34 in overtime to La Vega. Harrison received little attention as a football recruit, being rated only a two-star prospect by Rivals.com. Harrison had offers from Baylor and Southern Miss, but decided to hold out for an offer from Texas A&M;, which came about two weeks after National Signing Day. College career After redshirting his initial year at Texas A&M;, Harrison served as the top backup on the offensive line for the Aggies. He saw action in 11 games of the 2011 season, and started four games in October against Texas Tech, Baylor, Iowa State, and Missouri, replacing the injured Cedric Ogbuehi at right guard. Harrison got another start against Northwestern in the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas at left guard in place of the injured Brian Thomas. As a sophomore, Harrison started all 13 games at guard. As part of an offensive line that also featured Ogbuehi, Luke Joeckel, and Jake Matthews, Harrison helped the Aggies to lead the SEC in all rushing, passing, scoring and total offense. Quarterback Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy after the season. In his junior season, Harrison remained a cornerstone on the offensive line, starting all 13 games. The 2013 Aggies were one of only three teams to rank in the top 10 nationally in scoring, passing and total offense. Harrison injured his calf in the Chick-fil-A Bowl against Duke, and also underwent surgery to repair torn labrum in his right shoulder in January 2014. He missed the first two games of the 2014 season due to slow recovery from this surgery, but eventually played in the final ten games and re-earned his starting spot for the last seven. Harrison made five starts at his usual left guard spot, but was moved outside to left tackle against Auburn and Missouri to replace an injured Germain Ifedi. Providing protection for quarterbacks Kenny Hill and Kyle Allen, the offensive line helped turn the Aggies into the SEC's top passing attack, which led the conference in passing yards and touchdowns. Professional career New York Jets Harrison was drafted by the New York Jets in the fifth round (152nd overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $2.5 million contract on May 6, 2015. He was waived on November 7, 2015, re-signed by the Jets and placed on their practice squad on November 11. On August 28, 2016, Harrison was waived by the Jets. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On January 5, 2017, Harrison signed a reserve/future contract with the Buccaneers. He was waived on September 2, 2017.

On 27 February 2001 the Short 360 operating the flight ditched in the Firth of Forth off Edinburgh at around 17:30 local time; the two crewmembers' bodies were found in the wreckage a few hours after the crash. Aircraft and crew Sister ship of accident aircraft The accident aircraft was a Short 360-100 turboprop airliner manufactured by Short Brothers Limited in 1987, constructor's serial number SH 3723 and registered G-BMNT. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67R engines. Its passenger seats had been removed for use as a freighter and its Certificate of Airworthiness was valid until 15 October 2001.Accident report, page 8; accessed 6 May 2015Accident report, page 9; accessed 13 May 2015 The aircraft was loaded with 1,360 kg (3,000 lb) of fuel and carried of cargo with a total weight at takeoff of . Maximum certified takeoff weight of the Short 360 is 12,292 kg (27,100 lb).Accident Prevention, page 4; accessed 10 May 2015 The crew consisted of a 58-year-old male holding a valid Airline Transport Pilot's licence and with 13,569 hours' flying experience, as the pilot in command.Accident report, page 6; accessed 6 May 2015 The co-pilot was a 29-year-old male, also with a valid licence and 438 total flight hours.Accident report, page 7; accessed 6 May 2015 Accident At 17:10 local time the first officer requested clearance and, after a short delay, the crew taxied to depart from runway 06. With the pilot flying, a normal takeoff was followed by a normal reduction in power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet the co-pilot selected the anti-icing systems on while the pilot changed to a new radio frequency. Four seconds later the torque indicators for both engines rapidly fell to zero and the aircraft suffered a complete loss of propeller thrust. As the first officer radioed a Mayday call on the Air traffic control frequency, the pilot initiated a descent with a reduced airspeed of 110 kt while turning right towards the coast. Realizing they could not reach shore, the crew prepared for ditching. At an airspeed of 86 kt with a 6.8 degree nose up and 3.6 degree left wing down attitude the aircraft impacted the water heading 109 degrees magnetic. Aftermath The aircraft was found 65 metres off shore in a 45 degree nose down attitude, with the forward half of the fuselage submerged in a water depth of approximately 6 metres. The flight deck was almost completely destroyed and the fuselage was firmly embedded in the sand. The empennage had separated and was found floating 100 metres to the east of the main wreckage. Both crew seats remained attached to the flight deck floor with no failure of the safety harnesses. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were both recovered intact. The Short 360 was eventually salvaged with some difficulty, and was dismantled before it was transported to Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) headquarters at Farnborough for a detailed examination.Accident report, page 27; accessed 9 May 2015 Cause Upon investigation, it was concluded that the crash had been caused primarily by the lack of an established practical procedure for flight crews to install engine air intake covers in adverse weather conditions. The aircraft landed at Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove a significant amount of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been included in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where it would not have been readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8 m (9 ft) above the groundAccident report, Appendix III, Figure 4, accessed 13 May 2015). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.Appendices to Aircraft Accident Report, page 50; accessed 9 May 2015 Similar occurrence During the course of the investigation the AAIB was made aware of a similar incident eight years before the loss of G-BNMT. A Short 360 operated by a different airline suffered a dual engine power loss while on its takeoff run. The source of the problem was found to be the accumulation of ice and snow during operation in sub-zero temperatures.Appendices to Aircraft Accident Report, page 32; accessed 9 May 2015 Recommendations As a result of this incident several recommendations were released by the AAIB and the aircraft manufacturer suggested changes to current operations of Short 360 aircraft in near-zero or sub-zero temperature conditions, including: * Flight Operation Department Communication 17/2001 published on 20 October 2001 by the AAIB. * All Operator Message SD002/02 released by Short Brothers on 4 March 2002. * Recommendations 2002-39, 2002‚Äì40 and 2002‚Äì41 based on findings of the investigation, issued by the AAIB.Accident Prevention, page 7; accessed 10 May 2015 References * Aircraft Accident Report 2/2003: Report on the Accident to SD3-60, G-BNMT near Edinburgh Airport on 27 February 2001 * Appendices to Aircraft Accident Report 2/2003 * Accidents and incidents involving the Short 360 Aviation accidents and incidents in 2001 Aviation accidents and incidents in Scotland 2001 in Scotland Firth of Forth 2001 disasters in the United Kingdom February 2001 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Loganair Flight 670A"},{"id":"46588815","text":"Youlston, Shirwell: Barry of six vair and gules.Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.469; Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.65, in which given erroneously as Vair√© azure and argent, over all two bars gules Philip Beaumont (1432‚Äì1473), lord of the manors of Shirwell in North Devon and of Gittisham in East Devon, was a member of parliament for a constituency in Devon and was Sheriff of Devon in 1469.Beaumont, p.64, exact constituency not stated.

Origins The Beaumont family of Devon, generally said to have been seated at the estate of Youlston within their manor of Shirwell in North Devon, is supposed by that family's historian Edward Beaumont in his 1929 work The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850‚Äì1850, to have descended from Hugh de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Bedford (b.1106),Beaumont, Edward T., The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850‚Äì1850. Oxford, c. 1929, p.58 Surviving records do not however allow a definite familial link to be made between the Norman Beaumonts and the Beaumonts of Shirwell, Ashford and the two Loxhores of North Devon. Thus the link made by Edward Beaumont in his 1929 work is supposition. Biography Philip Beaumont was the third son of Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401‚Äì1450) of Shirwell by his first wife Philippa Dinham, a daughter of Sir John Dinham (1359‚Äì1428)Vivian, p.46, pedigree of Basset, p.65, pedigree of Beaumont of Gittisham of Hartland in North Devon, Kingskerswell and Nutwell in South Devon, Buckland Dinham in Somerset and Cardinham in Cornwall.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol.IV, p.377 Effigy of Blanche Bourchier (died 1483), Shirwell Church He married Blanche Bourchier, a daughter of William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin (1407‚Äì1470) of Tawstock, feudal baron of Bampton and heir to a moiety of the feudal barony of Barnstaple, both in Devon. The marriage was childless. She survived him and remarried to Bartholomew St Leger \\"of Kent\\".Vivian, p.106: Latin: de Com. Cantii (\\"from the county of Kent\\") She died on 4 January 1483,Vivian, p.106 and a stone effigy of her survives in Shirwell Church.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.728 Beaumont died on 12 June 1473. His will was dated 1 January 1472/3 and requested that a marble stone should be laid on his body, with his arms graven on it, and his portraiture of copper, with this inscription on it: (citing Pole) > Testis sis tu Christe, quod non-jacet hic lapis iste Corpus ut ornetur, sed > ut spiritus memoretur. Clearly this had not been performed by 1488 as in that year his younger half- brother and heir Thomas Beaumont (died 1488) repeated the request in his own will. The rhyming Latin verse may be translated as: \\"Thou art a witness O Christ that this stone is not an adornment for the body but a memorial for his soul\\".Beaumont, T., pp.65‚Äì6 Whether the stone was eventually laid down is not known, but no such brass survives. Succession Beaumont bequeathed his estates in two directions: The manors of Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon were left to his nephew Sir John Bassett (1441‚Äì1485)Vivian, p.46 of Whitechapel in Devon, the son of his sister Joan Beaumont who had married John Bassett (1374‚Äì1463) of Whitechapel, Bishops Nympton, Devon, and of Tehidy in Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1449.Vivian, p.46, regnal year 28 Henry VI (1449) The other part of Philip Beaumont's bequest, including Shirwell, went to his eldest half-brother Thomas Beaumont (died 1487/8), whose eventual heir was his niece Margaret (or Maud) Beaumont and her husband John Chichester (1472‚Äì1538) of Raleigh. The Chichester family later made Youlston, the chief estate in Shirwell, their principal seat. Notes References Sources *Beaumont, Edward T., The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850‚Äì1850.

Early life Montgomerie was the fifth son of George Montgomerie of Broomlands, Ayrshire, a minor Scottish laird. He trained as a writer to the signet in 1687. He married Penelope Barclay, daughter of Sir Robert Barclay of Perceton, Ayr on 2 February 1689. His second wife, whom he married in September 1696, was Janet Gray, daughter of Thomas Gray, merchant, of Edinburgh. In 1697 he acquired lands at Wrae in Linlithgowshire, Career Montgomerie was returned as shire commissioner for Linlithgowshire in the Parliament of Scotland in 1704. He was a burgess of Edinburgh from 1706, and a director of the Bank of Scotland from 1706. In 1707, he became a Commissioner of Excise for Scotland. He supported the Union, but after the Union with England in 1707, he did not win a place as one of the Scottish representatives to the first Parliament of Great Britain in 1707. Montgomerie unsuccessfully contested Linlithgowshire at the 1708 British general election, and was appointed as Under-secretary of State for Scotland in 1709, serving as private secretary to Lord Queensberry. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Buteshire at a by-election in February 1710, as a nominee of the county's patron Lord Bute. However, Buteshire was an alternating constituency (with Caithness) and was unrepresented in the next Parliament. As a Court supporter, he voted in favour of the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. No alternative seat was found for Mongtgomerie at the general election in September 1710. Later life and legacy Montgomerie's business failed in 1712‚Äì13, and he was pursued by the Treasury over customs funds. He died on 11 March 1725, and was succeeded by his son George.

It is an extremely rare member of the WO oxygen sequence, at WO2 the hottest known in the LMC. It is likely to be one of the hottest stars known. Although no temperature has yet been published, WO2 stars typically have temperatures around 200,000 K. The star was first observed in a 2013 survey of the Magellanic Clouds using the 1m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The survey was intended to identify Wolf Rayet candidate stars by taking images through narrow bandwidth filters centred on the 465.0 nm CIII and 468.6 nm HeII spectral lines together with a continuum filter at 475.0 nm. Digital subtraction of the separate images was used to highlight stars with particularly strong emission at one or both of the indicative spectral lines. The first survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud in October 2013 identified eight previously unknown candidate objects, of which five were later confirmed to be Wolf Rayet stars. LMC 195-1 is located in the rich LH-41 (NGC 1910) stellar association that contains the luminous blue variable S Doradus as well as another WO star LH41-1042. The two WO stars are only 9\\" apart. WO stars are classified on the basis of OVI emission at 381.1-383.4 nm, which is weak or absent in other Wolf Rayet stars. The WO2 subclass is defined as having the ratio of OVI to OV emission strength between four and 12.5. Higher values would indicate WO1, while smaller values would be WO3 or WO4. In the new star, the ratio of these line strengths was 4.5.

History and the people Castle tower The history of the castle dates back to the tenth-eleventh century, when an early defensive castle was located on the castle's grounds. The castle was built two centuries later, in about the year 1222. When the Kingdom of Poland was under feudal fragmentation, the castle housed the following Silesian dukes and castellans. The most important part of the castle's being, was that under the rule of Duke Przemys≈Çaw Toszecki, of the O≈õwiƒôcim family line. After his death the castle became of property of the Dukes of Opole. In the sixteenth century, the castle was the property of the Habsburgs. Which gave the castle to do Redern√≥w family, which they bought in 1592. In between 1638-1707 the castle was ruled by the Colonna family, which had made a full-scale reconstruction of the castle - by which the castle became a magnate residence, the first one in Upper Silesia. The following owners were: Johann Dietrich von Peterswald, Count Franciszek Karol Kotuli≈Ñski, Posadowski family, and finally Adolf von Eichendorff. In 1797, the castle was sold to Count Franciszek Adam Gaschin√≥w. Shortly after, in 1811, the castle burned down and became a ruin. In 1840 the ruins were bought by Abraham Guradze, and the Guradze family maintained possession of the castle until World War II, when Abraham's great-grandson Count Kurt von Guradze bequeathed the castle to the youth of Poland. The castle was finally partially rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, the castle houses a centre of culture, and a primary wedding celebration venue.

In 1925, he was the World's third ranked lightweight. He was reputed by one source to have fought 237 bouts with 200 wins. In his career he fought champions Mushy Callahan, Young Corbett III, Jackie Fields, and Young Jack Thompson. He defeated Callahan in a stunning upset on July 5, 1926 just months before Callahan would take the World Light Welterweight Championship. After his retirement from professional boxing, he was a California boxing referee and judge for over twenty years.The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, pgs.153‚Äì156 Early life Silver was born one of eight children, on August 16, 1903 in the rough Portola district of San Francisco, California. His father, originally from Vienna, was a tailor for ladies garments. His brother Joey Silverstein (Not to be confused with Brooklyn boxer Joey Silvers) became a Welterweight boxer. Like many boxers of his era, Jack grew up selling newspapers to earn extra money for his family. He entered the Navy around 1921, at the age of eighteen, where he gained many of his boxing skills during his two-year stint. By the time of his discharge he had earned the title of Pacific Fleet Champion. While in the Navy on June 13, 1922, he fought aboard the USS California (BB-44), flagship of the Pacific fleet, and a vessel known for hosting top boxing and athletic competitions. Boxing career On August 17, 1923, he took the City of San Francisco Lightweight title from Bobby Allen in four rounds at the large Dreamland Rink where he was to fight regularly. Silver was a studied boxer who was solid in the fundamentals. He had an accurate and lightning fast left jab, and an efficient right which could knock an opponent on the mat, but rarely knock one out. He used his long reach to his advantage and was more a studied scientific boxer than a power hitter. His long slim build was rather unusual for a championship boxer. From 1922‚Äì23, Silver fought at the Dreamland Rink in San Francisco for 52 consecutive weeks as a headliner. In early 1924, according to boxing writer Ken Blady, Silver defeated Lou Paluso of Salt Lake city for the Pacific Coast Lightweight Title. He fought Paluso again for the title on March 29, 1926 in a twelve-round draw match in Salt Lake City. According to the Deseret News, \\"the local pride (Paluso) was superior at infighting, while the coast ace (Silver) had an advantage with his long reach and was at his best on long distance slugging.\\"\\"Paluso and Silver Step Through 12 rounds to a Draw,Lightweights in Classy Exhibition in the Manly Art\\", Deseret News, pg. 6, Salt Lake City, 30 March 1926. Defending his Pacific Coast Lightweight Title on February 23, 1925, he fought Joe Benjamin at Recreation Park in San Francisco. The fight attracted 20,000 spectators, and was at the time the largest attendance for a lightweight bout in California history. Silver was down in the third round for a count of five, and Benjamin ultimately won the controversial ten-round decision. This fight was significantly an elimination bout for the World Lightweight Title.Partly from an interview with Silver in The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, pgs.153‚Äì156 On April 16, 1926, Silver defeated Oakland Jimmy Duffy, Pacific Coast Welterweight Champion 1922‚Äì25, in ten rounds at his favorite haunt Dreamland Rink in San Francisco. Author Ken Blady wrote that Silver won the Pacific Coast Welterweight Championship as a result of this or an earlier fight with Duffy. On July 5, 1926, Silver faced the next Light Welterweight World Champion Mushy Callahan in Ewing Field in San Francisco before a huge crowd of 18,000, with Silver impressively winning the referee's decision and every round. Callahan would hold the Light Welterweight Championship from September 21, 1926 until 1930. Reflecting on the Callahan fight two years later, the San Jose News wrote \\"In his prime Silver was the fastest Jr. Welterweight on the Pacific Coast, giving Mushy Callahan the surprise of his life...Callahan... expected to find a pushover, but was handed a lacing by the San Francisco battler.\\"\\"Wright and Silver Head Boxing Card at Forman's\\", San Jose News, pg. 19, San Jose, CA, 5 July 1928. Jackie Fields, 1929 World Welterweight Champion By late 1926, Silver was still a competent boxer, who now fought closer to the Jr. welterweight division, but no longer as a top ranked contender. On December 21, 1926, he lost to the former Olympic champion Jackie Fields in a four-round TKO at Dreamland Rink in San Francisco. Silver lost to 1933 World Welterweight Champion Young Corbett III on June 7, 1927 in a close ten round bout in Fresno, California. Retirement from professional boxing and work as boxing judge Young Jack Thompson, 1930 World Welterweight Champ Partly as a result of his losses to Young Corbett III, and Jackie Fields, Silver retired from professional boxing in 1929. He said in an interview \\"I simply lost my touch.\\" In a disappointing loss to 1930 Welterweight Champion, Young Jack Thompson, on September 28, 1926, in an eighth-round TKO in Los Angeles, Silver's jaw was broken. Silver married Bess O'Connor around 1932, and had a long marriage with a large family. On October 9, 1937 Silver was scheduled to box in a benefit exhibition at Legion Stadium in Los Angeles for Wad Wadheim, a fight promoter who had suffered a stroke. Among the fifty or so boxing greats that participated were triple World Champion Henry Armstrong, Silver's opponents' Jackie Fields, Mushy Callahan, and Young Jack Thompson, Abe 'The Newsboy\\" Hollandersky, Fidel La Barba, ex-Middleweight champion Al McCoy, Jim Jeffries, and Maxie Rosenbloom.\\"Wadham's Benefit Tonight\\", Los Angeles Times, pg. A-10, Los Angeles, 9 October 1937. Silver worked as a boxing judge and referee after his retirement from professional prizefighting. His lengthy career as a California boxing referee stretched from 1939 to 1962 and he refereed about 80 matches, including two USA sanctioned State Titles. He simultaneously worked as a California boxing judge as well from 1947 to 1968, judging the California State Light Heavyweight Title on August 21, 1968 in Oakland. During his career he judged at least forty-two boxing matches according to his BoxRec record. In his retirement from boxing, he also worked as a Salesman for the Ranier Brewing Company. During the 1940s, when boxing and refereeing jobs were scarce, Silver became a sought after boxing instructor in Hollywood, where he helped tutor actors James Cagney and Ronald Reagan in the fistic arts. Boxing honors He was elected into the California Boxing Hall of Fame in 1972, and was a member of the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame as well.

It is one of 162 German Student Corps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European fraternal corporations, with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.Die Corps. \\"Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?\\" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.Klimczuk, Stephen & Warner, Gerald. \\"Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies\\". Sterling Publishing, 2009, New York and London. . pp. 212‚Äì232 (\\"University Secret Societies and Dueling Corps\\"). Membership in the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Aachen's universities and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.Die Corps. \\"Prinzipien der Corps\\" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013. Members of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Marko-Guestphalia's members wear the traditional couleur, colored stripes, in green-white-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds. While many of their members stem from the west-Rhine region of Germany, Marko-Guestphalia enjoys a strong membership of international students (examples include Denmark, India, Italia, Serbia, Turkey, USA, Peru), similar to the internationally very open character of the RWTH.  Fundamentals and principles  Like all German Student Corps, Marko-Guestphalia expects tolerance from its members in political, scientific and religious affairs. Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Marko-Guestphalia as an entity always remains neutral. This neutrality is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \\"fox\\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (Rezeption). The fraternity has about 300 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life. Academic \\"Mensur\\" fencing in 1900. Steel goggles provide added protection nowadays. Members of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and practice the tradition of engagements in academic fencing, or \\"Mensur\\" in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.Die Corps. \\"Hoch bitte ‚Äì Los!\\" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013. Mark Twain described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices. Marko-Guestphalia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional couleur, colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as \\"wearing colors\\" (German: Farben tragen), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions. Activity and responsibility are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term (\\"Semester\\") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies. Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility. All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society. Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of Alter Herr (alumnus). Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said Alte Herren, who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities (Weinheim and Bad K√∂sen) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/KSCV). In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.  History   Foundation  Bismarck's student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by the fraternity's members then and now. The fraternity was founded by three fraternity students of other fraternities on December 2, 1871 who had come to the Royal Rheinian-Westphalian Polytechnical School at Aachen for their graduate studies. The fraternity grew quickly and joined the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) on May 17, 1872.  Today  The fraternity has official relationships with the Corps Saxo-Thuringia M√ºnchen in Munich and a close relationship with the other Corps of the Blaues Kartell with member fraternities Corps Altsachsen Dresden, Corps Hannoverania Hanover and Corps Berlin.

He described his work as visual abstractions after nature. He was very interested in the detail in nature and declared that everything he drew or painted, whether a portrait head, flower, landscape, still life, or breaking sea wave, was, for him, a portrait.  Education  Leonard McComb studied at Manchester School of Art and subsequently at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1956 to 1959, followed by a Postgraduate in sculpture, also at the Slade, in 1960. He went on to teach at various art schools, including Oxford Brookes University, Sir John Cass College, Slade School of Fine Art, Royal College of Art and Goldsmiths College, and in 1974 he founded the Sunningwell School of Art, Oxford.  Biography  He was a versatile artist who celebrated working in various media and was unusual amongst his contemporaries in being represented in the Tate Gallery Collection with works in oil, watercolour, and print, as well as sculpture. His sculpture, Young Man Standing, also known as the Golden Man (Tate Gallery), was the subject of National controversy when it was withdrawn from exhibition in Lincoln Cathedral as it was considered indecent by a senior cathedral cleric. Having destroyed most of his early work, McComb was included in the exhibition, The Human Clay, held at the Hayward Gallery in 1976; his first solo show was held the following year at the Coracle Press. In 1983, an Arts Council touring exhibition, entitled Leonard McComb Drawing Painting Sculpture, was organised by the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford and shown at the Serpentine Gallery, London; City Art Gallery, Manchester; Gardner Arts Centre, University of Sussex; and the Fruit Market Gallery, Edinburgh. His work continued to be exhibited in many important group shows, including the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1982, the Tate Gallery in 1984, the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington D.C. in 1986, and the Museum of Modern Art, Brussels in 1987. Among McComb‚Äôs many awards are the Royal Academy‚Äôs Jubilee Award (1977); Korn Ferry Award (1990); Times Watercolour Prize (1992 and 1993); Nordstern Print Prize (1997); and the RWS Prize (1998). McComb has received many major commissions for private and corporate collections throughout the UK, Europe, and the USA. In 1999, he completed a commissioned portrait of the novelist Doris Lessing for the National Portrait Gallery, London. The following year, he was selected by the Vatican to design a Jubilee Medal, featuring Pope John Paul II and the late Archbishop Basil Hume, for the worldwide series to commemorate the Millennium. McComb was elected Royal Academician in 1991 (ARA 1987) and, in 1995, was elected Keeper of the Royal Academy, placing him in charge of the Royal Academy Schools until 1998. He was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Watercolour Society and the Royal Society of Printmakers in 1996. McComb lived and worked in Brixton, London. He was married three times: to Elizabeth Henstock in 1955 (from whom he was divorced 8 years later), to Joan Allwork in 1966 (she died in 1967) and to Barbara Gittel in 1973 (from whom he was divorced in 1999). He died on 19 June 2018 at the age of 87. His sisters Moira and Anne survived him.Leonard McComb obituary The Guardian References External links * http://leonardmccomb.co.uk https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/artist/leonard- mccomb-ra * http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mccomb-portrait-of-a-young- man-standing-t07466/text-summary 1930 births 2018 deaths English artists Royal Academicians Slade School of Fine Art ","title":"Leonard McComb"},{"id":"46589186","title":"Bad Bitch"},{"id":"46589200","text":"Thao River () is the upper stretch of the Red River, originates from Weishan Yi and Hui Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, China, flows through three Vietnamese provinces, including Lao Cai Province, Yen Bai Province and Phu Tho Province.

The monument was placed in 1935 as part of a campaign to galvanize local opposition to the controversial Commonwealth College, which was accused of teaching Communism and other evils. Local opposition contributed to the school's eventual closure in 1940.

Career Born on 13 August 1882 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, he became interested in acting as a young man, studying in a private master class with the famous Austrian stage actor, Karl Arnau. He made his stage debut at the age of 20 in the municipal theater of Olomouc, Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic). Over the next five years he would appear in productions in Meran, South Tyrol, Linz, Upper Austria, and Graz, Austria. In 1908 he would begin a 30-year association with the Deutsche Volkstheater in Vienna. While he concentrated mostly on the theater during his early career, he did appear in a small role in the Austrian film, Der Unbekannte (The Unknown) in 1912. In 1917, he would again begin performing in films, and during the late 1910s through the mid-20s, he had a successful run of starring and featured roles in silent films. Some of the more notable silent films in which he starred were: Der Doppelselbstmord (1918), Die Ahnfrau (1919), Der tanzende Tod (1920), Der tote Hochzeitsgast (1921), Hoffmanns Erz√§hlungen (1923), and Durch Nacht und Eis (1926), which Ehmann also directed. He also directed two other films, Junggesellenwirtschaft (1920) and Faustrecht (1922), as well as penning the scripts for Junggesellenwirtschaft and Verschneit (1920). In the mid-20s Ehmann would take a hiatus from the film industry, choosing to focus on his theatrical career. In the early 1930s he would return to making films, although with the advent of sound, the size of his roles diminished, and he played mostly small, or featured supporting parts. Over his 50-year film career, he appeared in over 100 films, mostly in Austria, but also from Germany later in his career. Some of the more notable films in which he appeared include: Fr√§ulein Lilli (1936) directed by Hans Behrendt, Robert Wohlmuth and Max Neufeld, and starring Franciska Gaal; Thirteen Chairs (1938), starring Heinz R√ºhmann; 1940's Der Postmeister, directed by Gustav Ucicky; Schicksal (1942), directed by G√©za von Bolv√°ry, and starring Heinrich George, Werner Hinz and Christian Kay√üler; Die Kreuzlschreiber (1950), directed by Eduard von Borsody; and The Forester of the Silver Wood (1954), in which he had one of his infrequent starring roles. In 1956 he would appear in the comedy The Trapp Family, based on the memoirs of Maria von Trapp, which became the inspiration for the hugely successful American Broadway musical, The Sound of Music, and the subsequent American film of the same name. Towards the end of his career, Ehmann would also appear in several television films for German and Austrian TV. Ehmann died on 1 November 1967 at the age of 85, in his home town of Vienna. He is buried in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.

Published in the United States on 9 January 2006 it covers the period between May 2003 to July 2004. Bremer takes the readers through his struggle with Iraq's leaders to build democratic institutions. He also describes negotiations with Iraqi leaders to write an interim constitution with guarantees for women and minority rights. Bremer explain his work with Iraq's politicians to build a responsible and representative government while facing an atmosphere of division and distrust among Iraq's politicians. The Shia Arabs, the country's long-repressed majority, deeply distrusted the Sunni Arab minority who had held power for centuries. Iraq's non-Arab Kurds teetered on the brink of secession when Bremer arrived. He had to find Sunnis willing to participate in the new political order. The book carries readers from the holy city of Najaf to the burning and lawless Baghdad; from the White House Situation Room to the Pentagon E-Ring. The book argues that the coalition disbanded Saddam's army, the unbalanced force composed of Shiite draftees serving under Sunni officers. The soldiers deserted and refused to defend Saddam Hussein's regime. A number of important issues are raised in the book including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the First Battle of Fallujah, and the crisis of Muqtada al-Sadr.

The fjord is approximately 50 km northwest of Cape Farewell and is now called Narssap Sarqa.  Norse period  The name Herjolfsfjord was in honour of Herjolf Bardsson, one of the founding chieftains of the Norse colony in Greenland established circa 985 AD, as recounted in the Greenlanders Saga and The Landn√°mab√≥k. Herjolf's homestead, Herjolfsnes, was located on the western shoreline of the fjord's end, facing the open ocean. The other chieftains favoured the heads of fjords, inland and away from the ocean, where farming conditions were better, which suggests that Herjolf was more interested in establishing a port-of-call than farming.Farley Mowat, Westviking (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1965), pg. 84-5 Herjolfsfjord was the southern- and easternmost extent of major Norse homesteading in Greenland. Archeologists have identified 8 other smaller Norse sites on the fjord, about half on each side.  Modern period  The modern Greenlandic name of the fjord is Narssap Sarqa, with the northwest fork called Amitsuarssuk. It features one community, Narsarmijit (sometimes appearing on maps as Narsaq Kujalleq and formerly Frederiksdal), located on the eastern shoreline about 3 km across the fjord from the ruins of the old Herjolfsnes homestead. The Herjolfsnes site later became known by Inuit Greenlanders as Ikigait, but is now uninhabited.  Details  The fjord is approximately 16 km long, about two-thirds of which extends north from the ocean end (59.986577, -44.692687) up to a fork, then turning northwest further inland for approximately 5 km, to the fjord's head (60.125168, -44.754610).

Early life  Wright grew up in Marshall, Texas and attended Wiley College, where she studied Home Economics. At Wiley, Wright took classes from Professor and activist Melvin B. Tolson, who inspired her to become engaged with the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1942, After receiving a recommendation from Wiley College president Dr. Matthew Dogan, Lady Bird Johnson hired Wright as a cook for herself and then-representative Lyndon Johnson. Wright accompanied Mrs. Johnson and another newly hired staff member, John Hickey, on their drive to Washington D.C. The three had difficulty finding restaurants and hotels throughout the trip since segregated establishments often refused to serve Wright and Hickey. Wright said about the journey in a 1974 interview that she was often asked to enter restaurants through the kitchen or eat outside, but always refused, stating \\"I felt that if I wasn't wanted, I wouldn't go. I felt happier not going.\\"  Racial discrimination  When Wright moved with the president's family to Washington, D.C., several hotels in the Southern United States refused to let her stay because she was black. When Lyndon Johnson was senator, Wright refused to drive to Austin, Texas with him, telling him, \\"When Sammy and I drive to Texas and I have to go to the bathroom, like Lady Bird or the girls, I am not allowed to go to the bathroom. I have to find a bush and squat. When it comes time to eat, we can't go into restaurants. We have to eat out of a brown bag. And at night, Sammy sleeps in the front of the car with the steering wheel around his neck, while I sleep in the back. We are not going to do it again.\\" Friendship with Johnson President Johnson often asked Wright's opinion of his legislative actions and appointments. Wright recalled one instance in 1967: > One day he came home, and he said, \\"Oh, do you see that I have appointed the > first Negro to the Supreme Court?\\" I said, \\"Oh! Has it gone through?\\" And he > said, \\"Well, no, but I'm sure it will. I've appointed him.\\" That's when he > had appointed [Thurgood] Marshall to the Supreme Court.\\" Wright often relayed messages to President Johnson that she heard from people she encountered in her daily life, both of approval and disapproval of the Johnson administration. In one instance, Wright recalls approaching Johnson about the difference in salary between herself and another white house chef, to which Johnson responded by increasing the salaries of both Zephyr and her husband. Wright frequently cooked for guests of Johnson, including Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn. She spoke of serving food to longtime anti-civil rights senator Richard Russell Jr. and noted that she did not view his company as at all unpleasant. Wright and Johnson maintained a friendly relationship and often conversed in a casual manner. Wright named several instances in which her and Johnson traded lighthearted words and poked fun at each other's sleep schedules. Wright was outspokenly supportive of Johnson's work on civil rights, stating that \\"In talking with him I know he is for all of the Negro people, and he has done more for them than anyone else\\" Her time with the Johnsons concluded in 1969, at the end of Lyndon's presidential term. When Johnson became Vice President of the United States, he sought Wright's opinion on matters such as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. She was later a witness to his signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and at the signing ceremony, he gave her the pen he had used to sign the act, saying, \\"You deserve this more than anyone else.\\" References The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House by Kate Andersen Brower (2015).

It is a luminous and very hot star, highly evolved and close to exploding as a supernova. Discovery WR 102 was first mentioned as the possible optical counterpart to a peculiar X-ray source GX 3+1. However, it became clear that it was a separate object and in 1971 it was highlighted as a luminous star with unusual OVI emission lines in its spectrum. It was classified as a WC star, an unusual one because of the highly ionised emission lines, and not the central star of a planetary nebula. It was seen to vary in brightness and was given the variable star designation V3893 Sagittarii in the 62nd name-list of variable stars. Faint nebulosity was discovered around WR 102 in 1981 and was identified as a wind-blown bubble. In 1982, a set of five luminous stars with highly ionised oxygen emission lines, including WR 102, was used to define the WO class of Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars. They were identified as highly evolved massive stars. Features Infrared image of the nebulosity around WR 102 () WR 102, of spectral classification WO2, is one of the very few known oxygen-sequence Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, just four in the Milky Way galaxy and five in external galaxies. It is also the hottest known, with a surface temperature of 210,000 K. Modelling the atmosphere gives a luminosity around , while calculations from brightness and distance gives luminosity of with a distance of parsec. It is a very small dense star, with a radius around and a mass of . Very strong stellar winds with a terminal velocity of 5,000 kilometers per second are causing WR 102 to lose /year. For comparison, the Sun loses (2-3) x 10‚àí14 solar masses per year due to its solar wind, several hundred million times less than WR 102. These winds and the strong ultraviolet radiation from the hot star have compressed and ionised the surrounding interstellar material into a complex series of arcs described as the bubble type of Wolf‚ÄìRayet nebula. Evolutionary status WO stars are the last evolutionary stage of the most massive stars before exploding as supernovae. It is very likely that WR 102 is on its last stages of nuclear fusion, near or beyond the end of helium burning. It has been calculated that WR 102 will explode as a supernova within 1,500 years. High mass and rapid rotation would make a gamma-ray burst (GRB) possible, but it is unclear if WR 102 is rotating rapidly. It was previously thought that the projected rotation velocity within the stellar wind could be as fast as 1,000 km/s but spectropolarimetric observations seem to indicate that if WR 102 is rotating, it is rotating at a much lower speed.

Biography Rafael was born in Albany, New York. After high school, he attended State University of New York at Binghamton, where he wrote for the school paper. He started as sports writer, and worked his way to managing editor. He also served an internship at the local newspaper, the Binghamton Press & Sun- Bulletin. He later took a part-time job at The Saratogian, a community newspaper published at Saratoga Springs, New York. When a full-time job opened at the newspaper, he took it, then moved to a reporting position at the Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin, covering college sports and local auto- racing. He later was assigned to cover the local AA baseball club (Binghamton Mets, the farm club of the New York Mets). The Gannett newspaper empire (which owned the Binghamton newspaper) fostered promising writers by detailing them to Virginia for four months and thoroughly grounding them in the newspaper business, working at USA Today. Rafael began his course in August 1998. He worked covering major-league baseball. When baseball season ended, the newspaper's principal boxing reporter (Jon Saraceno) was moving up, so Rafael was asked to cover boxing. Rafael's temporary duty at USA Today ended in December 1998, and he returned to Binghamton. In January 2000, he was asked to return to USA Today on a permanent basis, as a boxing writer. In September 2004, ESPN began pursuing Rafael, desiring to strengthen its boxing coverage. He began with ESPN.com in March 2005. He writes in-depth coverage pieces, and his specialty is his weekly compilation of rankings.Hauser, Thomas. Dan Rafael, SecondsOut.com. Accessed February 22, 2017 In January 2016, ESPN announced Rafael had been signed to a new multi-year agreement.

A performance of all three pieces takes about 9 minutes. They are: # A Grecian Lad # The Boy Bishop # Puck's Birthday A pastel is an artwork made using a colouring medium in the form of a stick which consists of powdered pigment and a binder; the stick too is called a pastel. Pastel drawings are often delicate in tone, which may explain Ireland's choice of title for this set of gentle impressionistic pieces. The title A Grecian Lad may have been taken from A. E. Housman's poem \\"Look not in my eyes, for fear\\", No. XV in his 1896 collection A Shropshire Lad. It refers to the Greek legend of Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection: : A Grecian lad, as I hear tell, : One that many loved in vain, : Looked into a forest well : And never looked away again. : There, when the turf in springtime flowers, : With downward eye and gazes sad, : Stands amid the glancing showers : A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.'' The jonquil is a species of narcissus, Narcissus jonquilla. In the Middle Ages, it was a widespread custom to appoint a boy bishop, for example from among cathedral choristers, to parody the actual bishop on some particular church feast day. Puck is a mischievous supernatural creature in Celtic folklore. He is perhaps best known from the character Puck in Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream.

History The Czersk Castle was built at the turning point of the fourteenth and fifteenth century by Duke Janusz I, after the Masovian land became part of the Kingdom of Poland under the rule of Queen Bona Sforza. The castle had three towers, with one of them‚Äîbeing four-sided‚Äîused as the main gate house. In 1656, during the war with the Swedes, the castle was partially ruined, when the retreating land army under Stefan Czarniecki's command had captured and demolished the stronghold. The castle was rebuilt between 1762‚Äì1766 under the command of Marsza≈Çek Franciszek Bieli≈Ñski. Later, during the Prussian Partition, a Prussian leader had ordered for demolition of the castle's defense walls, reducing its military importance as a stronghold. In the years to follow, no more reconstruction work on the castle had ever been attempted. Today, only the towers, a brick bridge from the eighteenth century, and the north and east wing of the castle remain of the overall stronghold.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on July 10, 1948. The plot concerns a baby turtle named Clem who is only partly hatched and looks for a place to finish hatching while running into a dog and rooster who break out into a feud over ownership of the egg while Clem's family looks for him at the beach. The plot of a partly hatched baby animal experiencing misadventures in completing his hatching is loosely based on Frank Tashlin's Booby Hatched, released in 1944. Plot At the beach, a mother turtle, singing to the tune of \\"The Arkansas Traveler\\" (the main theme music for this short), brings down her four eggs and finds a good place to hatch them out. She sticks out four signs for the baby turtles' names (Tom, Dick, Harry, Clem) and begins digging holes for the eggs. At that moment, a human (from offscreen) holds up a nature note to explain to the audience that what we're seeing is a fact: turtles bury their eggs in the sand so that the hot sun can hatch them out. The mother turtle sees this, scolds the human for sticking in that piece of trivia (claiming people already know that), and leaves to fetch a sunlamp. While the mother turtle is gone, Clem's egg pops out from under the sand and Clem sticks his legs out of the shell (thanks to the sun), but dark clouds immediately cover up the sun. Upset at being only \\"half-hatched\\", Clem goes to look for something to continue hatching himself out. He comes to a road just near the beach and starts to cross over to the other side, but nearly gets run over by two cars going in different directions and shouts out at them. Meanwhile, Clem's mother returns with the sunlamp (having anticipated the unexpected cloud cover), places it over the eggs (unaware of the missing Clem), and starts knitting while the sunlamp takes over the sun's work. Over in the country, Clem comes across a pond (where he dips in his toe) and, despite being unable to see through the eggshell, leaps across the pond, thanks to a couple of stones and a turtle unexpectedly surfacing from underneath the water (though he wonders where the egg came from afterward). Next, Clem comes across a farm and finds a cow fast asleep, deducing the cow is probably warm enough for him to continue hatching, but the cow uses her tail like a swatter to try to hit Clem. When that doesn't work, she uses her tail to set Clem up like a golfball and (turning the tail into a golf club) hits Clem to a barn where he goes down the waterspout and hits the foot of a horse. As Clem wishes aloud for something to break open the shell, he, at the same time, narrowly avoids getting stomped on by the horse as the horse begins walking. Back at the beach, Clem's mother finishes knitting just in time to see the eggs beginning to hatch. In perfect harmony, Tom, Dick, and Harry hatch singing out their names one by one and together as a group. Clem's mother tells them to come along, but just as they start to leave the beach, she suddenly gets a funny feeling that something's off. She counts up her babies and on her fingers twice (coming up to three on the babies and four on the eggs) and does the sum on an adding machine, to which she realizes to her horror that Clem is missing. Going into a blind panic, Clem's mother takes the shovel and starts digging in the spot where Clem's egg was while Tom, Dick, and Harry join the search with smaller shovels and singing to the tune of \\"Working on the railroad\\". On the farm, Clem gets under the farm dog and leaves him, lamenting on losing good hatching spots. At first, the dog brushes off \\"laying an egg\\" as a dream, but suddenly realizing it wasn't a dream, he begins fantasizing about being the only dog to lay an egg and the fame and fortune that could come from such a feat. He then tries to sit on Clem, but Clem dodges him. Clem then wanders into the hen-house and snuggles under a hen. The dog comes into \\"reclaim\\" Clem, but the hen catches him in the act and cries out for help. The dog slaps the hen and scolds her for stealing the egg, but the hen still cries out for help. Just as the dog leaves the hen-house, the rooster shows up, forcing the dog to hide Clem. When the rooster demands to know where the stolen egg is, the dog holds out empty hands, having hidden Clem behind his back, but the rooster catches onto the ruse, pounds the dog on the head, and \\"reclaims\\" Clem. The scene briefly shifts back to the beach where Clem's mother is now digging a hole within a hole and Clem's brothers doing the same thing with their hole and singing to the tune of \\"Where has my little dog gone?\\" Back at the farm, the dog takes a rain barrel and, just as the rooster passes by with Clem, drops the barrel on him to trap him. The dog then reaches in through a hole to try and take back Clem, but the rooster hits the dog's hand and laughs at it. Angered, the dog rushes away, takes a pole, and uses it to repeatedly poke the rooster through the hole in order to get him to surrender Clem. Fortunately, the rooster gives up and hands back Clem. Over at the beach, Clem's mother has now resorted to using a steam shovel to dig up the beach in her search and Clem's brothers are using a toy steam shovel in their search as well while singing to \\"Brother John\\" Over at the farm, the dog comes across a large white box with a sign that reads \\"Warning! Do not look into this box!\\" Rather than walk on, the dog lets his curiosity get the better of him and opens it, revealing the rooster hiding inside. Stunned, the dog tries to get the words of how the rooster escaped the barrel out of his mouth, but the rooster seizes him and pulls him into the box. The box then shakes as the dog and rooster begin beating each other up over possession of Clem, but during the brawl, Clem escapes from the box and makes a beeline back to the beach. First the dog and then the rooster notice this and also jump out of the box and pursue Clem. As the three of them get down to the beach and pass the pit already dug by Clem's mother, Clem's mother sees the chase and, thinking both the dog and rooster kidnapped Clem, uses the steam shovel's bucket to catch them and Clem. Once they're down, Clem's mother reclaims Clem and, with a mallet, whacks both the dog and rooster over the head, leaving them dazed. At that moment, Clem starts shouting for his mother to get him out of the shell. At the same time, relieved to have their brother back, Tom, Dick, and Harry also tell their mother to get Clem out of the shell. Quickly, Clem's mother uses the sunlamp to provide some more heat for Clem. Finally, the eggshell breaks and Clem sticks his head out of his turtle shell, at which his joy over finally hatching becomes short-lived when he sees that he's been born an animal that has to spend its life in a shell, at which he cries \\"Aww, wouldn't you just know it? I'm still in a gosh dang shell!\\" to end the short. Availability *This film is available on the laserdisc set The Golden Age of Looney Tunes.

He played college football at the University of Miami. Feliciano is of Puerto Rican & Sicilian descent.  Early life  Born in East Meadow, NY, Jon, his mother and younger brother moved to South Florida in the mid-90s. As a child, Feliciano was more interested in designing and playing video games and basketball than in football. In the early 2000‚Äôs Jon and his family moved to Davie, Florida where he eventually enrolled at Western High School, playing basketball and football. Throughout his adolescence, Feliciano‚Äôs mother‚Äôs battle with cancer, spotty employment, and his brother‚Äôs health challenges caused a great deal of financial and emotional strain on the family. In 2008, his mother returned to New York while Feliciano willingly remained in Davie to complete his high school career. Throughout these formative years, Feliciano dealt with periods of homelessness and hunger. Considered a three-star recruit and number 19 offensive guard by Scout.com, he was also considered a three-star prospect by Rivals.com and ranked as the 55th best offensive tackle in the nation. Feliciano was also named to First-team All-Broward by Sun Sentinel. Despite having received offers from the University of Akron, Florida International University and San Diego State University, to name a few, Feliciano‚Äôs heart was set on being a Hurricane. Encouraged by his best friend Sean Cole, and accompanied by his coach Rashad West, Feliciano attended the 2008 University of Miami spring scrimmage with his highlight tape in hand.

History  First published in 1981 by Churchill Livingstone, it was originally catered to an American audience due to technical differences in anesthesia procedures among European and American practitioners. The first edition was co-authored by many contributors at the University of California. The book soon became a huge success, and it was frequently cited by research groups and clinical departments across the United States. The second edition appeared in 1986, with total content filling more than 2400 pages spread over three separate volumes. Although it was criticized for lack of cross-referencing and noticeable differences in writing styles due to a higher number of contributors, Miller's Anesthesia soon became the \\"standard encyclopedic textbook of anesthesia\\". In 1991, the third edition was released in two volumes with the involvement of more international contributors. The sixth edition was noted for its illustrations of technical procedures such as ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access, caudal block in pediatric populations and anesthesia for robot-assisted surgery. New video segments were created for the accompanying CD demonstrations of techniques such as tracheal intubation and needle cricothyrotomy. In 2010, the seventh edition was released with a downloadable video library for extra anesthesia procedures. In 2015, the eight edition was released with more than 3200 pages in two volumes and nine main sections. Major updates include ten new chapters covering robot- administered anesthesia, non-operating room anesthesia, non-opioid analgesics, and anesthetic neurotoxicity. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has recommended Miller's Anesthesia as an essential textbook for preparations for a career in anesthesiology.

She was born on 9 February 1900 in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, to Miguel Corval√°n and Ana Casco. She studied at the National College, graduating in 1918, and was the only woman of the 40 graduates in that term. Between 1919 and 1921, she was actively campaigning for women's rights. She was a co-founder and participant in the Centro Feminista Paraguayo (Paraguayan Feminist Center), which was pushing for passage of the draft law on equal rights between men and women, introduced by deputy Tel√©maco Silvera. The Center was the first feminist organization in Paraguay and included members such as Serafina D√°valos, Carmen Garcete, Carmen Gatti, Felicidad Gonz√°lez, Adela Ib√°√±ez, Ermelinda Ortiz, Sabrina Sapena Pastor, Catalina Steward, and Elida Ugarriza, among many others. Corval√°n went on to study law and obtained a doctorate of law and social sciences in 1923, becoming the second woman in Paraguay to hold the distinction. Her thesis, entitled \\"Femininismo: La causa de la mujer en el Paraguay\\" (Feminism, the cause of women in Paraguay), was published in 1925, and argued from a feminist perspective women's equality in intelligence and virtue, establishing a foundation as to why they should have the right to vote. She argued that while men were heroes for their participation in war, the sacrifices of women for the country were unrecognized. In 1926 she married Dr. Peter Lar√°n. During the Chaco War, Lar√°n was a Judge Advocate General in the Comanchaco and Corval√°n served as his assistant. After the war ended in 1936, she became the Minister of the Women's Union of Paraguay. Corval√°n often linked feminism with socialism focusing on worker's issues. She spoke German, French and English in addition to her native tongue, which allowed her to serve as the legal representative for the Cinema Splendid of the House Pret√°n of Paris and the German Colony of Paraguay.

The club was established by supporters of former Belgian champion K.S.K. Beveren, after the unofficial merger of their team with Red Star Waasland in May 2010. It is the first and currently the only Belgian team that is completely fan-owned and applies the principles of Supporters Direct. History After a long period of financial struggle and a very likely relegation from the Belgian Second Division, the board members of K.S.K. Beveren decided in May 2010 to terminate all male senior footballing activities for the next season. This decision came after political pressure at community level and was the result of expensive investments in the club's Freethiel Stadion. It then was decided that instead of K.S.K. Beveren, the local neighbours of K.F.C. Red Star Waasland (a small but financially healthy club) would start the 2010‚Äì2011 season at the Freethiel Stadion. As a concession to the Beveren supporters, the club changed its name to Waasland- Beveren, its colours to yellow-blue-red and its badge into a newly created one. However, the majority of the board members, the manager and the players of Red Star Waasland moved to Beveren and the club took on the football association's number of Waasland (4068). For many supporters this concession wasn't enough. While hundreds of fans simply stayed away from the new club Waasland-Beveren, a fraction of them started a new project. On August 4, 2010, a new website was launched, www.eskabee.be, in order to commemorate the rich past of K.S.K. Beveren and to restart a new team in the lower Belgian divisions. In a couple of weeks the new site received over 500 registrees and drew attention from several national newspapers, who reported the \\"Resurrection of KSK Beveren from its ashes\\". One of the figureheads of the new project was former Dutch international Wim Hofkens, who played for K.S.K. Beveren between 1976 and 1980. On January 12, 2011, the official website reported that the VZW Eskabee 1935 was formed and that the statutes were written. On January 21, 2011, these statutes were signed by the ten founding members of the VZW, including chairman Andre Bolsens, a local doctor who was the only board member of K.S.K. Beveren that voted against the merger of May 2010. The new club also announced their cooperation with Supporters Direct and their clear ambition to restart footballing activities in the lowest Belgian division. On March 23, 2011, the club played its first unofficial friendly game against the Under 19s team of local club HRS Haasdonk. The match served as a testing training in order to form a team for the 2011‚Äì2012 season under the management of Wim Hofkens. Beveren won the game by 2‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of nearly 350 spectators. Shortly after the match, the club officially sent a request to the Royal Belgian Football Association to register their team for the upcoming season under the name 'Supporterskring Beveren'. On April 5, 2011, the Municipality of Beveren announced that there was no place for the new club in their town, despite earlier agreements with the Schepen of Sports and several talks with Waasland-Beveren about the use of the training fields surrounding Freethiel Stadion. Despite this major setback, the club played a second testing match against the KSK Kallo reserve team the following evening and won again, this time with 2‚Äì5 in front of 300 spectators. During the first General Assembly of the VZW on April 25, 2011, it was decided that the club would start playing its first season in the neighboring city of Sint-Niklaas, specifically at a training field of former 2nd Division club Sportkring Sint- Niklaas. Instead of 'Supporterskring Beveren', which was denied by the Royal Belgian Football Association, the name 'Yellow Blue Beveren' was chosen, referring to the club colours and taking Yellow Red K.V. Mechelen as an example in that regard. The club received registration number 9577 from the Royal Belgian Football Association, but has always maintained the ambition of recovering the number 2300 from K.S.K. Beveren in the future as a rightful heir of its legacy.http://www.eskabee.be/images/articles/svmdebasiseskabee.pdf On May 30, 2011 both the agreement with Sportkring Sint-Niklaas and the registration with the Royal Belgian Football Association were settled, so YB SK Beveren was finally able to start playing football in the 2011‚Äì2012 season. On July 24, 2011, YB SK Beveren played its first official pre-season friendly and lost against Belgica Edegem. On September 4, 2011 started the competition with a 2‚Äì2 draw in an away game against Hardy Waasmunster, with striker Bjorn Van Der Stighelen scoring the first official goal for the club in front of over 300 fans. The following week YB SK Beveren won its first home game against VK Tielrode with 1‚Äì0 in front of 450 fans, again causing significant media attention from several national football websites. After a promising start the club failed to confirm, resulting in a bad streak and the resignation of Wim Hofkens as a manager. His successor Luc Piessens debuted in the worst imaginable way losing 9‚Äì1 away to Haasdonk B, which is to date the worst defeat ever of YB SK Beveren. On January 5, 2012 founding board member Wim Hofkens left the club definitively after his earlier resignation as a manager. Despite the relatively poor results 270 fans visited the away game against SK Belsele. In an atmospheric game played in Red Star Waasland's former home, the Puyenbekestadion, Beveren won with 0‚Äì2. Early March, active player Margino De Kerf took over as manager for the remainder of the season. Beveren ended the 2011‚Äì2012 season in a disappointing 11th position.http://www.vbal4.be/a2011/p010566.htm Since the beginning of the year 2012 several meetings between the club and the Municipality of Beveren took place, in which the possibility of returning to home town Beveren was discussed. Early March, Major Marc Van De Vijver declared in local media that there was a very big chance that the club was yet again welcome in his village, since the fans of the club had proved during the first season that there were no significant security risks during their matches.http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/hd3msg1s Early April, the General Assembly of the club voted in favour of a return to Beveren, despite the good relationship with Sportkring Sint- Niklaas.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/581 On August 5, 2012, YB SK Beveren played its first official game in its hometown Beveren in an East- Flanders Cup (a qualification tournament of the Beker van Belgi√´) game against Hardy Waasmunster. The club was granted permission to play its home games on a former training field of KSK Beveren near the Freethiel, sharing its usage with Waasland-Beveren.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/654 While the supporters could celebrate the return to their home soil, on the field affairs kept on lacking stability as proven by the resignation of the sporting director before competition even started.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/675 After a string of disappointing results, head coach Margino De Kerf was dismissed and replaced by assistant coach Kurt Dierick.http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20121120_00375807# Under the new head coach, Beveren won a series of matches to eventually obtain a place in the promotion playoffs. The decisive match against Overmere was played in Freethiel Stadium, which meant the return of the club to their spiritual home almost three years after the dissolving of KSK Beveren.https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2013-04-16/sk-beveren- speelt-match-op-de-freethielhttp://www.eskabee.be/news/article/858 In the playoffs Beveren drew a bye for the first round, which meant that they only had to win one away game against Wippelgem in order to achieve promotion.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/861 In a tight game, Beveren won 1‚Äì2 with Alexander Vereecken and Koen Strybos scoring before a crowd of nearly 500 travelling fans.http://www.indehekken.net/een-nieuwe- dimensie/http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/867 After a promising start of the season, newly promoted Beveren started to struggle in the higher division with inter alia a devastating 8‚Äì0 loss at Sinaai who would eventually become the new champion.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/928 At the end of October, the sporting director as well as several new signings left the club due to the bad results and disagreements with the board.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/955 A few weeks later, head coach Kurt Dierick became the new sporting director with his first assignment being the search for a replacement for himself as head coach.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/961 On November 6, 2013 Benny Van Polfliet was appointed as new head coach.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/964https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2013-11-07/beveren- stelt-nieuwe-trainer- voor?ref=team_newshttp://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20131106_00826891 During the winter break, three new players were added to the team.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/991http://www.ed.nl/sport/amateurvoetbal/1e-klasse- c-zondag-zuid-i/chelah-en-maessen-verruilen-nieuw-woensel-voor- beveren-1.4161199http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20131222_00899690 Amongst them were two Dutchmen who came through the youth system of PSV Eindhoven and one of them, Rachid Chelah,http://www.psvjeugd.nl/spelers/62http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.joueurs.rachid.chelah.107429.en.html even had a past as a professional a few years earlier. After an away defeat against relegation rivals White Boys Sint-Niklaas, Benny Van Polfliet was dismissed after being in charge for not even two months.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1004 A few weeks later, former KSK Beveren professional player Stefan Van Rumsthttp://www.worldfootball.net/player_summary/stefan-van-rumst/ was appointed as new head coach.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1009 A few days later, the whole technical staff except the head coach and the sporting director left the club, being disappointed in the board's decision of choosing Van Rumst.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1014 Eventually YB SK Beveren ended in last place with only 17 points and relegated back to the 4th Provincial League.http://www.vbal4.be/a2013/p010545.htm YB SK Beveren started the 2014‚Äì2015 with new hopes and a lot of new players. Pre-season friendlies and tournaments promised the best, as Beveren won its first trophy with the Beker van Beveren. A late winner from Lenny Laureys proved enough to beat KFC Vrasene in the final.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1087http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws- uit-beveren/yellow-blue-kan-beker-van-beveren-in-de-wacht-slepen-a2039534/ The club also reached the final of the Waasland Cup,http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1118 but lost to White Boys Sint- Niklaas with 4‚Äì2.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1143 Competition started well with inter alia an 8‚Äì0 home win against Baasrode at KSK Beveren's 79th birthday,http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1099 but a black November month in which the club lost to local neighbours Bosdamhttp://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1150 and suffered its worst defeat of the season in a 5-0 battering at Belselehttp://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1155 promised another difficult year in Belgium's bottom league. After the return of several injured players, Beveren won eight matches in a row from late December until early March (the longest winning streak in their history until that point), bringing them back to second place in the league. On April 18, 2015 Beveren secured a place in the play-offs for promotion with a 3‚Äì1 home win against SK Belsele.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1236 On May 5, 2015 Beveren won the play-offs and secured promotion to the 3rd Provincial League with a convincing 0‚Äì5 away win at Rupelmonde. Player of the Season Dominique Lefevre, Kristof Van Rumst, Jimmy Potithai and Lenny Laureys scored before half-time, while Potithai added its second of the afternoon after the break. More than 500 fans made the trip to Rupelmonde, providing a big atmosphere.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1243 Newly promoted Beveren started the 2015‚Äì2016 season with a deserved draw at White Boys Sint-Niklaas, obtained by a last gasp goal by captain Tom Van Den Eede,http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1293 who would become a few weeks later the first player of YB SK Beveren to perform in 100 league games. A week later the club celebrated the 80th birthday of KSK Beveren with a party, a firework spectacle and a close win against Hamme- Zogge.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1297 Furthermore, the day after the club released the first part of its book that commemorates the rich past of KSK Beveren. Several of the most notable players were presented at the official release event, including Jean-Marie Pfaff, Wilfried Van Moer and Jean Janssens (the three Beveren players who won the Belgian Golden Shoe).http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1299http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit- beveren/fans-schrijven-clubgeschiedenis- neer-a2449511/https://www.eskabeefanshop.be/ The club also appeared in Belgium's most important football magazine which discussed the story of the authors of the book.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1327 The festivities however were halted a few weeks later, when an incident took place between some fans during the home game against SK Wachtebeke (see section Rivalries) which would eventually lead to a 0‚Äì5 loss and a 1500 euro fine from the Royal Belgian Football Association.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1323 Despite having the chance to obtain a ticket for the play-offs in February, YB SK Beveren ended the season in mid-table, hereby meeting the goal of staying in the division. Supporters and friendships across Europe From the early beginnings, YB SK Beveren took AFC Wimbledon as an excellent example of a successful club based on fan participation. In December 2010 a delegation of fans, board members and a local television (TV Oost) crew took a bus trip to London for the Wimbledon home game against Wrexham F.C., but were forced to return because of the postponement of the match due to heavy snowfall. The trip was rescheduled to March 12, 2011 for the home game of the Dons against the Kidderminster Harriers F.C. AFC Wimbledon announced the visit on their official website and wrote an article about their Belgian followers in the official match day program. A couple of weeks later the famous English football magazine FourFourTwo also reported about the influence of AFC Wimbledon on YB SK Beveren.http://www.eskabee.be/images/articles/wimbledon442eskabee.pdf Another English club who has received frequent visits of YB SK Beveren is F.C. United of Manchester, who themselves are a fan-owned club since 2005. In April 2011 several board members of Beveren travelled to Manchester to meet the club's president Andy Walsh and Supporters Direct representative Kevin Rye. The club's board members were invited to the playing field before kick-off and were introduced to the fans. On March 10, 2012 several board members and supporters of Beveren visited the club for their home game against Stocksbridge Park Steels.

In early January 2013, a group of frustrated fans of Sint-Truidense V.V. declared the start of a new club, taking YB SK Beveren as an example (however the attempt to do this led to nothing).http://www.voetbalbelgie.be/nl/article.php?id=60583 YB SK Beveren is a fan-owned club member of Supporters Direct and applies the principles of the organisation. Beveren's board member Jim Van De Vyver made some important contributions to the 'Improving Football Governance through Supporter Involvement and Community Ownership' Project, which was financed by the European Commission.http://eskabee.be/news/article/598http://www.supporters- direct.org/homepage/what-we-do/europe-2/ec-project In early March 2014, Van De Vyver and the VZW Eskabee 1935 in cooperation with Supporters Direct presented a toolkithttp://www.eskabee.be/downloads/toolkit_belgium.pdf with instructions for Belgian teams to introduce fan participation.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1023http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1023 On February 4, 2015 the club was invited to the opening session of the Intergroup Sport, a project of the European Commission with co-presidents Santiago Fisas and Marc Tarabella, to discuss the importance of sport in Europe and to improve the future of football.http://www.sport.ee/et/file/.../201501january_2015.pdfhttp://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1191 Rivalries K.S.K. Beveren has a long-standing rivalry with fellow Waasland club Sporting Lokeren. Even in the lowest divisions this caused tension at several occasions between both sets of fans, especially in YB SK Beveren's away games against clubs from the neighbouring villages of Lokeren. This resulted in unusual safety regulations for the away game against FC Eksaarde in November 2011, a match which the club won in convincing style with 0‚Äì3 after a long period without winning. The club's promotion in 2013 meant that Beveren would again face opposition of clubs from around the Lokeren municipality. Special safety regulations were instructed for the away game at SK Lokeren-Doorslaar.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/934 Early October 2013, major Rudy Van Cronenburg of Wachtebeke decided to postpone the match between SK Wachtebeke and YB SK Beveren due to security risks. The main reason for this risk lay in the fact that local police had intercepted plans of fans of Sporting Lokeren to reunite with their colleagues of Dutch side NAC Breda in order to interrupt the game and clash with supporters of Beveren.http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20131009_00783269http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/9091/Time- out/article/detail/1720088/2013/10/09/Hooligans-Lokeren-en-NAC-verhinderen- wedstrijd-in-derde- provinciale.dhtmlhttps://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2013-10-10/lokeren- hooligans-verhinderen-provinciale-wedstrijd Eventually, the match was played at the end of December and ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw. A police force was present in large numbers, but no incidents occurred.http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blamu_20131222_003http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/995 The rivalry between Beveren and Lokeren fans was only more fueled up by the home game against Daknam. With 5 minutes on the clock and Beveren up 3‚Äì2, the referee decided to pause the game due to smoke circulation on the field caused by fireworks, but the visitors subsequently refused to finish the match because they felt threatened.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/954 Almost a month later, the provincial disciplinary committee of the Royal Belgian Football Association decided that the Daknam players had no reason for the refusal and punished Daknam with a 5‚Äì0 defeat.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/965https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2013-11-17/match- stilgelegd-en-forfaitscore-na-bengaals-vuur?ref=team_news Things really went bad in the 2015‚Äì2016 season, in which the club returned to the 3rd Provincial League. On October 10, 2015, during a home game against Wachtebeke, some fans had an argument which resulted in a brawl on the sidelines. While the situation was quickly under control, the referee decided to end the game with a couple of minutes remaining. Monday's newspapers reported a massive fight of hooligans against the opposition side.http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit- beveren/harde-kern-yellow-blue-schopt- keet-a2486634/http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-wachtebeke/ouders-van-keeper- krijgen-klappen-a2486727/ On October 13, 2015, the club placed an official statement on its website in which it acknowledged the brawl, but severely criticised the local media for its reporting.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1316 A day later, the mayors of Lokeren, Wachtebeke and Lochristi asked the Royal Belgian Football Association to postpone upcoming fixtures against Zaffelare, Beervelde, Eksaarde and Wachtebeke (return fixtures).https://www.tvoost.be/nieuws/burgemeesters- vragen-uitstel-van-wedstrijden-tegen-yellow-blue-sk- beveren-19299http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-beveren/yellow-blue-nergens- meer- welkom-a2489066/http://www.lochristi.be/nieuwsdetail/239/voetbalwedstrijden- uitgesteld-wegens-veiligheidsrisico The incident would eventually lead to a 0‚Äì5 loss and a 1500 euro fine from the Royal Belgian Football Association.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1323 On November 2, 2015, the club appealed the decision,http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1326 but the Royal Belgian Football Association rejected the appeal.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1339 Eventually, the majors decided to forbid fans to watch the games against Eksaarde, Zaffelare and Wachtebeke, an unprecedented measure in Belgian provincial football. The club reacted by offering their fans the chance to watch the game via a livestream.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1359 YB SK Beveren's closest neighbours are FC Bosdam, whose playing field is just a few hundred metres away. This derby match takes place in a friendly but atmospheric fashion. After a 0‚Äì2 loss before the winter break, YBSKB won its first 'Beveren Derby' with 1‚Äì2 in March 2012. The derby became a bit more intense during the 2012‚Äì2013 season, mainly because of an ongoing dispute between Bosdam's players and Beveren's head coach during a scintillating home game early 2013 which ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw.http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/794http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20120827_00273519 The last season in which both teams played each other was the 2014‚Äì2015 season: Bosdam won 2‚Äì0 in November,http://www.eskabee.be/news/article/1150 while Beveren demolished the neighbours in the return match with a 5‚Äì1 win.http://eskabee.be/nieuws/artikel/1231 References Football clubs in Belgium Sport in East Flanders Beveren ","title":"YB SK Beveren"},{"id":"46589741","text":"Peter Masten Dunne (1889‚Äì1957) was a prolific historian of the 17th- and 18th- century Jesuit missions of northwestern New Spain.

The play, a commercial success, shifted the focus of Parsi theatre from historical dramas to farces and comedies and featured such renowned technicians as Burjor Mistry, Anand Pai and Shahdeo. He and his manager, Pesi Khandalawala, were pioneers of paying and profit sharing with the members of an amateur theatre group. Marzban was active in drama societies such as Amateur Dramatic Circle, Theatre Group, the Indian People's Theatre Association, The Bombay Players, The Players Guild and Parsee Arts Circle and brought together many known theatre personalities like William Linford, Oovernaya Burekhan, Jimmy Pocha, Bachi Chaina, Homi Narielwala, Naju Bhabha, Jehangir Anklesaria, Aloo Dubash, Piloo Sethna and Coomi Karani. He is known to have staged over 100 plays in Parsi language and wrote several TV programmes such as Aavo Mari Sathe and the quiz series, What's the Good Word? His weekly radio show Buddhi Dhan Shak Mandal (Association for Dhan Shaka popular Parsi recipe ) with C. C. Mehta on the All India Radio became popular with listeners for which he had written around 5000 scripts. He was a trained musician and could play the piano, guitar, clarinet, keyboards and ukulele. He also learned painting under Walter Langhammer, an Austrian painter. He was proficient in magic, ventriloquism and Western dance which he used to share with his fellows. He used to improvise the dialogues in plays during rehearsals and had a great sense of comic timing. His plays were known for the scene and light design as well as music. Due to his experience in journalism, his plays were natural, socially relevant and well crafted. His most successful productions were Katariyun Gap (The Head Is Lost), Ardhi Rate Ahat (Knock at Midnight), Kaka Thaya Vanka (Uncle Behaves Funny), Behram ni Sasu (Behram's Mother-in-law), Mota Dil na Bava (Large-hearted Elder), and English plays like Brandon Thomas's Charley's Aunt and J. B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls. Ah! Norman (adapted from Norman, Is That You? by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, 1972) was a massive hit among the audience. He trained several young actor-directors like Phiroz Antia, Homi Tawadia, Burjor Patel and Ruby Patel who continued the Parsi theatre tradition. He also wrote the screenplay for the film, On Wings of Fire, a film on the history of Zoroastrianism directed by Cyrus Bharucha, featuring Zubin Mehta. He also wrote script of Carnival Queen (1955), an action film starring Fearless Nadia. Marzban was married to Silla, a TV personality and a litt√©rateur, and the couple resided at Chapsey Terrace, along Altamount Road in Mumbai. A smoker, Marzban was diagnosed with lung cancer which forced him to quit the habit and in February 1987, he died at the age of 72, succumbing to the disease. Recognition The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1964 and he received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1970. Major productions The first notable play from Marzban was a thriller by name, Ardhi Raate Aafat.

George Home was supposed to have argued with the Regent Morton for the restitution of the estates of Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home whose father had supported Mary, Queen of Scots. Morton argued that this would be to George Home's own detriment.Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland from the Reformation to the Revolution, vol. 1, (Edinburgh 1858), pp. 120-3 According to Godscroft, George explained his loyalty to the young chief of his family, answering; > \\"the Lord Hume was his chief, and he could not see his house ruined; if they > were unkinde he could not do withall, that would be their own fault; this he > thought himself bound to do, and for his own part whatsoever their carriage > were to him, he would do his duty to them; if his chief should turne him out > at the fronte-doore, he would come in again the back-doore.\\"David Reid, ed., > David Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 1, (Edinburgh > 2005), p. 246 The Earl of Home was restored to his estates with the help of the Erskine brothers, the Commendators of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth, kinsmen of George Home's wife. George Home's remark has been quoted by more recent historians including Gordon Donaldson as an example of an expression of family solidarity in the Scottish borders.Gordon Donaldson, Knox the Man, (Edinburgh 1975), p. 10 Hume of Godscroft had earlier used the example of front door and back door in a pro-Unionist tract, describing it as a tired argument against the union of Scotland and England.Paul J.

He is best known as one of the observers appointed by the Royal Society to observe the 1761 transit of Venus with Nevil Maskelyne on the island of Saint Helena. On that voyage they made successful use of the lunar- distance method of establishing longitude at sea. Waddington subsequently taught the method at his academy in London and published a navigation manual, A Practical Method for Finding the Longitude and Latitude of a Ship at Sea, by Observations of the Moon (1763). Life before 1761 Little is known about Waddington's early life, although he was probably the \\"Mr. Rob. Waddington of Hull\\" who appeared in The Gentleman's Diary or The Mathematical Repository in 1758 and Benjamin Martin's General Magazine of Arts and Sciences in 1759. The papers of the gentleman astronomer Nathaniel Pigott show that Waddington was living in his household, in Whitton, Middlesex, immediately before his appointment as an observer by the Royal Society. It is from these manuscripts that we have a detailed knowledge of Waddington's experience of the Saint Helena expedition and his subsequent attempts to forge a career as a teacher, mathematical practitioner and longitude projector. Voyage to Saint Helena In 1760 Waddington was appointed by the Royal Society to accompany Nevil Maskelyne on a voyage to Saint Helena as one of two expeditions being organised by the Society, and paid for by George II, to observe the 1761 Transit of Venus. The expedition's equipment was ordered by Maskelyne and the Society arranged transport from the East India Company. The Directors of the East India Company in London wrote to The Governor of St Helena on 31 December 1760 to inform them that \\"Revd. Mr. Nevil Maskelyne and Mr. Robert Waddington take passage on the Prince Henry to St. Helena. As this is done to make some improvements in Astronomy which will be of general utility the two last named gentlemen are upon their arrival and during their stay to be accommodated by you in a suitable manner with diet and apartments at the Company's expense and you are to give them all the assistance as to materials, workmen, and whatsoever else the service they are employed upon may require.\\" The reply confirmed their readiness to help and stated \\"We have already erected an observatory for them in the country\\". In the event, Waddington and Maskelyne's view of the transit of Venus on 6 July 1761 was thwarted by clouds. However, the voyages to and from the island proved to be very significant to the subsequent careers of both men as they used it to make longitude determinations by the lunar-distance method testing the accuracy of lunar tables calculated by Tobias Mayer. Maskelyne's log of the voyage records their efforts to do this, with the assistance of officers from the ship, and refers to the use of \\"Mr Waddington's Quadrant\\", a Hadley's quadrant adapted by him to better facilitate lunar-distance observations Waddington kept his own account of the voyages, and seems to have produced more accurate observations than Maskelyne. He told Piggott that their observations \\"finds a Practical & Certain Method\\" of determining longitude \\"& may be depended upon to one Degree of Longitude\\". This wording and degree of accuracy echoes that in the 1714 Longitude Act, which offered a reward of ¬£10,000 for methods that kept or found longitude to within a degree. Subsequent career Waddington returned from Saint Helena before Maskelyne, who stayed on to attempt observations of the parallax of Sirius. He arrived back in London on 21 September 1761 and began to forge a career around providing teaching and texts on navigation, particularly the lunar-distance method of finding longitude. Waddington, having announced publicly by his method longitude \\"may be generally obtained to less than half a Degree, and always to less than One Degree\\", hoped that he might be in a position to receive a reward from the Board of Longitude. His contribution was a method of observing and computing the data, but was based on Mayer's lunar tables and the earlier publication of precomputed tables and rules by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. His 1763 Practical Method for Finding the Longitude included such instructions and tables, which he claimed would reduce the necessary computation from several hours to three-quarters of an hour. Maskelyne, on his return to London, produced his own version of such a text in the same year, The British Mariner's Guide, although never seems to have expected a reward from the Board of Longitude for his effort. Waddington styled himself \\"Teacher of Mathematics at the Mathematical Academy in Three Tun-court, Mile's-lane, London\\", where he taught officers of the East India Company and also sold Hadley's quadrants. In 1763 he attempted, unsuccessfully, to gain employment from the Royal Society. By 1764 he had moved to Rolls Building, Chancery Lane. He reported to Piggott his hopes that he and Maskelyne might gain the interest of the Board of Longitude but his only formal approach to them seems to have been in 1771, when a petition was read at a meeting on 11 May stating that he had much improved, and successfully trialled, the steering compass, or binnacle. In 1777 he published his longest and most comprehensive work, An Epitome of Theoretical and Practical Navigation. As The Edinburgh Magazine reported in 1778, he claimed that the book could \\"teach the young navigator every particular essential to his art, without his being under the necessity of having recourse to any other author.\\" Waddington's will, dated 12 May 1775 and proved posthumously in 1779, states his address as Downing Street, Westminster. His wife, Margaret, was the beneficiary.

It consists of Church of Presentation of Virgin Mary and town fortifications. It is situated in south-western part of the historic centre between Street ƒåesk√°, the bank of the river Mal≈°e and the Piaristic square where used to be the town cemetery. Today, the monastery belongs to the cultural heritage of the Czech Republic and there is placed the Artistic school. History The Origin The Dominican monastery in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice with the well-preserved Gothic cloister was built at the same time as the city. It was probably the first town building in the city of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. The city was ranked among royal towns during the reign of king Ottokar II of Bohemia. The city was founded in 1265 by the Czech king Ottokar II of Bohemia. The monastery was founded probably a few years before by the same king. Construction- 13th and 14th century The monastery was part of the town fortifications as was usual at that time. The monastery belonged to the order of Dominicans since its beginning. The cloister of monastery and the Church of Presentation of Virgin Mary are the only remains of the early gothic complex. Plans of the monastery were changed even during the construction in the 13th century. The whole monastery complex was probably completed at the beginning of the 14th century. Baroque and neogothic reconstructions Numerous fires are the reason of a lot of reconstructions. The most devastating fire destroyed convent buildings in 1723. The monastery was abolished by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1785. Piarists took it over and they set up the dormitory. They were replaced by Redemptonstis in 1885 who rebuilt the monastery in Neogothic style and they left in 1949 because of the communism regime. Nowadays The church belongs to the diocese of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. During communism regime there was the Artistic School, Revenue Authority, Academy of Komensk√Ω and school canteen. Since 1990, there is the Artistic School for children. Exterior The exterior of monastery unlike the church is marked by numerous, mainly Baroque, reconstructions. Reconstructions are visible on the facade chiefly on the roof extension with noticeable baroque elliptic windows. Original gothic tower with the bulb dome was completely rebuilt in Baroque style except one Gothic window which remained on the first floor. All exterior portals are also Baroque apart from the Gothic one in the south- western part of the monastery¬¥s wall. The arches of the cloister and the first floor towards the heavenly court are maintained in the Gothic style. The tracery of windows isn‚Äôt original; windows in two arches of cloister and neogothic extension in court have neogothic division. The first lanced arch consists of small saddle portal; tapered tracery with three and four-leaves, is decorated by another tracery in flamboyant style. The second tracery is divided by more dense net of spherical triangles and three and four-leaves. Narrow windows on the five-side extension in the court are divided into two parts and triangle with three-leaves. Interior Wall picture of the Holy Virgin, patron of ƒåesk√© BudƒõjoviceThe most significant interior architectural monument is the inner wall of cloister. On the wall of cloister there are visible wall-paintings, remains of former portals, niches and windows with preserved metal division which are wall up nowadays. Some parts which are surrounded by the arch and the bracket contain both the right window and the portal beside it. The rest of the field was decorated by wall-paintings. Vault is cross like in the church and ribs have similar profile as the ribs in the church. Brackets in inner side of cloister are simply formed without decoration; we can also find atypical supports with vegetable motives. In the court direction the arc is supported by two columns with heads decorated by vegetable motives. In other corners pillars with undecorated heads step 10 cm in space. Each bay of the vault between ribs was decorated as well as walls. The most valuable wall-picture is located in the cloister and shows Holy Virgin, the patron of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, who hides real figures of the emperor Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and his son Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia under the open coat. Painting dates back probably to 1378. Between 5 and 7 May 1378 the emperor Charles IV with his 17-year-old son spent their time in the royal town ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice where they were attending meeting with Czech aristocrats, ecclesiastics and the nobleman of the Holy Roman Empire. It is also necessary to mention well-preserved gothic extension above well called \\"Well Chapel\\" in southern part of cloister. Curiosity Many legends are associated with the foundation of the monastery by king Ottokar II of Bohemia. They explain for example the name of the city. According to one legend, king Ottokar II of Bohemia promised to found the monastery on place where he got the news about the birth of his first child, a boy. It happened at the confluence of the rivers Vltava and Mal≈°e. It was said that king exclaimed \\"It will be more than one\\" thinking about other children. It is the explanation of the name Budƒõjovice (\\"bude\\" in Czech=it will be in English, \\"v√≠ce\\" in Czech= more than one in English) Another legend says that Ottokar¬¥s words were said in connection with increasing Dominican‚Äôs settlement. However ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice were founded on the green grassland, it is documented that small villages were there before the foundation. Some theories claim that ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice inherited the name from the Czech noblemen Budivoj who was the member of noble family V√≠tkovci. No version denies that the monastery was founded earlier than the town. Writer Jan Styral coming from ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice also claimed it in the 16th century. He agreed with the version about the birth of descendant, which was disproved by Bohuslav Balb√≠n who said that the monastery was founded as result of king Ottokar II of Bohemia¬¥s wish having his child with his first wife Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia.

Parvin Theodore Sutton Parvin was born on the 15th of January, 1817, in Cumberland County, New Jersey. In 1833 he graduated at Woodworth College, Ohio, and began the study of law, graduating at the Cincinnati Law School in 1837. In 1838 Robert Lucas, who had been appointed Governor of the new Territory of Iowa, selected Mr. Parvin for his private secretary. He accompanied the Governor to Burlington where he was appointed to take charge of the Territorial library. In 1839 Mr. Parvin was appointed District Attorney of the middle District and removed to Bloomington. He served three terms as probate judge. In 1844 he rendered Iowa an enduring service by cooperating with Enoch W. Eastman and Frederick D. Mills in defeating the Constitution which proposed to deprive the State of the counties of the Missouri slope. Upon the organization of the United States District Court in 1846 Mr. Parvin was appointed clerk, a position he held ten years. In 1857 he was nominated for Register of the State Land Office by the Democrats and, notwithstanding the Republican majority of more than 2,000 in the election for Governor the same year, Mr. Parvin was elected. He was one of the first trustees of the State University and was for ten years professor of natural science in that institution. He was one of the organizers of the State Historical Society and served several years as its secretary and as editor of the Annals of Iowa, an historical magazine published by the society. Mr. Parvin made large contributions to the library, newspaper files and general collections of that Society, and for more than thirty years was one of the most valued writers of historical and biographical articles for the Annals of Iowa and the Historical Record. Having been one of the first officials of the Territory and long associated with its public affairs, personally acquainted with prominent men of all parties for more than sixty years, Mr. Parvin was long regarded the highest authority on Iowa history and biography. He was one of the founders of the Masonic Order of Iowa and has been Grand Master and Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of the State many years. In his capacity as secretary he collected at their building at Cedar Rapids the most extensive Masonic library in the world. He also collected and donated to the library a more complete collection of Iowa books and rare documents than is possessed by any other library. Mr. Parvin's contributions of early Iowa newspapers, legislative journals and session laws, long out of print and other rare publications to the State and Historical libraries have been continuous and exceedingly valuable. He was one of the most valued members of the Pioneer Lawmakers' Association and his historical contributions to that organization have been of great value. His writings and addresses on historical subjects relating to Iowa for half a century would fill several volumes. He died at his home at Cedar Rapids, June 28, 1901. Parvin served as a schoolteacher in Cincinnati schools for a number of years; among his pupils there was the painter George Henry Yewell, later to become prominent in Iowa affairs himself.

In 2009 he was awarded Padma Shri by the Government of India for his contributions to the study of Indian art. Early life and education Pal was born in Bengal, British India and received his early schooling in Shillong, Darjeeling and Calcutta. Studying at the University of Calcutta, he hoped to specialize in anthropology, but the university didn't offer any courses in the area in 1957, and he instead obtained a Master of Arts degree in ancient Indian history and culture. He continued at the university to earn a PhD in the history of Nepali architecture in 1962. He then won a scholarship to Cambridge University, where in 1965 he earned a second PhD in Nepali sculpture and painting. However he failed to get a teaching job in India, and moved to the US instead. Career In 1967 Pal was appointed the curator of the Indian art collection at Boston Museum, a position that had previously been held by Ananda Coomaraswamy. In 1969, he moved to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which was then beginning to develop its own collection of Indian art. Pal joined as the head of department of Indian and Islamic art, and subsequently served as the museum's acting director (1979‚Äì80) and as the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art from 1981. Los Angeles Times art writer Suzanne Muchnic described his legacy as building the museum's collection from \\"a handful of items to about 4,000 pieces, giving LACMA one of the nation's preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art.\\" In 1995, Pal was appointed visiting curator of Indian, Himalayan and Southeast Asian Art at The Art Institute of Chicago.

The volume was so popular that it was re-issued several times.Viscountess Strangford, University of Wales, retrieved 3 May 2015 Of the ancient oasis city, Palmyra she writes: \\"I was once asked whether Palmyra was \\"not a broken-down old thing in a style of slovenly decadence?\\" It is true its style is neither pure nor severe: nothing over which the lavish hand of hasty and Imperial Rome has passed is ever so: but, Tadmor [Palmyra] is free from all the vulgarity of real decadence; it is so entirely irregular as to be sometimes fantastic; the designs are overflowing with richness and fancy, but it is never heavy: it is free, independent, bizarre, but never ungraceful; grand indeed, though hardly sublime, it is almost always bewitchingly beautiful.\\" (pp. 239‚Äì40)Color lithograph panorama of Palmyra, Syria by Nicholas Hanhart after Emily Anne Beaufort Smythe, 1862. Egyptian Sepulchres and Syrian Shrines by Beaufort Strangford received a critical review of her 1861 book Egyptian Sepulchres and Syrian Shrines by Percy Smythe, later Viscount Strangford. Unusually, this led to them meeting and their marriage. In 1859 and 1860 she was travelling in Smyrna, Rhodes, Mersin, Tripoli, Beirut, Baalbek, Athens, Attica, the Pentelicus mountains, Constantinople and Belgrade. During the whole journey she kept a journal recording all that she experienced.Viscountess Emily Anne Beaufort Smyth Strangford Journal, 1859-1860, Duke University, retrieved 2 May 2015 When Strangford published her second book Eastern Shores of the Adriatic in 1864 it had a final anonymous chapter title \\"Chaos,\\" which is attributed to her husband, Percy Smythe, 8th Viscount Strangford. This work is considered important in his writing career. Her husband was twice president of the Royal Asiatic Society in the 1860s. He died in 1869 and as they had no children his titles became extinct. Widow and nurse Following her husband's death Strangford volunteered to serve as a nurse in (probably) University College Hospital in London. In 1874 her studies led her to advocate a change in the way that nurses were trained. She published Hospital Training for Ladies: an Appeal to the Hospital Boards in England. She advocated that nurses should be allowed to train and work part-time. She believed that the training to be a nurse would benefit many women in their role within a family. This idea did not gain official backing as the major objective at the time was to establish nursing as a profession and not as a part-time activity for amateurs. a massacre had taken place in May 1876 The war crimes that were taking place in Bulgaria in 1876 gained her attention. Christians had suffered massacres by the Ottomans and Strangford initially joined one committee and then she set up her own. via Internet Archive Thousands of pounds were raised by the Bulgarian Peasants Relief Fund and she went to Bulgaria in 1876 with Robert Jasper More, eight doctors and eight nurses. Both she and More wrote letters to The Times to report and gather more funds. Strangford believed that the Bulgarians and not the Serbs would be important as the Ottoman Empire shrank. These were views that she had shared with her husband. Strangford found the Bulgarians to just need the tools for their own self-improvement and she was impressed that their first priority was a school. She built a hospital at Batak and eventually other hospitals were built at Radilovo, Panagiurishte, Perushtitsa, Petrich and at Karlovo.In September 1876 the Bulgarian poet Ivan Vazov was moved by her humanitarian work and dedicated to her a poem. See She also provided subsidies to a flour mill and a number of saw mills. In 1883 Queen Victoria awarded her the Royal Red Cross for creating, with Dr Herbert Sieveking the Victoria Hospital, Cairo. The hospital continued in operation thanks to a grant of ¬£2,000 per year from the Egyptian government taking in local students for training and offering first class accommodation on a private basis. Strangford edited A Selection from the Writings of Viscount Strangford on Political, Geographical and Social Subjects which she published in 1869 and Original Letters and Papers upon Philology and Kindred Subjects in 1878. She also published her brother-in-law's novel Angela Pisani after his death and she helped found the Women's Emigration Society with Caroline Blanchard which arranged for British women to find jobs abroad. In her later years, Lady Strangford had a London home at 3 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair. She died on board SS Lusitania of a stroke in 1887. She was travelling through the Mediterranean en route for Port Said where she was to create a hospital for seamen. Her body was returned to London and buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

It was during his time at Argosy that he dubbed a mysterious area in the Atlantic Ocean \\"The Bermuda Triangle\\" and a strange creature as \\"Abominable Snowman\\". Search for Rockefeller In 1969, Machlin traveled to the jungles of Papua New Guinea in an attempt to learn the fate of Michael Rockefeller, son of then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Michael had vanished in 1961 on a trip to secure bisj poles for the Museum of Primitive Art, when his catamaran capsized and he was swept out to sea. While the Dutch anthropologist he was with stayed with the vessel awaiting help, Rockefeller attempted to swim in shark-infested waters to the coastline. The anthropologist was rescued the next day, but Rockefeller was never seen again. Rockefeller was declared legally dead in 1964, but a rumor surfaced that he was still alive and held captive by a local tribe. Machlin traveled to Papua New Guinea searching for any trace of him. Following his trip, Machlin later published the book, The Search for Michael Rockefeller, in which he concluded that Rockefeller had indeed made it to shore only to be killed by headhunters.

Heston discovered 15 reels of 16 mm film from the 1969 trip, including Machlin's interviews with Dutch missionaries who had traveled from tribe to tribe and heard stories.

Life Waterman was born in Providence, Rhode Island to William Henry and Martha Burrill Pearce Waterman; he had a brother, William Clarence Waterman, who survived him. He graduated from Brown University in 1857 and moved to New York, where for twenty years he kept a studio in the New York University building. His training is unclear; some sources claim that he was entirely self-taught, while others, including Waterman himself, claim that he either worked with or was influenced by Thomas Hill and William Morris Hunt. Before moving to New York he was part of a group of \\"art enthusiasts\\" in Providence, including Thomas Robinson, John N. Arnold, James M. Lewin, and Frederick S. Batcheller; Robinson would go on to be a friend of his for many years. Waterman is known to have attended a life drawing class at the National Academy of Design during the 1858‚Äì1859 academic year. In the former year he began exhibiting at the Academy as well, a habit which he kept up as long as he lived in the city. Early on he chose to specialize in landscape painting, and many of the pictures he showed at the Academy were in this vein. He was elected an associate of the Academy in 1861. In 1874 Waterman accompanied a group of painters including Hunt on a sketching trip along the Massachusetts coast, and as a result resettled in Boston, where he would remain until moving to Italy. He spent much time traveling in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s; among his destinations were the Netherlands, France, southern Spain, and North Africa. Visiting Algiers was a revelation to the artist, and he said in an 1894 interview that \\"for the first time he felt at home\\". Having first visited in 1879, he returned there a second time, staying between 1884 and 1886. He continued depicting American subjects as well, favoring the beaches of Cape Cod and the mountains of Vermont. Waterman married an Italian woman, Marietta Ambrosi, and in the first decade of the twentieth century he relocated with her to her home country; he died in Italy, in Madero, and is buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. Waterman was described after his death as a man of broad intellect and a deep thinker, something of a philosopher; he was said to hold the average American art buyer in contempt, and was well-off enough to enjoy the art of painting for itself, rather than for any pecuniary reasons. He was a member of the Paint and Clay Club of Boston, of the American Watercolor Society, and the Artists Fund Society. Career Though Waterman was primarily a painter of landscapes, he turned his hand to other genres at times during his career. An early attempt was a self-portrait of 1861, presented to the National Academy of Design upon presentation of his diploma the following year. He bore no fondness for the work, and a 1906 letter detailing his opinions of the painting survives: > I regret to confess that I am the guilty party who painted the frightful > portrait in question. I never saw it but once since I did it & it filled me > with horror & remorse. If there is any survivor of the scores of painters > who were friends of mine in New York some fifty years ago, he will oblige me > by taking the said painting & giving it a good glaze of ivory black, wiping > out a spot somewhere & thus converting it into a Whistler. I was a boy in my > twenties when I did it & had never painted a head before. I hope I may be > forgiven. The self-portrait, too, survives, in the Academy's collection. Waterman turned to Orientalist subjects after his visits to Algiers, and his paintings in this arena have been described as \\"rather literary\\"; many of them depict scenes from The Arabian Nights, while others are based on landscape studies made during his travels in Oram, Algiers, Andalusia, and the Sahel. It was already noted during his career that his paintings, though praised by critics, were out of step with trends in the contemporary artistic scene; within three years of his death his work was described as \\"old-fashioned\\" when it was shown in Boston. Even so, at his death he was remembered by one writer as \\"the greatest colorist this country has produced, and far and away the greatest painter of light.\\" Besides the National Academy, museums which include work by Waterman in their collections include the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Addison Gallery of American Art,http://accessaddison.andover.edu/Obj9187?sid=13207&x;=67273 the Worcester Art Museum, the Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum, the Boston Public Library, and the Indiana University Art Museum.

The cars were the centrepiece of a new set of intercity passenger trains in Southwestern Ontario. The fleet passed to Via Rail in 1978 and later saw use with the Ski Train, QIT-Fer et Titane, and the Algoma Central Railway.  Design  The cars were constructed out of aluminium. Canadian National rebuilt six MLW RS-18 diesel locomotives to haul them. The locomotives were equipped with head end power (HEP) and painted in a unique red-orange and grey livery. The cars were built to use Canadian National's standard 575 volt HEP; in 1982-83 Via rebuilt them to use 480 volts. The cars rode on \\"inside bearing trucks with outboard disc brakes.\\" The original fleet consisted of five club/galley cars, five coach/cafe cars, and fifteen coaches. The club cars seated 39, the cafes 16 (in the coach section), and the coaches 80. In 1969 Canadian National rebuilt one of the club cars into an 80-seat coach and another into a 52-seat coach/galley car. The seating in the club car was 2√ó1, common for parlor cars. When the Canadian National reacquired part of the fleet in 2009 it refurbished the cars, replacing the windows, carpet, and seat upholstery.  Service  Tempo cars in Ski Train service, 2008 The Tempos entered service on the Canadian National Railway in mid-June 1968. Canadian National operated the Tempos as integrated trainsets. Routes served included Toronto‚ÄìWindsor and Toronto‚ÄìSarnia. At the outset each set comprised a club/galley car, three coaches, and a coach/cafe. Travel time was four hours. The cafe/coach and the addition of luggage racks in the coaches allowed the elimination of dining and baggage cars. In 1971 Canadian National ran five daily \\"Tempo\\" trains: four to Windsor and one to Sarnia. Via Rail inherited the fleet and leased the RS-18s. By 1980 the Tempos were limited to the Windsor route. Via later placed the Tempos in service on the Chicago‚ÄìToronto International. These were pulled by LRC locomotives. Via Rail stored the five cafe cars in 1986 after a regulatory change permitted it to serve alcohol in coaches. In 1987 Via Rail included up to four Tempo coaches on the International. The cars ran between Toronto and Sarnia on Sundays only. The remainder of the fleet was stored. At the end of 1987 Via sold all but four of the cars. Four of the coaches went to QIT-Fer et Titane, which used them to shuttle workers. 17 cars, including the three remaining club/galleys, the coach/galley, the five coach/cafes, and eight coaches, went to the Ski Train in Denver. On the Ski Train they replaced 1915-vintage cars which had been sold to the Napa Valley Wine Train. Via withdrew its four remaining Tempos in 1990 because of budget cuts. QIT acquired three more coaches in 1998. The sole remaining Via Tempo car, coach No. 370, was reported at the Toronto Maintenance Centre in 2000. After the closure of the Ski Train the Canadian National acquired its rolling stock for use on the Algoma Central Railway.

Historically, different breviaries were used in the various parts of Christendom, such as Aberdeen Breviary, Belleville Breviary, Stowe Breviary and Isabella Breviary, although eventually the Roman Breviary became the standard within the Roman Catholic Church.  Different breviaries  The Shehimo (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) In the Catholic Church, Pope Nicholas III approved a Franciscan breviary, for use in that religious order, and this was the first text that bore the title of breviary. However, the \\"contents of the breviary, in their essential parts, are derived from the early ages of Christianity\\", consisting of psalms, Scripture lessons, writings of the Church Fathers, as well as hymns and prayers. The ancient breviary of the Bridgettines had been in use for more than 125 years before the Council of Trent and so was exempt from the Constitution of Pope Pius V which abolished the use of breviaries differing from that of Rome.The Tablet, 29th May, 1897, page 27. In 2015, The Syon Breviary of the Bridgettines was published for the first time in English (from Latin). This was done in celebration of the 600th anniversary of Syon Abbey, founded in 1415 by King Henry V. Following the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Communion, in 1916, the Anglican Breviary was published by the Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation. In Lutheranism, the Diakonie Neuendettelsau religious institute uses a breviary unique to the order; For All the Saints: A Prayer Book for and by the Church, among many other breviaries such as The Daily Office: Matins and Vespers, Based on Traditional Liturgical Patterns, with Scripture Readings, Hymns, Canticles, Litanies, Collects, and the Psalter, Designed for Private Devotion or Group Worship, are popular in Lutheran usage as well.

He is the leader of the Night Wolves, Russia's largest motorcycle club. He was awarded the Medal \\"For the Return of Crimea\\" by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin for his actions in \\"Helping Crimeans to self-determine\\".  Early life  Zaldostanov was born in Kirovohrad (present day Kropyvnytskyi in Ukraine, then USSR) in 1963. His father is Georgian (original spelling Zaldastanishvili), and his mother, a doctor, is Russian. Zaldostanov describes his mother as a \\"convinced communist\\", but he says that the family still prayed to Russian Orthodox icons. The Zaldostanovs spoke Russian at home, despite the father's Georgian background. The family moved to Sevastopol in the Crimea when he was young, and then again to Moscow. He was involved in the communist youth Pioneer movement as a teenager. Zaldostanov studied medicine in Moscow, and practiced as assistant of surgeries, specializing in post-traumatic facial reconstruction. He left medicine and became involved in motorcycle club activities. In the mid-1980s, he was working as a bouncer in a nightclub in West Berlin. He was in demand as Moscow suffered from crime-related violence with the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Night Wolves  left Zaldostanov was introduced to motorcycle culture in the mid 1980s, while he was in Berlin. He purchased a Czech-made motorcycle, and began participating in the biker scene in Moscow while still working as a surgeon. He formed the Night Wolves, Russia's first major motorcycle club, in 1989. The club maintains close ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, and promotes nationalist ideals. Moving away from themes like drugs and organized crime associated with American motorcycle clubs like the Hells Angels, Zaldostanov began to use the club for political activism in the 2000s. In the late 2000s, the club began holding rallies in the former Soviet Eastern European countries, promoting Slavic culture. Vladimir Putin participated in one rally, travelling with the group to Sevastopol in 2012. Zaldostanov has offered the Night Wolves to the Russian Government as an informal militia. Zaldostanov and other club members visited Crimea just prior to the Russian annexation in 2014, and publicly supported the change of power on the peninsula. He and the Night Wolves have offered support to pro-Russia militias fighting in the eastern Ukraine.  Political activities  Zaldostanov and Putin, 2013 Zaldostanov is known for strong support of the Russian government, military, and President Vladimir Putin. He is also known for his admiration for former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and homophobic views. Zaldostanov was one of the official torchbearers for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and received the Order of Honour, a Russian state decoration, from Putin in 2013. In January 2015, Zaldostanov formed the \\"Anti-Maidan\\" movement with journalist Nikolai Starikov and several right-wing politicians. The group opposes \\"Maidan\\"-style democratic revolutions, specifically the Orange Revolution and 2014 Euromaidan revolts in Ukraine, as well as opposition political groups within Russia. Zaldostanov suggested that \\"Death to faggots\\" could be an alternate name for the Russian anti-Maidan movement. *Original in Russian: Zaldostanov has been sanctioned by several governments, including the United States and Canada, for the Night Wolves' involvement in the unrest in Ukraine in the mid-2010s. In April 2015, he and the Night Wolves were refused entry to the European Union at the Polish border.

Archaeological sites require an extra level of care in regards to their conservation and restoration. Archaeology, even with thorough documentation, is a destructive force. This is because once a site has been even partially excavated, it cannot be put back the way it was, so to keep getting information from the site, it must be conserved to current best standards. Life of a site According to Ashurst and Shalom, archaeological sites have several phases. #Creation of the Site: During this phase, the site is in use and has been established. #Deterioration: After the site has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any structures that have been built. Animals also burrow through the remnants, destroying floors, walls, and moving objects around. As walls and structures fall, they settle in different patterns and wind and water fill in the openings with dirt and dust. #Identification: The site might be identified by archaeologists, or it might be identified by locals or other non-professionals. #Excavation: There are many ways that an excavation can take place. One is that locals or other interested people decide that they want to investigate themselves. Whether this is simply for pot hunting (illegal digging and collecting of artifacts) or as more of an actual attempt at amateur excavation, it can easily damage the site and regularly makes interpretation more difficult. Even when excavated by professionals, sometimes improper techniques or documentation can actually lead to further damage. If done properly, archaeological excavations can reveal many aspects, while still protecting others and detailed documentation takes place to allow the site to be virtually reconstructed as best as possible. #Further Deterioration: If the site is then left open, there is a renewal of deterioration since areas are now re-exposed to the weather. #Ignorant Repair: There are many instances where people, with good intentions, attempt to conserve and repair a site. However, it results in more damage than assistance. Some ways that this happens is the use of inappropriate materials, inappropriate uses, as well as the lack of understanding of the original condition of the site (example: construction techniques, last used layout, et cetera). #Correct Conservation: In this instance, correct conservation materials and techniques are used to preserve the condition the site was found in, and in rare cases rebuild where things have fallen over. The basic goal, however, is simply to preserve how it was found. #Reburial: In the case that the site cannot be properly preserved while in the open (due to funding or other reasons), one of the better conservation techniques is simply to rebury the site to protect it from further deterioration. Many of these phases can be repeated and happen in a variety of orders. Dangers Weathering The source of most damage is weather. Erosion through wind, rain, freeze-thaw, and evaporation are extremely common and other than covering the site entirely cannot be prevented. However, more dramatic factors are natural disasters: floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, et cetera. The best way to protect archaeological sites from these larger events is to formulate a risk management plan. The basics of this are to first identify what threatens the site the most and then determine its susceptibility to it. This plan is much like that for any structure or area, but there are no codes that must be upheld. An example of how some locations deal with this is in Florida, which has many floods and much soil erosion. Florida has used easements that protect archaeological sites from such risks. Development Pueblo Grande Ruin- Hohokam Village. Note the buildings in the background; this is in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. An unfortunate risk to archaeological sites is development itself. As the world continues to develop and build new buildings and roadways, many times archaeological sites are damaged. An example of this is in Arizona. There was an Ancient Puebloan site that dates to A.D. 900-1350 was damaged by construction activities while putting in a new road. After the damage was assessed, it was determined that the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, this determination was made because there is not enough remaining for it to be of any \\"information important in prehistory or history.\\" While development cannot be discontinued simply to protect archaeological sites, having a basic understanding of what might be impacted before development takes place could help protect sites and at least the information they can provide. The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960 is an example of some ways in which archaeological sites can be protected. Vandalism Vandalism is also a prominent force of damage to archaeological sites. A range of actions can be considered, including graffiti, carving, deconstruction, and burning. These can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional vandalism is when visitors know that there is an archaeological site and yet still chose to harm it in some way. Unintentional vandalism happens when the visitor vandalizes while not realizing they are at an archaeological site. An example of an unintentional vandalism is if someone is hunting small game and they see several rock around and decide to pile them up into a berm to shoot from behind. Unbeknownst to them, those rocks were not just naturally placed but actually a collapsed wall of an ancient building, with the majority of it underground. An example of intentional vandalism is graffiti. This can be considered intentional even if the visitors are unaware of the location being an archaeological site, because there is purposeful destruction even of a natural location. Tumamoc Hill in Tucson, Arizona has been subjected to this form of vandalism for centuries. Tumamoc Hill has a site on its top and has rock art all along the sides. It appears as though visitors throughout history have decided to join in on this tradition by adding their own initials and artwork. To protect an archaeological site from vandalism requires a combination of techniques. The most important is education of the public. This isn't just in terms of explaining that vandalism is bad‚Äîbut to also educate them on the importance of these sites, and what can be lost if they vandalize the site. This can be as done as easily as adding signage. Another strategy is to discourage the activity through adding barriers, patrols, or even full-time observation. Another vital way to help is to routinely survey the area to track changes. This technique can also monitor weathering damage. War Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction Throughout history, war has also caused much destruction of archaeological and historical sites. The Nazis during World War II destroyed many buildings during the planned destruction of Warsaw, including several palaces and other buildings dating back to before the 13th century. In more recent times, the Taliban destroyed the sacred Buddha statue in Afghanistan and the ISIS YouTube videos. The prevention of this is virtually impossible without large-scale efforts such as those done by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program that has become popularized by the 2014 movie The Monuments Men. People involved Archaeologists The goal of archaeologists as well as other archaeological site conservators is \\"To preserve the physical remains of our past and to employ them in perpetuating our historical heritage.\\" The way an archaeologist can assist in this is to be as thorough in their documentation as possible. This way, even if the site is physically destroyed, there are existing records of how it once was. It is also important that archaeologists use excavation techniques that impact the site as little as possible and saves features. A current technique used is that the entire site is not actually excavated, only parts that are viewed as being able to answer research questions the best. A previous technique reconstructed walls and other site features to make it look more like it did originally. However, that has mostly gone out of style, and instead, preserving the site as found is more common. Visitors Visitors have some responsibility for archaeological site preservation. This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at Recapture Canyon in Utah. In 2007, the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites. However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself. Owing to the large number of people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage. To combat further damage, archaeological sites that are open to the public are given trails that do not actually impact the site while still giving visitors a good view of it. It is important for visitors to understand their own impact on archaeological sites they visit. If there is a designated path, they should remain on it. If they see artifacts, they can point to them and take pictures but not pick them up and move them. Conservators Conservators are the leaders in going the extra mile for archaeological site conservation. It is these specialists that need to formulate the largest and longest-lasting plan. Martha Demas has created a great outline that conservators can rely on to create the most effective plan. #Identification and description ##Aims: What are the aims and expectations of the planning process? ##Stakeholders: Who should be involved in the planning process? ##Documentation and Description: What is known about the site and what needs to be understood? #Assessment and Analysis ##Cultural Significance/Values: Why is the site important or valued and by whom is it valued? ##Physical Condition: What is the condition of the site or structure; what are the threats? ## Management Context: What are the current constraints and opportunities that affect the conservation and management of the site? #Response ##Establish Purpose and Policies: For what purpose is the site being conserved and managed? How are the values of the site going to be preserved? ##Set Objectives: What will be done to translate policies into actions? ##Develop Strategies: How will the objectives be put into practice? ##Synthesize and Prepare Plan #Periodic Review and Revision Techniques The purpose of any technique used on an archaeological site is to strengthen its ability to resist damage and/or reinstate its cultural significance and ability to teach about its history. Restoration Restoration is the \\"returning of the existing fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without the introduction of new material.\\" The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material. Ideally, this is the primary technique to strengthen the site from further damage. Reconstruction Huaca Pucllana Reconstruction Effort Reconstruction is \\"returning a place to a known earlier state; distinguished from restoration by the introduction of new material into the fabric.\\" The aim of restoration is to \\"preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents.\\" There is also debate on whether this is conservation work or not, due to potential over-reconstruction. The appropriateness of this technique is highly dependent upon the region, the amount of known knowledge of the site itself, as well as the actual condition of the site. The older a site, the more difficult it is to be confident in the reconstruction. Reconstruction should also be identifiable upon inspection as well as reversible. A common form of reconstruction is the re-plastering of floors and walls. Due to weathering, the plaster that originally protected surfaces has eroded away and left the surfaces vulnerable. The re-plastering then adds that layer of protection back and in many cases was at least the same technique as originally even if it isn't exactly the same material. Recreation/renovation Recreation/renovation is the \\"speculative creation of a presumed earlier state on the basis of surviving evidence from that place to other sites, and on deductions drawn from that evidence using new materials.\\" This is the least favorable option as it is less likely to reinstate the originality of the site, and many times includes destroying existing authentic materials in order to add new materials. It is deemed justifiable if it is the only form of effective conservation available. or if conservation measures prove to be unfeasible. Relocation Mid-move of the Abu Simbel Temples Relocation is a dramatic form of conservation which involves the physical movement of the site or part of the site itself. This should only take place if the site would be heavily damaged or even eliminated if it were to not be moved. A famous example of this is the move of the Abu Simbel temples. The movement of these temples was expensive as well as challenging, but if the move did not take place they would be completely underwater due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

He played college football at Delaware. Professional career On November 24, 2015, it was announced that Boyle had accepted his invitation to play in the 2015 Senior Bowl. He became the fourth player from Delaware to appear in the Senior Bowl and first since Joe Flacco in 2008. Throughout the week leading up to the Senior Bowl, Boyle performed well at practice and showed scouts and teams his versatility, blocking capability, and his receiving ability. On January 24, 2015, Boyle caught two passes for 31-yards, leading all tight ends, and helped the North defeat the South 34-13. He accepted his invitation to the NFL combine and was one of the 19 tight ends invited. Boyle completed all of the required combine and positional drills. His performance was described by media and analysts as mediocre as he finished last in the 40-yard dash among tight ends and dropped a few passes during positional drills. Boyle finished first among tight ends in the 60-yard shuttle and 20-yard shuttle, eighth in the broad jump, ninth in the vertical, and tied for fifth in the bench press. On March 12, 2015, Boyle opted to participate at Delaware's pro day, along with 11 other teammates. He ran his 40-yard dash (5.00), 20-yard dash (2.85), 10-yard dash (1.65), and also performed positional drills. Scouts and representatives from 22 NFL teams attended, including tight ends coaches from the New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Boyle was projected to be a fifth or sixth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the 11 best tight end prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. The Baltimore Ravens selected Boyle in the fifth round with the 171st overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the ninth tight end selected in the draft and the second tight end selected by the Ravens, with the first being Minnesota's Maxx Williams (second round, 55th overall). He was the 27th player to be drafted from Delaware and became teammates with fellow Delaware alumni Joe Flacco. 2015 On May 7, 2015, the Baltimore Ravens signed Boyle to a four-year, $2.44 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $166,254. He competed With Maxx Williams, Crockett Gilmore, Dennis Pitta, and Konrad Reuland throughout training camp for the vacant starting tight end position left by the departure of Owen Daniels. He made his professional regular season debut in the Baltimore Ravens' season-opening 19-13 loss to the Denver Broncos. On September 27, 2015, Boyle caught two passes for 19-yards during a 28-24 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. He made the first reception of his career on a six- yard pass from Joe Flacco in the second quarter. On October 1, 2015, Boyle made his first career start and caught three passes for 12 receiving yards in a 23-20 victory at the Pittsburgh Steelers. During a Week 10 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had three receptions for a season-high 35 receiving yards in the Ravens' 22-20 loss. On December 7, 2015, it was reported that the NFL would suspend Boyle for four games after violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drug policy. He was required to forfeit his salary for four games, equaling $112,132. Boyle was immediately suspended and missed Weeks 14-17. He finished the season with a total of 18 receptions for 153 receiving yards in 11 games and two starts. 2016 On February 19, 2016, it was announced that Boyle would be suspended for the first ten games of the 2016 season for his second violation of the performance-enhancing drug policy. His was activated to the Ravens' active roster on November 26, 2016 prior to Week 12. On December 4, 2016, Boyle caught two passes for a season-high 24-yards, as the Ravens routed the Miami Dolphins 38-6. The following week, he had a season-high three receptions for 15-yards in a 30-23 loss against the New England Patriots. Boyle finished the season with six receptions for 44 receiving yards in six games and zero starts. 2017 Throughout training camp, Boyle competed with Benjamin Watson, Dennis Pitta, Crockett Gilmore, Maxx Williams, Larry Donnell, and Ryan Malleck for the job as the starting tight end. Head coach John Harbaugh named him the starter for the beginning of the season after Gilmore suffered a torn MCL and Pitta retired after suffering another hip injury. He started the Baltimore Ravens' season-opener at the Cincinnati Bengals and had one catch for 14-yards in their 20-0 victory. On October 1, 2017, he caught a career-high five passes for 36 receiving yards in the Ravens 26-9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He missed a Week 9 contest at the Tennessee Titans after suffering a toe injury. He finished the 2017 season with 28 receptions for 203 receiving yards. 2018 After competing with Maxx Williams, and rookies Hayden Hurst and Mark Andrews, Boyle was named the starting tight end to begin the season. Despite being outplayed by the rookie Andrews, Boyle finished the season with 23 receptions for a career-high 213 yards. 2019 On March 7, 2019, Boyle signed a three-year, $18 million contract extension with the Ravens through the 2021 season. Boyle caught his first career touchdown during a Week 9 37‚Äì20 victory over the New England Patriots. Overall, Boyle finished the 2019 season with 31 receptions for 321 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns.

The [IrCl6]2‚àí centers adopt octahedral molecular geometry.Bokii, G.B.; Ussikov, P.I. \\"Roentgenographische Untersuchung der Struktur des Ammonium-Chlor-Iridats (N H4)2IrCl6 Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR 1940, vol. 26, p782-p784. Uses It is a key intermediate in the isolation of iridium from ores. Most other metals form insoluble sulfides when aqueous solutions of their chlorides are treated with hydrogen sulfide, but [IrCl6]2‚àí resists ligand substitution. Upon heating under hydrogen, the solid salt converts to the metal: : (NH4)2[IrCl6] + 2 H2 ‚Üí Ir + 6 HCl + 2 NH3 Bonding The electronic structure of ammonium hexachloroiridate(IV) has attracted much attention. Its magnetic moment is less that than calculated for one electron. This result is interpreted as the result of antiferromagnetic coupling between Ir centers mediated by Cl---Cl interactions. Electron spin resonance, studies reveal that more than half of the spin density resides on chloride, thus the description of the complex as Ir(IV) is an oversimplification.

Donegal Abbey (Irish: Mainistir Dh√∫n na nGall) is a ruined Franciscan Priory in Donegal in Ireland. It was constructed by the O'Donnell dynasty in the fifteenth century. It is sometimes referred to as Donegal Friary. It was built in 1474 on the orders of the leading Gaelic lord of the area, the ruler of Tyrconnell Hugh Roe O'Donnell, the First, and his wife Finola O'Brien. In the Nine Years' War, the Abbey was used for a meeting between the rebel leadership and envoys of the Spanish King Philip II. The Abbey was the scene of fighting during the 1601 Siege of Donegal when a force led by Red Hugh O'Donnell attempted to capture the town from Crown forces led by the Gaelic warrior Niall Garve O'Donnell.McGurk p.113-16 During the fighting Niall Garve's younger brother Conn O'Donnell was killed. Description The abbey is located in the town of Donegal in County Donegal, Ireland. It is situated at the mouth of the River Eske, where it empties into Donegal Bay, to the west of the town centre. History Donegal Abbey was founded in 1474 by Finola O'Donnell (, also known as Nuala O'Donnell), and her husband Hugh Roe O'Donnell. Finola was a member of a powerful family of princes in Leinster, while Hugh was the king of Tyrconnell, what is now County Donegal. According to a 17th-century account in Latin by one of the abbey's friars, translated to English by Charles Patrick Meehan, Finola made a journey of around with a number of women to the monastery at Ross Errilly Friary in County Galway, where Franciscan monks were holding a provincial chapter. The purpose of her journey was to request the founding of a Franciscan monastery in Tyrconnell. Her request was initially refused, but according to the account she replied: \\"What! I have journeyed a hundred miles to attain the object that has long been dearest to my heart, and will you now venture to deny my prayer? If you do, beware of God‚Äôs wrath, for I will appeal to His throne and charge you with the loss of all the souls which your reluctance may cause to perish in the territory of Tirconnell!\\". This plea was successful, and a number of Franciscans agreed to accompany her back to Tyrconnell. They began building the abbey, at a site next to the wharf in Donegal, which the account described as \\"a lovely spot, and sweetly suggestive of holy meditations\\". Later in 1474, before the abbey was completed, Finola O'Donnell died. Hugh Roe married again, to Fingalla O'Brien, and she continued Finola's work, ensuring that the monastery, church cloisters and other features were completed successfully. The abbey was dedicated that same year. In 1505, Hugh Roe O'Donnell died and was succeeded by his son, Hugh Oge. Fingalla withdrew from public life after the accession of her son, living a life of austerity and prayer in a small house close to the abbey. By 1601, the town of Donegal was under the control of the English crown, following an alliance made between Sir Hugh O'Donnell, a descendent of the original Hugh Roe, and the English as part of the Tudor conquest of Ireland., but the original condition of that was that his eldest son, Sir Donal O'Donnell by his first marriage would be the Sheriff of Donegal rather than an English captain. In this way, he kept the English out, while managing dynastic survival. Shortly after the Armada shipwreck of 1588, Sir Donal O'Donnell was knighted and appointed as Sheriff of Donegal by the Lord Deputy William FitzWilliam.. Sir Donal was the leading contender in the O'Donnell succession dispute of the 1580s which took place while his father was still alive. His personal jurisdiction covered \\"that part of Tirconnell from the mountain westwards, i.e. from Barnesmore to the river Drowes (i.e. Tirhugh), and also all the inhabitants of Boylagh and Tir Boghaine (i.e. Bannagh)\\"*. Faced with the eclipse of her son Hugh Roe's position, In√≠on Dubh acted usurpively. She had already burnt Donegal Castle, in war against her husband. Next she hired large numbers of Redshank mercenaries from her native Scotland to confront her son's rival. Sir Donal was defeated and killed at the Battle of Doire Leathan on 14 September 1590. Meanwhile, Sir Donal O'Donnell was survived by his only son, Donal Oge O'Donnell.. But Sir Hugh's son by his second marriage, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, the Second, was strongly anti-English and began rebel activity from an early age. He was captured twice by English forces, escaping both times, before seeking an alliance with Spain which led to the Nine Years' War. In Hugh Roe's absence, Tyrconnell was ruled by a rival, his cousin Niall Garve O'Donnell, who made terms with the English government and set up his base at the abbey. Hugh Roe attacked in 1601 to try to reclaim the territory, but was unable to do so. During the battle, on 10 August 1601, a fire broke out at the abbey which in turn ignited a store of gunpowder kept by Niall Garve. The resulting explosion destroyed most of the building and killed hundreds of Niall Garve's soldiers, including his brother Conn Oge O'Donnell. The abbey was not rebuilt, and remains in ruins, but the Franciscan friars set up a new base at a refuge close to the River Drowes, near Ballyshannon. Members of the Donegal order such as M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, John Colgan, and Donatus Mooney played an important role during the early 1600s in recording Irish history.

Selman (born May 7, 1942) is an American-born educational psychologist and perspective-taking theorist. who specializes in adolescent social development. He is married to Anne Selman and father to Jesse Selman and Matt Selman. He is the Roy E. Larsen Professor of Education and Human Development at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) and a Professor of Psychology in Medicine at Harvard University. Robert Selman founded the Risk and Prevention masters program ¬óat the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1992,¬ó and served as its first director through to 1999. (In 2010, the program was renamed ‚ÄúPrevention Science and Practice.‚Äù) Selman served as the chair of the Human Development and Psychology department at HGSE from 2000 to 2004. At the Harvard Medical School, he is professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry, where he serves as senior associate at the Judge Baker Children's Center and at the Department of Psychiatry at Children's Hospital Boston. Selman's research has focused on helping children develop social-awareness and social-engagement competencies as a way to reduce risks to their health, as well as to promote their social relationships and academic performance. His work on the promotion of children's understanding of ways to get along with others from different backgrounds is conducted in the context of literacy and language arts curricula at the elementary level; in school-based programs designed to coordinate support and prevention services for students in public middle schools; and in the social studies, literature, and history curricula for high schools. His past work focused on the treatment of psychological disorders of youth in day school and residential treatment and the prevention of these disorders in children and adolescents placed at risk  Career  Selman received a B.A. in psychology from Cornell University and a Ph.D. from Boston University in Clinical, Community, and Counseling Psychology in 1969. He then studied with Lawrence Kohlberg at Harvard University both under a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) post-doctoral fellowship in developmental psychology, and as a research associate. Selman's initial research focused on the child's developing capacity to coordinate points of view, develop interpersonal negotiation strategies, and become aware of the personal meaning of risk in the context of social relationships and the larger culture. From 1975 to 1990, Selman was the director of the Manville School of the Judge Baker Children's Center, which provides special educational and clinical services for children with severe social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. During his tenure as director, the Manville School provided academic training opportunities in both research and practice to doctoral students from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In 1992 Selman founded the Prevention Science and Practice Program for masters students at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He was the director of this program for seven years (1992-1999). Selman's courses at Harvard draw from his ongoing research into the developmental and cultural antecedents of children's capacity to form and maintain social relationships, and to take positive rather than negative risks. Selman has examined the relationship between the promotion of children's social awareness and of their literacy skills through child and young adult literature, both in the elementary grades, as described in his 2003 book, The Promotion of Social Awareness (awarded best book by moral education division of the American Educational Research Association), and in history, social studies, and literature courses in middle and high school. Scholars have drawn from Selman's inquiry into the promotion of youth civic engagement and the understanding of bullying (and bystanding) behaviors in adolescence to inform their own understandings of youth development. Selman is the recipient of two Fulbright Fellowships to Iceland, and was a Scholar in Residence at the Russell Sage Foundation in 1999-2000. He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the American Educational Research Association. In 2009, he was the first scholar-in-residence at Bank Street College. He received a lifetime achievement Kuhmerker Career Award from the Association for Moral Education in 2010. As a theorist in child and adolescent development, Selman authored the classic 1980's G.I. Joe Public Service Announcements. In collaboration with Dr. Catherine E. Snow, Selman is a senior author of \\"Voices: Literature and Writing Curriculum\\" (PreK to grade 6) published in 2012 by Zaner-Bloser. From 2010-2015, he served as a Principal Investigator on a five-year project entitled Catalyzing Comprehension through Discussion and Debate, supported by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). He currently consults with the television production division of the Walt Disney Company and the education department of Walden Media, LLC on the development of children's and adolescent's media and curricula.  Work   Perspective taking theory  Selman's theory of perspective-taking suggests that the ability to differentiate and coordinate the social perspectives of self and others, cognitively and emotionally, forms the basis of social communication as well as action. His developmental approach theorizes that perspective taking becomes both more sophisticated and more differentiated with age and maturity. Selman's theory postulates that a child's capacity to coordinate multiple points of view towards shared social experiences may promote the development of interpersonal understanding and relational management skills. Over time, as children learn to see other people's points of view and integrate them with their own, they are more apt to display deeper understandings about other people‚Äîsuch as their thoughts, feelings, and motivations‚Äîand as a result are better able to manage relationships in their lives. J√ºrgen Habermas has drawn upon Selman's Perspective-Taking Theory as a model for describing the varying degrees of communicative action that may be achieved. That is, Habermas adapted Selman's evidence-based investigations of perspective-taking to argue that the ability to take on the perspectives of other discussion partners had developmental stages. Thus far, this theory has been used to understand the development of peer relationships, risk-taking behavior such as fighting and drinking, and student engagement in intervention programs  Risk and resiliency framework  From the 1980s onward Selman directed his attention towards applying foundational research in child psychology to practical applications in order to promote the positive social development of children and youth. Selman investigated child risk factors that could potentially result in negative life experiences. He examined interventions and prevention models that could be used to ameliorate the effects of childhood risk factors and promote positive contexts and experiences to optimize children's health, academic capabilities, and social welfare. This \\"Risk and Resiliency Framework\\" informed the development of the Risk and Prevention program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and also reflected his later involvement with school-based or media-based practical interventions. During his early career time, Selman became actively involved with several local schools in the Boston and Cambridge area, including the now-closed Lucy Stone School in Dorchester, Massachusetts. His involvement in these schools, and his realization that schools can play a significant role in promoting social interventions but face enormous challenges in tending to both the academic and social needs of their students, fueled the writing of the 2003 book, The Promotion of Social Awareness as well as a chapter titled \\"Risk and Prevention\\" in the 6th edition of the Handbook of Child Psychology (2006).  Curriculum Design & Contributions  Up until the 1990s, Selman's risk and prevention framework had been used primarily to understand one-on-one social interactions between individuals. By moving these ideas into a school-based curriculum, Selman and his colleagues experimented with how the approach applied to children's understanding of their relationships with peers from different cultures or identity groups. One method of delivery was to children's literature that contained stories with social justice themes, and then to design teachers‚Äô guides for these texts. Selman partnered with colleagues, such as literacy expert and linguist Catherine E. Snow, to develop methods of literacy instruction that could be used in grades K-6. Selman and Snow collaborated with colleagues at Zaner-Bloser to develop Teachers‚Äô Guides for books such as Freedom Summer and Felita. The guides were designed to teach reading and writing but also included exercises to develop students‚Äô ability to take perspectives on other individuals‚Äô experiences, their understanding of others‚Äô cultural beliefs, and to strengthen their conflict-resolution strategies. Selman and colleagues conducted qualitative and quantitative studies of classrooms as they used the texts. In these studies, and subsequent work, Selman and his colleagues questioned the ways in which social perspective-taking and understanding may be related to student's reading, writing, and oral communication skills. For Selman, this work signaled a transition in his career from conducting primarily foundational research in child development to developing school-based practices to negotiating school policy and then cycling back to research, this time focused on working with and learning from schools and communities. He has also consulted with and contributed to the content for Facing History and Ourselves curricular materials designed to promote civic and moral engagement in youth, and he is a guest expert for the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation's (RAK) online curriculum for educators who want to promote social-emotional learning in their classrooms (RAK is funded by Philip Anschutz's The Foundation for a Better Life).  Children‚Äôs television and teen digital media  Selman, collaborating with his wife Anne (who holds an MA in early childhood development), served as an educational consultant on the popular 1980s cartoons G.I. Joe; Selman was responsible for the educational content of the And Knowing is Half the Battle G.I. Joe public service announcements, many of which exist today in different formats on YouTube including the popular parody films created by Fenslerfilm. Selman's research has also explored contemporary issues related to the multiple roles of new media in adolescents‚Äô social lives and experiences, drawing on data from MTV‚Äôs A Thin Line campaign. The project included collaboration with colleagues at MIT‚Äôs Media Lab, including Henry Lieberman. Selman has also worked with Walden Media to produce multiple crossmedia curricula designed to bridge the narratives of classic children‚Äôs books and their motion picture adaptations (See Selman‚Äôs crossmedia curricula for The Watsons Go to Birmingham (book by Christopher Paul Curtis) and The Giver (book by Lois Lowry)).  Civic and moral initiatives  With Professor Helen Haste of Harvard University and the University of Bath, Selman is the Co-principal Investigator of a comparative study on New Civics Early Career Scholars funded by the Spencer Foundation. With Harvard professors Helen Haste and Meira Levinson, Selman has also conducted work in civic education, civic development and civic engagement at HGSE, including the Spender Foundation funded Early Career Scholars Program in New Civics. With Xu Zhao and Helen Haste, he has been developing moral and civic research with Chinese young people in the HGSE China Lab.  Publications  Selman published The Growth of Interpersonal Understanding: Developmental and Clinical Analyses in 1980. This text introduced Selman‚Äôs general framework and empirical background for theories for his social perspective taking theory, and served as the precursor for his future works. In 1997, Selman co-edited Fostering Friendship: Pair Therapy for Treatment and Prevention with Lynn Hickey Shultz a professor of psychology at Harvard University and Caroline Watts a lecturer and researcher at Harvard University. Fostering Friendship introduces ‚Äúpair-therapy‚Äù as a therapeutic intervention method designed to help children develop healthy interpersonal relationships. The method is suggested by physicians for clinical settings. This approach, which involves developing a nurturing relationship between an adult and two children, is also used outside of clinical settings as a prevention method used by counselors and teachers in public schools, daycare centers, and other youth development settings. In The Promotion of Social Awareness: Powerful Lessons from the Partnership of Developmental Theory and Classroom Practice, published in 2003, Selman shifted his theoretical frame from one-on-one interventions to considering cultural themes. This text demonstrates the evolution of Selman's work as it that draws from his earlier clinical work and connects it to school-based practice. The book is based on his studies of the way young people growing up under difficult life circumstances (such as dysfunctional families, neighborhood poverty, and social prejudice) learn how to relate to others. Selman describes \\"social competence‚Äù as the ability to coordinate one's own perspective with that of others, through mutual understanding and negotiation. In The Promotion of Social Awareness, Selman combines his work on developmental psychology, ethnography, and extensive practical experience of implementing initiatives in schools to promote children's ability to form good social relations with others. In 2005, Selman's The Promotion of Social Awareness was awarded the Outstanding Book Award by the American Educational Research Association Section on Moral Development and Education.

The regiments on the establishment were placed on the British establishment following the Act of Union, although some roles continued to exist separately. Origins The origins of the Irish Royal Army were in the traditional royal garrisons of the old Lordship of Ireland. Numbers were low during peacetime, and during the sixteenth century the force would be supplemented by assembling militia in The Pale and the raising of troops by loyal Gaelic chieftains during emergencies. It was financed by votes in the Irish Parliament, although this was sometimes supplemented by subsidies sent over from London. The principal task of the Army was to defend Ireland from internal disorder and invasion by foreign powers.Bartlett & Jeffrey 1996 p.248 The Irish security situation had come under strain during the rebellion of Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare in the 1530s.Bartlett & Jeffrey 1996 pp.116‚Äì135 The Fitzgerald family had traditionally been the leading Anglo-Irish lords in the country, serving as Lord Lieutenants. Their rebellion exposed the weakness of Henry VIII's forces in the Lordship of Ireland, with the rebels securing large gains and launching a Siege of Dublin. Tudor era In 1542 the Kingdom of Ireland was formally established and Henry VIII declared King. It accompanied a major policy to bring the whole island under control of Dublin, partly through the surrender and regrant offers to major Gaelic leaders. It was intended that traditional Gaelic feuds and succession disputes would be replaced by a more peaceful system of law. Nicholas Bagenal was appointed Marshal of Ireland with command over the Army, a title he passed to his son Henry Bagenal. Actual command over the forces in charge of suppression the Desmond Rebellion in Munster in the 1580s was given to the Earl of Ormond. Ormond was a prominent Irish leader with good connections at the court of Elizabeth I. Lord Mountjoy led the Army to success during Tyrone's Rebellion. He was able to defeat a Spanish expedition at the Siege of Kinsale in 1601. During Tyrone's Rebellion the Army was faced with a major uprising in Ulster. Elements of the Army suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Yellow Ford in 1598 at the hands of the rebel Earl of Tyrone. After receiving substantial reinforcements from England, Lord Mountjoy was able to successfully defeat Tyrone and his Spanish allies at the Siege of Kinsale in 1601. The following year his forces captured Dungannon, the rebel capital. In 1603 Tyrone surrendered to Mountjoy at the Treaty of Mellifont and the Army was dramatically reduced in size. Many of its officers were rewarded with land in exchange for their service. In 1608 the Army was again called into action following the Burning of Derry which launched O'Doherty's Rebellion. Despite the weakened state of the Army, it won a decisive victory at Kilmacrennan, crushing the uprising.McCavitt p.136-48 This, along with the Flight of the Earls the previous year, opened the way to a much grander Ulster Plantation. The arrival of large numbers of Protestant settlers changed the balance in the north, presenting new challenges to the Army. War of the Three Kingdoms During the Scottish Crisis of the early 1640s, a separate force known as the New Irish Army was raised in 1640-41 which dwarfed the \\"old\\" Irish Royal Army in size. Mainly drawn from the Catholic Gaelic inhabitants of Ulster, and mustered at Carrickfergus, it was intended to take part in a landing on the coast of Scotland. However it was rumoured that Charles I planned to lead the New Irish Royal Army against his enemies in the English Parliament, in the months before the outbreak of the English Civil War. When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out, the traditional Irish Royal Army was too small in size to cope. Many soldiers of the New Irish Royal Army joined the rebels, and soon controlled large swathes of Ireland. Large numbers of reinforcements were shipped over from England in 1642, known as the \\"English Army for Ireland\\",Ryder, Ian English Army for Ireland 1642; Partizan Press 1987, to support the Irish royalists. Scotland despatched a separate force to Ulster. Irish Protestants in counties Londonderry and Donegal raised their own force known as the Laggan Army, which was nominally under the command of the Crown, but largely acted independently. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the Irish Confederacy continued to insist upon their loyalty to the Crown, and stated that King Charles had endorsed the rebellion. Under its commander the Duke of Ormonde, the Irish Royal Army engaged in a complex mixture of fighting and truces as it sought to end the rebellion. It was Ormonde's hope that a peace treaty in Ireland would allow the various forces to unite and cross to England to assist Charles in the English Civil War. By 1647 it was clear that this was not going to take place and Ormonde handed over Dublin to the English Parliamentary forces. Charles I was executed in 1649 and Ormonde returned to Ireland with orders from his successor Charles II to form an alliance amongst the various forces, Catholic and Protestant, opposed to the new English Republic. Ormonde launched an attempt to capture Dublin but suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Rathmines. A large expedition under Oliver Cromwell then landed and won a series of victories that brought the whole of Ireland under their control. The remnants of the Royalist Irish Army served in exile under Charles II, while Ireland was garrisoned by a mixed force of English republican troops and Irish Protestants until 1660. Restoration The Royal Hospital Kilmainham was established in 1680 for the welfare of former soldiers. In 1660 Charles was restored to the Irish throne. The Irish Royal Army was reformed by the returning Ormonde, with gradual attempts to purge it of the remaining supporters of the old Cromwell regime. It numbered 5,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, considerably bigger than it had been before the rebellion, and was the largest armed force available to Charles in the British Isles. In 1662 Ormonde raised a regiment of Irish Guards to provide added security. The cost of the Army that year was ¬£146,000.Childs. Army of Charles II p.204 In 1680 the Royal Hospital Kilmainham was built for the welfare of soldiers.Bartlett & Jeffrey 1996 pp.212‚Äì13 During this period a major fear was a revival of republicanism amongst Ireland's Protestants, and extra troops were stationed around Cork and particularly in Ulster to guard against this. This strategy was broadly successful and there was no equivalent Irish rising to the 1685 Monmouth and Argyll rebellions.Bartlett & Jeffrey p.235 Williamite War The Battle of Aughrim (1691) was a defeat for James II's Irish Royal Army. Shortly afterwards much of the Army left for France in the Flight of the Wild Geese. Following the accession of James II in 1685, the newly appointed Viceroy, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell conducted a purge of Protestant officers of the Army replacing them with Catholics who had previously been generally excluded because of the Penal Laws.Childs 1980, pp. 56‚Äì79 He also rapidly expanded the Army in size. Elements of the Irish Royal Army fought on both sides during the Williamite War that followed, although primarily for James II. Irish Protestants unhappy with the rule of King James launched a rebellion in 1689, forming the Army of the North and declaring William III to be King. Although the Irish Royal Army was able to secure control over most of the island, Derry held out. A major Williamite expeditionary force landed and captured Carrickfergus. It consisted of many newly formed regiments commanded by Protestant officers recently dismissed from the Irish Royal Army by Tyrconnell, as well as large foreign contingents. However their advance on Dublin faltered, and thousands died of sickness at Dundalk Camp. In July 1690 the Battle of the Boyne was fought, leading to the defeat of the Jacobite Army and their French Allies. William III personally led his troops to victory, capturing Dublin in the wake of the battle. However he was beaten back by the Jacobites at the Siege of Limerick in September. The following year the bloodiest battle in Irish history was fought at Aughrim with the Irish Royal Army again defeated by the international force assembled against it. Led by Patrick Sarsfield the Catholic regiments went into exile following their defeat at the Second Siege of Limerick and served in Continental European Armies as \\"Wild Geese\\". A separate Irish Brigade had been formed in 1689‚Äì90 for service in the French Army. The two forces were amalgamated in 1698 but continued the traditions of the old Irish Royal Army, and remained committed to the restoration of the Jacobites. They continued to wear the red coat of the Irish Royal Army, leading to occasional confusion when they were fighting the British Army.McNally p.83 Catholics, formally denied the right to enlist in the Irish Royal Army at home, served as Wild Geese in significant numbers. William reformed the Irish Royal Army, using it as a source of recruits for his international coalition during the Nine Years' War, and deploying it across Ireland as a garrison to prevent any potential Jacobite rising. Following the Treaty of Ryswick, William planned to maintain a much larger standing army in Ireland but he was forced by Parliamentary pressure to reduce this to 12,000.Childs 1987, p.194-202 Eighteenth century For much of the eighteenth century, the Irish Royal Army formed a strategic reserve for the British forces serving around the globe. Regiments would often be transferred to Ireland when they wished to recruit up to full strength. Although Catholics continued to be officially excluded from the Army throughout the era, many served the House of Hanover. Jacobite threat The Army continued to support the civil powers in the events of disturbances, such as the Dublin election riot in 1713. It also remained vigilant against the prospects of a Jacobite rebellion to restore the Stuarts to the throne, widespread amongst many Catholic followers of the exiled Duke of Ormonde. Contrary to expectations, a major rising did not place in Ireland following the Hanoverian Succession of 1714. Regiments from Ireland were sent over to Scotland to support the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1715.Reid p.19-20 A large network of barracks were constructed across the island, considerably ahead of many other regions where it was still usual to quarter soldiers in private houses. The Army was increased in size to 18,000. Ireland was considered a potential target of invasion by France during the Seven Years' War. In 1760 the Irish Royal Army was called out following a French landing at Carrickfergus. However the enemy withdrew before a major battle took place. French and Indian war The British government drew on regiments on the Irish establishment for the Expedition to Fort Duquesne at the opening stages of the French and Indian war. The 44th and 48th foot were quickly dispatched from Ireland and suffered heavy casualties at the disastrous engagement at Monongahela. Both regiments continued to serve throughout the war taking part in the more successful expedition against Havana before returning home in 1763 for service again in Ireland. American War of Independence Following the outbreak of rebellion in Britain's Thirteen Colonies in 1775, Ireland provided large numbers of recruits to the expanded British Army. Following a vote in the Irish Parliament, it was agreed that a number of Irish Royal Army regiments be allowed to serve in America. This led to concerns that Ireland was not properly defended once France entered the war in 1778, having sent so many soldiers abroad. A spontaneous movement established the Irish Volunteers, committed to the defence of the island against invasion. Despite this, the Volunteers rapidly emerged as a political movement demanding greater powers be granted to Ireland by London, which eventually led to the Constitution of 1782. Amongst its many measures, this gave the Irish Parliament greater control over its own armed forces. Rebellion of 1798 In the 1790s the Irish Royal Army was described as \\"not fit for purpose\\". This came at a time of growing support for the republican ideas of the French Revolution, amidst fears of the revolutionary spirit spreading to Britain and Ireland. Amalgamation The Irish Royal Army was amalgamated into the British Army following the Acts of Union 1800. By this stage the traditional ban on Irish Catholics serving in the army had been completely removed, and they began to supply a growing portion of troops.

He was accepted by Conn O'Neill as his natural son. Matthew was challenged by his alleged half-brother Shane O'Neill over who had the right to succeed as Earl of Tyrone. Biography Background and parents A son of Alison Kelly (n√© Roth) in Dundalk, the wife of a blacksmith, at the age of sixteen, he was presented to Conn O'Neill, whom Kelly had previously had an affair with. Conn accepted that Matthew was his natural son. Baron Dungannon As part of the surrender and regrant policy brought in during the reign of Henry VIII, Conn was made Earl of Tyrone with Matthew confirmed as his heir and made Baron of Dungannon. Both visited London to formally submit to the King. Conflict with Shane O'Neill This arrangement was disputed by Matthew's elder and legitimate half-brother Shane O'Neill, who had a larger and more powerful following. Shane's violent response crushed the government's hope that a peaceful succession might take place.Brady p.67 Matthew was killed by Shane's men in 1558, a year before Conn O'Neill died. In his attempts to gain recognition of the title of Earl of Tyrone from the Crown, Shane suggested that Matthew had not really been Conn's son, and his real father was a blacksmith from Dundalk named Kelly. Shane tried to show Matthew's claims were weak under both the English law of primogeniture as well as the Gaelic custom of the strongest member of the family inheriting. Shane received some recognition of his role as head of the √ì N√©ills, but he was never made an Earl before his death in 1567. Offspring Matthew had several children, the most notable of which was Hugh √ì N√©ill. With government-backing Hugh, who had been educated by an English family, returned to Ulster with a role in the Royal Irish Army and began to build up a power base. Hugh was able to secure the Crown's acknowledgement that Matthew had been Conn's legitimate heir, and Hugh was therefore made the 2nd Earl of Tyrone. He grew into the leading nobleman in Ulster before his Tyrone's Rebellion and subsequent Flight of the Earls destroyed his power base. Matthew's widow Siobh√°n Nic Uidhir remarried after his death to Sir Eoin O'Gallagher, an influential figure in neighboring Tyrconnell. * Brian O'Neill, Baron Dungannon * Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone ** Shane O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone ** Ellis O'Neill, Countess of Antrim * Cormac MacBaron O'Neill ** Conn O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone * Art MacBaron O'Neill **Brian MacArt O'Neill **Owen Roe O'Neill References Bibliography * Brady, Ciaran.

The 13-kilometre-long branch line links Haltingen on the Rhine Valley Railway with Kandern.  History  On 1 May 1895, the Kander Valley Railway was taken into service by a consortium of Vering & Waechter, Mitteldeutsche Creditbank and Moritz von Cohn. On 1 April 1899 the Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebsgesellschaft AG (DEBG) took over the Kander Valley Railway and ran in until 26 April 1963 when the S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs AG (SWEG) assumed operational control. After the collapse of an embankment on 4 July 1983 near Wollbach services between Wollbach and Kandern were suspended and passenger services suspended until 31 December 1983. Goods services to Wollbach were reinstated on 1 April 1985. On 14. April 1985 the line was still officially closed. Thereafter the Zweckverband Kandertalbahn took over the infrastructure and, since 1986, have operated a heritage railway here together with the Kandertalbahn e.V. ‚Äì the owner of the railway vehicles.

The saison traditionally begins on 1 May and runs until the end of October. On Sundays, three shuttle services are operated between Kandern and Haltingen, on 1 Mai, on Ascension Day and for the Rossm√§rkt (stallion market) in Kandern additional trains are laid on.

Coagulation is a chemical process that involves neutralization of charge whereas flocculation is a physical process and does not involve neutralization of charge. The coagulation-flocculation process can be used as a preliminary or intermediary step between other water or wastewater treatment processes like filtration and sedimentation. Iron and aluminium salts are the most widely used coagulants but salts of other metals such as titanium and zirconium have been found to be highly effective as well.  Factors  Coagulation is affected by the type of coagulant used, its dose and mass; pH and initial turbidity of the water that is being treated; and properties of the pollutants present. The effectiveness of the coagulation process is also affected by pretreatments like oxidation.  Mechanism  In a colloidal suspension, particles will settle very slowly or not at all because the colloidal particles carry surface electrical charges that mutually repel each other. This surface charge is most commonly evaluated in terms of zeta potential, the electrical potential at the slipping plane. To induce coagulation, a coagulant (typically a metallic salt) with the opposite charge is added to the water to overcome the repulsive charge and \\"destabilize\\" the suspension. For example, the colloidal particles are negatively charged and alum is added as a coagulant to create positively charged ions. Once the repulsive charges have been neutralized (since opposite charges attract), van der Waals force will cause the particles to cling together (agglomerate) and form micro floc. See p. 267.  Determining Coagulant Dose   Jar test  Jar test for coagulation The dose of the coagulant to be used can be determined via the jar test. The jar test involves exposing same volume samples of the water to be treated to different doses of the coagulant and then simultaneously mixing the samples at a constant rapid mixing time. The microfloc formed after coagulation further undergoes flocculation and is allowed to settle. Then the turbidity of the samples is measured and the dose with the lowest turbidity can be said to be optimum.  Microscale Dewatering Tests  Despite its widespread use in the performance of so-called \\"dewatering experiments\\", the jar test is limited in its usefulness due to several disadvantages. For example, evaluating the performance of prospective coagulants or flocculants requires both significant volumes of water/wastewater samples (liters) and experimental time (hours). This limits the scope of the experiments which can be conducted, including the addition of replicates. Furthermore, the analysis of jar test experiments produces results which are often only semi-quantitative. Coupled with the wide range of chemical coagulants and flocculants that exist, it has been remarked that determining the most appropriate dewatering agent as well as the optimal dose \\"is widely considered to be more of an ‚Äòart‚Äô rather than a ‚Äòscience‚Äô\\". As such, dewatering performance tests such as the jar test lend themselves well to miniaturization. For example, the Microscale Flocculation Test developed by LaRue et al. reduces the scale of conventional jar tests down to the size of a standard multi-well microplate, which yields benefits stemming from the reduced sample volume and increased parallelization; this technique is also amenable to quantitative dewatering metrics, such as capillary suction time.  Streaming Current Detector  An automated device for determining the coagulant dose is the Streaming Current Detector (SCD). The SCD measures the net surface charge of the particles and shows a streaming current value of 0 when the charges are neutralized (cationic coagulants neutralize the anionic colloids). At this value (0), the coagulant dose can be said to be optimum. Jar test: Mixing different doses of coagulant with samples of the water to be treated  Limitations  Coagulation itself results in the formation of floc but flocculation is required to help the floc further aggregate and settle. The coagulation-flocculation process itself removes only about 60%-70% of Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and thus, other processes like oxidation, filtration and sedimentation are necessary for complete raw water or wastewater treatment. Coagulant aids (polymers that bridge the colloids together) are also often used to increase the efficiency of the process.

Joe has two older siblings Arthur and Adrienne Hernandez, and one younger sister Sophia Cardona. He attended Granite Hills High School, lettering two years in football and four years in lacrosse, earning conference lacrosse MVP as a senior. He graduated in 2010. College career After high school, Cardona attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School for one year before enrolling in the Naval Academy, where he majored in economics. At Navy, he was a four-year starter in football as a long snapper, where he was not charged with a single bad snap. During his four years at Navy, the Midshipmen compiled a 30‚Äì21 record, including four wins over arch-rival Army, and played in three bowl games.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/navy/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/History-2014-Guide.pdf Professional career Washington Redskins 2015 season On May 2, 2015, the New England Patriots selected Cardona in the fifth round (166th overall) of the 2015 NFL draft, making him the fourth pure long snapper to be drafted in NFL history (and the second drafted by the Patriots, after Jake Ingram). His Naval assignment was delayed until after the 2015 NFL season so that he would be able to play in the NFL. The Patriots officially signed Cardona to his rookie contract on June 4, 2015. The structure of his contract is unusual, reflecting the uncertainty of his availability in future seasons. The signing bonus of $100,000 is less than the expected bonus of about $190,000 expected for his draft slot, but he can earn $100,000 in roster bonuses if he is on the 53-man roster or an injury list at any point in 2015, 2016, and 2017 seasons. On Thursday, September 10, in the NFL's opening game of the 2015 season, Cardona made his official debut as a long snapper in the Patriots' 28‚Äì21 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 2016 season On May 13, 2016, United States Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus approved Cardona's request (and the request of Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Keenan Reynolds) to play in the NFL for the 2016 season. For the second consecutive season, Cardona played in all 16 games for the Patriots. He was part of both Patriots' playoff wins, and went on to play in Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017. He was a contributor to the Patriots as they defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34‚Äì28 in overtime. Cardona had an active role in the game on seven special teams plays. 2017 season For the third consecutive season, Cardona played in all 16 games for the Patriots. He was part of both Patriots' playoff wins, and went on to play in Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018. The Patriots failed to repeat as Super Bowl Champions after losing 41‚Äì33 to the Philadelphia Eagles. 2018 season On June 14, 2018, Cardona signed a four-year contract extension with the Patriots. The Patriots reached Super Bowl LIII where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3.

He played college football at the University of Southern California (USC). He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. High school career Telfer was born on May 16, 1992, in Rancho Cucamonga, California. His mother was a physical therapist. Telfer attended Rancho Cucamonga High School, where he received a 3.5 grade point average. He had no familiarity with football and had never played the game, but head coach Nick Baiz convinced him to begin playing in his freshman year. His height and swiftness led to his being cast as a wide receiver, but he was so poor at catching footballs that he didn't play that year. He played only minimally his sophomore year, but had so rapidly developed as an athlete that he became the team's second receiver in his junior year. In the 2008 season, he caught 42 passes for and five touchdowns. Rancho Cucamonga won the Southern Section Central Division high school championship football game 21-7 over Upland High School. Telfer caught a touchdown that helped win the game for RCHS. By his senior year, Telfer had developed into a , receiver with superb blocking skills. Considered one of the state's top college football recruits, he had only played in 14 games. College career Telfer in 2012 College recruiters saw Telfer more as a tight end than a receiver. He was recruited by eight schools: Arizona State University, Stanford University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Oregon, the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Tennessee, the University of Washington, and Vanderbilt University. He favored Oregon and USC. Head coach Pete Carroll successfully recruited Telfer for the University of Southern California (USC), where he attended upon receiving an athletic scholarship. He was redshirted his freshman year (the 2010 season), after which Carroll left USC to coach professionally for the Seattle Seahawks. In the spring, the NCAA punished USC for numerous rules and recruiting violations, banning the team from playing in Pac-10 conference championship games and bowl games for two seasons. Telfer had the right to transfer to another school, but declined to do so. As a sophomore in 2011, Telfer had an outstanding season under head coach Lane Kiffin, catching 26 passes‚Äîfive of them for touchdowns. He suffered several injuries during the season, but continued to play. In his junior year, USC began the season ranked Number 1 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. Telfer had numerous additional injuries, and according to press reports probably should not have continued practicing or playing. Nevertheless, Telfer asked to continue playing, and received permission from coaching staff to do so. Telfer caught a touchdown pass that led USC to defeat the University of Oregon 38-35, a victory that ended the Oregon Ducks 21-home game winning streak. USC's 2012 season was a dismal one, as the team finished 7-6. The team played in the Sun Bowl, losing 21-7 to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. A violent altercation (which some media reported as a fistfight, while others said it was verbal) broke out in the USC locker room after the game, in which some younger players criticized senior quarterback Matt Barkley for not playing even though injured and for generally poor leadership throughout the season. Telfer played with numerous leg injuries in the 2013 season. Coaching staff permitted him to play, but counseled him several times that he should take a more prudent approach to his health. USC lost three of its first five games of Telfer's senior season, and Kiffin was fired as head coach on September 29, 2013. Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron was named the interim head coach, and led the team to a 6‚Äì2 record. Over the past two seasons, Telfer caught another 18 passes, five for touchdowns. Steve Sarkisian was named USC's permanent head coach at the end of the 2013 season. Telfer had arthroscopic surgery on a knee in the spring of 2014, which kept him out of spring training camp. Although many in the press predicted he would have the breakout fifth-year season, and Coach Sarkisian told Telfer he would be an \\"offensive weapon\\" in the coming year, Telfer was relegated largely to a role as a blocker. The Trojans ended their season playing in the Holiday Bowl, winning 45-42 over the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers. Telfer ended his college football career with 63 receptions, 12 of them for touchdowns. His USC teammates voted to give him the Chris Carlisle Courage Award for starting every game his final year, despite his significant injuries. Randall Telfer graduated from the University of Southern California in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in political science. In the fall of 2014, he began work at USC on a master's degree in communications management, with an emphasis on marketing. Telfer suffered a left mid-foot fracture of the tarsometatarsal articulations while playing in the Holiday Bowl. The injury was difficult to diagnose, and he did not undergo surgery to correct the fracture until mid-February 2015. Healing and rehabilitation for such injuries generally lasts four to six months, although eight months is not uncommon. Professional career Cleveland Browns The Cleveland Browns drafted Telfer in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. Telfer signed a four- year contract with the Browns on May 6, 2015, although terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. A later report said the terms were worth $2.397 million, which included a 117,537 signing bonus. On July 28, 2015, head coach Mike Pettine announced that Telfer would sit out training camp and remain idle until at least midseason. Pettine said that although some athletes return from mid-foot surgery in four to six months, the team would wait eight months and reevaluate Tefler's ability to play in October. Telfer played 14 games in the 2016 season under new head coach Hue Jackson, catching two passes for four yards and spending most of his time as a blocker. On May 2, 2018, Telfer was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for linebacker Dadi Nicolas. However two days later, the trade was called off and voided. Telfer was waived by the Browns. Indianapolis Colts On May 7, 2018, Telfer was claimed off waivers by the Indianapolis Colts, only to be waived the next day after failing his physical. On August 24, 2018, Telfer announced his retirement from the NFL.

In June 1940, he was transported to Auschwitz, where he was assigned prisoner number 121. At the camp, he was assigned to work in a barbershop.

He played college football at Iowa (2010‚Äì11), Coffeyville Community College (2012) and Arkansas (2013‚Äì14).  College career  Derby started his collegiate career at Iowa, where, after redshirting his freshman year, he was a backup quarterback in 2011. He appeared in nine games and completed three passes for 30 yards. Before his sophomore year, he transferred to Coffeyville Community College, where he finished the year throwing for 1,936 yards and 22 touchdowns, leading his team to Region IV semifinals. Before his junior year, he transferred again, to play at Arkansas, where he was a backup quarterback again. He started one game during the year, finishing the year throwing for 178 yards and one touchdown. Before his senior year, he was converted to tight end. Derby played in 11 games with 7 starts at tight end before missing the last two games due to a knee injury. He finished the year with 22 catches for 303 yards and three touchdowns.  Professional career  On November 30, 2014, it was announced that Derby had accepted his invitation to play in the 2015 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. Unfortunately, Derby was unable to play in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game after suffering a knee injury. He was one of 19 collegiate tight ends to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Derby was limited to performing the bench press due to his knee injury and successfully had 15 reps, placing him 13th among tight ends, only ahead of Oklahoma's Blake Bell. On March 4, 2015, Derby attended Arkansas' pro day, along with Trey Flowers, Darius Philon, Martrell Spaight, and 13 other prospects.

It did not reach production. Design The C.22 BN2 was based on the earlier Caudron C.21, but scaled up. The span was increased by 22%, requiring an extra bay and more powerful engines. The French BN2 military category specified a two-seat night bomber. It was a four bay biplane, with fabric covered, constant chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which carried the ailerons, had a 7% greater span and a smaller chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form engine bearing struts which supported the two rotary engines above the lower wing defined the inner two bays. It was designed to be powered either by a pair of Le Rh√¥ne 9Jb or Clerget 9B nine-cylinder rotary engines. Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing. The C.22's fuselage was almost flat sided, with a vertical knife edge at the short nose. The crew had an extended cockpit under the wing, with the pilot under the leading edge and the second member under the trailing edge which had a deep cut-out to increase the field of fire from his defensive machine gun. At the rear the straight edged fin was long and low, carrying a straight edged, balanced rudder that extended down to the keel. An angular tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, had elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The bomber had a tailskid undercarriage, with pairs of mainwheels on axles attached to longitudinal bars fixed under the engines on N-form struts. Its track was . The C.22 could carry six and three bombs. The military preferred the Breguet 16 and the Farman F.50 for the night bomber role and the C.22 did not go into production. In February 1919, immediately after the end of World War I, the French proposed a commercial passenger service between Paris and London, using the C.22 and a Farman Goliath but the plans were rejected by the British authorities.

The castle site lies in a triangle formed by the entrance of the H√∂llental valley ‚Äì the Lower H√∂llental and the Engenbach valley, not far from the Buchenbach village of Falkensteig, on a rocky crag that is very difficult to get to today. Of the castle itself only a few wall remains are left. It is one of the less well preserved ruins in the Breisgau.  History  The castle may have been built around 1200Estimate based on a comprehensive literature search by the Freiburg Monument Preservation Authority (Denkmalpflege Freiburg). This gives the latest construction date for the castle as 1230. The aristocratic surname \\"von Falkenstein\\" could however also indicate an earlier construction date of around 1150, like St. Oswald's Chapel in the upper H√∂llental, which was consecrated in 1148. However, to date there are no absolutely reliable sources for such a view. on a steep eminence at the lower entrance to the H√∂llental, also known as the Falkensteige, by a Z√§hringen ministerialis family. Its founders probably came from the Wittental valley from the lords of Weiler and BlankenbergBernhard Mangei, Herrschaftsbildung von K√∂nigtum. Kirche, Adel zwischen Oberrhein und Schwarzwald, Dissertation - Albert Ludwig University, Freiburg, 2003, p.164 and are first recorded from 1137 to 1148 as the lords of Falkenstein.Jutta Krimm-Beumann, Die √§ltesten G√ºterverzeichnisse des Klosters Sankt Peter im Schwarzwald - der Rotulus Sanpetrinus, Stuttgart, 2011, p. 45 In the ensuing period they rose to become one of the circle of important aristocratic families in the Breisgau. The valley was named Falkensteiner Tal after them and their castle, and only changed to H√∂llental later on. The castle was supposed to guard the important communication route through the valley which linked the Breisgau to the Baar region and Lake Constance. The lords of the castle soon reigned over an area that extended up the valley to Hinterzarten and Titisee. Other castles built by the Falkensteins were Falkenb√ºhl Castle, Bickenreute near Kirchzarten and Bubenstein Castle, also called Neufalkenstein (\\"New Falkenstein\\"). Gravestone of Sir Kuno of Falkenstein (died 1343) in Kirchzarten parish church, St. Gallus After the toll road, which had brought the Falkensteins substantial revenue, met with competition from the route through the Wagensteig valley built in 1310-1379, according to legend, the knights are said to have operated more and more as robber barons. In a conflict between an aristocratic coalition under the leadership of Count Eberhard II of W√ºrttemberg against the Swabian League, Werner von Falkenstein, on the orders of his overlord, blocked roads and plundered the League's citizens. Affected by the economic decline of the low nobility in the late 14th century, it was probably financial pressure that drove the Falkensteins to extend this approach to innocent travellers. This behaviour was the reason that, on 6 December 1388, Freiburg attacked and destroyed Falkenstein Castle.Heinrich Schreiber, Urkundenbuch der Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau, Freiburg 1829, Vol. 2, pp.59 -82 Other historians blame its destruction, however, on Freiburg's hunger for power. The castle chapel apparently survived the demise of the castle. In 1460, it is first mentioned as St. Nicholas' Chapel. In 1606 it was moved into the valley by the H√∂llenbach stream, today known as the Rotbach.  Description  Plan of the Falkenstein castle site. Key: A: Lower Ward; B: Middle Ward; C: Inner Ward; D: Neck Ditch; 1: present access path; 2: small rock plateau = West Tower? 3: large flat area = Stables? 4: possible building remains; 5: former entrance area = Castle Gate? 6: valley-facing remains of the enceinte; 7: ascent to the Inner Ward; 8: Tower and building remains; 9: former entrance to the Inner Ward = Gate? 10: building remains = Kitchen? 11: building remains = Chapel? 12: viewing platform and projecting wall section; 13: Bergfried The irregular and very inaccessible castle site rises through four levels. For simplicity, it will be described under four sections. First, is the lower ward (Unterburg, A) whose fragmented wall remains are up to six metres high and three metres thick, and run from the southwest side of the castle rock up to, and along, its northern flank. Here, there are more, very substantial, staggered sections of wall and what is assumed to be the old entrance area and castle gate (5) above the Engenbach valley and present day entrance at its western tip. (1) Second, there is an adjoining neck ditch, about 20 metres long, 4 to 6 metres wide and up to 12 metres deep (D), cutting through the ridge to the northeast. Third, is a small middle ward (Mittelburg, B) on a roughly six-metre-high rock step rising above the lower ward - which lies to its west and north - on the upper part of the castle rock, and extending northeast to a point above the neck ditch. Fourth, is the upper ward (Oberburg) or inner ward (Kernburg) (C) on the ascending, elongated rocky ridge that is up to 55 metres long, between 12 and 16 metres wide and runs from southwest to northeast. Among other large sections of surviving wall at the south and southwestern tip are: a wall about ten metres long and three metres high facing the valley which is believed to belong to the castle kitchen (10); another wall, six metres wide and about 2.5 metres high (11), which could be the site of the chapel; a further prominent, tooth-like wall in the centre on the southeastern cliff edge - easily visible from the H√∂llental valley when approaching from Hirschsprung - and finally the remains of a quadrangle with walls measuring about nine by nine metres - probably the former bergfried - on a lofty site at the northeastern end of the castle rock.

In an effort to reduce the homophobia of the original script and present a more realistic and positive portrayal of the gay characters, Greer rewrote much of the dialogue and worked with the director. Upon release, the film was protested by gays for propagating stereotypes of gay men as \\"swishy\\", effeminate draft dodgers.Kinser, Jeremy. \\"Artful Dodgers: The '60s flick The Gay Deceivers Showed Inductees Mincing to Avoid a War ‚Äî And Had 'Pansies' in an Uproar\\", The Advocate, October 12, 1999, p. 61.

Greer aspired to play a diverse range of movie roles, at one point optioning and writing a screenplay about mass murderer Richard Speck in which he hoped to star. However, his ability to get parts was limited by homophobia and typecasting. Although most media in the late 1960s and early 1970s avoided directly stating that Greer was homosexual (and frequently implied that he was interested in women), he refused to marry a woman or otherwise pretend to be heterosexual for the sake of his acting career, despite his agent's advice to do so.

As he gets into bed, Pluto joins Mickey, but then gets sent to his basket as he's a dog. As soon as Mickey falls asleep, Pluto creeps back into Mickey's bed and licks his face. Mickey dreams a mysterious dream about when he proposed to Minnie Mouse and got married at the church after the proposal. After the wedding, Mickey and Pluto are in the garden watering the flowers. A stork comes by and drops the first batch of baby mice into the chimney of Mickey and Minnie's home. But then, more baby mice start to arrive by the same stork and a bucketful of them are poured down the chimney. Mickey rushes inside to find Minnie Mouse in bed with many baby mice. They all start to chase and play rough with their father along with their pet dog. Soon, the baby mice start to use paintbrushes to paint the wall and ceiling in black paint. They also throw pillows at Mickey landing on his face. But the last one smacks Mickey so hard, that his jug is now in pieces. He is then in a tight tangle whilst the paint is licking across his face, the telephone is ringing and the cuckoo clock is crowing. But in Mickey's bedroom, he finds himself wrapped up in his bedclothes with Pluto licking across his face and the rooster is crowing whilst his alarm clock is ringing. Mickey wakes up and realizes it's a dream and his determination is to never marry Minnie. The cartoon ends with Pluto licking his master's face.

He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL Draft, and has played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, and Philadelphia Eagles. Early life Hayes Pullard was born in Inglewood, California, to Hayes Pullard, Jr. and his wife, Sharon Pullard. He was one of 10 children. His uncle was Robert Pullard, a stand-out pole vaulter at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1971 to 1974. His uncle placed third at the 1973 NCAA track and field championships, and fourth in 1974. His mother was manager at a bank, and an ordained minister. Hayes' father collapsed on September 29, 2008, while playing basketball on his 60th birthday. He fell into a coma, and died on October 13, 2008. Pullard attended Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, California, where he also played football, basketball, and sprinted for the track and field team. His mother wanted Pullard to attend an academically superior school on the other side of the San Fernando Valley, away from the drugs, violence, and crime which surrounded Crenshaw (a high school in a poor neighborhood). Pullard's brothers DeShawn and Ken had attended Crenshaw High. DeShawn Pullard even tried to convince Hayes to attend Susan Miller Dorsey High School, which had an excellent football program. But Pullard agreed with his father, and attended Crenshaw. Pullard played linebacker and defensive back on defense, and running back on offense. From 2007 to 2009, Pullard played alongside De'Anthony Thomas and Marcus Martin, and the three helped Crenshaw High School become the first Los Angeles City Section team to play in a state championship game. In his last two years, he had 211 defensive tackles, gained on offense (including 20 touchdowns), and caught 21 receptions for on offense (four for touchdowns). By the end of his senior season, Pullard stood tall and weighed . Pullard was not only a star player at Crenshaw, but also mentored other students. He often invited at-risk kids to come to his home so they would stay off the street, and helped them study for classes. He became particularly close to his high school football coach, Robert Garrett. He continued to speak with Garrett twice a week by telephone throughout his collegiate career. College career Pullard grew up wanting to attend the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where numerous other Crenshaw students had played football. But his father wanted Hayes to attend USC, where Robert Pullard shined as an athlete. UCLA offered Pullard an athletic scholarship, and Pullard made several visits to the campus to speak with former Crenshaw students playing for the Bruins. But USC head coach Pete Carroll and assistant defensive coach Ken Norton, determined to recruit more players from the neighborhoods near their university, were also interested in Pullard. Norton convinced Pullard to attend some USC practices. Pullard was strongly impressed with Carroll and Norton's coaching, and the attitude and energy of the USC players. The day before National Signing Day, Carroll announced he was leaving USC to coach professionally for the Seattle Seahawks. Norton convinced Pullard to stick with USC. He was redshirted his freshman year (the 2010 season) after suffering a knee sprain mid-season. He had surgery in the off-season to correct problems which arose from the sprain. That summer, the NCAA punished USC for numerous rules and recruiting violations, banning the team from playing in Pac-10 conference championship games and bowl games for two seasons. Pullard had the right to transfer to another school, but declined to do so. Pullard started all 12 games for the Trojans in the 2011 season. Pullard was a weak side linebacker, helping to lead the team in weak-side tackles. He led the team in tackles (81), and he and fellow freshman linebacker Dion Bailey became the first freshmen to lead USC in tackles since the team began keeping records. In Pullard's junior year in 2012, USC began the season ranked Number 1 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. USC's 2012 season was a dismal one, as the team finished 7-6. The team played in the Sun Bowl, losing 21-7 to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. A violent altercation (which some media reported as a fistfight, while others said it was verbal) broke out in the USC locker room after the game, in which some younger players criticized senior quarterback Matt Barkley for not playing even though injured and for generally poor leadership throughout the season. Pullard had an outstanding year, however, and along with T. J. McDonald was one of only two players to have more than 100 tackles (107) in a season‚Äîthe first time any USC player had as many tackles in a single season since 1996. Pullard was elected team co-captain by his fellow players in the 2013 season. McDonald was the individual most responsible for telling Pullard to step up as a team leader, a role Pullard then embraced. USC lost three of its first five games of Pullard's senior season, and Kiffin was fired as head coach on September 29, 2013. Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron was named the interim head coach, and led the team to a 6‚Äì2 record. At season's end, Pullard had 94 tackles. Many in the news media speculated that Pullard would forego his senior year of football and join the 2014 NFL Draft. But Pullard had promised his mother he would graduate from college, and declined to do so. Pullard was again elected team co-captain by his fellow players in the 2014 season. Steve Sarkisian was named USC's permanent head coach at the end of the 2013 season. Sarkisian said Pullard was a team leader in soothing feelings and helping make the transition a smooth one. In the second game of the season, Pullard was ejected for the last half of the game for hitting Stanford University wide receiver Ty Montgomery out of bounds after the play was over. The Trojans ended their season playing in the Holiday Bowl, winning 45-42 over the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers. Pullard had a team-high 87 tackles his final season, making him the first USC player since Dennis Johnson (1977 to 1979) to lead the team in tackles for three back-to-back seasons. He ended his career at USC with 369 tackles‚Äîseventh most in USC history and just 27 short of the 396 career tackles set by Marcus Cotton from 1984 to 1987. In May 2015, Pullard graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in policy, planning and development. Professional career Pullard was not expected to be drafted, due to the glut of linebackers in the draft. His prospects dramatically improved when, two days before the draft, he published an open letter to the 32 NFL teams on The Players' Tribune. Pullard discussed his ability to read offenses, his loyalty in the face of difficult times and program changes at USC, and the adversity he faced in life. Cleveland Browns The Cleveland Browns selected Pullard in the seventh round (219th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the 33rd linebacker selected in 2015. On May 17, 2015, the Cleveland Browns signed Pullard four-year, $2.35 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $79,240. He was released by the Browns on September 5, 2015. He was signed to the Browns' practice squad the following day. Jacksonville Jaguars On October 28, 2015, the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Pullard off the Browns' practice squad. They signed him to a four-year, $2.28 million contract. On September 3, 2017, Pullard was waived by the Jaguars. Los Angeles Chargers On September 4, 2017, Pullard was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Chargers and was reunited with Chargers' defensive coordinator Gus Bradley who was Pullard's head coach in Jacksonville. He was signed as depth at middle linebacker after starter Denzel Perryman was placed on injured/reserve with an ankle injury. Upon joining the team, head coach Anthony Lynn named Pullard the backup middle linebacker behind Korey Toomer. He competed in an open competition between himself, Korey Toomer, and Kyle Emanuel for the job as the starting middle linebacker. On September 2, 2018, Pullard was waived by the Chargers. He was re-signed on October 30, 2018. Arizona Cardinals On August 2, 2019, Pullard signed with the Arizona Cardinals. He was released on August 25, 2019. Philadelphia Eagles On August 27, 2019, Pullard signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was released during final roster cuts on August 30, 2019.

Officially, it was presented as a private body, but the PAIH was financially supported by the Ministry of Military Affairs, and was subjected to the Second Department of Polish General Staff (military intelligence) (see History of Polish intelligence services). The creation of the PAIH was a Polish response to the activities of foreign industrial espionage services. They actively operated on the territory of the Second Polish Republic, and the government in Warsaw was unable to effectively control them. The foreign services gained information about Polish heavy industry, in order to analyze defensive abilities of the Polish Army. All activities of the PAIH were ordered by the Second Department of the General Staff. The agency provided information and opinion about enterprises operating in Poland, especially those which cooperated with the Army. In PAIH‚Äôs reports, their loyalty to the Polish state was analyzed, together with their competences and professionalism. In the 1937 analysis, the PAIH experts emphasized several negative situations in the Polish economy, especially in those enterprises which belonged to the foreign capital. It pointed out that three companies which extracted lead (\\"Giesche\\", \\"Gepner\\", \\"Wyrgumet\\"), decided to cut their production in Poland, while Polish neighbors increased led extraction. Other examples of negative situations, revealed by the PAIH were: * the agreement of British-owned company Schicht-Lever SA and German- owned company Zaklady Przemyslowe E. Kollontaya, against Polish plans of gaining independence from foreign exports, * actions against Polish batteries manufacturers, initiated by foreign companies, such as German-Swedish consortium Ericsson-Niffe, * wrong bookeeping and draining of Warsaw Power Plant by French-owned company Compagnie d‚ÄôElectricite a Varsovie, * closing of several Polish sugar plants by a foreign sugar cartel, which claimed financial losses. This was negative to the interests of the Polish state, as sugar and sugar products were necessary for the Polish Army, * cooperation of purveyors of raw hide to the Army, aimed at raising the price of this product. By the mid-1930s, the PAIH grew to such a degree that it needed financial support from the Army. In 1932‚Äì34, Polish General Staff supported it with 2‚Äì4 thousand z≈Çotys monthly. Since each report, created by PAIH experts, was paid for by the army and government agencies, such as Ministry of Trade, in 1936 profits of the agency amounted to 36,000 z≈Çotys. By 1937, the agency had its branches in Katowice, Gdynia, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ and Lw√≥w. It also had 4500 field correspondents and 200 qualified informants. In comparison to German industrial espionage agencies (Sonderdienst Nuntia, which in 1930 was incorporated into the Abwehr, and Sicherheitsdienst IG Farben Leverkusen, owned by the IG Farben), the activities of the PAIH were much more limited, due to better organization of German agencies. Furthermore, Minister Jozef Beck did not want to spoil Polish-German relations, and restrained the PAIH, to the advantage of the Germans. The agency ceased to exist in September 1939 (see Invasion of Poland).  See also  * Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego  Sources  * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Bitwa o tajemnice.

Van der Waals forces link the atoms together. The combination of three atoms is much more stable than the two-atom helium dimer. The three-atom combination of helium-4 atoms is an Efimov state. Helium-3 is predicted to form a trimer, although ground state dimers containing helium-3 are completely unstable. Helium trimer molecules have been produced by expanding cold helium gas from a nozzle into a vacuum chamber. Such a set up also produces the helium dimer and other helium atom clusters. The existence of the molecule was proven by matter wave diffraction through a diffraction grating. Properties of the molecules can be discovered by Coulomb explosion imaging. In this process, a laser ionizes all three atoms simultaneously, which then fly away from each other due to electrostatic repulsion and are detected. The helium trimer is large, being more than 100 √Ö, which is even larger than the helium dimer. The atoms are not arranged in an equilateral triangle, but instead form random shaped triangles. Interatomic Coulombic decay can occur when one atom is ionised and excited. It can transfer energy to another atom in the trimer, even though they are separated. However this is much more likely to occur when the atoms are close together, and so the interatomic distances measured by this vary with half full height from 3.3 to 12 √Ö. The predicted mean distance for Interatomic Coulombic decay in 4He3 is 10.4 √Ö. For 3He4He2 this distance is even larger at 20.5 √Ö.

Morscio (1887-1972) was mainly devoted to still life and frescos; he was active in Liguria and Nice, and he exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1930 and practiced in France also as a gallery owner. The collection was enlarged by the municipal administration in the eighties. After an initial location in the former town hall, the museum was transferred to the Doria Garoscio Palace.  Collection  The original collection is focused on a selection of works by Morscio and some Italian and French painters of his time: Eloi No√´l Bouvard, Mario Ameglio, Eugenio Bonivento, Cyrano Castelfranchi, Georges Chappuis, Gaston Cirmeuse, Yves Diey, Robert Duflos, Charley Garry, Maurice Martin, Maurice Louis Monnot, Fernando Pelosini, Alberto Rossi, Andr√© Salomon Le Tropezien. After Morscio's death collection has been enlarged with paintings by Achille Cabiati, Marcello Cammi, Franco Giglio and Mario Raimondo.
