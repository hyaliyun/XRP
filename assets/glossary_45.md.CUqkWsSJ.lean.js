Biography Bayley was born in 1745 in Fairfield, then in the Colony of Connecticut, to a family of French Hugenot and English descent, based in New Rochelle, New York. In 1766 he was apprenticed to New York City physician John Charlton. Bayley married John's sister, Catherine Charlton, at St. John's Episcopal Church (Elizabeth, New Jersey); her father was the rector of St. Andrew's Church (Staten Island, New York). The couple had three children, including Elizabeth Ann Bayley and Guy Carlton Bayley. Later known as Mother Seton, Elizabeth became the foundress of the first group of Catholic Religious Sisters in the nation, and was the first native-born citizen of the United States to be declared a saint. Guy's son James Roosevelt Bayley became a Roman Catholic Bishop and Archbishop. Richard Bayley traveled to London in 1769, where he studied anatomy with William Hunter. Bayley returned to the United States in 1772, where he opened a practice with Charlton, his father-in-law and former instructor. He returned to England in 1775 to continue his work with Hunter. A Loyalist, Bayley returned to America and enlisted in the British army as a surgeon at the start of the American Revolution and was stationed in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1777, however, the illness of his wife caused him to return to New York, where she soon died. He took no further part in the conflict. The following year he married Charlotte Barclay, and they eventually had four children. They later separated. Bayley's chief focus in his medical practice was the poor of the city. He helped to found the New York Dispensary, which operated in the Greenwich Village neighborhood well into the 20th century. He was the first American surgeon to successfully amputate an arm at the shoulder. By 1783, Bayley had begun performing cataract surgery. His laboratory was attacked in the 1788 Doctors' Riot. His anatomical collection was destroyed, but he escaped without injury. In 1792 he began to teach anatomy and surgery at Kings College of New York. He began studies of yellow fever when the disease broke out in New York in 1795. His work helped discover its epidemiology. As a result, around 1796, he was appointed as the first health officer of the Port of New York, in charge of a quarantine station in what is now Tompkinsville, Staten Island. In 1797 the newly created Board of Health Commissioners was given the authority to make ordinances for cleaning the city. Efforts to address standing water and sewage in the streets where the soap and candle makers worked, prompted the soap boilers and tallow chandlers talk of petitioning the Legislature for a removal of the Health Officer. He authored the Quarantine Act of 1799.\\"Early History of Medicine in New York\\", Part II, Americana, Vol.9, National American Society, 1914. Bayley contracted yellow fever while checking a ship that had just arrived from Ireland and died from it on August 17, 1801. He was buried in the cemetery of the church served by his father-in-law. Legacy Bayley Seton Hospital, once located in the Clifton section of Staten Island, was named for both Bayley and his daughter, Elizabeth. It was founded and run by the Sisters of Charity of New York, until 2006.

These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice as a place to treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying. Under hospice, medical and social services are supplied to patients and their families by an interdisciplinary team of professional providers and volunteers, who take a patient-directed approach to managing illness. Generally, treatment is not diagnostic or curative, although the patient may choose some treatment options intended to prolong life, such as CPR. Most hospice services are covered by Medicare or other providers, and many hospices can provide access to charitable resources for patients lacking such coverage. With practices largely defined by the Medicare system, a social insurance program in the United States, and other health insurance providers, hospice care is made available in the United States to patients of any age with any terminal prognosis who are medically certified to have less than six months to live. In 2007, hospice treatment was used by 1.4 million people in the United States. More than one-third of dying Americans use the service. Common misperceptions regarding the length of time a patient may receive hospice care and the kinds of illnesses covered may result in hospice being underutilized. Although most hospice patients are in treatment for less than thirty days, and many for less than one week, hospice care may be authorized for more than six months given a patient's condition. Care may be provided in a patient's home or in a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged for a number of reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal. In other countries, there may not be the same distinctions made between care of those with terminal illnesses and palliative care in a more general setting. In such countries, the term hospice is more likely to refer to a particular type of institution, rather than specifically to care in the final months or weeks of life. End-of-life care is more likely to be included in the general term \\"palliative care\\". History and statistics The first hospices are believed to have originated in the 11th century, when for the first time the terminally ill were permitted into places dedicated to treatment by Crusaders. In the early 14th century, the order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem opened the first hospice in Rhodes, meant to provide refuge for travelers and care for the ill and dying.Connor, 5. The hospice practice languished until revived in the 17th century in France by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and, later, by the Irish Sisters of Charity, who opened St Joseph's Hospice in London, England in 1902. In the 1950s at St. Joseph's, Cicely Saunders developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care. She later founded St Christopher's Hospice in London. In 1971, Hospice, Inc. was founded in the United States, the first organization to introduce the principles of modern hospice care to that country, where medical care had focused on fighting illness through hospital stays.Connor, 6. Throughout the 1970s, the philosophies of hospice were being implemented throughout the United States. The hospice movement in the United States became distinguished from that in Britain, according to Stephen Connor's Hospice: Practice, Pitfalls and Promise, by \\"a greater emphasis on use of volunteers and more focus on psychological preparation for death\\".Connor, 5‚Äì6. In 1982 Medicare, a social insurance program in the United States, added hospice services to its coverage. On September 13, 1982, by request of the senate, US President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the week of November 7 through November 14, 1982, as National Hospice Week. Since then, the hospice industry has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and the aging of the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non- profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare- certified providers in the United States. According to the 2017 National Hospice and Palliative Care Organizations Facts and Figures, 1.49 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice care for one day or more, which is 4.5% increase from the prior year. Other statistics from the 2017 report are as follows: * 48.2 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2017 were enrolled in hospice at the time of death. * 40.5 percent of patients received care for 14 days or less, while those receiving care for more than 180 days accounted for 14.1 percent. * At 98.2 percent, Routine Home Care accounts for the vast majority of days of care. * $18.99 billion was spent on hospice care by Medicare in 2017, representing an increase of 6.3 percent. * Since 2014, beneficiaries identified as Asian and Hispanic increased by 32 percent and 21 percent respectively. As the hospice industry has expanded, so has the concept of hospice care. In 2003 the first US children's hospice facility, the George Mark Children's House Hospice, opened in San Francisco. In February 2009, Buffalo News reported that the balance of non-profit and for-profit hospices was shifting, with the latter as \\"the fastest-growing slice of the industry.\\" Philosophy and practices The goal of hospice agencies in the United States is to provide comfort to the patient and heighten quality of life. How comfort is defined is up to the patient or, if the patient is incapacitated, the patient's family. This can mean freedom from physical, emotional, spiritual and/or social pain. Hospices typically do not perform treatments that are meant to diagnose or cure an illness,Old and Swagerty, 8. and they do not seek to hasten death or, primarily or unduly, to extend life.Plocher and Metzger, 122.This is an approach historically taken by hospice providers in England. Cf. While it is generally not required that patients sign \\"Do not resuscitate\\" (DNR) orders to be on hospice, some hospices require them as a condition of acceptance. Many hospice patients, though not all, have made decisions against receiving CPR should their heart or breathing stop. If a patient does decide to request CPR, that service may not be provided by the hospice; the family may need to contact Emergency Medical Services to provide CPR. The principle of not extending life and withdrawing diagnostic or curative treatments is often the greatest barrier for patients in accepting hospice care. In some cases, medical professionals may feel conflict in attempting to provide it. Some confusion still exists as to what treatments a patient may receive in hospice care. Hospices may provide treatments that have been traditionally regarded as curative, including radiation therapy or antibiotics, if these are administered to improve quality of life.Wilbur and Graber, 850. Determination of appropriate treatment is made by medical personnel on an individual basis. Another aspect of the hospice philosophy is that the care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided.. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy. =Popular media= Hospice care in the United States was the subject of the Netflix 2018 Academy Award-nominated short documentary End Game, about terminally ill patients in a San Francisco hospital and Zen Hospice Project, featuring the work of palliative care physician BJ Miller and other palliative care clinicians. The film was executive produced by hospice and palliative care activist Shoshana R. Ungerleider. Hospice demographic In order to qualify for hospice care, a patient must have certification from two physicians that he or she has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, and as long as the hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care. Many physicians are slow to refer to hospice care, waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis. Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six-month prognosis or less to receive hospice care, while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis, presuming treatment will be more effective than it is. As a result, the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end-stages of their diseases, or choose that time to seek hospice care. The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 and 19 days in 1998. Although the length of average stays has since increased, the term of care continues to be underused. In 2004 the average stay was 57 days and the median length was 22 days. 33% of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission. Such late admission is inconsistent with the process of hospice, which is to alleviate patient distress over a period of time, based on time for patients and family members to develop relationships with the hospice team. Some people believe that only individuals suffering from cancer or AIDS can receive hospice care. Hospice in the United States developed around the model of cancer care, with a relatively predictable pattern of deterioration. According to 2002's The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End- of-life Care, \\"60% of hospice patients have cancer.\\" But, patients can be on hospice for numerous other illnesses, such as end-stage heart and lung diseases, stroke, renal failure, Alzheimers, or many other conditions. Any diagnosis that would be an acceptable cause of death on a death certificate is, if expected to be terminal, an acceptable diagnosis for hospice care. =Re-certification= In order to qualify for hospice, a patient has to be certified as having a prognosis of less than six months to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition. =Pediatric hospice care= Patients in hospice have primarily been elderly; according to the 2006 Handbook of Social Work in Health and Aging, more than 80% of hospice patients in the United States are over 65. But hospice care is available to all age groups, including those under 21. Not all hospices are able to serve every population. In 1983, less than 1% of hospice providers offered pediatric care; by 2001, that number had grown to 15%. The first pediatric hospice facility in the United States, the George Mark Children's House Hospice of San Francisco, opened in 2003. While pediatric hospice options are expanding, as of 2006 many adult-oriented hospice programs remained ill-prepared to handle younger populations.. The primary diagnosis for children in hospice treatment is cancer, but, like the adult population, children may enter hospice for a variety of conditions, including AIDS, prematurity, congenital disorder, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or \\"death-inducing trauma\\", such as automobile accidents. Hospice care, which is intended to treat the whole family, may also be made available to families expecting a child who is not anticipated to survive long after delivery. The recommended model of hospice for children differs from that of adults. In 2000, the committees on Bioethics and Hospital Care for the American Academy of Pediatrics jointly released a recommendation that palliative care for children should be provided for any life-threatening condition from the point of diagnosis, whether death is the prognosis or not, as the benefits of palliative care can be offered concurrently with curative treatment. The Virginia-based Children's Hospice International also recommends hospice services for all children with life-threatening conditions, even if seeking \\"hopeful\\" treatment, \\"to enhance the quality of life for the child and family\\".Ferrell and Coyle, 910. However, the federal standards set by Medicaid require the six-months terminal prognosis. Insurance providers may restrict access to hospice care to pediatric patients undergoing life-extending treatment.Farrell and Coyle, 915. Expense The cost of hospice care may be met by health insurance providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care in order to get a patient's symptoms under control. Most commercial health insurances and Medicaid have a hospice benefit as well. These typically are similar to the Medicare benefit. There may be a co-pay required by commercial health insurance providers depending on individual plans. According to a 2008 article by Lauren Tara LaCapra on TheStreet.com, Medicare and Medicaid paid 78% of home-based hospice charges in 2008, with 12% being supplied by private insurance providers and 10% \\"out of pocket\\", paid by the patient. Most non-profit hospice agencies have contingencies for patients who lack insurance coverage and will provide care to the patient free of charge or at reduced rates. LaCapra said that out-of- pocket expenses for home-based hospice services were $758 a year in 2008 for the average hospice patient. Once a patient is enrolled in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if a patient is on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance. Providers Hospice is a competitive business. In any given service area, there may be hundreds of different non- profit and commercial providers.Connor, 118 Hospices can be small community- based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, the mean number of patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year.NHPCO facts and figures, 9. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers. In order to receive payments for hospice patients under Medicare or Medicaid, a hospice must be certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and in 2007 93.1% were.NHPCO facts and figures, 10. Among those that were not certified, some were in the process of seeking certification. However, some agencies do not seek certification or voluntarily relinquish it. For one example, an agency that is entirely supported through donations or relies on volunteer staff might not choose to seek certification. The NHPCO estimated in 2008 that at least 200 \\"all-volunteer\\" programs were in operation in the United States. Levels of care There are four primary levels of care; routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient and respite/respite inpatient.Kinzbrunner et al., 33. All hospices in the United States certified by Medicare are required to offer each of these levels of care. =Routine home care= Routine home care is the most common level of care provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not indicate a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants.Kuebler et al., 9. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns. =Continuous care= Continuous Care is a service provided in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care is intended to be used for short periods of time. =General inpatient care= General inpatient care is an intensive level of care which may be provided in a nursing home, a specially contracted hospice bed or unit in a hospital, or in a free-standing hospice unit.Kinzbrunner et al., 34. General inpatient criteria is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms which require daily interventions from the hospice team to manage. Often, patients on this level of care have begun the \\"active phase\\" of dying, when their prognosis is measured in days as opposed to weeks or months. Although there is a limit to how long Medicare will cover this level of care, it is usually provided for brief periods of time, with five to seven days being the average. =Respite= Respite Care (sometimes referred to as respite inpatient) is a brief and periodic level of care a patient may receive. Respite is a unique benefit in that the care is provided for the needs of the family, not the patient. Should a family member need a \\"break\\" from caregiving, or if a vacation is planned, then this level of care may be provided. During respite, the patient is transferred from the home to an institutional setting; this can be a nursing home, assisted living, hospital or an inpatient hospice unit. Should a patient be transferred to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, the only difference between respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period. Hospice interdisciplinary team The hospice interdisciplinary team is the core service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team.Ferrell and Coyle, 35. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated may or may not relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members. The hospice team is required by Medicare to meet every 14 days. During this team meeting, patient needs are discussed and planned for the next two weeks. Additionally, the team reviews the patient's medical condition to ensure that the patient still meets criteria for hospice care. =Team members= Team members include hospice medical directors, physicians, pharmacists, registered nurses, social workers, counselors, home health aides, and volunteers.Forman, et al., 16‚Äì22. * Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often provides the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient does not have a primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.Forman et al., 16‚Äì19. * Physician: Physicians involved in patient care may include the primary physician, who can provide valuable information about patient medical history, and physicians connected to the hospice team. These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly.Forman et al., 19. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006,American Board of Medical Specialties, ABMS Establishes New Subspecialty Certificate in Hospice and Palliative Medicine , October 6, 2006, accessed 11/9/2010. to provide expertise in the care of patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.American Board of Medical Specialties, ABMS Guide to Physician Specialties , 2011, p. 2, accessed 11/9/2010. * Registered Nurses: Registered nurses are responsible for coordinating all aspects of the patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.Forman et al., 19‚Äì21. * Social Worker: Every patient is assigned a social worker who visits at the time of admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.Forman et al., 21‚Äì22. * Counselor: Counselors are required as part of the core team by Medicare regulations. Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve.Forman et al., 22. While not every patient will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices have to be able to provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.Ferrell and Coyle, 36. * Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide is not a core service for a hospice patient; this means it is not required that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3‚Äì7 days a week for approximately 1‚Äì2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.Forman et al., 24‚Äì26. * Pharmacist: Pharmacists oversee the patient's drug therapy, which includes filling prescriptions, monitoring for drug interactions and adverse effects, anticipating problems, and assessing the appropriateness of drug therapies in the context of patient- oriented goals.Forman et al., 26‚Äì27.Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, et al. Clinical pharmacist competencies. Pharmacotherapy 2008;28(6):806-815. * Volunteers: Volunteers form a major part of hospice care in the United States and may provide a variety of physical or emotional comforts to patients and family, including providing housework, health care, spiritual counseling and companionship. Hospice volunteers also provide administrative assistance to hospices.Forman et al., 27‚Äì28. Discharge from hospice The majority of discharges from hospice are due to the death of the patient, although hospice treatment may not end then as care also provides for a period of bereavement counseling for the family afterward.Cowles, 296. However, there are several other scenarios when a patient may be discharged from hospice. De- certification: If it is determined at the time of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice. Revocation: A patient may be discharged by revocation if he or she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it. Transfer of hospice: Transfer of hospice does not involve a discharge from hospice in general, but a discharge from the current hospice provider to another one.Cowles, 297. Discharge for cause: Occasionally a hospice will be unable to provide care to a patient, either due to philosophical differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary. Barriers to access As indicated, hospice is frequently under-utilized and often not taken advantage of until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have as much to do with financial considerations as with the psycho- social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers. =Reimbursement= * Physicians: There are multiple aspects as to why, financially, hospice care may be difficult to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians.See Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non- referral from a physician. * Nursing Homes: A second aspect to reimbursement pertains to the nursing home. In many cases, patients who are transferred to a nursing home from a hospital will have a portion of their nursing home stay reimbursed by Medicare. In these cases, Medicare is paying for some kind of rehabilitative care. Medicare will not reimburse any room and board coverage in the nursing home for patients on hospice. Occasionally, patients who would be better served receiving hospice care will be \\"rehabilitated\\" in the nursing home so as to defray the costs of the room and board. * Hospices: While late referral to hospice is a much more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de- certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission. =Stigma= * Physicians: Medical care is traditionally focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice care is not seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not many of the other terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care. * Patients: Many patients and families simply do not want to receive hospice care. The most common reason is an unwillingness to recognize when comfort rather than cure is a more realistic goal. When hospice is framed as care for when \\"there is nothing left to do\\" instead of a different kind of treatment, patients may believe that choosing hospice is the equivalent of doing nothing.Jennings, et al., 26,27,28 See also * Stephen Connor (psychologist) ReferencesExternal links * Family Caregiver's Guide to Hospice and Palliative Care * Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Hospice Conditions of Participation; Final Rule, June 5, 2008.

History  The origins of expeditionary education could be thought to extend far back into early human history through hunting and gathering expeditions where traditional ecological knowledge was learned. Potentially one of the first formal applications of expeditionary education were the field trips conducted through Henry David Thoreau and his brother John's Concord MA grammar school in 1838. Later in the 19th century a summer camping movement was established in response to anxieties about urban and industrial influences on children. During this time, expeditions into \\"nature\\" were combined with informal educational pursuits. Scouting, a movement started in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell initiated widespread development of practical outdoor skills which often incorporated expeditionary components like camping, backpacking, and canoeing and has grown to 38 million members in 216 countries 100 years after its inception.see scouting para. 3-4.

Negotiations first took place with the help of the Libyan government, but also with Algeria, a regional rival of the Libyans, and home to a substantial Tuareg population. In March, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya negotiated the release of Malian army prisoners held by the rebels, and sporadic talks were held with Libyan mediation. Malian armed forces remained in control of all the major settlements, but Malian rebels staged a series of raids, the largest taking place at the end of March.

The Algerian ambassador to Mali, Abdelkrim Ghrieb, had negotiated the deal, between Amada Ag Bibi (now a Deputy in the Malian National Assembly) for the rebels and General Kafougouna Kon√©, Malian Minister of the Interior, for the Malian government. 92 prisoners held by the rebels would be released, amnesties were promised for rebels, and re-integration into the military (along the lines of the 2006 deal) were promised for Tuareg fighters. This agreement held throughout 2008, and by the end of the year the Malian conflict was seen as resolved. This was also a success for Algeria as a regional power, and rival of the Libyan government for influence in the Sahara.Le gouvernement et les rebelles d'accord pour cesser les hostilit√©s. 21 juillet 2008 - AFP Throughout the process, the Malian government, as well as Tuareg leaders on both sides of the conflict public ally pushed for a negotiated settlement, in contrast with the Nigerien conflict.

While the last of the rebel held prisoners were released in August, and the ceasefire held as of the end of that month,Otages enlev√©s au nord-est de Kidal : Tous libres ! L'Essor, 19/08/2008 there continued to be speculation on the role played by presumed Mai 23 leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga, who has not participated in the Algerian sponsored tripartite talks. Press speculation has posed a split in the already fractured movement, in which Touareg groups loyal to the Kel Adagh fully participated in the eventual peace process, which seemed to have resolved the conflict since August 2008. Meanwhile, a smaller group around Ag Bahanga had been holding out for Libyan sponsored mediation, and eventually abandoned the talks and sought refuge in Libya. =Mali December 2008: Ag Bahanga's return= Sometime before the beginning of December 2008, Ibrahim Ag Bahanga returned from his self-imposed exile in Libya: he and the Alliance Touaregue Nord Mali Pour Le Changement (ATNMC) faction took credit in communiques for a series of attacks in northern Mali beginning on 18 December. They attacked a desert garrison post at Nampala 500 km north of Bamako near the Mauritanian border. Between 11 and 20 Malian Armed Forces soldiers were killed and an unknown number of rebels. This made it the bloodiest fighting since June 2007. The attack was prefaced by the killing of an aide to a pro-government Tuareg leader in Gao on the 18th, in a grenade attack on the politician's home.Mali: br√®ve \\"offensive\\" de l'arm√©e contre des rebelles touareg dans le nord.

There was no government confirmation of these attacks.Communiqu√© de l'ATNMC Alliance Touareg Nord Mali pour le Changement. 27 December 2008.Communiqu√© de l‚ÄôATNMC Alliance Touareg Nord Mali pour le Changement 28 December 2008. Regardless, the attack on Nampala pushed the fighting far to the south. The President of Mali, Amadou Toumani Toure vowed harsh action in a speech at Kayes: \\"Enough is enough. We cannot continue to suffer, we cannot keep counting our dead... We cannot keep searching for peace... They are firing on anything that moves. They are firing on soldiers, they're firing on civilians, what does all this mean?\\" He claimed that while Nampala had no strategic importance, it was \\"close to the different routes and paths that take drugs across the Sahara-Sahel strip\\". This was a reiteration of the government contention that elements of the rebels were motivated not by political motives, but were involved in the lucrative Saharan smuggling trade, and that the rebel's desire to have the town of Tin-Zaouatene evacuated of troops was cover for their smuggling operations. =The ADC and the ATNMC= The Malian army quickly responded with an attack on a rebel camp just west of Aguelhoc (In the Adrar des Ifoghas, Kidal Region) in which it said it killed 20 fighters and took 8 prisoners.Mali: un responsable humanitaire veut rencontrer les prisonniers touareg.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Turkey in 1948, political and bilateral relations have been usually characterised by warmth and cordiality, although some sporadic tensions remain due to Turkey's support for Pakistan, India's rival. India has an embassy in Ankara and a consulate‚Äìgeneral in Istanbul. Turkey has an embassy in New Delhi and a consulate-general in Mumbai. As of 2015, the bilateral trade between India and Turkey stood at US$6.26 billion. History Economic and cultural relations between ancient India and Anatolia date back to the Vedic age (before 1000 BCE). During World War I, the British Indian Empire played a pivotal role in the successful Allied campaign against the Ottoman Empire. There are deep historical connections between India and Turkey. The first exchange of diplomatic missions between the Ottoman Sultans and the Muslim rulers of the sub-continent dates back to the years 1481‚Äì82. A strong historical connection between Indian Muslims and Turkey exists dating back to the medieval era and fostered with the late 19th and 20th century interaction between the two. India and Turkey also have a cultural overlap. The Turkic impact on India in areas such as language, culture and civilisation, art and architecture, and costumes and cuisine was considerable. There are also over 9,000 words common in Hindi and Turkish languages. More recent historical contacts between India and Turkey were reflected in the medical mission led by renowned Indian freedom fighter, Dr M A Ansari, to Turkey in 1912 during the Balkan Wars. India also extended support in the 1920s to Turkey's War of Independence and the formation of the Turkish republic. Mahatma Gandhi himself took a stand against the injustices inflicted on Turkey at the end of World War I. Turkey recognised India right after its declaration of independence on 15 August 1947 and diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. As Turkey was part of the Western Alliance and India of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War era, the bilateral relations did not develop at a desired pace. However, since the end of the Cold War era, both sides put in effort in developing their bilateral relations in every field. In contemporary times, relations between India and Turkey have been strained due to Turkey's religious mutuality with Pakistan. Until recently, Turkey was a vocal advocate of Pakistan's position on the Kashmir dispute. Turkey was also one of the few opponents to India's inclusion into the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\\"India and Turkey: Friends Again?\\", The Diplomat, 19 July 2013 However, in recent years, the relations between the two countries have warmed due to common strategic goals, and there is a growing bilateral cooperation in the fields of education, technology and commerce. Turkey has softened its pro-Pakistani approach on the Kashmir issue thinking that it is important to build up a coherent and comprehensive relationship with India and develop a holistic Asian policy. Turkey has since reversed its support to Pakistan's position on Kashmir, moving from a call for a plebiscite under UN supervision to stressing the importance of India-Pakistan bilateral talks to resolve the issue, which is by and large closer to India's position, India's GMR Group is one of the main stakeholders in the new Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport in ƒ∞stanbul. Both the countries are members of the G20 group of major economies, where the two countries have closely cooperated on the management of the world economy. Bilateral trade in July 2012 stood at US$7.5 billion, a figure that is expected to double to US$15 billion by 2015. Strategically too, there are growing areas of consensus. On Afghanistan, Turkey had taken the lead in 2011 to begin the Istanbul Process to find meaningful and sustainable solutions to Afghanistan's problems. The Istanbul Process culminated in the annual \\"Heart of Asia\\" regional conference on Afghanistan held in Kazakhstan's former capital, Almaty, with both India and Turkey playing important roles. In the context of the planned 2014 withdrawal of NATO and US troops from Afghanistan, the need for Delhi and Ankara to intensify dialogue over Afghanistan has acquired a particular importance. India condemned Turkey for its military offensive into north-eastern Syria, claiming it would undermine regional stability and the fight against terrorism. India also called upon Turkey to exercise restraint and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. Bilateral trade relations Entrance plate at Embassy of India in Ankara The bilateral trade relations started its new phase and both sides emphasised the importance of developing bilateral cooperation programmes with the aim to enhance their commercial relations on a mutually beneficial and sustainable basis. However, as the world's second-most populous country, India's progress in gaining importance in the global economy and international politics since the 1990s has led to Turkey's quest to develop a new strategy for South Asia. Turkey has also begun to prioritise India in South Asian politics while preserving its traditionally good relations with Pakistan and Bangladesh. In recent years, the relations between the two countries have warmed due to common strategic goals, and there is a growing bilateral cooperation in the fields of education, technology and commerce. On 18 March 2012, Burak Ak√ßapar, Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey in India, announced that Turkey sought to double flights from India and open four more connecting points. Other destinations considered are Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. At present, Turkish Airlines operates daily flights from Mumbai and New Delhi to Istanbul. A joint study on a free trade area was conducted, but is yet to be signed. He also announced that consulates in Chennai and Hyderabad, in South India, are planned to be started, as permission had been gained from the Indian government. =Investments= More than 150 companies with Indian capital have registered businesses in Turkey in the form of joint- ventures, trade and representative offices. These include M/s Polyplex, GMR Infrastructure, TATA Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Reliance, Ispat, Aditya Birla Group, Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd, Jain Irrigation, Wipro and Dabur. Turkey ranks 41st overall in terms of FDI inflows to India. Cumulative Turkish direct investment into India amounts to US$87.18 million (April 2000 ‚Äì Apri2014). In September 2019, Turkey had criticized India on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and the revocation of article 370. It made vocal comments against India at the United Nations. Thereby it favoured the position of Pakistan in this respect. Due to this the relationship between India and Turkey has caused a temporary strain. Cooperation in Space Technology Turkey's first nano satellite \\"ITUpSAT1\\", manufactured at the Istanbul Technical University's Faculty of Aeronautics was sent to space on a PSLV C-14 rocket by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on 23 September 2009. The satellite orbited the earth at an altitude of 720 kilometres and had the capacity to take continental photos. Its orbital life was six months. Turkey is keen to expand cooperation in space technology with India.

Although recognized as the reincarnation of the Bogd Khan in 1936, his identity was kept a secret by the Dalai Lama until 1990 due to the persecution of the Buddhist religion by the Mongolian People's Republic, and did not reside in Mongolia until the final year of his life.  Biography  He was born as Jampal Namdol Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen on the tenth day of the eleventh month of Water Monkey year (6 January 1933) near the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, Tibet. Six months after his birth, his parents separated and his mother left him in the care of his uncle who was a bodyguard of the thirteenth Dalai Lama. The thirteenth Dalai Lama died in December 1933, and Reting Rinpoche became Regent of Tibet until a new Dalai Lama was discovered and crowned. Because of the inability of the Mongolian lamas to proclaim the discovery of the ninth Khutughtu, Reting Rinpoche in 1936, recognised Jampal Namdol Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen, then age four, as the reincarnation of the eighth Jetsun Dhamba Khutughtu, after the boy passed three sets of tests. Due to the complex political situation, his existence was kept a secret. At the age of seven, he entered the Drepung Monastery, but because his identity was kept secret, he could not enter the Khalkha Mitsen, but had to follow the life of a common monk. At age 25, he renounced his monastic vows and became a householder, took a wife and had two children. When the Dalai Lama escaped from Tibet in 1959, Jampal Namdol did also, fearing that his identity would be revealed and he would be killed or used by the Communists for propaganda.Mongolyn IX Bogd Jevzundamba Khutagt Jambalnamdolchoijijantsan.

She was the writer of the political essay Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga, and the editor of the Stockholm Gazette. Chronologically, she may be counted as the first female journalist in Sweden. Early years Margareta Momma was born in the Netherlands, possibly as a descendant of French Huguenots. In 1735, she married the Swedish publisher Peter Momma (d. 1772), himself of a Swedish family of Dutch origin, and settled in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. She was the mother of Petter (1738-1758), Wilhelm (1740-1772) and Elsa (1744‚Äì1826). Peter Momma was the publisher and editor of popular papers such as the Stockholm Gazette (1742) and the Stockholms Weckoblad (1745), and she played an active part in his business. Career Momma was identified as the author behind the Swedish language essay paper Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga (English: 'Conversation between the Shadow of Argus and the unfamiliar Shadow of a Female'), or popularly Samtal (Conversation), which has become her most known work. As a female journalist, she was rare in Europe and possibly the first identifiable one in Sweden. The essay aroused great attention in contemporary Sweden, but the author was anonymous and unknown during her own lifetime. The essay was published in ten issues in connection with the Riksdag of 1738-1739. Essay papers was a new form of media in contemporary Europe, and hers was among the first to introduce this media form in Sweden. The paper was contemporary to similar publications in Sweden such as Skuggan Af den d√∂da Argus (The Death Shadow of Argus), Samtal, I The D√∂das Rijke, Emellan Den Sedo-L√§rande Mercurius (Conversation, In the Kingdom of the Dead, With the Instructive Mercurius) and Den Sw√§nska Argus, and was likely inspired by them. Samtal discussed foreign policy, social policy, morality, and independence and subjects of the age of enlightenment. The essay numbers were written in the form of a fictive argumentative conversation - hence the name of the paper - between two fictions figures, the male Argi skugga (Shadow of Argi) and the female Fruentimbers skugga (Shadow of a Female), of various topics. Other characters sometimes participate in the conversation, such as Muselmanen (The Moslem) and Philosophen (The Philosopher). Criticism against the Catholic church within the subject of enlightenment, until then uncommon in Sweden but common in the Netherlands, was often presented. In the conversations, the essay promoted freedom of speech, freedom of religion, advocated to translate knowledge to the Swedish language to make it available to more people rather than to restrict most such literature to foreign languages in the universities, and stated that women should also been given higher education and participate in public debate. In it, she satirizes the letters from some readers who criticize the thought of a woman discussing philosophy. Affected strongly by the continental ideas of enlightenment, it was regarded as radical and progressive and came in conflict with the contemporary censorship laws. It was not banned by the censorship, but discontinued for unknown causes after ten issues in 1739, despite having planned further issues. During the 18th-century Age of Liberty and the Gustavian Age, there were several publications in Sweden written by and for women which, except for the more common topics of the Age of Enlightenment, discussed and questioned the rights and status of women in society, often written in the form of essays, letters and fictions conversations, of which the publication of Margareta Momma was arguably the first. Most of the female journalists and writers in 18th-century Sweden wrote under pseudonym (normally a French name), and therefore, they have seldom been identified: also in this aspect, Momma is one of the first identified female journalists in Sweden. Momma is also identified as the editor behind the French language edition of the Stockholm Gazette, which she published between 1742 and 1752. In 1772, she died along with her spouse and her remaining son, and the family business was inherited by her daughter Elsa Fought. Legacy The award \\"Mommapriset - √Örets Utgivare\\" ('Momma Award - The Publisher of the Year') is named after Margareta Momma.

He is 12 or 13 years old during the former and a year older (\\"thirteen or fourteen or along there\\", Chapter 17) at the time of the latter. Huck also narrates Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, two shorter sequels to the first two books. Characterization Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn is the son of the town's vagrant drunkard, \\"Pap\\" Finn. Sleeping on doorsteps when the weather is fair, in empty hogsheads during storms, and living off of what he receives from others, Huck lives the life of a destitute vagabond. The author metaphorically names him \\"the juvenile pariah of the village\\" and describes Huck as \\"idle, and lawless, and vulgar, and bad\\", qualities for which he was admired by all the other children in the village, although their mothers \\"cordially hated and dreaded\\" him. Huck is an archetypal innocent, able to discover the \\"right\\" thing to do despite the prevailing theology and prejudiced mentality of the South of that era. The best example of this is his decision to help Jim escape slavery, even though he believes he will go to Hell for it (see Christian views on slavery). His appearance is described in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He wears the clothes of full-grown men which he probably received as charity, and as Twain describes him, \\"he was fluttering with rags.\\" He has a torn, broken hat and his trousers are supported with only one suspender. Even Tom Sawyer, the St. Petersburg hamlet boys' leader sees him as \\"the banished Romantic\\". Tom's Aunt Polly calls Huck a \\"poor motherless thing.\\" Huck confesses to Tom in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that he remembers his mother and his parents' relentless fighting that stopped only when she died. Huck has a carefree life free from societal norms or rules, stealing watermelons and chickens and \\"borrowing\\" (stealing) boats and cigars. Due to his unconventional childhood, Huck has received almost no education. At the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Huck is adopted by the Widow Douglas, who sends him to school in return for his saving her life. In the course of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn he learns enough to be literate and even reads books for entertainment. His knowledge of history as related to Jim is wildly inaccurate, but it is not specified if he is being wrong on purpose as a joke on Jim. In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the Widow attempts to \\"sivilize\\" [sic] the newly wealthy Huck. Huck's father takes him from her, but Huck manages to fake his own death and escape to Jackson's Island, where he coincidentally meets up with Jim, a slave who was owned by the Widow Douglas' sister, Miss Watson. Jim is running away because he overheard Miss Watson planning to \\"sell him South\\" for eight hundred dollars. Jim wants to escape to Cairo, Illinois, where he can find work to eventually buy his family's freedom. Huck and Jim take a raft down the Mississippi River, planning to head north on the Ohio River, in hopes of finding freedom from slavery for Jim and freedom from Pap for Huck. Their adventures together, along with Huck's solo adventures, comprise the core of the book. In the end, however, Jim gains his freedom through Miss Watson's death, as she freed him in her will. Pap, it is revealed, has died in Huck's absence, and although he could safely return to St. Petersburg, Huck plans to flee west to Indian Territory. In Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, the sequels to Huck Finn, however, Huck is living in St. Petersburg again after the events of his eponymous novel. In Abroad, Huck joins Tom and Jim for a wild, fanciful balloon ride that takes them overseas. In Detective, which occurs about a year after the events of Huck Finn, Huck helps Tom solve a murder mystery. Relationships Huck is Tom Sawyer's closest friend. Their friendship is partially rooted in Sawyer's emulation of Huck's freedom and ability to do what he wants, like swearing and smoking when he feels like it. In one moment in the novel, he openly brags to his teacher that he was late for school because he stopped to talk with Huck Finn and enjoyed it, something for which he knew he would (and did) receive a whipping. Nonetheless, Tom remains a devoted friend to Huck in all of the novels they appear in. In Huckleberry Finn, it's revealed that Huck also considers Tom to be his best friend. At various times in the novel, Huck mentions that Tom would put more \\"style\\" in Jim and his adventure. Jim, a runaway slave whom Huck befriends, is another dominant force in Huck's life. He is the symbol for the moral awakening Huck undergoes throughout Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This is seen when Huck considers sending a letter to Ms. Watson telling her where Jim is but ultimately chooses to rip it up despite the idea in the south that one who tries helping a slave escape will be sent to eternal punishment. Pap Finn is Huck's abusive, drunken father who shows up at the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and forcibly takes his son to live with him. Pap's only method of parenting is physical abuse. Although he seems derisive of education and civilized living, Pap seems to be jealous of Huck and is infuriated that his son would try to amount to more, and live in better conditions than he did. Despite this, early in the novel Huck uses his father's method of \\"borrowing\\" though he later feels sorry and stops. Inspiration The character of Huck Finn is based on Tom Blankenship, the real-life son of a sawmill laborer and sometime drunkard named Woodson Blankenship, who lived in a \\"ramshackle\\" house near the Mississippi River behind the house where the author grew up in Hannibal, Missouri.(Washington, D.C.) Express, June 6, 2007 Twain mentions his childhood friend Tom Blankenship as the inspiration for creating Huckleberry Finn in his autobiography: \\"In Huckleberry Finn I have drawn Tom Blankenship exactly as he was. He was ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed; but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had. His liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the only really independent person‚Äîboy or man‚Äîin the community, and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and envied by the rest of us. And as his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his society than any other boy's.\\" ‚Äì Mark Twain's Autobiography.

It is dedicated to the Lebanese writer, philosopher, and artist Kahlil Gibran. The museum was an old cavern where many hermits sought refuge since the 7th century. By the end of the 17th century, the people of Bsharri offered the hermitage the existing building erected during the 16th century and the surrounding oak forest to the Carmelite Fathers who were then living in the Qadisha valley with the Monks of Saint Elisha Monastery. The Carmelite Fathers built the monastery progressively till 1862. In 1908, while some of the monks moved towards Bsharri to build the Saint Joseph Monastery, the others remained in the valley to take care of the whole property. In 1926, while still in New York, Gibran expressed the desire of purchasing from the Carmelite Fathers the hermitage, the monastery, and the adjoining forest in order to make it his retreat and final resting place. He died on April 10, 1931. On August 22, 1931, Gibran's body reached Bsharri. Mariana, his sister, bought the monastery and the adjoining lands and thus fulfilled a part of her brother's will: to make of the hermitage his burial place. Founded in 1935, the Gibran Museum possesses 440 original paintings and drawings of Gibran and his tomb. It also includes his furniture and belongings from his studio when he lived in New York City and his private manuscripts. In 1975, the Gibran National Committee restored and expanded the monastery to house more exhibits and again expanded it in 1995. On August 15, 1995, the Museum reopened its doors to the public. The Furniture, Gibran's notebooks, his personal library, and the exhibited objects and paintings were all in his apartment in New York. All the masterpieces are exhibited in the 16 rooms of the three floors of the Museum leading in the end to Gibran's tomb. Rare are the paintings that Gibran dated, signed, not titled. he used to say \\"Visions cannot be titled.\\" And to those who wondered why he didn't sign his paintings, he replied: \\"Wherever they might be found, my paintings shall be known as mine.\\" Gibran did not use or abide by a specific school or trend.

He worked in the same capacity for Patti Austin and Lena Horne, who were co-performers on Belafonte's tours. Jenkins then joined Antisia Publishing (co-owned by Ralph MacDonald and William Salter), and forged a lifelong friendship and musical partnership with MacDonald, which led to more hit recordings like \\"The Hustle\\" with Van McCoy, \\"Where Is the Love\\" with Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway and \\"Just The Two of Us\\" with Grover Washington Jr. and Bill Withers. Jenkins was brought to the attention of John Lennon by May Pang, production coordinator for many albums by Lennon and Yoko Ono.Robert Rosen, Nowhere Man: the Final Days of John Lennon (2000). . p. 147 Pang booked Jenkins for Ono's Feeling The Space album, and Lennon, who was about to record his Mind Games album, asked Pang to retain him for that session. Jenkins played on all subsequent Lennon albums, including Walls and Bridges (for which he was awarded an RIAA gold record), Double Fantasy and the posthumous Milk and Honey. Lennon would jokingly credit Jenkins for \\"all the bells and whistles\\" on his records. Jenkins also worked on Broadway theatre and lent his distinctive sounds to popular commercials for McDonald's, Chemical Bank and other products. He also released two CDs of his own material, Alone With Arthur and Alone With Arthur Again. Jenkins died unexpectedly at his Manhattan apartment, aged 73. Discography Jenkins began his recording career in 1965 with the Latin Soul album by The Latin Jazz Quintet, and has over a hundred credits to his name.

As the author states in the opening chapter, it is partly a collection of case-histories of his writing career over twenty years as a professional writer (with the book being dedicated to his parents, Peter and Monica Raban). Plot summary I - II Raban describes his development as a writer from his early youthful love for books to a university career lecturing on Literature to his final decision to become a full-time writer in London, starting out as a professional book reviewer for the London Magazine and the New Statesman. The first part is mainly composed of book reviews he wrote for various literary journals and his subjects include: living in London, the Romantic poet Byron, Thackeray, Henry Mayhew, a well-researched piece on Anthony Trollope (although it is a pity there is so little of the writer's thoughts on his great masterpiece The Way We Live Now), who still remains a highly under-rated Victorian novelist, and three penetrative pieces on Evelyn Waugh, of whom Raban is a great admirer. As he says of Waugh's diaries, there is no clear division from the youthful into the adult Waugh and this element of youthfulness always maintained a strong influence on his writing: > 'This disconcerting, sometimes vengeful, sometimes pathetic, childishness > gives all Waugh's writing an odd innocence, a kind of brazen > incorruptibility. His cult of the noble (which was much more a dream of > living in a Burne-Jonesish world of sunlit castles and pure chivalry than it > was of toadying after titles), his fiercely traditionalist Catholicism, his > horror of the urban proletariat, were too wide-eyed to be either dangerous > or mean. His sensibility had the extravagance of a brilliant child's: adult > moderation never got in the say of clarity. When he admired he worshipped; > when he disapproved, he was appalled. The bourgeois virtues of common sense > and good manners (the besetting vices of so many modern English novelists) > were totally foreign to him - not because he was a snob but because he never > forgot what it was like to be a child.' He also includes a review of Anthony Powell, rightly criticizing the first part of his memoirs, Infants of the Spring, as being, > \\"... a book so boring, reticent and formulaic that it would hardly be a > creditable effort had it come from the hand of an idle brigadier jotting > down his Notess of an Old Soldier or Tales of an Officer's Mess. Mr Powell > begins by tracing his family tree back to Old King Cole and Rhys the Hoarse, > constructs a complete stud book of Powells and Wells-Dymokes, then embarks, > in a style of stultified discretion, on a rambling, much interrupted account > of his own life.\\" There is a very affectionate piece about Robert Lowell, the American poet who Raban knew for the last seven years of his life. As he says of Lowell's life, > \\"It's a life lived in full conscience by a man of preternatural quickness > and sensitivity and candour. We can all count ourselves lucky that Lowell > happened to be around in our messy stretch of history; more than any other > writer he got down on paper what it feels like to be normally alive in our > particular snakepit.\\" Unfortunately for Lowell he was plagued by bouts of temporary insanity that meant periods of forced incarceration in a mental hospital once a year during an attack of mania. Throughout his life Raban comments that he remained, in the deepest sense, an unknowable man and his poetry was written in order that he could at least attempt to come to terms with himself and his own character. III Just like the young aspiring writer in Cyril Connolly's Enemies of Promise, named Shelleyblake (a pun on the two Romantic poets) by Jonathan Raban, he too wanted to write plays. He states he first found a birth at Kestrel Films, a company set up by Tony Garnett, Ken Loach and Kenith Trodd. Raban wrote a play for Trodd after he moved over to Granada Television but it turned out to be a total failure dramatically. He went on to write seven plays for radio. of which six were produced by Richard Wortley but, as he states, there was a limited audience for plays of this kind - mostly the blind and \\"a small coterie of radio listeners who are prepared, in effect, to blind themselves for the duration of the programme. But they are few and far between.\\" He also wrote five more plays for television of which three were broadcast, but again they did not meet with much critical success. His last dramatic effort was a commissioned full-length stage play directed by Eric Thompson at the Bristol Old Vic, but the play closed after a month. In order to get playwriting out of his system, Raban took off to travel in Arabia to research his travelogue, Arabia Through the Looking Glass. IV This part deals with Raban's experiences with writing for 'the little magazines', mainly feature journalism. He was a book reviewer for the Review, edited by Ian Hamilton, and then later for the New Review, which was larger and glossier but which foundered just like its predecessor. He also did some work for the Radio Times, edited by Geoffrey Cannon, who was able to pay his reviewers considerably more than Hamilton out of the BBC coffers, and was also extremely liberal in terms of fitting in with his reviewers' requirements, particularly if they were working on a book. It was the Radio Times that sent Raban on a sailing ship for three days (it was being used as a prop in The Onedin Line), which was to spark off two books and an obsession with sailing. There are also some short articles. 'Christmas in Bournemouth' is a highly objective account of a group of OAPs spending their Christmas together at the Cliff Court Hotel, unwanted by their children: > 'There were 59 of us. There was one real family party from Egham, complete > with a trio of rather subdued children. But nearly everybody had come in a > couple. There were childless couples in their 40s, and grandparents in their > 50s and 60s whose grown-up children had somehow, inexplicably, failed to > invite them for Christmas.' With his partner, Linda (who appears briefly in Coasting when she collects Raban from the London Docks), they take part in all the arranged festivities. The people are the first generation after the war who had extra money to spend, shown by the expensive electronic gadgetry they all possess. However, the downside is that they have lost the family closeness that existed in the pre-war years, and their children and grandchildren prefer to be unencumbered with any elderly relatives who may embarrass their guests over Christmas. The whole experience at the hotel is a bitter-sweet one and Raban's last memory is of Frances, a lonely spinster hospital worker, waiting forlornly for her bus to 'take her back to her Christchurch maisonette and her job on the geriatric ward.' Living on Capital describes Raban's early childhood, much of which is re-presented in his travelogue, Coasting. Living with Loose Ends is a rather rambling account of family life, but 'Freya Stark on the Euphrates' and 'Fishing' - describing the writer's long love affair with the rod and reel - are two well-crafted articles that have a strong merit in their own right. V The last part - and the one in which Raban really comes into his own - deals with travelling and the writing of the travel book and goes a long way to explaining Jonathan Raban's own wanderlust. As he says about travelling and writing, 'Simple wanderlust is relatively easy to fend off, but when it starts to get tangled up with literary motive it becomes irresistible; and literature and travel are anciently, inevitably tangled. Journeys suggest stories, stories take the form of journeys - odysseys, exoduses, pilgrims' and rakes' progresses. Any travelling writer, leaving home, must find it difficult to rid himself of the idea that he's embarking on some kind of real-life picaresque. Before him lie the education and adventures of a rolling stone. Pilgrim, Gulliver, Tom Jones, Mr Yorick have been here before.' The author also gives some insights into his own method of writing about his travelling in such books as Hunting Mr Heartbreak, Old Glory - his journey in a skiff down the Mississippi - and Passage to Juneau, in which he sails from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska: 'Memory, not the notebook, holds the key. I try to keep a notebook when I'm on the move (largely because writing it makes one feel that one's at work, despite all appearances to the contrary) but hardly ever find anything in the notebook that's worth using later...Memory, though, is always telling stories to itself, filing experience in narrative form. It feeds irrelevancies to the shredder, enlarges on crucial details, makes links and patterns, finds symbols, constructs plots. In memory, the journey takes shape and grows; in the notebook it merely languishes, with the notes themselves like a pile of cigarette butts confronted the morning after a party.' And again, in 'Stevenson: Sailing towards marriage' Raban gives us a description Robert Louis Stevenson's much-admired writing style in The Amateur Emigrant, about the latter taking passage for America and his fiancee in northern California, that could be a mirror image of his own: > 'For Stevenson's temperament was instinctively skeptical and empirical. He > hoarded detail for its own sake. He was immensely careful and sympathetic > observer of other people's lives. When he came to deal with the physical > conditions of the ship and the train, and with the characters of the > emigrants, he was a scrupulous miniaturist. Every page of The Amateur > Emigrant is dotted with the trifles of life - with smells, fragments of > dialect speech, clothes, facial expressions. It has the dense and varied > texture of a true record.' 'Belloc at Sea' - about Belloc's The Cruise of the Nona - is in part recreated in Coasting, and 'Young's Slow Boats' is interesting from the perspective of one travel writer writing about another. Raban gives his own thoughts on what has drawn so many writers, including himself, to the travel book: 'It is the supreme improvisatory form; one can play it by ear; it will happily accommodate all sorts of conditions of writing. At its occasional best it works like a constellation, with autobiography, essays, stories, reportage mingling together in a single controlled blaze. More often it has the casual freedom of the scrapbook, into which any old thing can be pasted at will; a lifelike form, certainly, with all of life's contingencies, dead ends, and artlessness.' 'Florida' is a remarkable article based on Raban's visit to Florida, attracted by the thrillers of John D. MacDonald, 'With their bodice- ripper covers and titles like Nightmare in Pink, A Deadly Shade of Gold and A Purple Place for Dying. For Raban, MacDonald (whom he meets three years before his death) created an extremely vivid portrait of a 'jungly Eden, spoilt and besmirched by human vanity and greed ... a lovely paradise that was being cut down to make room for shopping malls, condominium blocks, six-lane highways, giant billboards and pagoda-style Kingburger palaces. Taken together, the novels added up to a resounding \\"No! Thunder!\\" They protested against this violation of the innocence of America with shocked and angry vigour.' Raban goes onto re-create this visit near the end of his later book, Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America (1991), which describes his meandering journey across the U.S.A. and its eventual conclusion in Seattle, where he now permanently resides. The final article, 'Sea Room', makes a seamless transition from this book to his next one, Coasting (book), recording his circumnavigation of the British Isles. Raban describes his desire to purchase his own boat and take to the sea. He purchases a sextant from a junkshop, made for J.H.C. Minter R.N. and practices the determination of latitude and longitude from his home in St Quintin Avenue, London W.10. He then starts his search for a boat and ends up with the Gosfield Maid, stranded on a mudbank up a Cornish estuary, which is to be his home for the next few years.

Since the French immersion program left Balmoral Junior Secondary in 2003, that institution saw declining enrollment, to the point where the school closed in 2009. The property has since been repurposed to hold the grade 8 and 9 classes of Carson Graham Secondary while that school undergoes a facilities upgrade. The Balmoral building, redesignated as the Carson Graham Secondary Balmoral Campus, was phased out in 2012 following the completion of the work at Carson Graham. In 2013 it became Mountainside Secondary School, an alternative school for students between grades 9 and 12. History Balmoral Junior Secondary School opened in about 1959 to serve Grades 7, 8 and 9 students in the northwest area of the District of North Vancouver. It was intended as a feeder to Delbrook Senior Secondary a few blocks away. In 1969 Balmoral split the grade 10 class with Delbrook. In January 1977 the Delbrook building was destroyed by fire, necessitating Balmoral accommodating both schools' students and staff until the end of June.British Columbia Archival Union List - Delbrook Following this, Balmoral became a feeder school to Carson Graham Secondary School. In 2009, Balmoral ceased to exist as a separate school and became the second campus to Carson Graham Secondary School.

Under Coach Bob Payne in the 1960s the bantam and juvenile teams often went undefeated in a season, and were unscored upon in a few. The grade 8 and grade 9 rugby were perennial Vancouver and District champions. In 1969 the school fielded a grade 10 boys' team for the first time. The school has produced numerous Canada U-19 and U-21 players and, at last count, three full international senior players; Tony Scott (1973), Ron Johnstone (2001‚Äìpresent), and Kelly McCallum (2003). In 1997 they became only the third junior high school in the 33-year history of the B.C.

The school parent advisory committee started a campaign to find more funding and keep the school open. The PAC's presentations presented a strategy to keep the school open, called the International Baccalaureate Program, which was approved in 2007. In 2009, the school district twinned an immediate rebuild of Carson Graham School with the closure of Balmoral in 2012. At issue was either the construction of a seismically sound, single facility at the Carson Graham site for 1,100 students, or the maintenance of two sites, both with aging facilities and one with under 300 students.

This teaching says that \\"following a person's death the soul leaves the body, and is escorted to God by angels. During this journey the soul passes through an aerial realm, which is inhabited by wicked spirits (Ephesians 6:12). The soul encounters these demons at various points referred to as toll-houses where the demons then attempt to accuse it of sin and, if possible, drag the soul into hell.\\" In some forms, the teaching is taught in hagiographical and other spiritual texts from quite early in the history of the Church, but it has never been formally promulgated by any ecumenical council. A number of the Orthodox saints, modern elders and theologians have openly endorsed it, but some theologians and bishops, starting from the last century, have condemned it as heretical and gnostic in origin. The content is somewhat similar to that propounded by John Climacus in The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Some say that given the amount of fear that comes along with the teaching, the love of Christ becomes misunderstood and is forgotten, but others suggest that fear is perfectly natural and salvific for Orthodox Christians. Aerial toll houses are part of the particular judgment. Teaching Demons showing a soul its sins at the third aerial toll house. Fresco of the Rila Monastery. The most detailed account of the aerial toll-houses is found in the , found in the Lives of Saints for 26 March (according to some E. Orthodox calendars, but not all), though some believe this Basil to be mistakenly attributed for this date, and believe the account to be heretical and spurious. In this rendering, Theodora, spiritual student of Basil, appeared to another student, the pious and holy layman Gregory. According to the story, Gregory had prayed to God and asked him to inform them of what happened to Theodora after her death. God answered his prayers (according to this account) by sending Theodora herself to Gregory; and told him, in great detail, about her journey through the toll houses. According to Theodora's teaching, every Christian has a demon who tempts him or her. These demons keep a record of every sin of thought or action they succeed in tempting a person to commit, though repented sins are erased from the demonic records. On the third day after the soul separates from the body, according to this account, it is carried by angels towards Heaven. On the way, souls must go past twenty aerial toll-houses. Each toll house is populated by demons devoted to particular sins. At each toll-house, demons demand that souls \\"pay\\" for their sins by giving an account of compensatory good deeds. If the soul is unable to compensate for a sin, the demons take it to hell. = Toll houses = The 20 toll houses, fresco of the Rila Monastery There are twenty toll-houses, though the number is not dogmatic, and different sources list varying numbers. On the first aerial toll-house, the soul is questioned about the sins of the tongue. The remainings are, in order, the toll-houses of: * Lies * Slander * Gluttony * Laziness * Theft * Covetousness * Usury * Injustice * Envy * Pride * Anger * Remembering evil * Murder * Magic * Lust * Adultery * Sodomy * Heresy * Unmercifulness Origin Mentions of toll houses can be found in the hymnology of the Church, and in stories of the lives of some saints and their writings. Prayers mentioning the aerial accusers can be found in Liturgical texts and official E. Orthodox books like the Slavonic Great Euchologion (The Great Book of Needs): \\"do thou banish from me the commander of the bitter toll-gatherers and ruler of the earth [...] O holy Theotokos\\" (Ode 8, Troparion 3).The Great Book of Needs, St Tikhon's Monastery Press Other church hymns say that the souls have to \\"pass through the rulers of darkness standing in the air\\"January 27, The Recovery of the Holy Relics of our Father among the Saints John Chrysostom, Troparion 1, Ode 5 of Orthros: \\"Grant me to pass untroubled through the host of noetic satraps and the tyrannic battalion of the lower air in the hour of my departure...\\"Parakletike, Friday Vespers, Second Mode: \\"When my soul is about to be separated violently from the members of the body, then, O Bride of God, come to my aid; scatter the counsels of the fleshless enemies and shatter their millstones, by which they seek to devour me mercilessly; that, unhindered, I may pass through the rulers of darkness standing in the air.\\" In the Greek and Slavonic Euchologion, in the canon for the departure of the soul by St. Andrew, the following words are found in Ode 7: \\"All holy angels of the Almighty God, have mercy upon me and save me from all the evil toll-houses\\". In the Canon of Supplication at the Parting of the Soul in The Great Book of Needs are found the following references to the struggle of a soul passing through the toll houses: \\"Count me worthy to pass, unhindered, by the persecutor, the prince of the air, the tyrant, him that stands guard in the dread pathways, and the false accusation of these, as I depart from earth\\" (Ode 4, p. 77). \\"Do thou count me worthy to escape the hordes of bodiless barbarians, and rise through the aerial depths and enter into Heaven\\" (Ode 8, p. 81). The toll house doctrine can be found for example in the Life of Saint Anthony the Great written by Athanasius of Alexandria, in the life of Basil the New and Theodora, in the homilies of Cyril of Alexandria,Cyril of Alexandria Ephesi praedicata depoito Nestorio, ACO.14(52.405D) as referenced by Lampe, G. W. H., A Patristic Greek Lexicon, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1961, p.1387 or in a discourse of Abba Isaiah. Some authors of the Philokalia, \\"an authoritative anthology of writings on the prayer of the heart\\", taught about the toll houses. For example, instructs to \\"reflect on the dreadful reckoning that is to come, how the harsh keepers of the toll homes will bring before as one by one the actions, words and thoughts which they suggested but which we accepted and made our own\\". The same way, wrote: \\"When the soul leaves the body, the enemy advances to attack it, fiercely reviling it and accusing it of its sins in a harsh and terrifying manner. But if a soul enjoys the love of God and has faith in Him, even though in the past it has often been wounded by sin, it is not frightened by the enemy's attacks and threats.\\" \\"The tradition of the tollgates was firmly established throughout the east long before the end of late antiquity, although it received typically Byzantine elaboration in the tenth-century Life of Basil the Younger (d. 944).\\"  Contemporary situation  19th-century saints Ignatius Brianchaninov and Theophan the Recluse insisted not only on the truthfulness of but also on the necessity of this teaching in the spiritual life of a Christian. A number of contemporary church figures support the teaching on toll-houses, including Ephraim (Moraitis),Vid. Ephraim, Elder, Counsels from the Holy Mountain, St. Anthony's Greek Orthodox Monastery, Arizona, 1999, pp. 436, 447. ,Cavarnos, Constantine, The Future Life According to Orthodox Teaching, Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, Etna, California, 1985, pp. 24-26. Abp Seraphim (Rose), Met. Hierotheos (Vlachos), John of Shanghai and San Francisco, Justin Popoviƒá in his Dogmatics of the Orthodox Church, and Michael Pomazansky. However, Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart considers this teaching as an heresy, and Eastern Orthodox theologian Adnan Trabulsi opposes the toll houses teaching. Eastern Orthodox theologian Dr Paul Ladouceur considers the Life of Saint Basil to be a forgery; furthermore, he writes that the toll-house teaching \\"is not the sole strand of thinking on the afterlife within the Orthodox tradition. It is not unusual in Orthodoxy to have different and even apparently overlapping elements within the overall tradition, on matters on which there exist no formal church dogmas. It is thus misleading and erroneous to present toll-house theology as 'the teaching of the Orthodox Church' when in reality it is only part of Orthodox tradition concerning the afterlife.\\" Likewise, Prof. of Religious Studies Stephen J. Shoemaker wrote: \\"The truth of the matter is that the state of the dead was never precisely defined in the Orthodox tradition, and just as in other matters related to the afterlife, 'the Byzantines had no ‚Äòsystem‚Äô around the last things. Eschatology remained for them an open horizon within theology The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia had a session on \\"a controversy raised by Deacon Lev. Puhalo\\", the main opponent of the toll-house teaching. The resolution says the Holy Synod \\"demands the cessation in our magazines of controversy\\", \\"this controversy must be ended on both sides\\" and that \\"Deacon Lev Puhalo is forbidden to lecture in the parishes\\". =Controversy= The opponents of toll houses argue that it is a form of gnosticism, or neo- gnosticism, and claim that the teaching is opposed to the Church's catechism and other Orthodox teachings. Michael Azkoul argues that Seraphim Rose is its only contemporary theological proponent. Rose, an American Orthodox hieromonk and theologian, wrote a book on the subject, The Soul After Death. While Ignatius Brianchaninov, John Maximovich, Rose and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos endeavored to demonstrate that this teaching is derived from patristic and other church sources, his opponents, among them Azkoul and Archbishop Lazar Puhalo (a retired hierarch in the Orthodox Church in America, who had previously been defrocked from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia), found his conclusions questionable. Moreover, opponents of the teaching argue that it emphasizes fear and guilt as a way of keeping believers \\"in line\\", while ignoring the forgiveness of Jesus Christ, who, according to Orthodox Christian teaching, came to earth to save the world and humanity when they least deserved it. On that account, the emphasis of the spiritual life thus changes from communion with a God of love, to fear of demons. Opponents of the teaching also consider it similar to the intermediary state taught by the Catholic Church in its doctrine of purgatory. While some say that the toll houses are only metaphorical, others believe in a real but not physical representation of \\"stations of taxation\\", where demons have the right to ask their victims to account for their wrongdoings, and actually let the victim go if a good enough payment (of victim's good deeds) is offered. For example, in the hagiography of Basil the New, the angels accompanying Theodora through the toll houses repeatedly exchange gold coins‚Äìrepresenting the prayers of Basil‚Äìto the demons, in order that Theodora might be allowed to pass through. The idea of payment of good deeds being offered to the demons shares some aspects with the Roman Catholic teaching on merits, but in the case of the Catholic Church, the merits in question are not primarily individual but those of Christ and the saints administered by the church. Indeed, Gennadios Scholarios, Patriarch of Constantinople from 1454 to 1464, \\"stated that the trial of the 'tollgates' was, in fact, the Byzantine equivalent of purgatory, minus the fireworks\\". However, two dedicated chapters in the book The Departure of the Soul According to the Teaching of the Orthodox Church allegedly reveal for the first time over 100 falsifications, misrepresentations, and errors in Puhalo's and Azkoul's writings. Puhalo reportedly falsified reproduction of several ancient icons and falsified translations of the writings and lives of several saints, while Azkoul is said to have falsified several patristic texts. Both writers' works are asserted to contain an inordinate number of gross misrepresentations and errors, all attempting to support their allegedly incorrect opinions about the Orthodox teaching on the toll-houses. Most Orthodox Christians are not aware of the teaching, which has become \\"popularized\\" only since the publication of the book by Seraphim Rose. Opponents of the doctrine point to its lack of systematic theological expression among any father of the church, the uncritical acceptance of some patristic and hagiography sources, and the absence of precise theological definition as deficiencies in its proclamation.

He began as decorator and painter of porcelains in Delft (Netherlands). His artistic preferences for post-impressionism result in painting Flanders' landscapes, marines, farms' interiors, still lifes and flowers, but very few portraits. Living in Brussels as from 1913, he was member of the group ¬´L'Effort¬ª and is mainly considered as Belgian artist... Biography * First artistic formation at the orphanage in Dieren-Arnhem where he is placed at the age of ten. * Starts reproducing decorative drawings. * Spends his free time to roam the neighborhood for better apprehending the landscapes. * Is an apprentice with a house painter for a while. * Becomes painter on porcelain, first in Delft, then Makkum. * Resides in Brussels then in Cologne in 1909. * Works mainly in the Netherlands until 1913. * Conscript in spring 1913 but savagely conscientious objector, leaves the Netherlands definitively and settles in Brussels (Belgium) near his sister Anna Alida, who married Frans Buning, childhood friend of the artist whom he knew since the orphanage. * End of the 1st world war, in 1918, marries Maria Marteau and gives his name to her first child, Jean Leon, born on September 15, 1911. * On Octobre 3d 1920, birth of his son Victor. * Moves to Saint-Josse-ten-Noode (Brussels) in 1931. * In the 30th, becomes regular member of a group of artists and their free workshop ¬´L'Effort¬ª. * 1936-1937: Spends nearly two years on the Belgian coast (De Haan, Belgium, Ostend, Koksijde) and devotes himself particularly to his penchant for the marines. Meanwhile, long walks in the surrounding countryside are the pretext for a wide range of subjects of oil paintings captured either in the form of drawings and landscapes as small as 20x30 (which he will reuse as model source until the end of the war and work on more imposing canvas or panels). * Moves definitively in 1937, Avenue Dailly - Schaerbeek (Brussels), but keeps his workshop, street St. Gudule (opposite the St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral), until 1945 year of demolition because of reconstruction work of ‚ÄúThe Junction‚Äù. * During the World War II, his family will have to hide from Germans in the workshop to escape from enforced works. * Then, until his death, works exclusively in his apartment on the basis of drawings made while having good time during various trips and excursions in Flanders and the Netherlands. His Work Foremost painter of landscapes, marines, riversides, farms and interiors, still lifes and flowers, he did paint only about thirty portraits. At the age of 10 years, he was placed in an orphanage in Dieren (Arnhem), after the death of his father. In this institute he received his first lessons, which consisted of copies of existing drawings, but especially decorative patterns and mural frescos very appreciated in these times. In 1906, he accepts a job of decorator on porcelain in Delft, then in Makkum, a small town in Friesland (Netherlands). His work then consists in decorating small square plates of ‚ÄúDelft‚Äù, dishes and other objects. In 1909, after leaving his employment, he begins his life as artist, free and independent. All his life he will remain faithful to his set of themes for landscapes which will evolve gradually to a greater lightness and will gain in colors and luminosity, always in a post-impressionist style. In 1928, in Brussels, he organizes an exhibition of his works (the first and only he will ever agree to do) and participates the same year, in Namur, in an overall exposition organized in favour of victims of floods. Photographs of several of his paintings illustrated the newspapers of the time. In the 30th, he assiduously spends a lot of time in the Circle ‚ÄúL'Effort‚Äù, corporation of artists whose workshop was located at Brussels - Grand-Place. In the company of his artist friends, he benefits thus from the services of models and carries out many drawings (charcoals, \\"sanguines\\") drawn from life. After the war, he will reach the top of his art by playing with the sets of shadows and lights throughout his landscape subjects of predilection: fields, undergrowths, farmyards,... He will thus not be long in gaining a rather great public notoriety and interest from the artistic media, without strictly yielding to their demands and while painting only subjects according to his desires. He will produce in his lifetime more than 7.500 works, for the majority oils on canvas and generally sizing between (30 X 40) and (50 X 60), made in his workshop, but also a lot of oil works on light panels or cardboards (around 20 X 30), because he preferred those when drawing from life during his excursions. To live and satisfy his family responsibilities, he was nevertheless obliged to sell works, through art galleries (e.g. Ferbach) which became more and more demanding in front of the increasing interest of customers attracted by the friendliness of his paintings. Also, many of them were sold on the North American market. The paintings that he agreed to paint thus, which he called ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù, represent however nearly 2/3 of his work, often of style in agreement with the image that the public had about him, therefore may be less handled on the level of the artistic study. Such works were generally signed with a surname (e.g.: Mentens) which he separately reserved for each art merchant. His deep repulsion ‚Äúto be sold‚Äù will lead him to reject any form of exhibition or publicity, except for those organized by the merchants themselves and which he will always refuse to participate personally. This explains the confidentiality of the sale of his works after his death. Painting was his ideal and guided his all life.

Two salients had been formed during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 between Arras and Saint-Quentin and from Saint- Quentin to Noyon. was planned as a strategic withdrawal to new positions on the shorter and more easily defended Hindenburg Line (). General Erich Ludendorff was reluctant to order the withdrawal and hesitated until the last moment. The retirement took place between 9 February and 20 March 1917, after months of preparation. The German retreat shortened the Western front by . The retirement to the chord of the Bapaume and Noyon salients shortened the Western Front, providing 13 to 14 extra divisions for the German strategic reserve being assembled to defend the Aisne front against the Franco-British Nivelle Offensive, preparations for which were barely concealed. Background=Winter 1916‚Äì1917= Soon after taking over from Erich von Falkenhayn as head of the Supreme Army Command () at the end of August 1916, Paul von Hindenburg and his deputy Erich Ludendorff, the (First Quartermaster General) ordered the building of a new defensive line, east of the Somme battlefront, from Arras to Laon. Ludendorff was unsure as to whether retreating to the (Hindenburg Line) was desirable, since it might diminish the morale of German soldiers and civilians. An offensive was considered as an alternative, if enough reserves could be assembled in the New Year and a staff study suggested that seventeen divisions might be made available but that this was far too few to have decisive effect in the west. Alternatives, such as a shorter withdrawal, were also canvassed but the lack of manpower made the decision to retire unavoidable, since even with reinforcements from the Eastern Front, the German army in the west numbered only 154 divisions against 190 Allied divisions, many of which were larger. A move back to the Hindenburg Line () would shorten the front by and require fewer divisions to hold. =German debates= German army thinking about a withdrawal to the changed during the winter of 1916‚Äì1917 and comprised positive and negative reasons. At first it was seen by OHL as a last resort, if pressure on the Somme front became overwhelming. After the Central Powers' success in the Battle of Bucharest (28 November ‚Äì 6 December 1916) and the beginning of the winter lull in France, optimism at OHL that the retreat was unnecessary rose but was then deflated by the French attack at Verdun on 15 December. During January 1917 the resumption of unrestricted U-boat warfare on 1 February 1917 offered the possibility of driving Britain out of the war. To win in the west, the German armies would have only to avoid defeat; a retirement to the would give the a big defensive advantage. A move back to the would generate reserves by shortening the front and the defensive strength of the new positions, built in depth, on reverse positions, behind wide belts of barbed wire and studded with machine-gun nests, would allow divisions to hold a wider frontage. Before the British and French could attack the new defences, they would have to rebuild the communications between the Somme and , comprehensively destroyed by the Germans before the retirement. The Germans planned to waste the land; villages demolished, bridges blown, roads and railways dug up, wells tainted and the population carried off. The British and French armies would have to repeat the preparations for another offensive, after the retirement made preparations to resume the offensive on the Somme redundant. Every day's delay of an Entente offensive in France gave more time for the U-boat offensive to work; even if the Franco-British managed to attack, the expected to defeat the attempt. Fritz von Below, commander of the 1st Army (), had opposed a withdrawal to avoid a blow to the morale of the men who had fought to defend the Somme front. Subordinate commanders on the Somme doubted the ability of their men to withstand another offensive. The commander of the XIV Reserve Corps, Georg Fuchs, reported that morale was low and that the defences were in a deplorable state, positions near the Ancre being nothing more than flooded shell holes. Hermann von Kuhl, chief of staff of Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria () was persuaded by Fuchs and others to advocate a move back to the and on 4 February, the Kaiser, Wilhelm II ordered that the intervening ground be devastated and the retirement to begin on 9 February; Below and the 2nd Army commander, Georg von der Marwitz (since 17 December 1916), had been overruled by a consensus of their leaders and subordinates. Prelude=Crown Prince Rupprecht= Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, commander of , comprising the 1st Army, 2nd, 6th and 7th armies (from the Somme front to Flanders) had preferred a deeper retreat to fortifications incorporating cities like Lille and Cambrai, to deter an Entente attack but OHL judged this impractical for lack of manpower. Rupprecht also opposed the intention to turn the ground in the Noyon Salient into a wasteland when the final demolitions to scorch the earth began on 16 March, because of the damage to the prestige of the German Empire and the deleterious effects on the discipline of his troops. The demolitions made a desert of of territory and Rupprecht contemplated resignation, then relented, for fear that it might suggest a rift between Bavaria and the rest of Germany. =Operations on the Ancre= From 11 January to 13 March 1917, the British Fifth Army attacked the German 1st Army positions in the Ancre river valley, on the northern flank of the Somme battlefield of 1916. The Action of Miraumont (17‚Äì18 February), Capture of the Thilloys (25 February ‚Äì 2 March) and the Capture of Irles (10 March) took place before the main German withdrawal began. British attacks had taken place against exhausted German troops holding poor defensive positions left over from the fighting in 1916; some German troops had low morale and showed an unusual willingness to surrender. British attacks in the Action of Miraumont and anticipation of further attacks led Rupprecht on 18 March to order a withdrawal. The 1st Army withdrew of about on a front of the 1st Army to the from Essarts to Le Transloy on 22 February. The retirement caused some surprise to the British, despite the interception of wireless messages from 20 to 21 February. A second German withdrawal took place on 11 March, during a preparatory British bombardment and was not noticed by the British until the night of Patrols found empty between Bapaume and Achiet le Petit and strongly held on either flank. A British attack on Bucquoy at the north end of on the night of was a costly failure. German withdrawals on the Ancre spread south, beginning with a retirement from the salient around St Pierre Vaast Wood. =German withdrawal= Alberich began on 9 February 1917 in the area to be abandoned. Railways and roads were dug up, trees were felled, water wells were polluted, towns and villages were demolished and many land mines and other booby traps were planted. About French civilians in the region were transported to work elsewhere in occupied France, while children, mothers and the elderly were left behind with minimal rations. On 4 March, G√©n√©ral Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey, commander of (GAN, Northern Army Group), advocated an attack while the Germans were preparing to retreat. Robert Nivelle, Commander- in-Chief of the French armies since December 1916, approved only a limited attack to capture the German front position; a potential opportunity to turn the German withdrawal into a rout was lost. The withdrawal took place from with a retirement of about , giving up more French territory than that gained by the Allies from September 1914 until the beginning of the operation. =British operations= During the German withdrawal the British Third Army and Fifth Army followed up and conducted the Capture of Bapaume, 1917 (17 March) and the Occupation of P√©ronne (18 March). Aftermath=Analysis= By evacuating the Noyon and Bapaume salients, the German front was shortened by , German divisions were needed for line holding and Allied plans for the spring were seriously disrupted. The operation is considered to have been a propaganda disaster for Germany because of the scorched earth policy but is also thought to be one of the shrewdest defensive operations of the war. During periods of fine weather in October 1916, British reconnaissance flights had reported new defences being built far behind the Somme front; on 9 November a formation of eight photographic reconnaissance aircraft and eight escorts reported a new line of defences from Bourlon Wood north to Qu√©ant, Bullecourt, the Sens√©e river, H√©ninel and the German third line near Arras. Two other lines closer to the front were observed as they were dug ( and ) from Ablainzevelle to the west of Bapaume and Roquigny, with a branch from Achiet-le-Grand to Beugny and Ytres. In 2004, James Beach wrote that some authorities hold that British aerial reconnaissance failed to detect the construction of the Hindenburg Line or the German preparations for the troop withdrawal. Evidence of German intentions was collected but German deception measures caused unremarkable information to be gleaned from intermittent air reconnaissance. Frequent bad flying weather over the winter and the precedent of new German defences being built behind existing fortifications, during the Somme battle, led British military intelligence to misinterpret the information. In late December 1916, reports from witnesses led the British and French to send air reconnaissance sorties further to the south and in mid- January 1917, British intelligence concluded that a new line was being built from Arras to Laon. By February, the line was known to be near completion and by 25 February, local withdrawals on the British Fifth Army front in the Ancre valley and prisoner interrogation led the British to anticipate a gradual German withdrawal to the new line. The first intimation of a German withdrawal occurred when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. The British began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude of the local roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an orderly withdrawal. The new defences were built on a reverse slope with positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers could see the front position, experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire only a few hundred yards/meters deep. Unfortunately for the Germans, General Ludwig von Lauter and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new position, they put artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the front position was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.

He was the father-in-law of Henry Newton (politician). Biography Adams was born in Boston in either 1672 or 1673 to John and Avis Adams. Growing up as a petty merchant, Adams joined Sir Charles Hobby's New England regiment, participating in the capture of Port-Royal in 1710. Shortly thereafter, Adams settled in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, returning to civilian life. There, he traded manufactured goods with the province's Acadian and Native Americans, and took up the role of a real estate agent and contractor. Adams joined the Executive Council of Nova Scotia on 28 April 1720, holding his position there for 20 years; the records show that few served as long as he did. He also held several other public positions in the province. Adams was appointed a notary public and deputy collector of customs for Annapolis Royal in 1725, and he was commissioned a justice of the peace in March 1727. Around the mid-1720s, Adams poor eyesight began to fail, leading to his near-blindness in 1730. After this, he was less active in community activities and trade. Adams petitioned to the king for a pension several times, but failed. He blamed his disability on over-exposure to the sun during an Indian attack on Annapolis Royal in 1724. In December 1739, Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Armstrong died. With the absence of Major Mascarene to take Armstrong's place, Adams became the new president of the council and head of the civil government. In a meeting on 22 March 1740, with the return of Mascarene, the councilors declared that he was the council's rightful president. This turn of events led Adams to retire to Boston in late August or early September 1740, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He died some time after 1745.

It was constructed during the years in 1855 - 1859 in the Gothic Revival style, and was the country residence of Simeon Leland, a wealthy New York City hotel proprietor. Leland began to assemble an estate as early as 1848, and in 1855, began the erection of this palatial 60-room mansion.New Rochelle History-Nineteenth Century The home was designed by New York City architect William Thomas Beers. A north and south wing were added to the castle in 1899 and 1902 respectively.

The exterior is enhanced on the southeast corner by a tall square tower, by an hexagonal tower on the northeast, and a round tower on the northwest. The main entrance on the eastern facade is framed by a Gothic pointed arch. Tall, black-walnut doors ornamented with lion's heads are flanked by slender sidelights crowned with Gothic details. All windows are decorated with Gothic tracery and topped with heavily molded labels. As late as 1890, a wooden porte cochere with an open balcony above it stood before the main entrance. Two wooden verandas also opened out from the original building, as did a greenhouse on the south end. All these had disappeared before 1900. The greenhouse was replaced by a veranda, which in turn was replaced in 1897 by a room that followed the outlines of the original greenhouse. The entrance hall features walnut paneling and a blue and gold Minton tiled floor. The gothic style library contains a bay window with stained- and etched-glass borders, original interior shutters and bookcases, and one of the three original fireplaces in the mansion. Some of the first floor rooms are in the Renaissance style, with round arched doorways. The music room arches are crowned with rococo crests bearing busts of English sovereigns. In the dining room, a Renaissance-style sideboard and mantel, originally designed for this room, contrast with the Gothic diamond-paned windows with etched, amber- colored, stained-glass borders. The sliding doors between the dining and drawing rooms retain their panels of etched glass. In 1902, a large wing was built onto the north side adjoining the former billiard room and picture gallery extension followed the Gothic style of the original castle. The attic rooms have been subdivided, and a small chapel was installed in a former bedroom on the second floor. In 1926, the wooden parapet of the rear north tower was destroyed by lightning. During the middle part of the 20th century, the wooden gables, turrets, and crenellations over the bay windows were replaced by galvanized iron copies. In 1974, an interior staircase was installed in the square tower. The castle has three multiflue chimneys, which were originally used to heat the interior. The ornate fixtures of the original gas lighting system remain throughout. A chapel, not original to the building, is attached to the south elevation and a dormitory wing, with a larger chapel which was added in 1902.Sister Martha Counihan O.S.U. \\"Simeon Leland's Castle at New Rochelle.\\" Unpublished Masters Thesis. University of Delaware. 1973 Historical background In 1848, Leland purchased a 40-acre site in New Rochelle overlooking Long Island Sound. Like many successful New York businessmen, he took advantage of the railroads' development into the rural areas around New York and carefully planned a suburban enclave designed for graceful and stylish living. Famous for his well-run and fashionable Metropolitan Hotel in New York's theatre district, Leland's home became equally famous as he entertained there regularly.\\"The Leland Palace\\", 'Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly'; October 21, 1865 Leland retired in 1872 when his lease on the Metropolitan Hotel expired and was given to William A. \\"Boss\\" Tweed. He died later that same year deeply in debt and the mortgage on Castleview was foreclosed.Obituary The castle's new owner, the Manhattan Life Insurance Company, allowed Mrs. Leland and her children to continue living there until 1880. The home was then leased by the Queens County Hunt Club for use as an inn, and thus became known as \\"Castle Inn\\" for two years. In 1884, Adrian Iselin, Jr., a member of one of the Hunt Club families from Davenport Neck, purchased the castle and its surrounding acreage for the purpose of developing the land into a residential park. He paved surrounding streets, including Castle Place, put in gas lines and planted many trees, and soon the 40-acre original estate was diminished to just 2 1‚ÅÑ2 acres, as Iselin's Residence Park came to occupy much of the former grounds of Leland's estate.Sister Martha Counihan O.S.U. \\"Simeon Leland's Castle at New Rochelle.\\" Unpublished Masters Thesis. University of Delaware. 1973 The castle temporarily housed the New Rochelle Collegiate Institute, a boarding school for young boys, from 1889 - 1892, and later to Miss Morse‚Äôs Academy for young ladies. In 1897, the castle was further damaged by a fire that broke out in the chimney and caused extensive damage to the roof, plaster, and second-floor woodwork. Uninsured, Miss Morse was forced to leave the castle, and with the promise by Iselin of repairs to the smoke and water damage, it was then purchased by Mother Irene Gill for her Ursuline Seminary. Today, the residence survives in a suburban area more densely settled than the original grand country estate, and serves as a symbol of the fashion, taste, and lifestyle that Americans idealized in the latter part of the 19th century. It is also the only surviving example of the work of William Thomas Beers. The castle, until 2019, housed the administrative offices of the College of New Rochelle and the college's Castle Art Gallery.

Magdalena Sofia \\"Malla\\" Silfverstolpe (n√©e Montgomery; 8 February 1782 - 17 January 1861) was a Swedish writer and salon hostess. Her house in Uppsala was a meeting place for many prominent writers, composers and intellectuals. Her diaries, published in four parts between 1908 and 1911, offer a unique insight into the lives of those who formed part of her circle.  Biography  Silfverstolpe's father, Robert Montgomery, was commissioned into the French army in 1754 and by 1777 had achieved the rank of colonel. Serving in the County of Nyland and Tavastehus, in modern-day Finland, he married Charlotte Rudbeck in 1781. Rudbeck died in April 1782, two months after their daughter was born; Montgomery returned to Sweden with his daughter in 1783. Montgomery was held in high regard by Gustav III at the time of his return. That changed in 1789 when he was sentenced to death for his involvement in the Anjala conspiracy-- the sentence was not carried out and he remained in prison until his release in 1793. Silfverstolpe was raised by her maternal grandmother in Edsberg, Sollentuna during the period of her father's imprisonment. Silfverstolpe was married to David Gudmund Silfverstolpe, a colonel in the Swedish General Staff, in 1807; the marriage was not a happy one. Her husband suffered from repeated bouts of \\"mj√§ltsjuka\\"--an illness that, though then associated with the spleen (\\"mj√§lte\\" being the Swedish word for the organ), might now be diagnosed as depression. The couple moved to Uppsala in 1812 and Silfverstolpe was widowed in 1819. In 1820, Silfverstolpe, inspired by the prominent women of Paris, began running her Friday night salon. Silfverstolpe's salon welcomed leading figures in Swedish science, literature and high society and even hosted influential foreign visitors to the country. The salon was a powerful presence within the culture of Sweden for two decades and was the centre of the country's romantic movement. Aside from her support for romantic poets and novelists, Silfverstolpe was also a patron to a number of songwriters, including Per Ulrik Kernell and Adolf Fredrik Lindblad. Silfverstolpe, who had kept diaries throughout her life, began writing her memoirs from 1822 following Kernell's insistent suggestion. Excerpts from these were eventually released in four parts from 1908 to 1911, a second edition was published in 1914. The memoirs are rich in personal and historical detail. Silfverstolpe described Sweden and many of her most famous contemporaries with great tact and familiarity. Her writings provide an important contemporary account of figures such as Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom, Erik Gustaf Geijer, Lindblad, Anders Fredrik Skj√∂ldebrand, Esaias Tegn√©r, Adolf T√∂rneros and Johan Olof Wallin. Numerous contemporaries of Silfverstolpe dedicated poetry to her; these include Atterbom, Geijer and Wallin. There is also a road named after her in Sollentuna Municipality--Malla Silfverstolpes v√§g--upon which is Rudbeckskolan (a school named after her maternal family).

It was last assigned to the 4241st Strategic Wing, based at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. It was inactivated on 15 April 1963. History Established in late 1941 as a pursuit squadron in the Hawaii Territory, initially equipped with obsolete P-26 Peashooters, later with some early model Curtiss P-40C Warhawks. Most aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Wheeler Field during the Pearl Harbor Attack; squadron was reassigned to Bellows Field for re-equipping, being re-formed by May 1942 and redesignated as a Fighter Squadron assigned to the new Seventh Air Force. Deployed to Midway Island after the Battle of Midway as a defensive squadron, providing air defense of the island. Reassigned back to Hawaii at the beginning of 1943, remained part of the Territory's air defense forces. Received P-47D Thunderbolts in late 1943; deployed to Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. During the Marianas Campaign, worked closely with Marine ground forces, pioneered close infantry support and employed the first use of napalm. On Saipan the squadron was attacked by Japanese ground forces in June 1944 on Aslito Airfield soon renamed Isley Field, Saipan, sustaining modest casualties. Pilots and ground personnel took a crash course in infantry tactics afterward. Received the new long range P-47Ns in early 1945, before moving next door to Okinawa on Ie Shima. With the P-47N the squadron pioneered Very Long Range (VLR) fighter operations across the Pacific with missions of historic length and duration: Kauai to Midway Atoll, Midway to Kaneohe and Makin to Jaluit and Maloelap. By 1945, with the long range P-47Ns, VLR sorties were the rule rather than the exception. In April 1945 the squadron began flying 1300 mile escorts and sweeps from Iwo Jima to Honshu. In May 1945 the 73d advanced to le Shima where they reached out to Japanese targets in Kyu-shu and China. During the summer of 1945 was reassigned to the Twentieth Air Force and continued its fighter sweeps against Japanese airfields and other targets, in addition to flying long-range B-29 escort missions to Japanese cities, until the end of the war. Assigned to Eighth Air Force on Okinawa in August 1945, shortly after V-J Day. Returned to the United States and inactivated in Jan 1946. Activated in the postwar air force reserve, but never manned or equipped. Inactivated due to budget shortages in 1949. Reactivated in 1952 as a Strategic Air Command RB-36 Peacemaker strategic reconnaissance squadron at Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico; flew very long range intelligence gathering missions over the borders of the Soviet Union, North Korea and Communist China until 1959 when the B-36 was retired. In 1959 was reassigned to SAC provisional 4241st Strategic Wing, being re- equipped with B-52G Stratofortress intercontinental heavy bombers. Was reassigned to Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina by SAC to disperse its heavy bomber force. Conducted worldwide strategic bombardment training missions and providing nuclear deterrent. Was inactivated in 1963 when SAC inactivated its provisional Strategic Wings, redesignating them permanent Air Force Wings. Squadron was inactivated with aircraft/personnel/equipment being redesignated 51st Bombardment Squadron in an in-place, name-only transfer. =Lineage= * Constituted 73d Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) on 4 October 1941 : Activated on 5 October 1941 : Redesignated 73d Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942 : Inactivated on 12 January 1946 * Activated in the reserve on 1 August 1947 : Inactivated on 27 June 1949 * Redesignated 73d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) on 4 June 1952 : Activated on 16 June 1952 : Redesignated 73d Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 1 October 1955. : Discontinued, and inactivated on 15 April 1963; personnel/aircraft/equipment redesignated as 51st Bombardment Squadron =Assignments= * 18th Pursuit (later Fighter) Group, 5 October 1941 * 318th Fighter Group, 15 October 1942 ‚Äì 12 January 1946 * 72d Reconnaissance Group, 1 August 1947 ‚Äì 27 June 1949 * 72d Strategic Reconnaissance (later Bombardment) Wing, 16 June 1952 * 4241st Strategic Wing, 5 January 1959 ‚Äì 15 April 1963 =Stations= * Wheeler Field, Hawaii Territory, 5 October 1941 * Bellows Field, Hawaii Territory, 22 May 1942 * Henderson Field, Midway Eastern Island, 17 June 1942 * Kaneohe Field, Hawaii Territory, 26 January 1943 * Mokuleia Field, Hawaii Territory, 5 May 1943 * Bellows Field, Hawaii Territory, 8 November 1943 * East Field Saipan, Mariana Islands, c. 23 June 1944 * Ie Shima Airfield, Okinawa, 30 April 1945 * Naha Airfield, Okinawa, November‚ÄìDecember 1945 * Fort Lewis, Washington, 11‚Äì12 January 1946 * Hamilton Field (later AFB), California, 1 August 1947 ‚Äì 27 June 1949 * Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, 16 June 1952 * Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, 5 January 1959 ‚Äì 15 April 1963 =Aircraft= * Boeing P-26, 1941 * P-40 Warhawk, 1941‚Äì1943 * P-47 Thunderbolt, 1943‚Äì1945 * P-38 Lightning, 1944‚Äì1945 * RB-36 Peacekeeper, 1953‚Äì1958 * B-52G Stratofortress, 1959‚Äì1963 See also * List of B-52 Units of the United States Air Force References * External links 073 073 ","title":"73rd Bombardment Squadron"},{"id":"21327279","text":"Perseus \\"Percy\\" Jackson is a fictional character, the title character and narrator of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. He is also one of seven main protagonists of the sequel series The Heroes of Olympus, appearing in every book except The Lost Hero, and appears in the ongoing Trials of Apollo series, making him one of the few characters to appear in all three series of the Camp Half-Blood chronicles. He has also been a narrator and protagonist in Riordan's Greco-Roman/Egyptian crossover stories, part of the Demigods and Magicians collection. The character serves as the narrator in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods and Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes, also by Rick Riordan. Percy Jackson is played by Logan Lerman in the film adaptations of the novels and by Chris McCarrell in the musical.  Creation and conception  Development of the character Percy Jackson began when Rick Riordan started inventing stories for his son Haley Riordan, who was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia in the spring of 2002. When Haley was in second grade and he was studying Greek mythology, he asked his father to tell him bedtime stories based on those myths. When his father ran out of ideas, Haley suggested that he make up new stories that combined existing mythological characters with new ones. This led Riordan to create the fictional character of Percy Jackson and the story of his travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning- bolt. Haley then suggested it be written as a novel. Riordan received input on the manuscript from some of his middle school students before taking the idea of Percy Jackson to a publisher. Riordan has said that Percy Jackson's original character was \\"inspired by my son's own struggle\\" at school. Haley and Percy have been cited as the \\"same age\\" and share several character traits, though they are by no means the same person. Riordan has also stated that Percy has \\"[his] sense of humor\\" and is also \\"based on many of the students [he has] had in the past.\\"  Character  In the story, Percy Jackson is portrayed as a demigod, the son of the mortal Sally Jackson and the Greek god Poseidon. He has ADHD and dyslexia, allegedly because he is hardwired to read Ancient Greek and has inborn \\"battlefield reflexes\\". Percy's birthday is August 18. In the first novel of the series, The Lightning Thief, he is twelve years old. His personality is described as \\"changeable like the sea\\" and hard to predict ‚Äî with the important exception that he is dangerously loyal to his friends and family. The goddess Athena describes this as his fatal flaw. Percy's \\"powers\\", which start small and develop as the books proceed, include controlling water, making hurricanes, breathing underwater, and talking to horse-like animals and fish. He also becomes an accomplished sword-fighter and leader. Throughout Percy Jackson & The Olympians, Percy grows more confident and brave.Shrijith, A. \\"The World Of Percy Jackson And The Lightning Thief.\\" Language In India 12.3 (2012): 518-523. Communication & Mass Media Complete. He serves as the first head counselor of the Poseidon cabin at his demigod summer camp ‚Äì Camp Half-Blood. After The Last Olympian, the next time Percy is seen is in The Son of Neptune, the second book in the sequel series The Heroes of Olympus. He is suffering from amnesia and slowly struggles to regain his memory over the course of the novel. For a while in the book he cannot remember anything other than Annabeth Chase, his long-time friend. He arrives at a Roman establishment called Camp Jupiter, and is elected praetor as a result of the help he offers them on a quest. During the remaining three books in the third person his character develops significantly. He develops an irrational fear of drowning; is humbled by weakening sword-fighting skills; and expresses a new tendency to make ambiguous moral choices in defense of his friends and family. One of the character's darkest moments comes in The House of Hades, when Percy discovers that he can control the water in a person's body, and uses it to torture the goddess Akhlys. Percy's girlfriend Annabeth Chase is present and brings him to his senses, but remains haunted by his readiness to use that new power. At the end of The Blood of Olympus, Percy and Annabeth reveal plans to finish their senior year of high school together in New York, and then attend college in New Rome (a demigod-only city located in California, guarded by Camp Jupiter). In The Hidden Oracle, Percy has been accepted to the college with a full scholarship, provided he can pass his SATs and graduate on time despite the semester he spent away (while missing during The Lost Hero). Percy's concern for his future and family leads him to uncharacteristically turn down Lester Papadopoulous's request for help on a quest to regain his godhood (Papadopoulous being the mortal form of the god Apollo).  Friends and family = Family = Percy is the son of Poseidon; his mother, Sally Jackson, married a man named Gabe Ugliano when Percy was young. Ugliano was abusive towards Percy and Sally, the latter of whom leaves him in The Lightning Thief. It is later known that Sally Jackson married Gabe Ugliano as Gabe was so mortal and human and gave off such a stench that no monster would roam anywhere near his surroundings. As Percy was a strong demigod (a son of Poseidon, one of the \\"Big Three\\") and such demigods attract monsters more than usual, she had to marry him to protect Percy from danger. Between the time of The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian, Sally Jackson marries Paul Blofis, a man she met in a writing seminar. Percy likes and respects his new step-father and eventually reveals to him that he is a demigod. Though understandably shocked, Paul still stays with the Jackson family and accepts Percy's complicated life. In The Hidden Oracle, Percy's mother is seven months pregnant with Paul's child (Percy's half sister). Percy has a brother named Tyson, who is a cyclops. Though Percy is related to virtually every character and creature in Greek mythology through his father Poseidon, Tyson is one of the only beings whom he acknowledges as family. Percy first met Tyson at a school called Meriwether Prep, and did not learn of their relationship until much later. Percy is also distantly related to horses, pegasi, some other monsters, and numerous gods and demigods through his father. Significant examples of this would be that he is technically a grandson of Kronos, nephew to Hades, Zeus, and numerous other Olympians as well as the half-nephew of Chiron. = Friends = Percy's oldest friend is Grover Underwood, a satyr originally tasked with protecting him and bringing him safely to Camp Half- Blood. His next-oldest friend is Annabeth Chase, whom he meets when she helps nurse him back to health after his first fight with the Minotaur. The two accompany him on his first, and most of his subsequent, quests. Percy is also close to many other characters in the book series. His closest friends include Thalia Grace, daughter of Zeus and leader of the Hunters of Artemis; Luke Castellan, son of Hermes (at first Percy's friend, then his enemy, and finally Percy's friend at the time of his death); Nico di Angelo, son of Hades; Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a mortal Pythia, or host of a prophetic spirit; Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto; Leo Valdez, son of Hephaestus; Jason Grace, son of Jupiter; Piper McLean, daughter of Aphrodite; and Frank Zhang, son of Mars. Frank Zhang is also a descendant of Periclymenus, descendant of Poseidon, and so distantly related to Percy. Finally, Percy has an interesting relationship with Clarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares and Camp Half-Blood's resident bully, whom he allegedly dislikes but often helps.  Romantic relationships  Percy's oldest romantic relationship is with Annabeth Chase. Their relationship gradually changes throughout the first series, with the goddess Aphrodite first insinuating that it was romantic in The Titan's Curse, when Percy undertakes a quest to free Annabeth from the Titan Atlas. However, Percy's first move towards a serious relationship does not occur until the final pages of The Last Olympian. Other romantic relationships are shown to have been possibilities before this however. As the final battle with the Titans approaches after The Battle of the Labyrinth, Percy spends time with his mortal friend Rachel Dare. Their relationship causes Annabeth Chase to become jealous and helps enact the events of The Last Olympian. Towards the end of The Last Olympian Rachel also realizes that her attraction is not to Percy, but to his mythological world, because of her destiny as the next Oracle of Delphi. Three other characters in the novels are romantically interested in Percy, though he remains mostly oblivious. Nico di Angelo's hero worship of Percy turns into an ever-worsening crush on him; at the same time, Nico resents Percy because he believes the son of Poseidon allowed his sister Bianca to die in battle. The second is Calypso, who was banished to the island of Ogygia. Calypso later meets Percy's friend Leo Valdez; he manages to save her, where Percy could not. The third is Reyna Ram√≠rez-Arellano, who, silently attracted to her comrade Jason Grace, finds herself attracted to many of Percy's similar traits. = Magical animal companions = Percy has several animal companions. The first is Blackjack, a black pegasus that Percy liberates from the Princess Andromeda in The Sea of Monsters. Blackjack is first referred to as a \\"mare\\" in The Sea of Monsters, though he is called a stallion in all later books. Blackjack becomes Percy's personal steed and companion. Blackjack is unfailingly loyal to Percy, and on several occasions manages to save Percy's life. Blackjack always calls Percy \\"boss\\" and is quite fond of sugar cubes and doughnuts. Blackjack has two friends named Porkpie and Guido, both white pegasi, who sometimes accompany him. All three are intelligent beings capable of interacting with other demigods independent of their horse-to-human translator, Percy. Percy's second magical companion is Mrs. O'Leary, who is introduced in the fourth novel, Battle of the Labyrinth. She is a hellhound that he receives from Daedalus (whom Percy meets as a sword master named Quintus) before the inventor dies. Though Mrs. O'Leary is described as \\"the size of a tank\\", the magical veil known as the Mist causes her to appear as a poodle to mortals. Percy often refers to her as \\"his dog\\". Percy sometimes uses Mrs. O'Leary's ability to \\"shadow travel\\" to cross large distances almost instantaneously. His brother Tyson and dead friend Charles Beckendorf are Mrs. O'Leary's other caretakers, though she is also fond of Nico di Angelo, son of Hades. He also knows a hippocampus named Rainbow who likes Percy's half-brother Tyson. It first appears in The Sea of Monsters, where it helps Percy and his friends enter Luke Castellan's boat Princess Andromeda. It later saves the life of Tyson and returns to help the two brothers on several occasions. Percy has also traveled with a small calico kitten called Small Bob by Bob the Titan. Small Bob was accidentally created by one of Atlas's servants who was attempting to summon a group of spartoi. When Percy is trapped in Tartarus during The House of Hades, Annabeth, Bob, and he find and travel with the kitten. He is fond of Bob and protective of the traveling group, leading Bob to call him \\"a good monster\\". Small Bob can transform into a full sized saber-toothed tiger at will and occasionally appears as an x-ray for a few seconds at a time. His purr is disproportionately loud for an animal of his size. Small Bob remains in Tartarus with Iapetus to help hold open the Doors of Death. It is unclear if he lives or dies, but he is not mentioned again.  Description  Percy is described as handsome, with messy jet black hair, a \\"Mediterranean\\" complexion, and sea-green eyes like his father Poseidon. His mother notes that Percy looked just like his father, and his friend Hazel says that he has the looks of a Roman god. = Abilities = Like most demigods, Percy has ADHD and dyslexia, the former because of his godly battle instincts, and the latter because his brain takes more naturally to Ancient Greek than to English. After being trained at Camp Half-Blood, he has developed a Greek fighting style (described as unpredictable by New Romans) and is an expert swordsman. After bathing in the River Styx, Percy was given the curse of Achilles, making him invulnerable except for the small of his back. He loses this power when it is washed away in the Little Tiber surrounding New Rome, as part of his acceptance there. In addition, he has an \\"empathy link\\" with his first friend from Camp Half-Blood, Grover. As a son of Poseidon, one of the \\"Big Three\\" (the others being Zeus and Hades), Percy is more powerful than most of the gods' other children. He also has a degree of authority over his father's subjects. Percy is gifted with several semi-divine abilities: the ability to manipulate water and currents; enhanced strength/energy and senses while near the water; the ability to breathe underwater and operate old sailing ships with his mind; mental communication with marine animals, equine animals, water nymphs, and some of his relatives; and the creation of small earthquakes and hurricanes. Water also provides Percy with a measure of protection from injury and fire. All of Percy's abilities correspond to the myths about and abilities of his father. = Weapons = Percy's main weapon is Anaklusmos (\\"Riptide\\"), a sword made of celestial bronze given to him by Chiron the centaur, on the instructions of Poseidon; the sword's history goes back to Heracles, who was gifted that sword by the nymph Zo√´ Nightshade, a daughter of Atlas. Riptide can change shape; when it is not a sword, it appears as a ballpoint pen engraved with its name. It reappears in the character's pocket when lost. Since it is made of celestial bronze it will harm gods, demigods, and monsters, but simply passes through mortals. Percy has also used magic javelins made by his brother Tyson, magically camouflaging armor made by Charles Beckendorf, and the wand of Carter Kane. In The Sea of Monsters, his half-brother Tyson gives him a wristwatch that changes into a shield covered with designs, but the watch is damaged in The Titan's Curse and lost in The Battle of the Labyrinth. Percy has several magical items obtained from battles against monsters. The first of these is the horn of the Minotaur, which he obtains after killing the beast on Half-Blood Hill. Another is the head of Medusa, which he cuts off after killing the gorgon. He gives the head away several times, finally leaving it with his mother, who \\"disposes of it\\". He also obtains a bullet- and sword-proof lion skin coat when he killed the Nemean lion, which he later sacrifices as an offering to Poseidon in order to save his love interest.

Licensed to Mount Shasta, California, United States, the station is currently owned by Southern Oregon University. History The station, founded 1947 by David Rees, Sr. of the Shasta Cascade Broadcasting Corporation, signed on the air June 12, 1947, as KWSD, broadcasting on 1340 kHz with 250 W of power. After the \\"K\\", the call letters originally stood for W (Weed) S (Shasta) D (Dunsmuir). The station aired various formats over the years, including rock, country and news talk. Rees had previously spent two decades with KMED in Medford, Oregon. KWSD was the only station in the Mt. Shasta market until 1976, when a companion FM station, KEDY, went on the air. Station personalities through the years included Rees, his sons Dave Jr. and Jon, Dave Niles, Stephen Rizzo, Michael Killian, Jim Mourgos, Paul Whitney, Perry Sims, John Hart, Fred Gerding Jr., Timothy Harris, Mark Hickenbotham, Bill Craig, Dave Jr.'s son Dennis Rees, Brian Hembling and Robin Von. Programming varied from middle-of-the-road, to country, to rock, to various network and satellite programming. The AM station operated during daylight hours only at 1,000 non- directional watts with 500 pre-sunrise watts. By the 1990s, the AM station was allowed to broadcast after sundown at 29 watts. KWSD was one of the stations sold to Siskiyou Radio Partners, Inc. in 1995, owned by Tom Huth and Bob Darling. The call letters were changed to KMJC, as was KEDY. KMJC's format was changed to news/talk. The station was then sold to Four Rivers Broadcasting, who also purchased KMJC-FM, KSYC, KSYC-FM and then KWHO in 2001. Two years later, Jefferson Public Radio, in association with Southern Oregon University, acquired both KMJC (AM) and KSYC (AM) from Four Rivers. Jefferson Public Radio and its programming covers far Northern California and Southern Oregon with an affiliation of small local stations. Effective June 10, 2016, the licenses for KMJC and six other stations in California and Oregon were transferred by JPR Foundation to Southern Oregon University.

As a staff scientist his research interests include studying plasma kinetic physics and magnetohydrodynamics of the solar wind, heliosphere, shock waves, MHD and kinetic simulation of plasma instabilities, and turbulent processes associated with space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Early years Vi√±as was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. He studied at the University of Puerto Rico-R.U.M. where he received a B.S. and M.S. in physics in 1970 and 1972, respectively. He later studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1980. Between 1970 and 1974, he worked as an instructor and assistant professor of physics at the University of Puerto Rico. He joined Goddard Space Flight Center in 1980, where he has held multiple positions. He currently is a staff scientist in the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the Heliophysics Science Division at Goddard. He has served as Adjunct Visiting Physics Professor at the Universidad de Concepcion (Chile), at the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and at the Universidad de Alcal√° de Hen√°res-Madrid (Spain). NASA Vi√±as has pioneered methods for the analysis of plasma particle detectors on board spacecraft. He has conceived and developed a technique for the determination of the fluid moments of velocity distribution function in space plasma measurements from particle detectors. This method is currently being tested for implementation on board any satellite CPU processing unit with particle detectors, to reduce the amount of data required to compute the moments on ground with only a small amount of measurements required via telemetry to unpack the physical quantities on ground. Vi√±as has also pioneer work to resolve the geometrical properties, propagation velocity, and characteristics of shock waves from simple conservation principles. His work has received national and international recognition (known as the Vi√±as-Scudder Method) because it is the most accurate and robust method for in-situ shock characteristics determination from space plasma measurements. The Vi√±as-Scudder method have been implemented into an Interactive Data Language (IDL) visualization tool named SDAT (Shock and Discontinuities Analysis Tool) for distribution to the scientific community and investigators interested in shock physics. Currently Vi√±as is a staff astrophysicist at the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the Heliophysics Science Division at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Vi√±as continues actively in research and lecturing at various national and international research centers and universities, He is also a post-doctoral mentor and adviser to many national and international young scientists.

The graphics (not including the photo inserts) on all three sets was airbrush illustrated by Larry Grossman. The box sets contained new masters mixed and edited by Zappa in his Utility Muffin Research Kitchen home studio, prepared for the compact disc format. The albums were remixed and reedited, and are substantially different from their original releases. The series was well received by critics, although some criticism was aimed at Zappa's alterations, most notably the decision to rerecord the rhythm sections of the albums We're Only in It for the Money and Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, which provoked a lawsuit over unpaid royalties. These are official releases #43, #46, and #49.  Background  In the 1980s, Frank Zappa had regained the rights to the albums he had released on other labels. He decided to reissue them as part of a series of three box sets for collectors. Zappa found the quality of the original masters to be unsatisfactory for release, and decided to prepare new masters, remixing and reediting the original tapes. In the case of the albums We're Only in It for the Money and Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, Zappa decided to rerecord the rhythm tracks, overdubbing newly recorded performances by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman. Barrow stated of the remixing, \\"I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, as a musician, I'm always happy to be employed and doing sessions is always fun. But on the other hand, I did try to talk Frank out of it the best I could.\\" Zappa told Barrow that he did not like the original performances, by bassist Roy Estrada and drummer Jimmy Carl Black. During this period, Zappa also prepared a remix of the second version of his 1967 album Lumpy Gravy, featuring similar overdubs by Barrow and Wackerman. An excerpt from the remix was included in an Old Masters promotional sampler intended for radio station managers, but the remix was not released at the time; it appeared on Lumpy Money in 2008. Zappa stated in regards to the remixing of the albums, \\"The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in it For the Money, I decided to do it on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself.\\" After the remixing was announced, a $13 million lawsuit was filed against Zappa by Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk Gardner and Don Preston, who were later joined by Ray Collins, Art Tripp and Motorhead Sherwood, increasing the claim to $16.4 million, stating that they had received no royalties from Zappa since 1969. Zappa told interviewers that the oxide was falling off the tapes, and that he had to replace the drum and bass performances. Barrow disputed this, stating \\"how could the oxide be falling off the tape on one track and not on other tracks? But it's Frank's album. It's his music. He can certainly do what he likes with it. But I think it would be nice for those of us that like the original version to put that out also [...] As for Ruben & The Jets, I kinda think that's bad too. Because one of the coolest things about that album originally was the tape loops for the drums. It sounded like a machine, it was a great sound.\\" In addition to the new masters, Zappa prepared a \\"Mystery Disc\\" for two of the box sets, but not for the third Old Masters box. Additionally, the third box did not include the albums Zappa in New York, Sleep Dirt, Studio Tan, and Orchestral Favorites, which Zappa had prepared after Warner Bros. Records had rejected his intended release, L√§ther. Zappa in New York, Sleep Dirt, Studio Tan and Orchestral Favorites were subsequently released on compact disc by Barking Pumpkin, and L√§ther was released by Rykodisc in 1996. All of the albums included in this set were subsequently issued on compact disc, in editions that used the masters which appeared on these boxes; the \\"Mystery Discs\\" were subsequently combined into a single release, Mystery Disc, released by Rykodisc in 1998. On this release, the tracks \\"Big Leg Emma\\" and \\"Why Don't You Do Me Right?\\" were excluded, as they had previously appeared on the compact disc edition of Absolutely Free.

It blooms in mid to late summer with purple flower heads. It is of conservation concern. It grows from rounded or sometimes elongated corms, that produce stems 20 to 75 centimeters tall. The upright growing stems have appressed hairs that point in the same direction. The basal and cauline leaves have one nerve. The leaves are long and thin, ranging from 8 to 12 centimeters long and 2 to 5 millimeters wide. The foliage is mostly hairless or may have some hairs on the margins; the leaves are gradually reduced in size as they ascend the stem or abruptly reduced halfway up the stem. The flowers are in dense heads with 20 to 25 florets, and the heads have stems that are 20 to 70 millimeters long. The heads are produced in loose cyme-like clusters of 2 to 20, sometimes more, terminating the widely branched stems.

It has four major areas of focus: health care, development, relief, and education. The official website is: www.HaitianHealthFoundation.org The Mission of the Haitian Health Foundation is to improve the health and well being of women, children, families, and communities living in the greater J√©r√©mie region through healthcare, education, and community development. HHF is supported by contributions from private donors, USAID, other NGOs, in-kind donations, and volunteer services. Headquartered in Norwich, Connecticut, HHF's current president is Jeremiah J. Lowney, DDS, MS, MPH, KM, who also founded the organization. Its current executive director is E. Marilyn Lowney and its current Country Director is Nadesha Mijoba. History and background HHF began in 1982 with a trip to Port-au-Prince by Dr. Jeremiah J. Lowney, a Connecticut orthodontist, who traveled to Haiti to provide free dental care to the poor. In 1985‚Äîafter working for three years in Port-au-Prince and other areas of Haiti with Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity, Mother Teresa requested that Dr. Lowney move his small group's outreach to the rural city of J√©r√©mie. This volunteer effort developed into outpatient health care, public health outreach to mountain villages, house and latrine construction for the poorest villagers, feeding facilities, education support, animal distribution, and other programs. Haiti ranked 146th of 177 countries on the United Nations Development Programme 2007 Human Development Index; 76 percent of Haitians live with less than US$2 per day and 56 percent on less than US$1 per day, below the poverty line. Geographic areas served HHF provides services to the rural poor within the city of J√©r√©mie (population: 60,000) and to over 100 rural and mountain villages in the Grand'Anse, Haiti. Humanitarian services= Health Care= HHF operates an outpatient clinic (Klinik Pep Bondye-a), extensive public health outreach programs to over 100 rural and mountain villages, and a residential facility for women in high-risk pregnancies and children with Kwashiorkor malnutrition (Center of Hope). HHF periodically facilitates specialized surgeries (e.g., cleft lip) performed in J√©r√©mie as well as other areas of Haiti. Children under the foundation's care are also brought to the US for specialized surgeries not available in Haiti. HHF's maternal health program was featured on the PBS \\"NOW\\" program on January 29, 2010, in a story entitled \\"Saving Haiti's Mothers\\" (which was filmed in Haiti at the time of the January 12, 2010, earthquake).Public Broadcasting System, NOW, \\"Saving Haiti's Mothers\\", January 29, 2010. https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/605/index.html =Development=Housing Under its Happy House program‚Äîstarted in 1997‚ÄîHHF provides housing for homeless and poor families residing in rickety hovels in rural southern Haiti. Animal distribution Beginning in 1991, HHF has distributed thousands of animals to impoverished farming families, helping to provide some self- sufficiency. Thousands of Kreyol pigs and chickens have propagated as a result. Currently, HHF distributes female breeding goats with its Give a Goat program. Sanitation In 1993 HHF began constructing pit toilets under its Clean Latrine project, which encourages sanitation and helps to curtail the spread of disease related to lack of proper waste disposal. =Relief=Save-a-Family HHF's Save a Family program began in 1987. The program, run by volunteers, links sponsors in the US, Europe, and Canada with some of the poorest families in J√©r√©mie. The funding provides for food, rent, education for children, and other family needs. Feeding programs Haitian Health Foundation operates an active food program, called Feed-a- Child, that provides hot meals and take-home food to the most malnourished in J√©r√©mie and the rural mountains. =Education= Separate from the Save-a- Family program, thousands of other children have been provided with elementary and secondary assistance through HHF's education-based programs.

The benefits attributed to not using a computer for 24 hours range from electricity savings to getting back in touch with friends and nature.  Establishment =Founders= Denis Bystrov and Nikolay Kudrevatykh were the co-founders of Shutdown Day; Bystrov originally conceived the idea of Shutdown Day, and the co-founders developed the concept in 2007, while living in Canada. Michael Taylor, an original partner in the idea of shutting down one's computer down for a day, said:  Purpose and goals  Shutdown Day is a global Internet experiment whose purpose is to get people to think about how their lives have changed with the increasing use of the home computer, and whether or not any good things are being lost because of this. The concept of the Shutdown Day project is to simply shutdown one's computer for one whole day each year, and become involved in other activities: outdoors, nature, sports, fun stuff with friends and family, just to remind yourself that there is a real world beyond the computer screen.  History  Shutdown Day started in early 2007, when Denis Bystrov realized that he spent too much time with his computer and wanted to spend more time with his family. Bystrov teamed up with his friends Nikolay Kudrevatykh, Michael Taylor (former trade floor occupant in stock markets in London, England) and David Bridle (part-time film maker from Cardiff, Wales), to present a challenge on the Internet, through the website shutdownday.org, challenging people to avoid their computers for 24 hours. The idea was simple: What began as an innocent question, gathered an Internet chain reaction following, which drew millions of viewers from across the world. Here is a summary of the results from the Shutdown Day 2007 campaign: * The Shutdown Day website received more than 1.6 million visitors in the first month of the campaign. * More than 65,000 people participated in the campaign by actually shutting down their computers for 24 hours on the 24th of March, 2007. * The Shutdown Day promotional clip was broadcast on YouTube and received more than 1.1 million hits. * 450,000 visitors signed up for country locater on Shutdown Day website. * The idea of Shutdown Day featured on more than 200,000 online forums discussions, television interviews, and popular media. Services that covered Shutdown Day included Globe and Mail, CNN, Fox News, and TV5. Later in 2007, as Bystrov was discussing the future of Shutdown Day with another friend, Ashutosh Rajekar, also a victim of excessive technology use, he realized that both had some interesting ideas to share regarding the future direction of Shutdown Day. Eventually, Denis, Nikolay and Ashutosh decided to team up to register as a non-profit organization in the province of Quebec. In 2008, Shutdown Day was held on May 3. The message to turn off computers and engage in a day without technology was carried by Reuters wire services two days prior to the second annual event. Rajekar's message was now indicating that computers, televisions, and technology in general was having a negative effect on society. Shortly prior to the event, Reuters carried a story encouraging users to step away from their technology for 24 hours. The estimated that the inaugural 2007 event had garnered over 50,000 participants. Many of the group had plans to visit parks, engage in cleaning up public areas, enjoy hiking, camping, and outdoor photography. = 2009 = Shutdown day 2009 was held on May 2. The campaign started on March 1 and lasted through May 2, 2009.

The complex, with four federal National Wildlife Refuges, is managed by the U.S Fish & Wildlife Service. Introduction The complex is composed of the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge, Merced National Wildlife Refuge, San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, and the Grasslands Wildlife Management Area. The complex consists of nearly of wetlands, grasslands,and riparian habitats, as well as over of conservation easements on private lands for the protection and benefit of wildlife. The complex is headquartered in Los Banos, California and uses the Sierra National Forest Emergency Communication Center located in Fresno, California for emergency dispatch. The complex is located within the Pacific Flyway, a major route for migrating birds, including waterfowl. The extensive wetlands of the complex and surrounding lands provide habitat for up to a million waterfowl that arrive here each winter. Of the 30 species of waterfowl using the complex, the most common include Ross's geese, Aleutian cackling geese, snow geese, green-winged teal, mallards, northern pintails, gadwalls, American wigeons, northern shovelers, and greater white-fronted geese. The complex is an integral part of a mosaic of federal, state, and private lands in Merced and Stanislaus Counties that together constitute the largest contiguous freshwater wetlands remaining in California. This area has been recognized as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, an Audubon Important Bird Area, and as a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site. Wildlife refuge units= San Luis National Wildlife Refuge = The San Luis National Wildlife Refuge encompasses over of wetlands, riparian forests, native grasslands and vernal pools. A thriving population of tule elk is showcased by one of three auto tour routes. The refuge is host to significant assemblages of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects and plants; some of which, such as the California tiger salamander and San Joaquin kit fox, are endangered species. In 1966, the first parcel of the refuge was purchased with Federal Duck Stamp funds to provide a sanctuary for migratory waterfowl. Over the years the refuge has steadily grown in size and today it comprises six contiguous units: San Luis, East Bear Creek, West Bear Creek, Freitas, Blue Goose, and Kesterson. The San Joaquin River bisects the eastern portion of the refuge. The refuge is a major wintering ground and migratory stopover point for large concentrations of waterfowl, shorebirds and other waterbirds. Large flocks of northern shovelers, mallards, gadwalls, wigeons, green-winged teal, cinnamon teal, northern pintails, ring-billed ducks, canvasbacks, ruddy ducks, snow geese, Ross's geese, and greater white-fronted geese swarm over the mosaic of seasonal, and permanent wetlands that comprise a quarter of the refuge. Waterfowl generally remain until mid-April before beginning their journey north to breeding areas. Some mallards, gadwalls, and cinnamon teal stay through the spring and summer and breed on the refuge. Shorebirds including sandpipers and plovers can be found in the tens of thousands from autumn through spring. Large flocks of dunlin, long-billed dowitchers, least sandpipers and western sandpipers can be found feeding in shallow seasonal wetlands, whereas flocks of long-billed curlews are found using both wetlands and grasslands. Over 25 species of shorebirds have been documented at the San Luis NWR. The San Luis NWR has played a key role in the recovery of the Tule Elk, a non-migratory elk subspecies found only in California. Prior to the mid-19th century, an estimated 500,000 Tule Elk lived in California. Due to over-hunting and loss of natural habitat, they were nearly driven to extinction by the turn of the 20th century ‚Äì by some accounts, the population was down to 10-20 individuals. In 1974 a herd of 18 animals was established in a large enclosure at the San Luis NWR and has since thrived. Elk from this herd are periodically relocated to establish new or join other Tule Elk herds throughout California. A true wildlife recovery success story, the statewide Tule Elk population has recovered to over 4,000 animals. Less well known are the extensive upland habitats found on the refuge. Many of these habitats are characterized by saline or alkaline conditions which are accentuated by the low rainfall and arid conditions that characterize the San Joaquin Valley. These habitats support a rich botanical community of native bunchgrasses, native and exotic annual grasses, forbs, and native shrubs. Trees, such as the valley oak, cottonwood, and willow are found along riparian corridors. In these areas, visitors might encounter coyotes, desert cottontails, ground squirrels, western meadowlarks, yellow-billed magpies, loggerhead shrikes, as well as northern harriers and white-tailed kites coursing over the vegetation and other raptors. Great blue herons, great egrets, and white-faced ibises are frequently sighted throughout the refuge. The refuge has three auto tours routes with associated nature trails and observation decks for the public to view and photograph wildlife and nature. The refuge also allows fishing at designated sites and has a large waterfowl hunting program. = Merced National Wildlife Refuge = The Merced National Wildlife Refuge is within Merced County. It is divided into four units: Merced Unit, Arena Plains Unit, Snobird Unit, and Lonetree Unit. It encompasses of wetlands, native grasslands, vernal pools, and riparian zone areas. It was established in 1951 under the Lea Act to attract wintering waterfowl from adjacent farmland where their foraging was causing crop damage. In the last few decades, changes in agricultural practices and refuge management have reduced these wildlife/crop issues. The refuge plays host to the largest wintering populations of lesser sandhill cranes and Ross's geese within the Pacific Flyway. Each autumn over 20,000 cranes and 60,000 arctic-nesting geese terminate their annual migrations from Alaska and Canada to make the refuge home for six months. Here they mingle with thousands of other visiting waterfowl, waterbirds and shorebirds making the refuge a true winter phenomenon. The refuge also provides important breeding habitat for Swainson's hawks, tricolored blackbirds, marsh wrens, mallards, gadwalls, cinnamon teal, and burrowing owls. Tricolored blackbirds, a colonial-nesting songbird, breed in colonies of over 25,000 pairs. Coyotes, ground squirrels, desert cottontails, beavers, and long-tailed weasels can also be seen year-round. Vernal pools are another type of wetland found on the Merced NWR. These special pools form when natural shallow depressions underlaid with clay soils fill with winter rainwater. The pools come to life as they fill with water: fairy and tadpole shrimp emerge from cysts embedded in the soils the previous year. The endangered tiger salamander, along with other amphibians lay eggs and rear tadpoles. The vast number of aquatic invertebrates found in these pools provides a food source for wintering and migrating birds as they prepare for the long flight north to their breeding grounds. As spring arrives and the water in the vernal pools evaporates, wildflowers ‚Äì such as goldfields, purple owl's clover, and butter-and-egg ‚Äì germinate in colorful patterns of thick rings or halos around the pool basins. Once the vernal pools have dried out, Downingia and Colusa grass, a rare California species, appear in the parched basins. This annual coloring led John Muir to describe the valley floor as the \\"floweriest part of the world\\" he had seen. In addition to managing natural habitats, the Merced NWR contains approximately of cultivated corn and winter wheat crops and over of irrigated pasture for wildlife. Not only do these managed agricultural areas provide important sources of nutrition (carbohydrates) to the tens of thousands of arctic-nesting geese and sandhill cranes that make Merced County their winter home, they also help ensure that the birds will have adequate nutrient stores to make the long migration to their northern breeding grounds. Local farmers, under agreements with the refuge, oversee the ground preparation, seeding, and irrigation of these croplands. The refuge incorporates a livestock grazing program that works in partnership with local ranchers and farmers. Grazing cattle and sheep is a management tool used by the refuge to help control invasive weeds, provide and maintain short stature grasslands for goose grazing, and encourage native grasslands to thrive = San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge = The San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge is located in Stanislaus County and San Joaquin County. It encompasses over of riparian woodlands, wetlands and grasslands that host a diversity of wildlife native to California's Central Valley. The refuge is situated where three major rivers, the San Joaquin, Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers, join providing key wildlife corridor habitat. The refuge was established in 1987 under the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The refuge has played a major role in the recovery of Aleutian cackling geese by serving as a key wintering area and continues to be of major importance to this species. By 1975, the total population was under 1,000 geese; however, removing nest predators (non-native introduced foxes) from the breeding grounds in Alaska's Aleutian Islands and improving wintering habitat resulted in its delisting as an endangered species and a population well over 100,000 and growing. Restoring wetlands and providing grasslands and croplands at this refuge has provided ideal wintering habitat for the geese. It is estimated that 95 percent of the San Joaquin Valley's riparian woodlands were lost during the late 19th and 20th centuries due to changing land and water uses. However, this refuge is in the process of restoring this critical habitat. Within the borders of the San Joaquin NWR is one of California's largest riparian forest habitat restoration projects: 400,000 native trees such as willows, cottonwoods, and oaks have been planted across of river floodplain creating the largest block of contiguous riparian woodland in the San Joaquin Valley. This important riparian woodland habitat is host to many rare animals. Swainson's hawks nest in the canopy of tall cottonwood trees. Herons and cormorants form communal nesting colonies within the tops of the large oaks. Endangered riparian brush rabbits have been re- introduced to this restored habitat from captive-reared populations. These woodlands also support a diversity of breeding songbirds including grosbeaks, orioles, flycatchers, warblers, as well as least Bell's vireos ‚Äì a threatened species which last nested in the San Joaquin Valley over 50 years ago. A wildlife viewing platform along Beckwith Road is a favorite location for viewing the Aleutian cackling geese along with other waterbirds from October through March. = Grasslands Wildlife Management Area = The Grasslands Wildlife Management Area (GWMA) was established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1979 and is composed of privately owned lands on which perpetual conservation easements have been purchased. These easements preserve wetland and grassland habitats and prevent conversion to croplands or other uses not compatible with migratory bird and other wildlife values. Daily management operations remain under the landowner's control. The majority of easement properties are wetlands managed for waterfowl hunting. From 1979 to-date, over have been placed under conservation easements. The GWMA is located in western Merced County, California, within the San Joaquin River basin and supports the largest remaining block of contiguous wetlands in the Central Valley. It is divided into an eastern and western division separated by the San Joaquin River. In the heart of the western division is the Grassland Resource Conservation District (GRCD), an area of of private wetlands and associated grasslands, and over of federal National Wildlife Refuges and state Wildlife Management Areas. These private wetlands constitute 30% of the remaining wetlands in California's Central Valley and are extremely important to Pacific Flyway waterfowl populations. Over 60 million duck use-day and 3 million goose use-days occur annually in the GWMA. The wetlands support diverse habitats including seasonally flooded marshlands, semi-permanent marsh, riparian habitat, wet meadows, vernal pools, native uplands, pastures, and native grasslands. This habitat diversity supports raptors, shorebirds, wading birds, and other wildlife species. Several federal and state listed, endangered, and threatened plants and animals are present in the area and benefit by the habitat protection provided by the easement program.

In the UK, it is published by Harvill Press, an imprint of Random House. Although the novel is set many years ago, it deals with what many consider to be a very current theme---that of the clash, or at least the juxtaposition, of two cultures (in this case the culture clash between English culture and Serbian culture), and the subsequent alienation of the individuals involved. It has sold over 100,000 copies in Serbia.  Summary  The novel is set in Belgrade, just before World War II, and it covers over fifty years of Serbian history. It tells the story of a young Englishwoman, Elizabeth, and Steven, a Serb who meet at University in England and fall in love. They leave England to begin a new life together in Serbia. Through Elizabeth's letters home it is revealed that she is having difficulties adapting to Serbian culture, although Steven's narrative provides a very different take on events. Their son, Mihajlo, is ashamed of his mixed parentage and rebels radically against his English roots. On the eve of the war, the family's loyalties are tested and tragedy ensues.

Biography Adams was born to William, a labourer, and Katherine Adams. He was baptized on 4 May 1700, in Woodford, Essex. His parish bound him on 1 June 1705, to serve the Hudson's Bay Company until he was 24. Around this time, Adams was sent to Fort Albany, where he received training and learned the Cree language. In 1722, Adams' pay was increased to ¬£16 per year, retroactive to 11 September 1721. He spent the 1723‚Äì24 season in England due to health issues. When Adams returned to Fort Albany to continue working at the Hudson's Bay Company, he became Joseph Myatt's deputy from 1727 to Myatt's death on 9 June 1730, after when Adams took over Myatt's position as chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company based at Fort Albany. Adams surveyed Moose River in July 1728, with the help of William Bevan, and he also located the original site of Moose Factory, Ontario. The company's London committee told Adams to establish a factory at Moose in 1730, and despite reservations about their capabilities, he sent Thomas Render and John Jewer to build the post. He was later proven correct when the men at Moose refused to work under Render, forcing Adams to personally visit Moose in October 1731, to resolve the issue. The Hudson's Bay Company eventually hired Thomas McCliesh to replace Adams on two separate occasions, in 1735 and 1736. During both times, however, McCliesh was \\"sore afflicted with ailments\\" when he arrived, and had to return to England. On 26 December 1735, the Moose factory was destroyed by fire, to which Adams responded in a written note to the company's committee: \\"We have strained ourselves to the utmost to assist them.\\" In 1737, Adams retired and was replaced at Albany by Thomas Bird. Adams died on 29 September 1737, shortly after returning to England with his three-year-old daughter Mary, whose mother was a Native Canadian. His will instructed that most of his estate be given to Mary in trust.

The federal budget included $40 billion in stimulus and $20 billion in personal income tax cuts. The Budget Implementation Act, 2009 was introduced in the House of Commons on February 6, 2009, and it received royal assent on March 12, 2009, enacting the legislative changes necessary to implement the budget. It was announced as the \\"Budget 2009: Economic Action Plan\\", with accompanying publicity. The NDP and the Bloc announced shortly following the presentation of the budget that they would not support it in its initial form, but the budget was passed on February 3, 2009, with the support of the Liberals. All MPs for the NDP and the Bloc and the six Liberal members from Newfoundland and Labrador voted against the budget. Economic crisis and parliamentary dispute Prior to the 2009 budget, on November 26, 2008, Jim Flaherty released an economic statement to which according to many experts would introduce measures to deal with a significant worldwide economic slowdown that started earlier during the year where millions of jobs were lost in several sectors across the world including thousands in Canada particularly in the auto sector in southern Ontario. While announcing that there will be no deficits in 2008‚Äì09 fiscal year, he added that any measures to deal with the economic slowdown would result in a deficit though the government that the situation in Canada compared to the other G7 countries is not as bad. He also added prior to the announcement that a \\"technical\\" recession was possible. Many economists and groups predicted significant deficits after 2009 and for a couple of years and urged Parliament to quickly adopt a stimulus package to encourage spending. Parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page had forecast a deficit of between 4 and 14 billion dollars. Flaherty announced two controversial measures including the suspension of the right to strike among government workers which previously approved a 6.8% pay hike for the next 4 years (2.3% for the first year and 1.5% for the following three). The minister also announced a significant reduction of funding of political parties resulting in election results with a lower value per vote. It had also announced the possibility of cut spending by as much as $2 billion on various programs as well as the sale of various federal properties. It has also reduced the pay raises and bonuses of several bureaucrats and politicians including the cancellation of a three percent raise for MPs and cut unnecessary traveling. The opposition parties threaten to topple the government on a non-confidence motion in relation to the economic statement. The opposition criticized the lack of immediate economic stimulus packages to help cope with the struggling economy as well as the political party subsidies cuts which the latter was reversed by the government one day later and would not be included on a bill. This led a political crisis and the subsequent suspension of the Parliament on December 3, 2008 as the opposition threaten to defeat the government on a confidence motion that was set for December 1 and later one week later before the prorogation of the House. While the budget was scheduled for the early-spring, pressure due to the economic crisis and the opposition parties forced the government to move ahead the budget set for January 27, 2008, one day after Parliament resumes. On December 20, 2008, the government announced it would spend approximately $30 billion in order to stimulate the economy while forecasting a deep deficit for a five-year period. Highlights A $33.7 billion deficit for the 2009‚Äì10 fiscal was announced during the deposition of the budget on January 27, 2009 with a projected deficit of $29.7 billion for the following year as well as additional deficits until 2013 for a total of $85 billion over five years while Flaherty also announced a $1.1 billion deficit for the end of the 2008‚Äì09 financial year. It is the first deficit announced since the 1996‚Äì97 fiscal year. $12 billion was earmarked for various new infrastructure projects including roads, internet broadband access with additional funding for renovations on aging infrastructures as well as for green infrastructure projects. $8 billion was also announced for social housing renovation projects, $1.5 billion for job training, $2.7 billion for short-term loans for the auto industry as well as various income and corporate tax cuts and tax credits up to $20 billion for individuals and $2 billion for businesses. Among the tax measures included were a new home renovation tax credit of up to $1350, the extension of the EI benefits by five weeks for the next two years as well as the increase of the basic personal amount to $10,320 before any payment of federal income tax. The government estimated that the $40 billion in economic stimulus and other measures would create close to 200 000 jobs while it forecast a one percent growth of the economy over the next two years. Reception The Liberal Party, now headed by Michael Ignatieff who replaced Dion during the prorogation of the Parliament, supported the budget but also proposed in return an amendment, which passed 214‚Äì84, The amendment would force the government to present occasional reports on the progress and costs of the budget. Both the NDP and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois opposed the budget. The Bloc cited the loss of transfer payments for the province while the NDP cited a lack of funding for the vulnerable and also criticized the infrastructure funding as well as pay-equity reforms introduced in November. Six Liberal MPs from Newfoundland and Labrador also expressed opposition to the budget citing that the province would lose up to $1.6 billion in transfer payments as it no longer collects equalization. Ignatieff permitted his members to vote against his party lines. The budget passed 211 to 91. Among popular opinion, a Strategic Council poll indicated that 62% of Canadians were in favour of the budget against 38% who were not in favour while Canadians were split on whether the government failed the economy in Canada.  Areas of direction  Some of the key items in the Economic Action Plan budget were: * $12 billion in new infrastructure stimulus funding for roads, bridges, broadband internet access, electronic health records, laboratories and border crossings across the country. * $20 billion in personal income tax relief * $7.8 billion to build quality housing, stimulate construction and enhance energy efficiency. *Increasing the basic personal amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax. *Raising the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets by 7.5 per cent

It was completed in 1998 as the tallest and highest bridge in Lebanon and the Middle East but this has since been surpassed. The bridge was built as part of Rafik Hariri's vision of rebuilding and developing Lebanon and its infrastructure. The bridge served as a connecting route for the Beirut-Damascus Highway aiming to improve the main road that links Syria's capital city Damascus, to Lebanon and its capital city Beirut.  Destruction  On the 12th of July during the 2006 Lebanon-Israel conflict the Israeli Air force bombed the Mudeirej Bridge causing partial damage to its base and pillars, and critical damage to the road it uplifted. The destruction of the bridge which was a symbol of Lebanese architectural pride was considered by many in Lebanon to be unjustified because of the perceived low strategic value to the bridge in Israeli's conflict with Hezbollah. According to one observer of the bombing, ‚ÄúThe bombing of this bridge, which is the pride of the Lebanese people, clearly proves that Israel is committed to destroying the infrastructure of the whole country. This bridge is not used by Hezbollah since it lies in a mountain resort area of Mount Lebanon, far away from the south of Lebanon.\\" In 2007, USAID announced that it would be involved in an extensive reconstruction of the bridgehttps://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/us-government-announces-award- reconstruction-30-million-bridge-project-lebanon, due to Lebanon's political victory which put Israel and the United States in an awkward position in regards to the destruction and reconstruction of the bridge.

It emerged as the leading voice of anti-colonialism and Pan-Africanism in the United States and internationally before Cold War anti-communism and liberalism created too much strife among members; the organization split in 1955.Duberman, Martin, \\"The Apex of Fame\\", Paul Robeson, 1989, pp. 284‚Äì285. The split was also precipitated by co-founder Max Yergan's abandonment of left-wing politics; he advocated colonial rule in Africa. Founding members Paul Robeson served as the CAA's chairman for most of its existence while W. E. B. Du Bois served as vice-chair and head of the Africa Aid Committee. Activist Max Yergan, who taught at the City College of New York (until 1941), was its first Executive Director. Alphaeus Hunton Jr. (1903‚Äì1970), an assistant professor in the English and Romance Languages department at Howard University, joined the CAA in 1943 as its Educational Director. He was appointed as its Executive Director, after Yergan resigned. Hunton was also the editor of the CAA publication, New Africa. He was the primary force behind much of the CAA's activity and vision through the early 1950s.Johanna Selles, \\"The Hunton Family: A Narrative of Faith through Generations\\" (pdf), Religious Education. Other pioneer members of the ICAA were Raymond Leslie Buell and Ralph J. Bunche. The CAA, from its beginning in 1941, received the support of mainstream activists and liberal intellectuals such as anthropologist Franz Boas, historian E. Franklin Frazier, record producer John H. Hammond, Mary McLeod Bethune (from the National Youth Administration) and Rayford Logan.Anthony, David Henry: Max Yergan: Race Man, Internationalist, Cold Warrior, NYU Press, 2006, p. 212. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveilled CAA's founding members as early as 1942. The CAA's main donor was Frederick Vanderbilt Field. Goals and message The Council on African Affairs articulated and promoted a fundamental connection between the struggle of African Americans and the destiny of colonized peoples in Africa, Asia and elsewhere in the world. Among a host of other campaigns, it lobbied the federal government and the United Nations and lent material support on behalf of Indian independence, striking trade unionists in Nigeria, and African famine relief. It publicized the connections between these campaigns and its larger critique of colonialism and capitalism via its monthly bulletin New Africa. The CAA's most significant work took place in relation to South Africa. It supported striking black miners and helped direct worldwide attention to the African National Congress's struggle against the Union of South Africa government and its policy of imposing racial apartheid.  South Africa Uncensored (1951)  In 1951, the Council produced a half-hour agitprop documentary film about apartheid in South Africa, narrated by Paul Robeson and edited by Hortense Beveridge. The only-known copy of the film, South Africa Uncensored, is part of the Pearl Bowser Collection (2012.79.1.5.1a) was preserved by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (available for stream via museum website). Reaction to United Nations Conference 1945 Members of the CAA were hopeful that following World War II, when Western powers adopted new resolutions on the issue of colonialism, that they would encourage Third World independence under the trusteeship of the United Nations.Duberman, Martin, \\"Postwar Politics\\", Paul Robeson, 1989, pp. 296‚Äì297. To the CAA's dismay, the United States introduced a series of proposals at the April‚ÄìMay 1945 conference that set no clear limits on the length of colonialist occupation and no motions toward allowing territorial possessions to move toward self-government. Cold War The Council on African Affairs advocated an internationalization of domestic civil rights, support for African liberation groups, and a non- aligned stance on the part of developing nations toward the Cold War superpowers. Combined with many CAA leaders' past and current associations with the Communist Party USA, this position became politically untenable by the early 1950s. The House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC) put great pressure on communist-affiliated organizations and activists. Liberal supporters abandoned the CAA and the federal government cracked down on its operations. In 1953, the CAA was charged with subversion under the McCarran Act. Its principal leaders, including Robeson, Du Bois, and Hunton, were subjected to harassment, indictments, and in the case of Hunton, six months' imprisonment. Under the weight of internal disputes, government repression, and financial hardships, the Council on African Affairs disbanded in 1955. The United States government considered advocacy for the liberation of colonialist Africa as a \\"Communist cause\\" and therefore contrary to national interests during the Cold War.Robeson, Susan, \\"The Pinnacle of Fame and Fortune\\", A Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson: The Whole World in His Hands, 1981, p. 118. Following Joseph Stalin's excesses in the Soviet Union of murdering and repressing millions, and other problems in the Communist world, Max Yergan had become disillusioned with Communism and spoke out against it. In 1952, he spoke against Communism on a visit to South Africa. In 1964, he praised aspects of the South African government's \\"separate development\\" plan under apartheid. In the last decade of life, he co-chaired the conservative American-African Affairs Association.\\"Max Yergan\\", South African History Online.

The company is privately owned and headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Love's ranked No. 17 on the 2019 Forbes list of America's largest private companies. Love's has two primary kinds of stores: country stores and travel stops. Country stores are fueling stations with a convenience store attached.

Love's had 25,000 employees in 2018.  History  In 1964, Tom and Judy Love spent $5,000 to lease an abandoned service station in Watonga, Oklahoma, an hour northwest of Oklahoma City. They named their company Musket Corporation. Over the next eight years, Musket opened 40 additional gas stations. All of them operated under the Kerr-McGee gasoline brand. When the fuel crunch of the early 1970s began and gasoline was in short supply in the United States, Tom Love diversified for the sake of the company's success. He launched a new concept in Watonga: the \\"Mini Stop Country Store\\". By adding a grocery line to their self-service fuel sales, Musket became one of the nation's first to offer one-stop shopping for travelers. The Mini Stop was successful and the company quickly opened more stores in western Oklahoma. In 1972, Musket set out to convert all of its locations from gas stations to convenience stores with self-serve gasoline. By 1973, the company began using the family name to identify its locations. Love's Country Stores was the new name. By 1978, Love's Country Stores had 60 locations in small communities throughout Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. That year, the company began offering the Fresh Daily Deli, sandwiches made fresh daily on- location. Food service became the company's third profit center in each location, along with self-serve gasoline and convenience store items. The Fresh Daily Deli is branded today as Love's Subs. By the end of 1981, the company reached a milestone with 100 Love's Country Stores locations in operation. The in-store decor was changed from the previous dark country look to a brighter theme. The same year, it opened the first Love's Travel Stop on Interstate 40 in Amarillo, Texas. The travel stop opened a new target audience to Love's business; the addition of self-serve diesel fuel brought professional drivers to Love's. The Travel Stop was unique in that it served both the professional driver and the motoring public, resulting in more growth for Love's. In 1985, Love's added gifts and novelties. Then in 1993, Taco Bell became a partner, opening a co-branded location in Oklahoma City. The success of this partnership quickly grew. In 1995, the company opened its first triple-branded food service operation in El Paso, Texas. The location offered Subway, Taco Bell Express and Pizza Hut. In the late 1990s, food service continued to grow. Soon the company was partnering with an array of co-branded restaurant concepts, including Arby's, Baskin Robbins, Bojangles', Burger King, Carl's Jr., Chester's, Dairy Queen, Del Taco, Denny's, Dunkin' Donuts, Godfather's Pizza, Green Burrito, Hardee's, IHOP Express, McDonald's, Sonic, Subway, Taco Bell, Taco John's and Wendy's. Love's Travel StopIn 2000, Sales & Marketing Executives International awarded Love's the 2000 Outlook Award, for innovation and outstanding contribution to the future of the convenience store industry. The first truck tire care location opened in 2008, and since then, the business has grown into a nationwide network of centers, offering tires, equipment, light mechanical work, oil changes and roadside service. On June 30, 2010, Love's acquired 20 Pilot Travel Centers locations and six Flying J locations out of antitrust concerns in order for the Federal Trade Commission to approve the Pilot/Flying J merger. In June 2017, Love's opened its first location in Montana, its 41st state of operation. At the time, Love's operated more than 430 stores. Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores entered into an agreement with the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Oklahoma City Thunder on March 15, 2019.

Accessed 19 August 2015. It opened for service in July 2003, with a construction cost of $10 million. Service ended on 27 September 2015 due to major construction projects that would result in the demolition of a portion of the route. In March 2016 development plans for the port were announced which would include resumption of service on the Waterfront Red Car Line. Route The line used vintage and replica Pacific Electric Red Cars. The route ran south over a former Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way from the World Cruise Centre cruise ship terminal under the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the intersection of 22nd Street and Miner Street, with intermediate stops at Downtown San Pedro, the Maritime Museum, and the Ports O' Call Village.SanPedro.com: POLA Waterfront Red Car Line - with map RailwayPreservation.com: Port of LA Waterfront Red Car Line . accessed 19 August 2015. The service operated three days a week (Friday-Sunday) with occasional service on other weekdays depending on passenger ship landings. History The Pacific Electric Railway Red Car system operated for over 60 years (closed 1961), with more than of tramway routes throughout Greater Los Angeles and the surrounding cities and counties. Before the line closed, the Waterfront Red Cars comprised three tram cars in the style of the originals. Two of the three Red Cars‚Äîthe replica cars, numbers 500 and 501 ‚Äî were built from scratch by employees of the port of Los Angeles; the interiors are cooled using the same clerestory-style windows as the original 500-class Red Cars (‚ÄúThe Fives‚Äù). The third car, No. #1058, was a vintage Pacific Electric 950-class car, having been assembled from two wrecked 950-class cars by Richard J. Fellows, restored for parades, movies, and the like, and then cleverly converted to be steered with the original throttle as a tiller and braked by the original brake handle; the original dead man pedal operated the gasoline engine throttle, which powered the rubber tires. The Port of Los Angeles bought the car and converted it back for rail operation as a charter service. The Waterfront Red Cars were supplemented by two shuttle bus lines. The Blue line serves downtown San Pedro and Ports O' Call village, whereas the Green line serves the harbor and marina. The replica cars will be reused again when the line reopens, but they must be modified to run on light rail tracks. Whether the original car will be brought back to service is unknown, though it will most probably be retired. =Shutdown and future= Future extensions to Cabrillo Beach, Harbour Park, the new cruise ship terminal at Berth 46, Pacific Avenue, and Warehouse 1 were initially under consideration. In April 2010, a new feasibility report was released, with the first priority to switch much of the existing line to street-running tramway track on Sampson Way. In 2015 it was announced the Waterfront Red Car Line would be closed for 18 months, with service ceasing in late September 2015, to make way for the realignment of Sampson Way leading into Ports O‚Äô Call Village. Because the street realignment cuts through the southern part of the line, it would require a new track and modified, street-level cars running parallel to the new Sampson Way, estimated to cost $40 million. Port officials eventually concluded that such reconstruction would be cost prohibitive. Waterfront Red Car Line service ended on 27 September 2015. However development plans for San Pedro's Ports O' Call were announced in March 2016 that included the resumption of Waterfront Red Car service; no date for the restoration of the Red Cars was included in the announcement.

Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127 (1948), is a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that a facially trivial implementation of a natural principle or phenomenon of nature is not eligible for a patent.. Factual background Leguminous plants are able to take nitrogen from the air and fix it in the plant for conversion to organic nitrogenous compounds. The ability of these plants to fix nitrogen from the air depends on the presence of bacteria that infect the roots of the plant and form nodules on them. These bacteria include six species of the genus Rhizobium. No one species works with all species of leguminous plants, but each works with different groups of those plants.For example, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii works with clover; Sinorhizobium meliloti works with alfalfa; and Bradyrhizobium japonicum works with soybeans. Moreover, different species of Rhizobia bacteria produce an inhibitory effect on each other when mixed. These bacteria have long been packaged for sale to and use by farmers in the inoculation of the seeds of leguminous plants, with each package containing only one species of root nodule bacteria, to avoid the mutual inhibition effect. The packaged inoculant could therefore be used successfully only in plants of the particular group corresponding to this bacterial species. Thus, if a farmer had crops of clover, alfalfa, and soybeans, he would have to use three separate inoculants. The patentee discovered that there are strains of each species of root nodule bacteria which do not exert a mutually inhibitive effect on each other. Thus, he was able to provide a mixed culture of Rhizobia capable of inoculating plants belonging to several groups. Kalo exploited the claimed invention by selling multi-purpose packages containing a mixture of different species of Rhizobia suitable for different plants. Funk infringed by selling similar packages and Kalo sued for patent infringement. While the patent had claims both to the method of producing a multi-purpose inoculant by mixing together mutually non- inhibitive strains of Rhizobia and to the inoculant product comprising a mixture of mutually non-inhibitive strains of Rhizobia, the case before the Court involved only the product claims. Supreme Court opinion The majority opinion (per Justice Douglas) held that the properties of inhibition or of noninhibition in the bacteria were ‚Äúthe work of nature.,‚Äù and therefore not subject to being patented. ‚Äú[P]atents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature.‚Äù The Court added: > The qualities of these bacteria, like the heat of the sun, electricity, or > the qualities of metals, are part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men. > They are manifestations of laws of nature, free to all men and reserved > exclusively to none. He who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of > nature has no claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognizes. If there > is to be invention from such a discovery, it must come from the application > of the law of nature to a new and useful end. The court of appeals thought that packaging the non-inhibitory strains together went beyond the discovery of a phenomenon of nature and conferred patentability, because a ‚Äúnew and different composition of noninhibitive strains‚Ä¶contributed utility and economy to the manufacture and distribution of commercial inoculants.‚Äù But the Supreme Court disagreed, and reversed, because the ‚Äúaggregation of species fell short of invention within the meaning of the patent statutes.‚Äù The Court explained: > The aggregation of select strains of the several species into one product is > an application of that newly discovered natural principle. But however > ingenious the discovery of that natural principle may have been, the > application of it is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the > inoculants. Each of the species of root nodule bacteria contained in the > package infects the same group of leguminous plants which it always > infected. No species acquires a different use. The combination of species > produces no new bacteria, no change in the six species of bacteria, and no > enlargement of the range of their utility. Each species has the same effect > it always had. The bacteria perform in their natural way. Their use in > combination does not improve in any way their natural functioning. They > serve the ends nature originally provided, and act quite independently of > any effort of the patentee. > > ‚Ä¶ The application of this newly discovered natural principle to the problem > of packaging of inoculants may well have been an important commercial > advance. But once nature's secret of the noninhibitive quality of certain > strains of the species of Rhizobium was discovered, the state of the art > made the production of a mixed inoculant a simple step. Even though it may > have been the product of skill, it certainly was not the product of > invention. There is no way in which we could call it such unless we borrowed > invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself. That is to > say, there is no invention here unless the discovery that certain strains of > the several species of these bacteria are noninhibitive, and may thus be > safely mixed, is invention. But we cannot so hold without allowing a patent > to issue on one of the ancient secrets of nature now disclosed. > > ‚Ä¶ Since we conclude that the product claims do not disclose an invention or > discovery within the meaning of the patent statutes, we do not consider > whether the other statutory requirements‚Ä¶are satisfied. Rationale and subsequent developments The Court decided this case under the patent statute in effect before the 1952 recodification, which distinguished obviousness from \\"invention.\\" It is therefore not certain from the language used whether the Court held that the claimed invention was too obvious to justify a patent or, as appears more likely, that when the discovery of a phenomenon of nature is implemented in a facially trivial manner, the subject matter is not patent-eligible. However, on the basis of how subsequent Supreme Court opinions, such as Gottschalk v. Benson. and Parker v. Flook,. treat Funk, it appears that the opinion is one on patent- eligibility. A lower court opinion illustrating the application of the doctrine of the Funk case is Armour Pharmaceutical Co. v. Richardson Merrell, Inc. In that case, the patentee desired to administer trypsin orally for use as an anti-inflammatory. He discovered that trypsin could be absorbed effectively in the lower small intestine (ileum). However, stomach acids destroyed trypsin. The patentee proposed and claimed coating trypsin with an enteric coating (stomach-acid-resistant coating), which permitted the trypsin to pass through the stomach to the small intestine without damage to be absorbed and then, it would act as an anti-inflammatory or analgesic. However, the enteric coating expedient was already known for other products. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit invalidated the patent on the basis of Funk: > Our reading of the Supreme Court's opinion in Funk leads us to conclude that > the test of patentability of a natural phenomenon is as follows: Would an > artisan, knowing the newly discovered natural phenomenon require more than > ordinary skill to discover the process by which to apply that phenomenon as > the patentee had done? Once nature's secret that the ileum would absorb > trypsin was uncovered, any artisan would have known the process of > enterically coating the trypsin to enable it to pass through the acidic > environment of the stomach and continue into the ileum.... [The inventor‚Äôs] > application of that newly discovered principle would itself have to be > inventive in order to sustain [the] patent.396 F.2d at 74. Thus, the court held that according to Funk the manner of implementation of a natural principle must itself be patentable, as Parker v. Flook subsequently held.Other lower court cases stating so are National Lead Co. v. Western Lead Co., 324 F.2d 539 (9th Cir. 1963); Davison Chem. Corp. v. Joliet Chems., Inc., 179 F.2d 793 (7th Cir. 1950);  References External links * 1948 in United States case law United States patent case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Vinson Court Rhizobiales Seed companies ","title":"Funk Bros.

The airfield was abandoned after the war. History :See Also: Battle of Midway, Henderson Field (Midway Atoll), Lofton R. Henderson The Midway Islands are best known as the location of the pivotal battle of the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Henderson Field was built in 1941. It consisted of a seaplane facility on Sand Island and a landplane airfield on Eastern Island. The Eastern Island airfield initially comprised three runways, 2 hangars & a barracks. Midway was shelled by a Japanese destroyer on the same day as the Pearl Harbor attack, and was shelled by a submarine several months later. During the climactic Battle of Midway in 1942, the Japanese were so sure of their victory that they deliberately spared the runways of Eastern Island for their use after the capture of the island. That didn't happen, due to their overwhelming defeat in the waters surrounding Midway. Aircraft of the Navy, Marine Corps & Army operated from Eastern Island, and helped to turn back the Japanese Fleet. The Marine Corps had nineteen SBD-2 Dauntless dive-bombers, seven F4F-3 Wildcat, seventeen SB2U-3 Vindicators, twenty-one F2A-3 Brewster Buffalos and six TBF-1 Avenger torpedo-bombers. B-17E of the 72d Bomb Squadron, 5th Bomb Group which took part in the Battle of Midway, 1942 First Lieutenant James Muri's aircrew and its USAAF B-26A which made torpedo-attack on Nagumo's carriers in early morning 4 June during the Battle of Midway, June 1942. 1st. Lt. Muri is second from left, in the front row. Eight B-17E Flying Fortresses of the 431st Bombardment Squadron (11th Bombardment Group) were deployed to Midway on 29 May 1942 and were joined by nine more the next day from the 42d Bombardment Squadron along with five B-26 Marauders (three from the 19th Bombardment Squadron (22d Bombardment Group) that were in Hawaii and two from the 69th Bombardment Squadron (38th Bombardment Group)). The Marauders were equipped to drop torpedoes and were under the command of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific. In addition, B-17Es of the 3d and 72d Bombardment Squadrons (5th Bombardment Group) were sent to Midway in preparation for the battle. No aircraft based on Midway scored any hits on enemy ships during the battle. Because of the threat of a dawn attack on Midway, searching planes were sent out as early as possible each day - usually about 04:15. To safeguard them from destruction on the ground and to have the striking force instantly available, the B-17's took off immediately afterwards. They remained in the air for about 4 hours, by which time the progress of the search and the reduction of their fuel load made it safe for them to land. The four B-26's, the six TBF's, and other planes remained on the ground but fully alert until the search had reached a distance of . Nimitz believed that the enemy planned a rendezvous about west of Midway and ordered that this area be searched by B-17's on 31 May and 1 June, if possible. This was done with negative results. On 2 June a B-17 without bombs searched to the west without making any contacts. These searches were conducted in part by two groups of six B-17's flown in from Hawaii on 30 and 31 May, respectively. Consequently, their crews were in the air about 30 hours in the 2 days before actual combat, and, in addition, serviced their own planes. On 3 June the usual search was made. At 12:30 9 B-17Es left Midway in search of the Japanese invasion fleet, which had been sighted by a PBY an hour earlier only away, and was ordered to attack this \\"main body.\\" This Japanese force, consisting of 2 or 3 heavy cruisers and about 30 other ships, including destroyers, transports, and cargo vessels, had evidently been moving toward Midway since the morning contact. At 16:25 the fleet of 26 ships was spotted from the island. Six B-17Es of the 431st, along with three B-17Es from the 31st, attacked in three flights of three from altitudes of , , and respectively. On the night of 3 June, an additional seven B-17Es from the 42d Bomb Squadron arrived on Midway to reinforce the heavy bomber contingent. At 04:15, 14 B-17s left Midway shortly after the patrol planes had been sent out. They were proceeding to the west to attack the enemy forces sighted the preceding day when a message was received in plain language telling of the discovery of the enemy carrier task force on bearing 325¬∞ from Midway. Climbing to , the Fortresses changed course to find the carriers. The enemy force was located at 07:32, but the carriers, circling under a cloud formation, were not found until 08:10. The B-17's had skirted the fleet and approached from the northwest; i. e., from the stern of the targets. They attacked by flights, two elements concentrating on each of two carriers and a single element on a third. Antiaircraft fire was heavy and found the altitude, but was generally behind. The Japanese fighters did not dare press home their attacks, which were ineffectual. In addition to the B-17 attacks, at 07:05 the B-26's attacked through heavy fighter defense and flak with no fighter support of their own. The Marauders were equipped with external torpedo racks underneath the keel of the aircraft. The torpedo runs began at altitude, the B-26s then dropping down to only above the water under heavy attack from Japanese fighters. Two of the Marauders were lost in this action, and the other two were heavily damaged. No hits were made on the Japanese carriers. The B-26 was much too large an aircraft for this type of attack. A second group of eight B-17Es launched from Midway on 5 June attacked a Japanese task force from the island and claimed hits on two large warships. A third group of six B-17s claimed hits on a heavy cruiser from Midway. The last strike made by Seventh Air Force aircraft in the Battle of Midway was by five B-17Es attacking a heavy cruiser from Midway, in which one B-17 was shot down, although all of the crew but one was rescued. Another B-17 was lost due to running out of fuel. Between 3 and 5 June, Fifth Air Force B-17s flew 16 attacks totaling 55 sorties from Midway. However, eventually it was determined that none of the heavy bombers actually hit a target. The B-17's were far more suited to high altitude bombing, hitting stationary ground targets, not maritime bombing, attempting to hit moving targets. =After the battle= After the Battle of Midway, the airfield on Sand Island was named in honor of Major Lofton R. Henderson, who perished in the battle. The airfield on Eastern Island was abandoned after the war. The P-40 Warhawk-equipped 73d Fighter Squadron (18th Fighter Group) was assigned to Henderson Field after the battle to provide air defense. It remained until January 1943 when it returned to Hawaii. =Henderson Field today= Eastern Island has been abandoned since 1970. Today, the original runways, bunkers and other wartime remnants still stand. Bomb craters and long strings of strafing bullet marks from Japanese Zero fighter aircraft still stitch across runway aprons and building faces, evidence that Japan brought the battle onto Midway's shores. No buildings remain on Eastern Island. Verbesina encelioides (Golden crownbeard flower) has about taken over all of it. The runways, although declared a National Historic Treasure, are not maintained. The only building on Eastern Island is an outdoor john built by Fish and Wildlife Service. The seawalls have been taken down, allowing for substantial erosion. The island is desolate with no trees. See also * USAAF in the Central Pacific References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

The house is a unique example of the Vienna Secession movement, making it unusual during a time when other fraternity houses were being designed with Classical Revival and other period revival architectural styles. The architect, Carl Stravs, used Vienna Secession features such as the overhanging roof slab with a rounded edge, pentagonal window openings on the ground floor, and decorations integrated with the main concrete structure. The living room on the first floor has a stone fireplace on the west wall, which Stravs called, \\"the center of all the social life in the fraternity house\\". The fireplace is built in rusticated limestone said to be salvaged from the University's Old Main building, which was destroyed by a fire in 1904. The wall has niches housing the busts of Greek philosophers, which were also reportedly salvaged from Old Main. Stravs used reinforced concrete to provide fireproof construction. He also did this in accordance with his design principle for the building, which was, \\"to provide the most economical, simple and substantial rooming for the use of the junior members of the fraternity, with the least amount of space wasted.\\" Thus, the heavy concrete piers and columns in the by living room are designed simply, without much ornamentation. The second and third floors each contained five bedrooms, with shared bathroom facilities. The Phi Gamma Delta chapter house, like many other fraternities adjacent to the U of M campus, is part of a \\"fraternity row\\" along University Avenue, and was part of a first wave of fraternity house construction between 1900 and 1917. Most of these houses featured prominent entries, with a porch or terrace, and had large living rooms and chapter meeting rooms on the first floor. Individual students usually had rooms on the second and third floors of these houses. The Phi Gamma Delta chapter house, besides being listed on the National Register, is part of the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission's University of Minnesota Greek Letter Chapter House Historic District. See also The List of Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Minnesota for further information on Phi Gamma Delta's historical building, and other iconic styles represented on the University of Minnesota campus.

The wife of IMRO leader Ivan Mihailov, she is known for assassinating IMRO left-wing activist Todor Panitsa. Karnicheva was born in Kru≈°evo in Ottoman- ruled Macedonia (today in North Macedonia) to a Bulgarophile Aromanian family, with her great-grandfather being a Bulgarian priest. Her father worked in Sofia and Tsaribrod. Upon the crushing of the 1903 Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising, Mencha and her mother moved to Bulgaria. In September 1918 she went to study in Munich, but returned to Bulgaria after the end of World War I. Karnicheva joined the female Macedonian movement in Bulgaria and was part of Todor Panitsa's circle. She gradually got to be disappointed by his leftist views that advocated Comintern ties and collaboration with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, acts she believed would be fatal to the Bulgarian population of Macedonia. Karnicheva reoriented to IMRO's right wing; she joined the organisation on 15 March 1924 and took an independent decision to assassinate Panitsa, who was alleged by IMRO to have ordered the assassinations of Boris Sarafov and Ivan Garvanov and to have served foreign interests. On 8 May 1925, Karnicheva assassinated Panitsa in Vienna's Burgtheater. The assassination was widely publicized across Europe. Mencha was arrested; her first words after the assassination were \\"He was a bad Macedonian\\". After a trial, Mencha was sentenced to eight years in prison, a minimum sentence by Austrian law that took her worsening health in consideration. Austria's Supreme Court declared her incapable of serving that sentence due to tuberculosis, kidney problems and rheumatism that she had suffered from since childhood; in late 1925, she was released and expelled from Austria. Following her acquittal in court in Yugoslavia over her involvement in the IMRO, on 25 December 1926 Karnicheva returned to Bulgaria and married IMRO leader Ivan (Vanche) Mihailov, with whom she lived in exile in Turkey, Poland and Hungary after 1934. In May 1941 they settled in Zagreb, capital of the Nazi Germany puppet Independent State of Croatia; in 1944, they briefly lived in German-occupied Skopje. From 1945 to her death in 1964, she lived with Mihailov in Rome, Italy.

Operationally, a ninth tropical storm was believed to have existed over the Dominican Republic on November 26, but HURDAT - the official Atlantic hurricane database - now excludes this system. The first system, Tropical Storm One, was initially observed on August 5. The final storm, Hurricane Eight, was last observed on October 22. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At two points during the season, pairs of tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Four of the cyclones only have a single known point in their tracks due to a sparsity of data, so storm summaries for those systems are unavailable. Of the season's eight tropical cyclones, four reached hurricane status. Furthermore, two of those four strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category 4 strength with 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. With a minimum barometric pressure of , it was the most intense tropical cyclone recorded in the Atlantic basin until the 1924 Cuba hurricane. The hurricane caused 40 fatalities after a brig went missing off the coast of North Carolina. Despite remaining offshore, Tropical Storm Five brought very strong winds to the Mexican city of Veracruz. Hurricane Eight brought strong winds and rough seas to North Florida and Georgia, causing significant damage in the latter. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1853 till:01/11/1853 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1853 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:05/08/1853 till:05/08/1853 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:10/08/1853 till:10/08/1853 color:TS text:\\"Two (TS)\\" from:30/08/1853 till:10/09/1853 color:C4 text:\\"Three (C4)\\" from:08/09/1853 till:10/09/1853 color:C3 text:\\"Four (C3)\\" from:21/09/1853 till:21/09/1853 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" from:26/09/1853 till:01/10/1853 color:C1 text:\\"Six (C1)\\" from:28/09/1853 till:28/09/1853 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" barset:break from:19/10/1853 till:22/10/1853 color:C2 text:\\"Eight (C2)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1853 till:01/09/1853 text:August from:01/09/1853 till:01/10/1853 text:September from:01/10/1853 till:01/11/1853 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems=Hurricane Three= Meteorologist William C. Redfield first observed the season's third tropical storm south of Cape Verde on August 30, which was the first Cape Verde-type hurricane ever recorded. Initially, the storm moved west-northwestward and gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on September 1. Over the next two days, the hurricane intensified significantly and reached Category 2 strength early on September 2. The system strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane by September 3, attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of was recorded by the barque Hermann soon thereafter. It was the most intense storm in the Atlantic until the 1924 Cuba hurricane, a Category 5 hurricane with a minimum pressure of . The Great Havana Hurricane of 1846 may have been stronger, though it is discounted because HURDAT records did not begin until the 1851 season. By September 5, the hurricane curved toward the northwest and began to weaken. Early on September 7, it turned northward and fell to Category 3 intensity, situated about east of Charleston, South Carolina. The hurricane passed offshore North Carolina later that day, and its outer rainbands produced heavy rainfall along the state's southern coastlines. The brig Albermarle was lost at sea on September 7 with 40 of its crewmen missing; they were later presumed to have drowned. The hurricane recurved east-northeastward and continued to deteriorate steadily, weakening to Category 1 status by September 9. The storm was last observed late on September 10, centered about north-northwest of Flores Island in the Azores. =Hurricane Four= The ship Gilbert Gallatin encountered the fourth hurricane of the season on September 8, which was centered about east of the third hurricane. Sustained winds were initially observed to have reached 115 mph (185 km/h), indicative of a Category 3 hurricane. Several other ships reportedly encountered this storm as it tracked northeastward. With winds decreasing to 105 mph (165 km/h), it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on September 10. The storm was last noted by the ship Josephine later that day, while located about north-northeast of Graciosa in the Azores. =Hurricane Six= The sixth hurricane of the season was first observed as a tropical storm to the southeast of Bermuda on September 26. Initially, the storm headed north-northwestward, before curving north- northeastward on September 27, while bypassing Bermuda. Later that day, the storm strengthened into a hurricane. The brig Samuel and Edward encountered the hurricane on September 2, reporting winds of 80 mph (130 km/h); this was the maximum sustained wind speed associated with the storm. Thereafter, the storm executed a cyclonic loop, which lasted until September 30. It curved northeastward on October 1 and was last noted at 0600 UTC, while located about northeast of Bermuda. =Hurricane Eight= The barque Edward reported a hurricane about north of Grand Bahama on October 19. Several other ships encountered the storm between October 19 and October 20. It moved slowly north-northwestward and gradually strengthened. On October 20, the storm reached maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. Additionally, ships reported a minimum barometric pressure of . After weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane on October 21, the storm veered east-northeastward, avoiding a landfall in the Southeastern United States. It was last noted on October 22, while centered about east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. Strong winds, combined with tides in Jacksonville, Florida, pushed water over wharfs and onto Bay Street. William Gaston Captain Thomas E. Shaw reported that the gale at Brunswick, Georgia caused significant damage to the town. An engine-house belonging to the Brunswick Railroad Company was flattened, as was a large cotton shed, a blacksmith shop, and a new frame house, and a number of other buildings were damaged. The new railroad wharf was washed away and its remains were floating in the harbor. Offshore, there were numerous shipwrecks, including the schooners W. Mercer, G. W. Pickering, Mary Ann, and the Steamer Planter. Additionally, the schooner James House reported \\"a perfect hurricane\\". =Other systems= In addition to the four tropical cyclones of the season, there were four others with only a single point on their track, due to the sparsity of data. The barque W.B. Bowen encountered a gale with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) near 33.5¬∞N, 69.2¬∞W on August 5, which is located about east of Bermuda. This system would later be listed in HURDAT records as Tropical Storm One. However, due to heavy prevailing weather, further data on this storm is unavailable. A publication by meteorologist Ivan R. Tannehill indicates that Tropical Storm Two was centered near Barbados on August 10. However, due its weak nature - maximum sustained winds were only 45 mph (75 km/h) - only a single data point is known of the storm's path. Tropical Storm Five was reported to have existed on September 21 at 20¬∞N, 95¬∞W, which is located in the Bay of Campeche. The Elize and Crichton encountered a heavy \\"norther\\" upon arriving at Veracruz, Veracruz on that day. Although it was centered offshore, very strong winds were reported in Veracruz, possibly induced by the funneling effect from the Sierra Madre Oriental. Further information of this tropical storm is sparse. Two separate reports by meteorologists Ivan R. Tannehill and Edward B. Garriott indicate that the seventh tropical storm of the season existed at 15¬∞N, 37¬∞W on September 28, which is located west of Cape Verde. Observations noted that maximum sustained winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h). With only a single data point, no further information is available on this storm.

From the experiences of childhood in the Great Depression, trips as a teenager in the Panamanian Merchant Marines, national- class boxing, the awe-inspiring sights of selfless sacrifice on Iwo Jima, and finally, fifteen years in overseas ideological warfare, Humphrey observed that universal values exist and, ultimately control human behavior. Humphrey is a graduate of Wisconsin University, Harvard Law School, and the Fletcher School of Diplomacy. At the beginning of the Cold War, he left a teaching position at MIT to help lead the struggle against Communism. Finding that U.S. education was contributing to, rather than reducing, American overseas problems, he developed a new leadership approach that overcame Ugly American syndrome among hundreds of thousands in crucial Third World areas. More recently, his methodology won commendations for educating the alleged uneducable: Mexican- American street-gang youths in southern California, and Canadian Native teenage dropouts. Until Communism's fall, Humphrey kept his new methods confidential. Those methods are significant: (1) From his experiences with young infantrymen in heavy combat, and with the peasants in many villages of the world, he perceived humankind's basic goodness that philosophers have missed or under-rated.

He also used the pseudonyms Fritz von der Kyrburg and Fritz Wernthal. Life Fritz Oswald Bilse, around 1905 Fritz Oswald Bilse was born in Kirn (present-day Rhineland- Palatinate, then Prussian Rhine Province), the son of a schoolteacher, and grew up in the towns of Kirn and Eisenach. He joined the Prussian army in 1896 and in 1900 was posted with the 16. Train-Bataillon at Forbach in Lorraine. He rose to instant notoriety with his novel Aus einer kleinen Garnison. Ein milit√§risches Zeitbild (1903). In later editions, he used the pseudonym \\"Fritz von der Kyrburg\\", after his home town's most prominent landmark, the Kyrburg castle. The book, in which Bilse satirizes the manners of the Forbach garrison and of the Prussian army in general, became a succ√®s de scandale and was soon reprinted many times. Bilse's criticism, however, was so sharp, and the location and protagonists so little disguised, that several officers who felt their honour to be under attack prosecuted Bilse in a court-martial, the trial taking place at Metz from 9. to 13. November 1903. Bilse was found guilty of defamation of character, was discharged from the army dishonourably, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. His novel was (temporarily) banned.Details concerning the novel and the scandal can be found in: R. Reissm√ºller, \\"'Aus einer kleinen Garnison'. Der Roman des Leutnants Bilse aus dem Jahre 1903. Aktuelle Wirkung und sp√§te Folgen einer fr√ºhen Wilhelminismus- Kritik\\", in: Imprimatur 10 (1982); Hartwig Stein, \\"Der Bilse-Skandal von 1903.

The scandal only served to enhance Bilse's celebrity. He was henceforth described as the German army's enfant terrible; the novel became popular abroad, especially in France, where the label interdit en Allemagne was recognized as a badge of quality. Translations soon appeared, into French and also into English, the latter appearing in 1904 containing a detailed account of the court-martial and a foreword by the German-American author Theodore Dreiser, who praised Bilse as a great realist.Fritz Oswald Bilse, Life In A Garrison Town; the military novel suppressed by the German Government, by Lieutenant Bilse. The authorized translation of \\"Aus einer kleinen Garnison.\\" With a foreword by Theodore Dreiser, an introduction by Arnold White, and a summary of the court-martial (London: John Lane & Co., 1904). The book was also translated into other languages, e.g. into Dutch and Russian. Thomas Mann referred to Bilse and his novel when he found himself subjected to a \\"trial by press\\" (\\"Pre√üproze√ü\\") in his home town of L√ºbeck, a fictionalized description of which he had published in his own novel Buddenbrooks. Mann's essay \\"Bilse and I\\" (\\"Bilse und ich\\", 1906) defends the right of writers to fictionalize living persons, which had been held against Mann by several of the burghers of L√ºbeck. However, Mann was also at pains to draw a distinction between \\"taking liberties and the writer's freedom\\" (\\"Frechheit und Freiheit\\"). Mann further noted that his accusers had called Buddenbrooks a \\"Bilse-Novel\\" (\\"Bilse-Roman\\"), a phrase which, for a while, became synonymous with roman √† clef in German.Thomas Mann, ‚ÄûBilse und ich‚Äú, in idem, Gesammelte Werke in zehn B√§nden (Frankfurt/Main: S. Fischer, 1925), vol. 9, pp. 3-17. On the controversy see Heinrich Detering: ‚ÄûThomas Mann oder L√ºbeck und die letzten Dinge. Buddenbrooks, Stadtklatsch, Bilse und ich‚Äú, in: idem.: Herkunftsorte.

Bilse continued his new career as an author for a while, but his subsequent publications could not emulate the success of his debut. After a fifteen-year interruption, he resumed publishing in the mid-1920s with two novels which were once again of a political nature: In Gottes M√ºhlen. Roman aus einer gro√üen Nation (1924), Bilse portrays a supposedly corrupt and decadent France;See Franz Rottensteiner, Article Gottes M√ºhlen, in: Franz Rottensteiner und Michael Koseler (eds.), Werkf√ºhrer durch die utopisch-phantastische Literatur (Meitingen: Corian Verlag, 1989ff.; 3. Erg.-Lfg. November 1989). whilst the supposed \\"negro novel\\" Die schwarze Welle (1925) testifies to Bilse's resentment at the occupation of the Rhineland by French troops of African origin.See V√©ronique Porra, \\"Autour du Batouala de Ren√© Maran en Allemagne: int√©gration id√©ologique de discours litt√©raires et politiques dans le roman d‚ÄôAfim Assanga / Fritz Oswald Bilse Die Schwarze Welle (La vague noire), 1925\\", in: Anne-Rachel Hermetet (ed.), La r√©ception du roman fran√ßais contemporain dans l‚ÄôEurope de l‚Äôentre-deux-guerres (Lille: Editions du Conseil Scientifique de l‚ÄôUniversit√© Charles-de-Gaulle-Lille 3, 2002), pp. 145-161. Furthermore, Bilse was for a time editor of the journal Deutsche Heimat, which articulated nationalistic tendencies close to the \\"B√ºndische Jugend\\", associated with the so-called \\"conservative revolution\\".On \\"Deutsche Heimat\\" see Armin Mohler, Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932. Ein Handbuch, 5th ed. (Graz: Leopold Stocker Verlag, 1999), p. 299. Bilse's editorship is mentioned in the article in the Berger/Rupp encyclopaedia (see note below). After his release from prison, Bilse moved around, living in Paris and London, then tending the estate of Frabertsham in Upper Bavaria, then living in Munich and ultimately near Gro√ü-Ziethen. In 1946, he was elected to the state assembly of Brandenburg as a member of the Christian Democratic Union (East Germany).Konrad Feilchenfeldt (ed.), Deutsches Literatur-Lexikon: Das 20.

He was a highly regarded interpreter of the vocal music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the lighter tenor roles composed by Richard Wagner. Walther also created the role of Assad in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba and performed in some Italian and French operas. After retiring from the stage in 1887, Walter toured Europe as a lauded recitalist of lieder, premiering numerous songs by Johannes Brahms and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. He became a celebrated pedagogue, teaching voice at the Vienna Conservatory for more than two decades. Notably, too, he is one of the very earliest singers to have left a legacy of gramophone recordings. Early life, education and career As a young man, Walter studied violin at the Prague Conservatory. However, under pressure from his parents, he abandoned his musical pursuits and entered the Prague Polytechnic Institute to study engineering. After finishing his studies, he became the engineer for a sugar factory in his hometown of B√≠lina. He sang part-time in a male quartet in Prague while working as an engineer. His excellent natural voice was discovered by Franz Vogl who immediately offered to become his teacher. For many years, music historians believed he had studied with Johann Friedrich Samuel Johann but recent scholarship has confirmed that his studies were entirely with Vogl.J.B. Steane: \\"Gustav Walter\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed January 30, 2009), (subscription access) Stage career In 1855, in Brno, Walter made his operatic d√©but as a lyric tenor in the role of Edgardo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. The following year he moved to Austria due to the persuasion of soprano Rosa Czillag. He promptly joined the Vienna Staatsoper, singing there for the next thirty one years in primarily leading roles. His first role with the company was Gomez in Conradin Kreutzer's Das Nachtlager in Granada.Biography of Gustav Walter on Operissimo.com (in German). Accessed 30 January 2009. Walter became a highly popular Mozart singer and notably performed the role of Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni in 1869 for the opening of the new opera house in Vienna. He also found success in several Wagner roles. He sang Walther von Stolzing in the somewhat ill-fated Viennese premiere of Wagner's Die Meistersinger (1870), the title role in Lohengrin, and the role of Loge in both Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre. In 1875, he originated the role of Assad in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba opposite Amalie Materna as the Queen of Sheba. In 1882, he sang Alfonso in Vienna's first performance of Franz Schubert's Alfonso und Estrella. His other notable roles with the company included Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore (1859), the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto (1860), Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (1866), and Vasco da Gama in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine (1866) among others. Walter also periodically performed in opera houses in Germany and Bohemia. He sang with the Munich Court Opera in 1868, with Oper Frankfurt in numerous operas between 1864‚Äì1882, the Wiesbaden Opera House in 1874‚Äì75, the opera house in Brno in 1875, and the National Theatre in Prague in 1885. Some of the roles he sang in these houses include Raoul de Nangis in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, George Brown in Bo√Øeldieu's La dame blanche, Tamino in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio, and the title role in Gounod's Faust. Later career, recordings, teaching and death Walter retired from the stage in 1887, with his last performance being as Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas's Mignon at the Vienna Staatsoper. He was appointed an honorary member of the Vienna Staatsoper upon his retirement. Walter also embarked on a famous series of lieder recitals throughout Europe, notably premiering several songs by Johannes Brahms and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. He had previously sung in the premiere of Brahms' Liebeslieder-Walzer and Dvo≈ô√°k dedicated his Cig√°nsk√© melodie (Gypsy Songs, 1880) to him. His recital tour took him to London in 1872 and he appeared with the London Philharmonic in a concert of songs by Mozart, Hermann Riedel and Anton Rubinstein. In 1891, Walter performed at the Salzburg Festival for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Mozart's death. He gave numerous concerts in Munich and Dresden between 1881‚Äì1888. One of his last recitals was in Graz in 1897. Although he stopped giving solo recitals in the late 1890s, he continued to perform with others well into the next century and the beauty of his voice remained with him into the latter years of his life. At the age of 71, in 1905, he made three recordings, including one of an aria from Mignon. Although past his prime, \\"the voice is well preserved and the style both expressive and elegant\\". Music historians value these discs highly because in addition to their artistic merits, they preserve authentic 19th-century performance practices and singing styles. In addition to performing, Walter spent much of his time teaching after his retirement from the operatic stage. He was a professor of voice at the Vienna Conservatory from 1882 until just a few years before he died in 1910, in Vienna. His students included Lula Mysz-Gmeiner. His children, Raoul Walter (1865‚Äì1917) and Minna Walter (1863‚Äì1901), were also successful opera singers.

The specific epithet refers to the vermilion flowers. E. cinnabarinum is similar to (and sometimes confused with) E. fulgens and E. puniceoluteum, as well as red forms of the other crucifix orchids.  Description  This sympodial reed-stemmed Epidendrum displays a pseudomonopodial habit: an individual stem (to 1 m. tall), will grow continuously at the tip for some time bearing fleshy lanceolate green leaves, 2 cm. wide by 10 cm. long, before producing a terminal bloom spike, which usually equals or exceeds the length of the stem. Nevertheless, the flowers come from the top of the stem (halting its upward growth), and new stems start from buds at the base of the old stems, thus making the plant sympodial, like the rest of the subtribe Laeliinae. The inflorescence is a short, highly congested raceme of non-resupinate, ruby red to orange flowers at the end of a long peduncle covered from its base through much of its length with tight imbricate sheathes. The deeply lacerate trilobate lip is adnate to the end of the column, with an orange region surrounding the end of the column, a pair of tubercles on either side of the column, and a keel or carina between the tubercles.Reichenbach, H.

It also provides a wider community service through adult courses in first aid and fire safety, as well as providing follow-up lessons to schools through its in-house teaching staff. It is a registered charity based in an industrial unit in Kiln Farm, Milton Keynes.  Hazard Alley  Most of the unit's floorspace is occupied by Hazard Alley, a full-sized interactive \\"set\\" where several safety scenarios are simulated. It consists of two streets, a lake area and a farm (all inside), on which there are twelve scenarios in total. Each scenario is visited in turn by the groups, led by a volunteer guide. Groups spend ten minutes on each scenario, making the average session two hours long. Groups typically contain six children, who are accompanied by one of the centre's guides. School age children are usually year three (age 7-8) and year six (age 10-11), but can vary anywhere between years two and seven. A session is called a \\"tour\\", throughout which there will be three opportunities for each member of the group (in pairs) to attempt a simulated 999 call. This is designed to build their confidence should a real emergency ever present itself. The scenarios are as follows: Number 2, Brooks Street - A fire simulation. Children discuss the importance of smoke alarms, and what to do in case of fire. Two children attempt a 999 call (one of them was Luke Lasenby[references available on requests]). Number 4, Brooks Street - A demonstration of dangers within the home, particularly dangers posed to young children such as lit cigarettes and alcohol. Contains a living room area and a kitchen area. Number 8, Brooks Street - A \\"cinema\\". Schools are given the option of two interactive videos: a film portraying the consequences of vandalism, or an interactive quiz about internet safety, particularly in chat rooms. Building site - Children are invited to identify ten significant dangers found on building sites, as well as discussing measures that can be put in place to reduce danger. A \\"burning car\\" demonstration reiterates the fire safety message, and two children make a 999 call. Road safety - Children are shown a demonstration of stopping distances, and attempt to cross the \\"road\\" using a full-size pelican crossing. The importance of high-visibility clothing and bicycle helmets is demonstrated. Railway - A full-scale train simulation indicates the dangers of trespassing on railway lines. There is also an in-depth discussion of the dangers of high voltage cables and electrified tracks. Garage - Children cross from the railway to a filling station forecourt using a zebra crossing, discussing hazards posed by large HGVs. On the forecourt the group explores safe storage of petrol, use of high pressure air lines, airbags, booster seats, seat belts and the dangers of smoking or using mobile phones in a petrol station. Key messages are summarised by a short interactive quiz which uses handsets to allow children to answer the questions. Dark alley - The group investigates an alleyway and its dangers, such as litter, abandoned syringes, and strangers. \\"Early warning signs\\", physical reactions to fear such as jumping or sweating, are also physically demonstrated. Water - Groups visit a lake (loosely modelled on nearby Willen Lake), encountering a person who has fallen into the water - prompting the remaining pair to make a 999 call. In the winter groups discuss the dangers of icy lakes, as well as pointing out various dangers such as depth and pollution. Attention is also drawn to the dangers of fishing lines near high-voltage overhead cables, as well as a discussion of the hazards posed by lock gates. First aid - An interactive video allows pairs to attempt the recovery position. Farm - Dangers such as hazardous chemicals (including unlabelled containers), working animals and heavy machinery are discussed. Demonstrations include a combine harvester and a silo. Shop - Children explore their own personal responsibility in matters such as shoplifting. Various methods of theft prevention are demonstrated, and groups discuss various sources of advice in the event of peer pressure or bullying. The Safety Centre's aim is to demonstrate hazards in a highly interactive way using active, hands-on experience as a more effective learning method than classroom teaching. Its policy is to illustrate dangerous situations and ways in which they can be prevented, actively avoiding explaining ways of physically combating dangers, such as extinguishing fires - the knowledge of which might prompt a child to put himself in danger by deciding to fight a fire himself rather than evacuating the area and leaving a responsible adult to combat the problem. Its key message is to put the child's own personal safety as the highest priority.  Impact and effectiveness  The Safety Centre has a high profile across Milton Keynes and the wider area. Because of its specialised purpose, there are very few similar centres in the country, thus it has a very wide catchment area including Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and north London. Many schools visit annually. The name \\"Hazard Alley\\" is recognised amongst children and students who remember their visits; fan groups on applications such as Facebook have sprung up,http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=2475780664&ref;=ts and many young people return as volunteer guides. Because its primary purpose is to prevent dangers and injuries, it is impossible to measure the true extent of the Safety Centre's effectiveness. However, there are several examples in the local press of children avoiding accidents using knowledge they had learned at Hazard Alley.

CHS received a \\"C\\" grade from the New Mexico Public Education Department in 2016. Campus The Carlsbad High School Campus was opened in 1962, with the conversion of the previous high school into what is present-day Carlsbad Intermediate School. Carlsbad High School consists of nine buildings scattered across a large campus. The Main Building is a three-story building with an interior atrium opening to the northeast. Also on campus are the Freshman Academy (where classes for most freshmen are held), the Science Building, the PAD (housing the History and Math departments), the cafeteria (also housing the theatre department), the Gym Complex (including a public- access natatorium), the Performing Arts Center (containing the band, choir, dance, and cheerleading programs), the Arts and Crafts building, and the Building Trades Center. CHS is the largest high school campus in the state of New Mexico, and one of the largest in the country. Mascot and colors CHS' athletic teams are known as the Cavemen (boys) and Cavegirls (girls), a tribute to the world-famous Carlsbad Caverns located near the city. The school's mascot is a caveman named \\"Rusty\\". Rusty received his name from the first Caveman statue placed on display in the Main Building. This statue was often decorated and dressed in blue for special occasions (e.g. district championships, rivalry victories, state championships). Rusty was often subject to abuse from rival high schools. For example, Artesia High School students once kidnapped and dropped him at Lake Avalon, just north of Carlsbad. Local residents retrieved him from the lake after a few years had passed. He now resides in the library (on the third floor of the Main Building) facing out the window and overlooking the campus. School colors are blue, silver, and white. Athletics CHS competes in the New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA), as a class 6A school in District 3. In 2013, the NMAA realigned the state's schools in to six classifications and adjusted district boundaries.http://www.nmact.org/file/Section_4.pdf Carlsbad High School has a total of 68 state titles, which puts it in fourth place for most state titles across all sports divisions in New Mexico. CHS competes in a wide variety of sports as the Cavemen and Cavegirls: * Tennis - Cavemen and Cavegirl tennis both compete. New tennis courts were opened in the 2009-2010 academic school year. The Cavegirls were district and state champions five years in a row, beginning in 2006. The Cavemen won the state championship in tennis in 2012. * Volleyball - Cavegirl volleyball won the 2010 district championship. * Football - The Cavemen football team has a total of eight state championships, but their most recent one was in 1962. The team plays at Ralph Bowyer Cavemen Stadium (named after a former Cavemen football player and later coach in 1962) on campus, which has a capacity of nearly 7000 people. The team wears silver helmets with a single blue stripe and a blue wishbone \\"C\\"; the jerseys and pants are both solid blue. The away jerseys and pants are white. :Throughout the 1980s into 2005, in addition to the traditional blue home uniforms with silver helmets, the team wore silver visiting jerseys and pants. During their 2010 season, the Cavemen went 7-3 in the regular season, and won the District 4 AAAAA title by defeating the Clovis Wildcats 14-13. The Cavemen then defeated the West Mesa High School Mustangs 35-19 in their first home playoff game since 2002. However, the Cavemen fell next week to the Manzano High School Monarchs 39-29. This season marked a major turnaround for head coach Ron Arrington. In 2011, the Cavemen finished the regular season 8-2, as well as defeating the Artesia Bulldogs and the Mayfield Trojans, the latter of whom Carlsbad had not defeated since 1992. Canutillo Eagles * Basketball - The Cavemen basketball team has three state championships, the most recent of which occurred in 1955. In 2016, however, they were state runner-ups. * Baseball and softball - The Carlsbad High School baseball and softball teams have many state championships each. The Cavemen play at the Caveman Corral and the Cavegirls at Cavegirl Park. The Cavemen and Cavegirls both won the district championship in 2010, and the Cavegirls won the state championship over Rio Rancho High School 7-6. The Cavemen claimed the 2012 baseball title over Sandia High School, their first title since 2002. In 2016, The Cavemen also claimed the 2016 State Championship title against Rio Rancho. * Men's and women's soccer - The Cavemen and Cavegirl soccer teams both play their varsity soccer games at Ralph Bowyer Cavemen Stadium. * Swimming and Diving - The Carlsbad High School swim team have been around for many years. An additional dive team was created in the 2009-2010 academic year. * Wrestling - The Cavemen wrestlers have been frequent participants in the state championships, winning nine state championships (the most state championships of any Cavemen sport). In addition to multiple one, two, three, and four time individual state champions, the Cavemen also boast the first five-time individual state champion; there have only been two in New Mexico history. Rivalries The Cavemen have several powerful rivalries that they participate in. The Cavemen have their standard district rivalry with the Hobbs Eagles. Carlsbad holds the overall series against both in baseball and softball, while Clovis holds football and Hobbs holds basketball. Carlsbad also has a bitter rivalry with the Artesia Bulldogs, which is referred to by the two schools as \\"The Eddy County War\\" or \\"The Battle for Eddy County\\". Carlsbad holds an overall series in football, but by less than 10 wins as Artesia has beat the Cavemen six times in a row. The Cavemen traditionally beat the Bulldogs at home in basketball while the Bulldogs often win at home. This is a powerful but friendly rivalry and is one of the longest running high school rivalries in the state of New Mexico. Other regional rivals include the Goddard Rockets, the Roswell Coyotes, the Alamogordo Tigers, and the Mayfield Trojans, as these teams play each other often.

The dam has a height of 63 metres. The reservoir has a capacity of some 8 million cubic meters and is some 1300 metres in length. The dam is located in rural Lebanon and is surrounded by farmland. Agricultural lands stretch far below the Faraya-Chabrouh Dam and the water is used from the reservoir to irrigate the lands, providing an essential resource to thousands of people in the villages below. Photo of Chabrouh Dam in Faraya, Lebanon. Date: 1 Oct 2017 Structure Chabrouh dam is located on Wadi Chabrouh river in Faraya, about 40 km north-east of Beirut. This project will provide potable water during the summer for Kesrouan region (around 250,000 inhabitants). The dam is a bituminous face rockfill dam (BFRD), with maximum height of 65m, crest length of 470m at 1618m above sea level and a volume of rockfill of 1,500,000 m3. The upstream and downstream slopes are 1V:1.7H. The upstream bituminous slab has a total area of 37,000 m2 and total thickness of 22 cm (2 layers of 6 cm and a base of 10 cm). The embankment is divided into eight zones of materials as well as filters and drains. The rockfill for the embankment is selected from two quarries at about 5 km from the dam site. Zone I (1800‚Äì1860) is a mixture of hard limestone (above 1840) and chalky limestone (Average Los Angeles 50) used for embankment material 3B and 3BE (see figure 2.2). Zone II is a formation of very hard limestone (Average Los Angeles 25) used for concrete aggregates and materials 2A, 2B, 3A, 4 and draining systems (see figure 2.3). The test layers performed with fill material 3B, showed that after compaction, the percentage of fines was greater than expected with Kh/Kv =100. These results led to the implementation of a draining chimney located at 45 m from the upstream face of the embankment, aiming at controlling all potential leakages, and channelling the water towards the horizontal drains of the embankment.

It is adjacent to the Grove Ngunnawal retirement village currently being developed by Lend Lease. The Gold Creek Homestead Complex (2) referred to a group of four buildings including the 697m2 homestead, a stone and timber cottage, a buggy shed and an entertainment and function centre (formerly a machinery shed). The Gold Creek Homestead Site (3) was a 41-hectare parcel of land, specifically Block 1 and 2, Section 23 Ngunnawal upon which the aforementioned complex was situated. Gold Creek Homestead was at one time at the centre of 'Gold Creek' a sprawling 1,594 hectare (3,940 acre) rural property, the largest in the Ginninderra district. Portions of the former property are or will be occupied by parts of the suburbs of Ngunnawal, Nicholls, Harcourt Hill, Moncrieff, Casey, Kinlyside and Taylor as well as large parcels of land in NSW adjacent to the village of Hall.Newman Chris (2004), Gold Creek, Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage, Gold Creek Homestead Working Group. the site then became abandoned for a little while, leaving teenagers to explore it during the night. it was then put up for sale after it was declined to be heritage listed.  History =Rolfe family= Edmund Rolfe, Gold Creek's founder c.1895 In 1849 Anthony Rolfe, an English farm labourer, arrived in Australia from Oxborough, Norfolk, England with his wife and five children. The family migrated to the new colonies under one of the Bounty schemes subsidised to the British Government and was part of the wave of free settlers to follow the convict era. After working for 10 years as a tenant farmer at Joseph Kaye's Springbank rural property, Anthony established his own property Tea Gardens, on 130-hectare (320 acre) of land in 1857.Gillespie L, Ginninderra, Forerunner to Canberra: a history of the Ginninderra district, ACT Heritage Unit, 1992 The remnants of that homestead is located in present-day Ngunnawal near Ginninderra Creek which is now part of the Gungahlin Lakes Golf Course. Anthony's second eldest son Edmund Rolfe spent his early working life as a teamster, transporting building materials e.g. sandstone, wool, wheat and even drinking water from and to as far afield as Camden and Braidwood.Shumack Samuel (1977), An Autobiography or Tales and Legends of Canberra Pioneers, Australian National University Press. He was the principal transport contractor for the tower reconstruction work on St John the Baptist Church (in present-day Reid).Robinson FW (1924), Canberra's First Hundred Years, C Penfold & Co Limited. Edmund Rolfe's first wife Margaret (n√©e Logue) died during childbirth in 1867 and he later married Margaret O'Keefe. Edmund Rolfe fathered 14 children ‚Äì Bryan (b. 1862), Maria (b. 1864), Mary (b. 1865), Catherine (b. 1867), Anthony (b. 1868), William (b. 1869), Alice (b. 1871), Bridget (b. 1873), Margaret (b. 1874), James (b. 1876), Patrick (b. 1878), Gertrude (b. 1880), John (b. 1882) and Edmund George(b. 1884). Anthony Rolfe financed the initial purchase of of land which abutes the present-day Gold Creek Homestead Site and transferred the land title as part of a much larger parcel to his son Edmund in 1872.National Archives of Australia: CA 745; Lands and Survey Branch, Canberra; A358/117, Edmund Rolfe, 3940 Acres, Parishes of Ginninderra and Gunderoo During its first few decades Gold Creek was devoted to cropping predominantly wheat and later the Rolfes diversified into merino sheep and later still beef cattle Gold Creek c.1907 (Partial) The Rolfes were major beneficiaries of the depression of the 1890s. Rising mortgage rates left many farmers servicing bank loans at rates of seven, eight and even ten per cent. With their previous mortgages paid out, the Rolfes were better placed than most. With five fit young men carrying out a program of cropping, animal husbandry and sheep grazing activities, the property remained profitable while neighbouring farms floundered. When one of the Rolfes‚Äô long- time neighbours forfeited on their mortgage payments in 1897, they snapped up the land. The superior quality of the Gold Creek livestock was underlined by a purchase concluded in December 1903. Mr E. Hudson, the manager of the Duntroon estate, paid ¬£2100 for 2100 merinos and 900 lambs. They used the cash to secure mortgages on further land purchases. Over a period of several years, he snapped up at foreclosure sales various parcels of land, extending his family's land holdings. By 1907 the Rolfes presided over a rural property in size, the largest in the Ginninderra district. Edmund Rolfe was very active in local politics in the two decades prior to the Federation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. He served for a number of years as the treasurer and later the vice-president of the Ginninderra Protection Union, the forerunner to the Protectionist party. He was also a committee member of the Ginninderra Agricultural Show, the forerunner to Canberra's Royal National Capital Agricultural Show. The Rolfes also hosted a number of balls and dances at Gold Creek in support of St Benedicts, a Catholic Girls School in Queanbeyan. Edmund Rolfe was a fundraiser for Ginninderra St Francis Church and its replacement, Hall‚Äôs St Xaviers Church. The Gold Creek Rolfes were amongst a handful of local farming families including Frederick Campbell (of Yarralumla) that lobbied the Federal Government for improved compensation during the land acquisition process in the lead-up to the creation of the Federal Capital Territory (now the Australian Capital Territory).Author Unknown (1911), Minutes of meeting of landowners held at Hotel Queanbeyan on 16 February 1911, Frederick Campbell's Third Letter Book, Mitchell Library, Sydney = Bruce family = Gold Creek Homestead c.1970s John Bruce was responsible for introducing scientific farming practices based on Agricultural Science at Gold Creek during the 1960s. A substantial program improved efficiencies and drought-proofed the property. As a result of measures such as these Gold Creek produced first-cross ewes (merinos mated with border Leicester), then much sought after by prime lamb producers in the Cowra region. The progeny of these ewes were excellent 'prime lambs', which yielded higher than average percentages of meat and accordingly achieved better sale prices.Interview with John Starr 2004 Ten earthen dams were constructed to capture water runoff and arrest soil erosion, and provide water for stock. Today, the traffic roundabout at the corner of Gungahlin Drive and Wanganeen Avenue marks the location of a subterran bore a key component of this strategy. In 1967, the Bruces sunk an artesian bore, the centrepiece of an elaborate water reticulation system. From the small pump house directly above the bore head, a diesel engine pushed a column of bore water 1,000 yards west to a 20,000-gallon concrete holding tank through very long lengths of two-inch polypropylene pipe. The water pump could completely fill the holding tank in about twelve hours. Today, this tank is located not far from Clarrie Hermes Drive in Harcourt Hill. From the tank, bore water was gravity-fed through buried pipes to 26 watering troughs. The entire reticulation system could be controlled by one person from a set of stop valves located in the machinery shed. The Bruces also oversaw the planting of more than 1,000 trees across the rural property. Australian natives, especially the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) found favour with the Bruces, though the vast majority of the species planted were European ornamentals. The list of species included poplars (Populus canadensis), Monterey Pine pines (Pinus radiata), pencil pines (Athrotaxis cupressoides), pussy willows (Salix discolor), silver spruces (Picea engelmannii), black walnuts (Juglans nigra), golden elms (Sassafras albidum), silver birchs (Betula pendula), quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis) and white oaks (Quercus arizonica). During the early to mid-1970s the Federal Government terminated the leases on a number of rural homesteads including Lanyon, Cuppacumbalong and Gold Creek. The government intended to issue a commercial lease for the use of the 16 hectares encompassing the Gold Creek Homestead Site (3). = Gold Creek Pty Ltd = Aerial view of Gold Creek Homestead Complex c.1980s looking towards present-day suburb of Nicholls In 1977 a group of Canberra business people pooled their finances to redevelop Gold Creek Homestead as a reception and function centre. The rural-style venue, which was to become amongst the first of its type in the Canberra region, hosted more than 7,000 wedding parties during its heyday through the 1970s, 1980s and into the early 1990s. The hayshed complex was also converted for use as a function centre. Many public service and social clubs celebrations were held in the hayshed over a twenty-year period. A partnership led by Australian national soccer player John Warren acquired the business in 1979. Gold Creek hosted the national rodeo and country music events in 1981 and 1982. In late 1977, David Templeton and two other former partners of Gold Creek Pty Ltd bought the Red Hill Hereford Stud, a cattle breeding business located near Finley in southern NSW. Established in 1966, Red Hill Stud's breeding stock was top notch. Initially the partners transported their prize bulls to Gold Creek to prepare them for show and eventual sale. The Red Hill Hereford Stud won a swag of blue ribbons at Agricultural Shows in Canberra, Sydney and regional NSW. Its success led to a series of cattle breeders‚Äô field days at Gold Creek held in conjunction with the Australian Hereford Society that attracted society members from around Australia.Interview with John Warren conducted by Chris Newman (2004) During 1987/8, Gold Creek Pty Ltd began discussions with Japanese developer Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd to partner up for an 8-hole golf course development. Detailed plans were prepared for a condominium-style development. The go-ahead for the project depended on ACT Government approval which was ultimately not forthcoming. While the 'Gold Creek Golf Estate' didn‚Äôt see the light of day, in a major touch of irony, the government put its considerable financial backing behind the Gold Creek Country Club, a golf course development that bears, some would argue, striking similarities to the plans submitted by John Warren.Interview with John Starr conducted by Chris Newman (2004) = Decline = Heritage Listing Proposal In the early 1990s the ACT Government progressively withdrew rural leases in the Gungahlin district ahead of construction work on the suburbs of Ngunnawal, Nicholls and Harcourt Hill. The Gold Creek Homestead business fully expected that land planners would retain a respectable buffer zone between the Homestead Site and surrounding houses to cater for extra noise. By 1994, a long timber paling fence stretched along the northern, eastern and western boundaries of the now 41 hectare Gold Creek Homestead site, while to the south, a two-metre high earth noise barrier was erected alongside Gungahlin Drive. With the majority of the construction work finished, bookings for the Gold Creek hayshed began to recover by mid 1995. Soon after noise complaints from nearby houses during a night-time function in the entertainment led to a suspension of live music at Gold Creek. The ACT Government commissioned a consultants report which estimated the cost of noise abatement measures at $300,000. The government quickly cooled on the idea. With no willing buyers, John Warren reluctantly sold the 41-hectare property to the ACT Government for $1.25M in 1998. The delivery of the Gold Creek Homestead site into public hands left the ACT Government with 41 hectares of land with excellent development potential. In July 2000 the Government began a first round of community consultations about future options for the site. Three months later indicative plans were unveiled for an aged care facility, medium-density housing, motel and plant nursery. Ngunnawal residents lobbied the government for retention of the entire site for community use. They presented a petition to the Heritage Minister with more than 4,000 signatures in support of their cause but to no avail. Unperturbed the group organised two open days at the site. The larger of the two events, held in April 2002, attracted about 1,500 people. Later still the community group received a heritage grant to record Gold Creek's history. In March 2005 the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, launched the book Gold Creek: Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage by local author Chris Newman at Gold Creek Homestead. = Heritage Nomination Rejected for a second time = In late 2005 a portion of the historic site was nominated for inclusion on the ACT heritage register. (See diagram to the right). The nomination addressed two specific criteria Criterion (d) The site is highly valued by the community or a cultural group for reasons of strong or special religious, spiritual, cultural, educational or social associations. The name Gold Creek and by extension the site, have retained a strong resonance within the local Gungahlin community. The name has subsequently been appropriated by a local golf course, tourist precinct, high school and commercial businesses, which trade on the strong associations engendered in the name Gold Creek. Criterion (h) the site has strong or special associations with a person, group, event, development or cultural phase in local or national history. The Gold Creek Homestead site has a special association with individuals and events, namely Edmund Rolfe (and the Rolfe family which still resides in the Canberra region) that helped shape local history including the transition to Australia‚Äôs Federal Capital Territory. The nomination was rejected in June 2009. = Retirement Village Development = At the beginning of 2014 construction began on an over 55's community on a 6.23 hectare parcel of land at was previously the western end of the Gold Creek Homestead site. This site is being developed by Lend Lease Retirement Living. The village will comprise 161 villas and community facilities and is expected to be completed by 2019.

By 1908, the school served 308 students, and by 1915 the high school students had moved to a new building on Oak Street. The school bell, mounted in a bell tower, had to be removed from the tower in 1962 because of a decaying structure. It was mounted on a granite pedestal next to the Excelsior Public Library in 1966.

It was built in the Mamluk period, from 1294 to 1314.Dictionary of Islamic Architecture By Andrew Petersen, Routledge,2002. p.1294 Saliba, R., Jeblawi, S., and Ajami, G., Tripoli the Old City: Monument Survey - Mosques and Madrasas; A Sourcebook of Maps and Architectural Drawings, American University of Beirut Publications, Beirut, Lebanon, 1995. This was the first building erected in Mamluk Tripoli. History The Mansouri Mosque was named after the Mamluk sultan who conquered Tripoli from the Crusaders in 1289, al-Mansur Qalawun. The mosque itself was erected by his two sons, al-Ashraf Khalil, who ordered its construction in 1294, and al-Nasir Muhammad, who had the arcade built around the courtyard in 1314. Located on the site of what was once a Crusaders' suburb at the foot of the Citadel of Tripoli, the mosque was often mistaken for a remodeled Christian church by medieval travelers and modern historians alike. This was the first building the Mamluks erected in Tripoli.Great Mosque of Tripoli . Archnet Digital Library. During Amir Qaratay's first term as Governor of Tripoli (1316-1326), he endowed the Mansouri's Mosque's minbar and also built the Madrasah Qartawiyyah, known as the \\"finest\\" madrasa in Tripoli, which adjoins the mosque to the east. Architecture Ablution fountain in the mosque's courtyard The Mansouri Mosque occupies an area of about 50 by 60 meters in the middle of the city. It does not have an elaborate facade, but is readily identifiable from the outside by its minaret and its main northern gate. The floor plan of the mosque shows a traditional arrangement with a central courtyard, single porticoes on three sides, a deeper qibla side for prayer, and a central fountain. The mosque has three axial entrances set to the north, east, and west, but there are also two others on either side of the prayer hall in accordance with traditional fashion. K.A.C. Creswell regards the three axial entrances as a Syrian feature which began in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, and later became part of other Syrian mosques, like the mosque in Harran, and was then copied in other parts of the Muslim world, particularly in Anatolia and a number of mosques in Cairo. To the right of the Mansouri Mosque's main entrance are two granite columns springing from the pavement, remnants of classical times that were for some reason left standing. They do not seem to have any practical or decorative function. The courtyard which dominates the building is enclosed by porticoes to the north, east, and west, and by the closed prayer area to the south. The porticoes display a rhythmic arrangement of identical low arches in the courtyard, and a continuous corridor-like area of simple cross-vaulting behind. These are the riwaqs built by al-Nasir Muhammad, when he completed the mosque in 1314. The ablution fountain located in the center of the courtyard consists of two adjoining square units, one of which is covered by a dome. When Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi visited Tripoli in 1700, he described the fountain as \\"having a huge dome and pillars so large as to need four men to embrace them.\\" The prayer hall of the mosque covers the entire qibla side of the building and consists of two aisles divided by six large piers to form fourteen areas, thirteen of them covered by simple cross-vaults, and the fourteenth‚Äîthe area in front of the mihrab‚Äîby a small dome. The qibla wall has three mihrabs‚Äîan axial main mihrab with a rosette positioned above it and one on either side‚Äîand a minbar (\\"pulpit\\"). The minbar is a wooden chair completely covered with geometric carvings. The painted rosette above the minbar is reused; the word \\"Allah\\" appears in its center and the same two motifs as were used inside and outside the main gate decorate the periphery. Four-pointed rosettes in relief run around the circumference of the roundel and a zigzag motif forms circles within. This decorative rosette, of the same style as the gate, was a part of the Crusader church.

A group of 40 activists of the Sri Rama Sena barged into the pub \\"Amnesia ‚Äì The Lounge\\" and beat up a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalised. The video of the incident has become one of the most watched clips on YouTube, though how the TV crew happened to be ready at the 'unannounced' attack is not known. According to statements of staff at the Amnesia Pub at the Hotel Woodside in the busy Balmatta area of Mangalore, two men approached the front desk of the hotel an hour before the actual attack took place at 4:30 pm on Saturday, reportedly claiming rights to inspect the premises. However, local police officials claimed the hotel staff had not made any reference to an extortion attempt or on previous occasions.Rama Sene, Bajrang Dal vie for ‚Äòcredit,‚Äô extortion under scan ‚Äì 27 January 2009, The Indian Express The police also suspect that the real hidden agenda could have been extortion, the fact is that by claiming responsibility, a group will be able to extort money from similar establishments later. \\"Whoever has done this has done a good job. Girls going to pubs is not acceptable. So, whatever the Sena members did was right. You are highlighting this small incident to malign the BJP government in the state,\\" said founder Pramod Muthalik. In 2018, Muthalik along with 24 others were acquitted by the court from the charges related to the pub attack. Arrests Prasad Attavar speaks about the attack outside court on 31 January The Karnataka police have picked up Prasad Attavar, the convenor of the Sri Ram Sena, along with Lohith, another member of the outfit. Police sources declared that they were hiding ever since the incident in an area called Adyar in Mangalore. The police is still looking for another key member of the outfit by the name Dinakar, who had claimed responsibility for the attack. The Sri Ram Sena chief Prasad Attavar claimed that these girls are like his sisters and he would not approve of anyone raising their hand on his sisters and this is just a minor incident that has been blown out of proportion. The police sources said that there were 40 persons involved in the attack in all and till now they had picked up 19 of them. Around 27 people were arrested related to this incident till now. The Sri Rama Sena, which has 1,000‚Äì1,500 cadre in the coastal Karnataka region, has threatened to carry out a state-wide bandh if Muthalik is not released by 29 January 2009,Thursday evening A pub attack victim has told NDTV that she received threat calls. Public reaction The Pink Chaddi Campaign, nonviolent protest movement was launched in India in response to notable incidences of violent conservative and right-wing activism against perceived violations of Indian Culture. The campaign was conceived particularly in protest against a threat by Pramod Muthalik. Reactions On 3 February 2009, Pravin Valke, founding member of the Sri Rama Sene, told The Indian Express, \\"These girls come from all over India, drink, smoke, and walk around in the night spoiling the traditional girls of Mangalore. Why should girls go to pubs? Are they going to serve their future husbands alcohol? Should they not be learning to make chapattis [Indian bread]? Bars and pubs should be for men only. We wanted to ensure that all women in Mangalore are home by 7 p.m.\\"‚ÄòAnti-Conversion‚Äô Law Considered in Karnataka ‚Äì Compass Direct, 2 March 2009 Shri Ram Sena chief Pramod Muthalik later apologised for the attack on weekend revellers at a Mangalore pub, saying the way the right- wing group acted \\"was wrong\\" but insisted it was done to \\"save our mothers and daughters\\". He was later arrested under IPC section 153 by the Karnataka Police. The Karnataka Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa had said the Sriram Sena is not a Sangh Parivar outfit and asserted that stringent action will be taken against the culprits. He also has ruled out banning the Sri Ram Sena even though the outfit's chief admitted to wrongdoing. The Ram Sena chief has threatened a similar protest on Valentine's Day. Pramod Muthalik, a full-time Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) man earlier was the Karnataka coordinator of the Bajrang Dal four years ago. Soon he was expelled from the Bajrang Dal after which he joined the Shiv Sena and later he formed his own group. Pramod Multhalik has over 45 cases pending against him. Most of these cases are still under investigation. A look at the chargesheet makes it clear that he has never been arrested for any of these cases. Pramod even recently held a press meet in Bangalore to release the photographs of the members of Hindu suicide squad undergoing training in handling arms and ammunition to take on Muslim Jihadis. According to Mutalik there are 1,132 members in the suicide squad. The Janata Dal (Secular) chief and the former PM of India, H. D. Deve Gowda on 26 January 2009, accused Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa of being responsible for Talibanisation of Karnataka. The mayor of Mangalore filed an FIR against Women and Child Development Minister Renuka Chowdhury for her reference to the Talibanisation of Mangalore. Toeing the right-wing group Sri Ram Sene Pramod Muthalik's line, Karnataka CM Yeddyurappa has said that pub culture is wrong and should not be permitted. One of the woman victims of the attack on a Mangalore pub on Monday claimed that the Sri Ram Sena activists hurled abuses at them and called them prostitutes\\". National Commission for Women controversy The National Commission for Women (NCW) constituted a three-member team to investigate the attack on women in the pub. In what was termed a shocking statement, the NCW put the blame on the girls who were beaten. They also implicated the pub. Nirmala Venkatesh, a member of the three-member NCW team, blamed the pub for the attacks, saying they did not have adequate security to protect against a mob of 40 men. She also stated that a live band was playing, and the girls partaking in this could have been another cause. She said her concern was that the media coverage had tarnished the image of Karnataka. She stated that as per information available to her, several of the girls were from north India. \\"Everybody was dancing wearing so many nude clothes (sic) and all. That is why they did what they did, they (the attackers) said. We women should always try to safeguard ourselves,\\" Nirmala Venkatesh said. Asked for an assessment of the incident, she strangely stated that she has found illegal activities going on in some hotels and pubs in Mangalore, including prostitution. She claimed to have conducted a surprise raid on one of the hotels and found \\"that not everything was going on legally.\\" Numerous reports have talked about the victims receiving threatening phone calls. The victims are said to be in a state of fear, and have not come forward to register complaints. In relation to this, Nirmala Venkatesh had a different view: \\"If the girls feel they were not doing anything wrong why are they afraid to come forward and give a statement?\\" She stated that she was not concentrating on the Sri Ram Sena group, but that she will interrogate the owner of the pub, and the media persons present. She stated that she held the pub's staff culpable. The NCW investigation has focused solely on the license and documentation of the attacked pub. The NCW advised the police to look into alleged misuse of the licence. According to Ms. Venkatesh, the NCW will recommend the cancellation of the pub's license. The NCW team is also investigating the register of guests, claiming it is suspicious. Nirmala Venkatesh met with the culprits who perpetrated the attack and provided counselling for them. She has, however, not talked to any of the victims of the attack. The Sri Ram Sena has thanked the NCW for helping spread its message to other states. In her report to the commission, Nirmala blamed the owner of the pub for not providing security to women guests, and recommended suspension of its licence. While claiming that she was unable to trace the victims, she met the accused in jail. At one point in time, she even suggested that women refrain from wearing \\"skimpy\\" and provocative dresses. When her report was not accepted by the Commission, Nirmala even challenged the authority of Minister for Women and Child Development Renuka Chowdhury. Nirmala Venkatesh was removed from her office of National Commission for Women member by the Ministry of Women and Child Development for failing to conduct an unbiased enquiry. Nirmala Venkatesh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shortly after this, and declared that she was ready to contest the coming Lok Sabha elections if she was given a ticket.

It takes its name from Raymond de Saint-Gilles, the Count of Toulouse and Crusader commander who was a key player in its enlargement. It is a common misconception that he was responsible for its construction when in 1103 he laid siege to the city. Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles History The citadel of Tripoli was built by Raymon De Saint-Gilles, governor of Tripoli, in 1103 on the emplacement of the castle of Saint-Gilles. When the Mont P√®lerin quarter was set ablaze by the Mamluks in 1289, the castle of Saint-Gilles suffered from the holocaust and stood abandoned on the hilltop for the next eighteen years. It was essential to have an adequate stronghold in Tripoli for the sultan‚Äôs troops, temporarily garrisoned in Hisn al-Akr√°d (Krak des Chevaliers), as the distance was too great in case of enemy attack. The governor therefore chose the emplacement of the gutted Crusader castle on the hill, incorporating what he could in his citadel, and made use of Roman column shafts and other building material he found nearby. Many of the interior walls, ramps and terraces of the citadel seen today were built in his time. Abou‚Äôl Fid√° and Ibn al-Wardi record that, among the important events which took place in the year A.H 746 (1345), was the promulgation of a military decree which was set up by order of the Mamluk Sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban in the citadels of Aleppo, Tripoli, Hisn al-Akr√¢d and other fortified places. The decree, put over the second entrance way of the citadel of Tripoli, is by far the best preserved. Apparently this sultan, who lived a life of luxury and debauch, was in constant need of extra revenues. In order to fill his depleted treasury, he imposed a heavy registration tax upon all feudal land concessions and appropriations. This tax was unpopular and was obviously going to stir up discontent among his subjects. To forestall any uprising and gain the support of his troops, upon whom his power was based he issued this military decree. It was the custom that a Mamluk soldier, under contract for a specified number of years, received an annual gratuity which amounted to slightly over eleven days extra pay. If the soldier died before the end of his contract, the sultan had the right to claim the extra sum of money which had accumulated during the soldier's years of service. Sha'b√°n abandoned his rights to this claim, once and for all, hoping thus to enlist the support of his troops. In 1516, Syria and Egypt fell to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. His son and successor Suleiman I, called the Magnificent (1520-1566), soon after his accession made an inspection tour of his newly conquered lands. He gathered about him in Damascus all his provincial governors and on this occasion took the decision to rebuild the great citadel of Tripoli. Over the entrance portal, the sultan commemorated this important restoration work with an inscription: \\"In the name of Allah, it has been decreed by the royal sultan‚Äôs order, al Malik al- Muzuffar Sultan Suleiman Shah, son of Sultan Selim Shah, may his orders never cease to be obeyed by the emirs, that this blessed citadel be restored so as to be a fortified stronghold for all time. Its construction was completed in the blessed month of Sha‚Äôb√¢n of the year 927 (July 1521) In the years that followed, various Ottoman governors of Tripoli did restoration work on the citadel to suit their needs and with time the medieval crenelated battlements were destroyed in order to open sally ports for cannons. In the early 19th century, the citadel was extensively restored by the Ottoman governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar. Very little of the original Crusader structure has survived until this day. The graves of a number of nameless Frankish knights, here and there, are the only bits of evidence today evocative of their presence on the heights of Tripoli's \\"Pilgrim's Mountain\\" many centuries ago.

Ireland is an island to the north-west of continental Europe. Politically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland, which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island. Roman Catholicism is the largest religious denomination, representing over 73% for the island and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland. Introduction of Christianity The introduction of Christianity to Ireland dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. Christian worship had reached pagan Ireland around 400 AD. It is often misstated that St. Patrick brought the faith to Ireland, but it was already present on the island before Patrick arrived. Monasteries were built for monks who wanted permanent communion with God. The lengths they went to for tranquility are evident from the monastery of Skellig Michael. Via Bishop Aidan, Christianity spread among the Picts and Northumbrians. Scholars have long considered the term \\"Celtic Church\\" to be inappropriate for describing Christianity among Celtic-speaking peoples, since this would imply a notion of unity, or a self-identifying entity, that did not exist.D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early Medieval Ireland 400‚Äì1200 (London, 1995); T. M. Charles-Edwards, Early Christians Ireland (Cambridge, 2000); W. Davies, ‚ÄòThe Myth of the Celtic Church‚Äô, in N. Edwards and A. Lane, The Early Church in Wales and the West (Oxbow Monograph 16, Oxford, 1992), pp. 12‚Äì21; Kathleen Hughes, ‚ÄòThe Celtic Church: is this a valid concept?‚Äô, in Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies 1 (1981), pp. 1‚Äì20; Kathleen Hughes, The Church in Early English Society (London, 1966); W. Davies and P. Wormald, The Celtic Church (Audio Learning Tapes, 1980). As Patrick Wormald explained, \\"One of the common misconceptions is that there was a 'Roman Church' to which the 'Celtic' was nationally opposed.\\"Patrick Wormald, ‚ÄòBede and the ‚ÄòChurch of the English‚Äô‚Äô, in The Times of Bede, ed. Stephen Baxter (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), p. 207. Celtic-speaking areas were part of Latin Christendom as a whole, wherein a significant degree of liturgical and structural variation existed, along with a collective veneration of the Bishop of Rome that was no less intense in Britain and Ireland.Richard Sharpe, ‚ÄòSome problems concerning the organization of the Church in early medieval Ireland‚Äô, Peritia 3 (1984), pp. 230‚Äì270; Patrick Wormald, ‚ÄòBede and the ‚ÄòChurch of the English‚Äô‚Äô, in The Times of Bede, ed. Stephen Baxter (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 207‚Äì208, 220 n. 3 Some scholars have chosen to apply the term \\"Insular Christianity\\" to this Christian practice that arose around the Irish Sea. Palladius and Patrick According to Prosper of Aquitaine, Palladius was from a noble family in Gaul. In 429, he was serving as a deacon in Rome. The Pope commissioned him to send Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, to investigate rumors of Pelagianism in Britain. In 431, Pope Celestine I consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to minister to the \\"Scots believing in Christ\\". His mission mainly seems to have been to Irish Christians in the east midlands, Leinster, and perhaps east Munster. It is uncertain if he converted any Irish. What little is known of his mission appears to have been successful, though it was later downplayed by partisans of Patrick. Saint Patrick's dates are uncertain. All that can be said is that he was alive sometime in the fifth century, and was a missionary bishop rather than ministering to Christians. His areas appear to have been Ulster and north Connacht, but very little can be said with certainty about him. Later tradition from the seventh-century onwards is known to be unreliable. Native ministries and Irish monasteries Monastic establishments arose in the sixth century, such as Clonard, founded by St. Finian, Clonfert by St. Brendan, Bangor by St. Comgall, Clonmacnoise by St. Kieran, Killeaney by St. Enda; and, in the seventh century, Lismore by St. Carthage and Glendalough by St. Kevin. In 563, St. Columba, a native of Donegal, accompanied by a few companions, crossed the sea to Caledonia and founded a monastery on the desolate island of Iona. Further fresh arrivals came from Ireland and the monastery, with Columba as its abbot, was soon a flourishing institution, from which the Dalriadian Scots in the south and the Picts beyond the Grampians were evangelized. When Columba died in 597, Christianity had been preached and received in every district in Caledonia, and in every island along its west coast. In the next century Iona had so prospered that its abbot, St. Adamnan, wrote in excellent Latin the \\"Life of St. Columba\\". From Iona had gone south the Irish Aidan and his Irish companions to evangelize Northumbria, Mercia, and Essex. Missionaries abroad A page from the Book of Kells that opens the Gospel of John Missionaries from Ireland to England and Continental Europe spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the Early Middle Ages. The period of Insular art, mainly in the fields of illuminated manuscripts, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice, and the many carved stone crosses that dot the island. These monasteries served as sanctuary to many of the continents great scholars and theologians. It was here that the lamp of Latin learning was preserved for the ages. During this age, the great illuminated manuscripts of Ireland were produced. Arguably the finest such work is The Book of Kells which may still be viewed at Trinity College, Dublin. The first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the Carolingian Renaissance of the Early Middle Ages. Charlemagne, advised by Peter of Pisa and Alcuin of York, attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by decree in AD 787 established schools in every abbey in his empire. These schools, from which the name scholasticism is derived, became centres of medieval learning. During the early Scholastic period, knowledge of the Greek language had vanished in the West except in Ireland, where it was widely dispersed in the monastic schools.MacManus, p 215 Irish scholars had a considerable presence in the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their learning. Among them was Johannes Scotus Eriugena, one of the founders of scholasticism.Toman, p 10: \\"Abelard himself was‚Ä¶ together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and Lanfranc and Anselm of Canterbury (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.\\" Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality. He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the Cappadocian Fathers and the Greek theological tradition. Arrival of the Vikings During the ninth and tenth centuries, waves of Norse warriors ransacked the countryside. The monasteries were favourite targets for their treasures of golden religious ornaments. As the eighth century neared its close, religion and learning still flourished, but unexpected dangers approached and a new enemy came, before whose assaults monk and monastery and saint and scholar disappeared. These invaders were the Danes from the coasts of Scandinavia. Pagans and pirates, they were formidable foes both on land and sea. In Ireland as elsewhere they attacked the monasteries and churches, desecrated the altars, carried away the gold and silver vessels, and smoking ruins and murdered monks attested the fury of their assaults. Under native and Christian chiefs churches were destroyed, church lands appropriated by laymen, monastic schools deserted, and lay abbots ruled at Armagh and elsewhere. Bishops were consecrated without sees and conferred orders for money, there was chaos in church government and corruption everywhere. In a series of synods beginning with R√°th Breasail (1118) and including Kells (1152), at which the pope's legate presided, many salutary enactments were passed, and for the first time diocesan episcopacy was established. Meanwhile, St. Malachy, Archbishop of Armagh, had done very remarkable work in his own diocese and elsewhere. His early death in 1148 was a heavy blow to the cause of church reform. Nor could so many evils be cured in a single life, or by the labours of a single man; and in spite of his efforts and the efforts of others the decrees of synods were often flouted, and the new diocesan boundaries ignored. Anglo-Normans In December 1154, Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, by the Treaty of Wallingford and a large fleet, became in addition Henry II, King of England. In that same month an Englishman, Nicholas Breakspeare, was elected Pope Adrian IV. Henry intended, as shown by his later Constitutions of Clarendon, to establish the supremacy of the civil law and courts above the ecclesiastical law and courts. In the first full year of Henry's reign (1155) he procured the Papal Bull Laudabiliter from the Hertfordshire born Pope Adrian IV, authorizing Henry to proceed to conquer Ireland \\"to check the torrent of wickedness to reform evil manners, to sow the seeds of virtue\\". The quid pro quo was the condition that a penny should be yearly paid from each house to the See of Rome (the still extant Peter's Pence). Henry and the Pope also had other reasons (see Henry II, section \\"Lordship over Ireland\\"). The invasion was put aside while Henry attended to other matters. Henry continued to battle the supreme power of the Church, and Thomas Becket in England. In 1166, Henry took the opportunity to accede to the request by displaced Irish R√≠ of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, for assistance in regaining his Irish territory. A first contingent of the Norman Invasion of Ireland came to Ireland in 1169 under Maurice Fitzgerald, followed by a stronger force under Strongbow (Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke) in 1170, the year Thomas √† Beckett was murdered. In 1171 Henry himself landed at Waterford and proceeded to Dublin, where he spent the winter, and received the submission of most of the Irish chiefs. This submission was outlined in the Treaty of Windsor 1175. Reformation and beyond It was not until the end of the 17th centuries that the Crown of England gained full control of Ireland by means of a series of military campaigns in the period 1534‚Äì1691. During this period, the island was progressively colonised by English and Scottish Protestant settlers. Most of the Irish remained Roman Catholic. =Henry VIII= Henry VIII decided to destroy the power of the Anglo-Norman kings and take control of Ireland. As he did so, he put English lords in charge of confiscated land and plundered the Catholic monasteries and churches, as he had done in England. In 1536 during the Reformation, Henry arranged to be declared head of the Church in Ireland through an act of the Irish Parliament. When the Church of England was reformed under Edward VI, so too was the Church of Ireland. In the beginning of his reign, Henry VIII was preoccupied with more pressing matters in England and on the European Continent, and therefore paid little attention to Ireland. It was not until he had reigned for a quarter of a century on the throne that he turned his attention to Ireland and then it was primarily due his conflict with the Church over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Then Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which invested Henry with spiritual jurisdiction over England and proclaimed him head of the Church of England rather than the Pope. When the proctors of the clergy refused to agree to this measure, the irate monarch deprived them of the right of voting, confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries, in some cases shedding the blood of their inmates, in the remaining cases evicting them and making them homeless and poor. =Elizabeth I= Fearing Ireland's Catholicism and strategic value for her enemies, Elizabeth consolidated English power in Ireland. The established church in Ireland underwent a period of more radical Calvinist doctrine than occurred in England. James Ussher (later Archbishop of Armagh) authored the Irish Articles, adopted in 1615. In 1634, the Irish Convocation adopted the English Thirty-Nine Articles alongside the Irish Articles. After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence; they remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment. The English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism, while the Irish-speaking majority remained faithful to the Latin liturgy of Roman Catholicism. From this period on, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history. =Translation of the Bible into Irish= The first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of Ossory, who worked on it until he was murdered in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and Nehemiah Donellan, Archbishop of Tuam; it was finally completed by William O'Domhnuill (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by William Bedel (1571‚Äì1642), Bishop of Kilmore, who completed his translation within the reign of Charles I, although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh (1638‚Äì1713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the Book of Common Prayer in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664‚Äì1747) and published in 1712. The first translation of the entire Bible that was approved by the church was An B√≠obla Naofa, supervised by P√°draig √ì Fiannachta at Maynooth and published in 1981. Persecution and Penal Laws The Irish Confederate Wars resulted in much destruction of church property. Irish Catholics were severely persecuted under Oliver Cromwell, their situation only slightly improving under the Stuart kings. The land settlements in the aftermath of these wars, and the defeat of James II in 1691, reduced Irish Catholic freeholders to a fraction of their previous size. The introduction of the Penal Laws further proscribed the practise of Roman Catholicism, with many priests and bishops forced into hiding or exile. Not until the 1770s did the religious climate relax, somewhat. Protestant ascendancy (1691‚Äì1801) Before the Stuart accession, Ireland was divided into thirty-four boroughs. In 1613, forty new boroughs were created, all of them dominated by Protestants. The consequence of this was the reduction of the Catholic majority in the Irish parliament to a minority. By the end of the seventeenth century all Catholics, representing some 85% of Ireland's population then, were banned from the Irish parliament. As a result, political power rested entirely in the hands of a British settler-colonial, and more specifically Anglican, minority while the Catholic population suffered severe political and economic privations. By the late 18th century, many of the Anglo-Irish ruling class had come to see Ireland as their native country. A parliamentary faction led by Henry Grattan agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with England and for greater legislative independence for the Parliament of Ireland. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals to enfranchise Irish Catholics. This was enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet enter parliament or become government officials. =Oath of Allegiance= By the Treaty of Limerick the Catholic soldiers of King James were pardoned, protected against forfeiture of their estates, and were free to go abroad if they chose. All Catholics might substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of supremacy, and were to have such privileges \\"as were consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II\\". King William also promised to have the Irish Parliament grant a further relaxation of the penal laws in force. This treaty, however, was soon torn to shreds, and in spite of William's appeals the Irish Parliament refused to ratify it, and embarked on fresh penal legislation. Under these new laws Catholics were excluded from Parliament, from the bench and bar, from the army and navy, from all civil offices, from the corporations, and even from the corporate towns. They could not have Catholic schools at home or attend foreign schools, or inherit landed property, or hold land under lease, or act as executors or administrators, or have arms or ammunition, or a horse worth ¬£5. Neither could they bury their dead in Catholic ruins, or make pilgrimages to holy wells, or observe Catholic holidays. They could not intermarry with the Protestants, the clergyman assisting at such marriages being liable to death. The wife of a Catholic landlord turning Protestant got separate maintenance; the son turning Protestant got the whole estate; and the Catholic landlord having only Catholic children was obliged at death to divide his estate among his children in equal shares. All the regular clergy, as well as bishops and vicars- general, should quit the kingdom. The secular clergy might remain, but must be registered, nor could they have on their churches either steeple or bell. In 1728, the Catholics outnumbered Protestants 5 to 1. A few Catholics managed to hold their estates with the collaboration of friendly Protestants; the remainder gradually sank to the level of cottiers and day-labourers, reduced to a standard of living far below what they had been used to. Many Catholics chose to emigrate in the hopes of finding a more congenial environment. =Irish Parliament and the Passing of Tolerance= In the Irish Parliament meanwhile a spirit of independence appeared. As the Parliament of the Pale it had been so often used for factious purposes that in 1496 Poynings' Law was passed, providing that henceforth no Irish Parliament could meet, and no law could be proposed, without the previous consent of both the Irish and English Privy Councils. Further, the English Parliament claimed the right to legislate for Ireland; and in the laws prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle (1665), and Irish woollen manufactures (1698), and that dealing with the Irish forfeited estates (1700), it asserted its supposed right. When one member, Molyneux, protested, the English Parliament condemned him, and ordered his book to be burned by the common hangman. Moreover, it passed an Act in 1719 expressly declaring that it had power to legislate for Ireland, taking away also the appellate jurisdiction of the Irish House of Lords. The fight made by Swift against Wood's halfpence showed that, though Molyneux was dead, his spirit lived; Lucas continued the fight, and Grattan in 1782 obtained legislative independence. In 1778 by an Act enabling Catholics to hold all lands under lease; and in 1782 by a further Act allowing them to erect Catholic schools with the permission of the Protestant bishop of the diocese, to own a horse worth more than ¬£5, and to assist at Mass without being compelled to accuse the officiating priest. Nor were Catholic bishops any longer compelled to quit the kingdom, nor Catholic children specially rewarded if they turned Protestant. Not for ten years was there any further concession, and then an Act was passed allowing Catholics to erect schools without seeking Protestant permission, admitting Catholics to the Bar, and legalizing marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Much more important was the Act of 1793 giving the Catholics the Parliamentary and municipal franchise, admitting them to the universities and to military and civil offices, and removing all restrictions in regard to the tenure of land. They were still excluded from Parliament, from the inner Bar, and from a few of the higher civil and military offices. Always in favour of religious liberty, Grattan would have swept away every vestige of the Penal code. But, in 1782, he mistakenly thought that his work was done when legislative independence was conceded. He forgot that the executive was still left independent of Parliament, answerable only to the English ministry; and that, with rotten boroughs controlled by a few great families, with an extremely limited franchise in the counties, and with pensioners and placemen filling so many seats, the Irish Parliament was but a mockery of representation. Like Grattan, Flood and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, they were opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of corruption and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from Pitt and Dundas. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of French revolutionary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal viceroy, Lord Westmoreland, was replaced by the liberal-minded Lord Fitzwilliam, who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named Beresford, so powerful that he was called the \\"King of Ireland\\"; he refused to consult Lord Chancellor Fitzgibbon or Foster, the Speaker; he took Grattan and Ponsonby into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from Portland, the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans. He was probably also influenced by Beresford, who had powerful friends in England, and by the king, whom Fitzgibbon had mischievously convinced that to admit Catholics to Parliament would be to violate his coronation oath. Possibly, other causes concurred with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay. The new viceroy, Lord Camden, was instructed to conciliate the Catholic bishops by setting up a Catholic college for the training of Irish priests; this was done by the establishment of Maynooth College. But he was to set his face against all Parliamentary reform and all Catholic concessions. These things he did with a will. He at once restored Beresford to office and Foster and Fitzgibbon to favour, the latter being made Earl of Clare. And he stirred up but too successfully the dying embers of sectarian hate, with the result that the Ulster factions, the Protestant \\"Peep-of-Day Boys\\" and the Catholic \\"Defenders\\", became embittered with a change of names. The latter, turning to republican and revolutionary ways, joined the United Irish Society; the former became merged in the recently formed Orange Society, taking its name from William of Orange and having Protestant ascendancy and hatred of Catholicism as its battle cries. Extending from Ulster, these rival societies brought into the other provinces the curse of sectarian strife. Instead of putting down both, the Government took sides with the Orangemen; and, while their lawless acts were condoned, the Catholics were hunted down. An Arms' Act, an Insurrection Act, an Indemnity Act, a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act placed them outside the pale of law. An undisciplined soldiery, recruited from the Orange lodges, were then let loose among them. Martial law, free quarters, flogging, picketing, half-hanging, destruction of Catholic property and life, outrages on women followed, until at last Catholic blood was turned into flame. Then Wexford rose. Looking back, it now seems certain that, had Hoche landed at Bantry in 1796, had even a small force landed at Wexford in 1798, or a few other counties displayed the heroism of Wexford, English power in Ireland would, temporarily at least, have been destroyed. But one county could not fight the British Empire, and the rebellion was soon quenched in blood. Camden's place was then given to Lord Cornwallis, who came to Ireland for the express purpose of carrying a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did Castlereagh, who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of Mr. Pelham, and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the briefless barrister was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors. =Catholic Emancipation= The next quarter of a century was a period of unrequited hope. Dr. Troy, the Archbishop of Dublin, had been a strong advocate of the Union, and had induced nine of his brother bishops to concede a veto on episcopal appointments, not uncommon in European monarchies. In return, he wanted Emancipation linked with the Union. Castlereagh was not averse; but Pitt was publicly non-committal and vague, though the Catholic Unionists had no doubt that he favoured linking concession with passage of the Union thereby creating a totally new dispensation for a United Kingdom. Disappointment ensued when nothing was done in the first session of the United Parliament, and it was increased when Pitt resigned office and was succeeded by Addington, the narrow-minded Speaker. Cornwallis, however, assured Dr. Troy that Pitt had resigned, unable to overcome the reluctance of King George III, who believed it contravened the Act of Settlement, and his coronation oath. Pitt declared that he would never again take office if emancipation were not conceded. In spite of this, he became Premier again in 1804, no longer an advocate of emancipation having pledged never again to raise the question in Parliament during the lifetime of the king. To this pledge he was as faithful as he had been false to his former assurances; when Fox presented the Catholic petition in 1805, Pitt opposed it. After 1806, when both Pitt and Fox died, the Catholic champion was Grattan, who had entered the British Parliament in 1805. In the vain hope of conciliating opponents he was willing, in 1808, to concede the veto. Dr. Troy and the higher Catholics acquiesced. The other bishops were unwilling, and rejected the offer of a state-paid clergy or state-appointed bishops. The agitation of the question, however, did not cease, and for many years it distracted Catholic plans and weakened Catholic effort. Further complications arose when, in 1814, the prefect of the Propaganda, Quarantotti, issued a rescript favouring the veto. He acted, however, beyond his powers in the absence of Pius VII, who was in France. When the Pope returned to Rome, after the fall of Napoleon, the rescript was disavowed. In these years the Catholics badly needed a leader. John Keogh, the able leader of 1793, was then old, and Lords Fingall and Gormanstone, Mr. Scully and Dr. Dromgoole, were not the men to grapple with great difficulties and powerful opponents. An abler and more vigorous leader was required, one with less faith in petitions and protestations of loyalty. Such a leader was found in Daniel O'Connell, a Catholic barrister whose first public appearance in 1800 was on an anti- Unionist platform. A great lawyer and orator, a great debater, of boundless courage and resources, he took a prominent part on Catholic committees, and from 1810 he held the first place in Catholic esteem. Yet the Catholic cause advanced slowly, and, when Grattan died in 1820, emancipation had not come. Nor would the House of Lords accept Plunket's Bill of 1821, even though it passed the House of Commons and conceded the veto. At last O'Connell determined to rouse the masses, and in 1823, with the help of Richard Lalor Sheil, he founded the Catholic Association. Its progress at first was slow, but gradually it gathered strength. Dr. Murray, the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, joined it, and Dr. Doyle, the great Bishop of Kildare; other bishops followed; the clergy and people also came in; and thus rose a great national organization, supervising from its central office in Dublin subsidiary associations in every parish; maintained by a Catholic rent; watching over local and national affairs, discharging, as Mr. Canning described it, \\"all the functions of a regular government, and having obtained a complete mastery and control over the masses of the Irish people\\". The Association was suppressed in 1825 by Act of Parliament; but O'Connell merely changed the name; and the New Catholic Association with its New Catholic rent continued the work of agitation as of old. Nor was this all. By the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 the forty-shilling freeholders obtained the franchise. These freeholders were in the power of the landlords. Protected by a powerful association, and encouraged by the priests and by O'Connell, the freeholders broke free. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, and elsewhere they voted for the nominees of the Catholic Association at elections, and humbled the landlords. They returned O'Connell himself for Clare in 1828. The Tory ministers, Wellington and Peel, steered the passage of the Catholic Relief Bill of 1829. The forty-shilling freeholders, however, were temporarily disfranchised, and provisions excluding Catholics from some of the higher civil and military offices, prohibiting priests from wearing vestments outside their churches, bishops from assuming the titles of their sees, and clergy from obtaining charitable bequests. In other respects U.K. Roman Catholics were placed on a level with other denominations, and at last were fully admitted within to the benefits fruits of the constitution. The Irish Catholics had several grievances still calling for redress: the established state Church, landlordism, and educational inequality. Mr. Gladstone commenced with the Church of Ireland. He introduced a Bill disendowing and disestablishing it. Commissioners were appointed to wind it up, taking charge of its property, then computed at more than ¬£15,000,000. Of this sum, ¬£11,000,000 was given to the disestablished Church, part to the holders of existing offices, part to enable the Church to continue its work. A further sum of nearly ¬£1,000,000 was distributed between Maynooth College, deprived of its annual grant, and the Presbyterian Church deprived of the Regium Donum, the latter getting twice as much as the former. The surplus was to be disposed of by Parliament for such public objects as it might determine. Free State and Republic (1922‚Äìpresent) Political map of Ireland The Roman Catholic Church has had a powerful influence over the Irish state since its inception in 1922 although that influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, banning, for example, divorce, contraception, abortion and pornography as well as encouraging the censoring of many books and films. In addition the church largely controlled the state's hospitals and schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services. With the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868‚Äì1966, (1993) p.431 By the 1960s, the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as Ne Temere, whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics. Sexual abuse scandals Since the early 1990s, the church in Ireland has been rocked by many cases of sexual abuse. Enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in- depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. Influence on Irish society=Ireland=Politics In the Irish Free State, now Ireland, the church had a great influence on public opinion as it had supervised public education for about 90% of the population since at least the 1830s. Historically it was associated with the Jacobite movement until 1766, and with Irish nationalism after Catholic emancipation was secured in 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869‚Äì71, when its most significant leaders included Bishop James Doyle, Cardinal Cullen and Archbishop MacHale. The hierarchy supported the democratic and mainly non- violent Irish Parliamentary Party in the 1880s, and its offshoots, and the policy of Irish Home Rule in 1886‚Äì1920. It did not support the Irish republican movement until 1921, as it espoused violence, in spite of support from many individual priests, and opposed the anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. Despite this relative moderation, Irish Protestants were concerned that a self-governing Ireland would result in \\"Rome Rule\\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in the creation of Northern Ireland. Major popular church events attended by the political world have included the Eucharistic Congress in 1932 and the Papal Visit in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was Archbishop McQuaid, who retired in 1972. Education After independence in 1922, the Church remained heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and running institutions which were staffed by Catholic religious institutes, largely because the new state remained impoverished. Its main political effect was to continue to run schools where religious education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by Donogh O'Malley, in part because they ran almost all such schools. Some have argued that the church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.E. Brian Titley \\"Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900‚Äì1944\\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983. Health care From 1930 hospitals were funded by a sweepstake (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests. On health matters it was seen as unsympathetic to women's needs and in 1950 it opposed the Mother and Child Scheme. Morality and censorship It helped reinforce public censorship and maintained its own list of banned literature which influenced the State's list. Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing feminist movement. For instance the Health (Family Planning) Act of 1979 showed the ability of the Catholic Church to force the government into a compromise situation over artificial contraception, though unable to get the result it wanted; contraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. In the 1983 Amendment to the constitution introduced the constitutional prohibition of abortion, which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons remains illegal under Irish statute law. However the Church failed to influence the June 1996 removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the church had opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its canon law allowed for a law of nullity and a limited divorce \\"a mensa et thoro\\", effectively a form of marital separation. In a further repudiation of the church's teaching, on 22 May 2015, 62% of Irish voters approved the legalization of same sex marriage in Ireland. =Northern Ireland= The Government of Ireland Act of 1920 acted as the constitution of Northern Ireland, in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens. Here Roman Catholics formed a minority of some 35% of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland. The Roman Catholic schools' council was at first resistant in accepting the role of the government of Northern Ireland, and initially accepted funding only from the government of the Irish Free State and admitting no school inspectors. Thus it was that the Lynn Committee presented a report to the government, from which an Education Bill was created to update the education system in Northern Ireland, without any co-operation from the Roman Catholic section in education. Instead, in regard to the Roman Catholic schools, the report relied on the guidance of a Roman Catholic who was to become the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Education ‚Äî A. N. Bonaparte Wyse. Many commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of gerrymandering and preference in public services for non-Catholics led to the need for a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967. =Vatican II= In both parts of Ireland Church policy and practice changed markedly after the Vatican II reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that Mass could be said in vernacular languages and not in Latin, and in 1981 the Church commissioned its first edition of the Bible in Irish.

The museum in Arcadia Park occupies an entire city block bounded by Park, Wessels, Schoeman and Johann Streets. The Pretoria Art Museum was established to house the City Council of Pretoria's Art Collection, built up since the 1930s. The collection received an early windfall in 1932 when Lady Michaelis bequeathed a large number of artworks to the city council after the death of her husband, Sir Max Michaelis. The collection consisted mainly of 17th-century work of the \\"North Dutch school\\",.The Pretoria Art Museum appears to be the only institution that uses this phrase to describe the \\"Dutch Masters\\". South African works included pieces by Henk Pierneef, Pieter Wenning, Frans Oerder, Anton van Wouw and Irma Stern. The collection was originally housed in the Town Hall. As South African museums in Cape Town and Johannesburg already had good collections of 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century European art, it was decided to focus on compiling a representative collection of South African art. Aside from these artists, work by Pieter Hugo Naud√©, Maggie Laubser and others was acquired.History The purchase of international work was focused on more affordable graphics prints from Europe and USA. More recently there was greater emphasis on contemporary South African art and building a more representative historical collection also traditional arts and new-media. After the death of the sculptor Lucas Sithole 1994, half of his unfinished work by Haenggi Foundation was donated to the museum after documented by art historian Elza Miles.LUCAS SITHOLE VIRTUAL MUSEUM The South African collection now includes work by Gerard Sekoto and Judith Mason.Art galleries in Gauteng Since the mid-1990s, the New Signatures competition is also held at the Pretoria Art Museum.Sasol New Signatures History The Pretoria City Council in 1954 decided that a building was needed to house the art collection. The firm of architects Burg, Lodge and Burg and W.G. McIntosh and the builder J. Zylstra (Pty) Ltd was appointed. The curator of the Johannesburg Art Museum, Anton Hendriks in an advisory capacity, and the city clerk of Pretoria, Henry Preiss, was the driving force behind the project; in 1956 he was on holiday in Europe on tour, where he studied art museums studied. Building began on 26 January 1962 and the cornerstone was laid on 19 October 1962 by the then Prime Minister Dr HF Verwoerd and the mayor of Pretoria, Councillor E. Smith. The building of concrete and glass was completed over 18 months at a cost of R400,000. The design in the modern International Style design and technical innovations feasible at that time were used. The museum was officially inaugurated on 20 May 1964 by the new mayor of Pretoria, Dr PJ van der Walt. The first curator of the new Pretoria Art Museum, Dr. Albert Werth, was appointed early in 1963 and until his retirement in 1991 was director of the art museum. Additional exhibit space was created in 1975 with the creation of secretion of an open area between the entrance and the East Gallery. It was constructed in 1988 and again in 1999 upgraded.

History According to popular legend, the town's name is derived from the samarsing, or horn of a Samar, an animal. Historically, it was used as a gateway to the local kingdom, Haihay. When there was any invasion this samarsing horn to alert the security of the kingdom. The King's palace was situated on the bank of the Bheden river. A Shiva temple had been constructed at Mahadevpali by the king on the river bank. The king of Ratnapur (Surguja) attacked this kingdom over the marriage of the only daughter of the Haihay king. During this aggression the Haihay King was killed and his kingdom was destroyed. People say the 7 rani, the king's wives, committed suicide when the king was killed; a spot near the ancient palace on the Beden river is a tourist destination known as Rani Darah. In the 16th century, Balram Dev, the first Chouhan king of Sambalpur, occupied this fort and there was a war between the Sambalpur king and the Ratnapur king, as a result of which the importance of the Bhogaragarh fort declined. For a long time the Bhogaragarh fort and the surrounding temples remained abandoned. As a result, the temples near the fort decayed. A few years back, the villagers of Mahadevpali constructed a new temple at the original site. Local history is clearly linked with this temple, so it is considered to be one of the Astaswayambhus of Jharsuguda district. Every year, a fair takes place here on the day of Sivaratri. Flora and fauna Domestic animals and birds include cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, parrots, champa and maina. Cultivated plants include tulsi, mango, guava, banana, rose, dahlia, chauldhua, kuiler, coconut, lichi, apple, Moringa oleifera and many others. Monkeys, rabbits and elephants are commonly found in the jungle. Local vegetation is composed of sishu, kendu, Madhuca indica, Azadirachta indica, Tamarindus indica, Ficus religiosa, Ficus bengalensis, kusam, jam, palm, saguan, harda, bahara, ananla, bel, char, krushnachuda, tut, kaha, kia, semel and a wide range of other plants. Economy, demographics and religion 100% of the population of the village practices Hinduism. Most of the villagers are farmers and a significant number are teachers. Shops sell a wide variety of goods. A few people are also engaged in professions like IT, law enforcement, management, medicine, research and technical.

The ancient cave of Bikramkhol is located near this village, where a group of people lived starting around 4000 BC. There are ancient script carvings in the wall of the Bikramkhol cave and also paintings of animals. Circular holes have been dug in the wall from which weapons, dress and other useful household items were suspended. There are also circular holes on the floor where grains were pounded. Bikramkhol has been declared a tourist spot by the Central Government and tourists, historians and researchers from all over the country and abroad. =Ruins of Hill Forts of Ulapgarh= On the Jharsuguda-Belpahar Road 21 km from Jharsuguda lies the village Lajkura. In the vicinity there is a hill known as \\"Maheswar Pahad\\" where the remains of an old holy fort attracts the attention of historians, researchers and tourists. At the foot of Maheswar Pahad, there is a village named \\"Ulap\\". The ruins of Ulapgarh are located about one kilometre from the village. Here, the Maheswar pahad is about high and on the top there is a huge plain, where the fort of Ulapgarh stands. The plain is about 400 metres long and 250 metres wide. On the eastern side of the fort there are several kilometres of densely forested Baramunda Hills and on the western side, the Belpahar Railway Station is located at a distance of 5 km. On the north there is a dense forest stretching up to Hemgir and in the south stretching up to the village of Badjob. A moat, 4 metres wide and 150 metres long, runs east to west. There was a Sivalingam and a place of worship in the Fort. A well dug within the Fort provided drinking water to the residents of the Fort throughout the year. On the stone floor, there are many square and round holes, with diameters varying from 1-3 inches. Wooden poles used to be inserted into these holes to support super structures for living space, storage, arsenals, kitchen, sleeping areas and so on. About 1000 people could take shelter at Ulapgarh at a time. On the western side of Ulapgarh and down the slope there is a cave named Ushakothi. On the walls and floors of this cave there are also circular and square holes, which the defence personnel of the fort may have used to suspend their clothes and other belongings from wooden poles fitted to these holes. The soldiers of the dense forest of Maheswar hill could easily overpower the enemies before they could climb up the hill and attack the fort. It is believed that Ulapgarh was being used as a residential fort by kings of the Naja Dynasty. Indian and foreign researchers and historians are researching in this direction. =Padmasini Temple of Padampur= The Hirakud reservoir lies 60 km from Jharsuguda, near Bhikampali. There was once a town called \\"Padampur\\" located where the Mahanadi river leaves Madhya Pradesh and enters Orissa to pour into the Hirakud reservoir. The Sanskrit dramatist \\"Bhabahbhoti\\" was believed to be born here. The Bajrajan Tantraof Buddhism may have originated here. Padmasini is the reigning goddess of this town. The Padmasini temple was constructed in the seventh century A.D. by a Chalukya king; the original temple decayed and was believed to be reconstructed by the Chouhan king of Sambalpur in the 16th century. The Jagmohan of original temple reveals a striking resemblance to architecture of the Chalukya era. Even the stone statue of the goddess Padmasini bears striking similarities to the style of the Chalukya period. In the whole of Orissa, this Padmasini Temple is a unique example of Chalukya art and architecture. In 1956, Padampur was submerged in Hirakud reservoir, but the deity was shifted to a new temple at nearby Pujaripali. It is uncertain who made the original statue of Padmasini, although it is probably also seventh century in origin. =Ramchandi: An ancient Shaktipitha= This important place of ‚ÄòShakti Worship‚Äô is 10 km. away from Jharsuguda town inside a cave. Rampur Dandapat (Jamindari) was created during the reigning ‚ÄòChhatrasai Dev‚Äô the 7th King of Sambalpur (1657‚Äì1695). One Khytriya youth of Rajpotana belonging to Gaharwal family ‚ÄòPrannath Singh‚Äô with his valour subdued the local aborigines of Rampur area in IB basin and received Rampur area as Jagirdari from Chhatrasai Dev, the ruling king of Sambalpur. The Rampur Jamindari had an area of 786 sq. miles. Davi Ramchandi has been worshipped as the reigning deity of the Rampur region since time immemorial. Many pilgrims and devotees come to the Rampur cave from far and near to worship the goddess Ramchandi. =Koilighugar Waterfall= The Koilighugar water fall is situated 55 km away from Jharsuguda in the Lakhanpur block near the village Kushmelbahal. A rivulet named ‚ÄòAhiraj‚Äô originates in the ‚ÄòChhuikhanch‚Äô forest and while flowing through its rocky belt falls from a height of creating the water fall of Koilighugar. After the fall the rivulet flows westwards to merge into the Mahanadi river. Inside the fall there is a Shivalingam known as ‚ÄòMaheswarnath‚Äô. The lingam is submerged in water and not ordinarily visible. If somebody tries to see it from inside the water in winter and summer the lingum is visible under the reflected sunlight, hence for the benefit of the pilgrims another Sivalingam has been created outside the waterfall. There is an Ashram of a holy man, or Saham swami near the water fall. Every year a fair sits in Kalighugar on the occasion of Maha Sivaratri. =Ancient Siva Shrine of Jhadeswar Temple, Jharsuguda= The Jhadeswar temple is located at a distance of about 1 km. from the Jharsuguda Railway station beyond the old town Purunabasti inside a small forest. There is a Swayambhu Sivalingam here the actual age of which is unknown; during the reign of Govind Singh Jamindar of Jharsuguda the lingam was worshipped inside a hut made of leaves. In 1916, a Gujarati contractor named Mulju Jagmal erected a small temple here. The Jamindar of Jharsuguda arranged Savayats for daily worship and donated agricultural lands for maintenance of the temple and puja. The temple was renovated in 1969 by a philanthropist from Calcutta, Lt. Surajmal Mohota. Since 1916 a fair takes place here on every Sivaratri day. The Jhadeswar temple area has important significance in the history of Jharsuguda. On the eastern side of the temple the original ‚ÄòJharguda‚Äô settlement has grown. On its northern side there was a settlement of ‚ÄòGond subject‚Äô of the Jamindar of Jharsuguda. Jhadeswar temple is recognised as original Siva shrine. ‚ÄòAdyaswambhu pitha‚Äô of Jharsuguda. A small garden has been grown near the Jhadeswar temple which is used as a picnic spot. =Shree Pahadeswar Temple, Jharsuguda= It is situated at the top of a small hill on the eastern side of Jharsuguda and is another place of attraction in the District. The temple was constructed by a Gujarati Contractor Lt. Bitthal Bhai Saha in 1921. With its natural surroundings and because its accessibility, it attracts a lot of visitors. From the hill top a bird‚Äôs eye view of Jharsuguda town enthrals the visitors.

It has almost 900 inhabitants (2003).:de:Einwohnerentwicklung von G√∂rlitz#Stadt- und Ortsteile Together with the village Ober-Neundorf it is the northernmost part of the city.  History  The church of Ludwigsdorf was built by 1175, according to the newest dendrochronological investigations. According to that, Ludwigsdorf presumably was founded in the course of the German Ostsiedlung. It is obvious that when the church was built there had to be a certain prosperity yet to manage the building and maintenance of the church. Most of the grubbing and construction phase must have been ended in 1175. The type of the settlement is a Waldhufendorf. Under the name Lodewigesdorph (village of Louis) it was mentioned first in 1305, in 1413 it was written Lodewigisdorf, in 1430 Ludwigsdorff, in 1534 Lustorf and in 1559 Lostorf. In February and March 1431 the Hussites were in Ludwigsdorf. Because 1539 the council of G√∂rlitz bought the village from Urban Emrich, it belonged to G√∂rlitz once before the incorporation in 1999. In 1621 Lord of Salza auf Ebersbach bought it. About 1665 it was probably the divided into Upper- and Lower-Ludwigsdorf. At the time of the War of the Sixth Coalition, from 1813 till 1816, Lower-Ludwigsdorf was afflicted with military billeting, according to the records of the then head of the municipality Gottlieb Winkler. Since 1950 Ober-Neundorf has belonged to Ludwigsdorf. About that time the two parts Upper- and Lower-Ludwigsdorf were no longer mentioned separately.  Sights  choir tower church in Ludwigsdorf (point of view: south east) Rediscovered portal from the transition period from the Romanesque to Gothic Parish church The church of Ludwigsdorf is mentioned first 1346 in the Mei√üner Bistumsmatrikel. The distinct higher age of the building could be documented with the help of dendrochronological investigations. According to that the choir was already completed shortly after 1175, the Saal (spezial form of a hall) about 1192. Apparently it was originally intended as a Saal church aisleless church with Chorquadrat and Apse. This represents a type widespread in Central Germany. The high age of the church of Ludwigsdorf gives reason to rethink again the beginning and process of the Ostsiedlung. Previously it was assumed that not until around 1200 a great many of settlers came to the Neisse Valley. Maybe already at the beginning of the 13th century, the choir was extended to a tower, so the church of Ludwigsdorf is since then a type of a choir tower church :de:Chorturmkirche, which is rare in Upper Lusatia. The roof framework of the choir was used again for the tower roof and so remained completely intact. The water mill The water mill is in Lower Ludwigsdorf at the M√ºhlgraben, a branch of the river Neisse. Previously, the mill was used to mill flour. Today there is a gastronomic event with the special atmosphere of a former mill .  Economy and Transportation  There is a customs office Ludwigsdorf at the motorway border crossing.

S. Gilbert in 1878‚Äì79 based on Goethe's version of part of the Faust legend. The play was first performed at the Olympic Theatre on 24 March 1879. The piece starred Marion Terry in the title role, H. B. Conway as Faustus and Frank Archer as Mephisto. The play was not a success and closed after about 18 performances on 12 April 1879.Moss, Simon. \\"Gretchen\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009 Background W.S. Gilbert in about 1878 Gilbert and Sullivan produced their hit comic opera H.M.S. Pinafore in May 1878, and Gilbert turned to Gretchen as his next project. Gilbert was by then one of the most famous playwrights in England, but he was known more for comedies than dramas, and so Gretchen was anticipated with much curiosity.Stedman, p. 168 Although Gilbert had met with some success in earlier dramas, his last such piece, The Ne'er-do-Weel (also at the Olympic), had met with a difficult reception in 1878.Knight, Joseph. Theatrical Notes, (Lawrence & Bullen: 1893), pp. 206‚Äì15 Gilbert was inspired to write Gretchen after seeing a picture called \\"Regrets\\", showing two priests, one of whom looks wistfully at a pair of lovers.Stedman, p. 167 He began to study Goethe's Faust in April 1878 and was ready to show his plot outline to Henry Neville, manager of the Olympic Theatre, in June 1878.Stedman, p. 163 Gilbert worked for a total of ten months on the play. He finished writing the play in December 1878 but did not agree with Neville on many production details, including which set and costume designers to use and some of the casting decisions.Stedman, p. 165Ainger, pp. 167‚Äì68 The cover of the theatre programme carried a lengthy note by Gilbert earnestly explaining that he was not attempting to put Faust on stage in its entirety, but simply to \\"re-model... the story of Gretchen's downfall\\".Gilbert, W. S. Gretchen theatre programme, 24 March 1879 Gilbert's version of the story differs from most Faust tellings in that Faust makes no agreement with the Devil. The Devil shows him a vision of Gretchen, and Gretchen sees Faust in a dream before she meets him. The Devil, in Gilbert's version, becomes a mere anticlerical raisonneur. Gretchen lasted only three weeks, although it was given in America in 1886, with May Fortescue in the title role.\\"Miss Fortescue as Gretchen\\", The New York Times 19 October 1886, p. 5, accessed 29 October 2009 After the failure of Gretchen, Gilbert concentrated on the highly profitable Savoy Operas, writing only a few more plays during the rest of his life.List of Gilbert's Plays, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 September 2012 Reception Gilbert wrote, in an introductory \\"Notice\\" to the printed version, that the play \\"was received with exceptional favour by a crowded house\\", and that the theatre manager had not given the play a chance by closing it so soon, when it had premiered during Lent.Gilbert, W. S. Gretchen, London: Newman & Co., 1879, available at the Internet Archive The box-office receipts fell off sharply after an enthusiastic opening. He later told an interviewer: \\"I consider the two best plays I ever wrote were Broken Hearts and a version of the Faust legend called Gretchen.

The Times gave the play a long and respectful notice,\\"The Olympic Theatre\\". The Times, 26 March 1879, p. 5, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 31 July 2011 The Observer praised the play but was lukewarm about most of the acting,The Observer, 30 March 1879, p. 3 and The Manchester Guardian called Gretchen \\"Little better than a travesty.... Some admirably written blank verse is the only merit which the play possesses.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 27 March 1879, p. 5 Reviewing the play's 1886 American production, The New York Times did not judge it to be among Gilbert's best, although the paper did find the treatment of the Faust story interesting, with many novel touches. Synopsis Faustus is a monk who had once been a soldier. He had fallen in love with a woman who left him for a wealthier man. Faustus joins the Church to escape from women and the world. Soon, he realises that his life in monastic isolation is a hollow sham, and he desires to live in the real world, though he is still completely disillusioned with it. Mephisto, the Devil, shows him a vision of a truly pure woman ‚Äì Gretchen. Faustus returns to the world to seek her. Gretchen dreams of Faustus, and her cousin Gottfried, who wishes to marry her, entrusts her to the care of Faustus when he marches to war. When Faustus and Gretchen meet, they are irresistibly drawn to each other. Faustus knows that taking her as his lover would corrupt her perfect purity, but his love for her is too strong, and they end up in each other's arms. Three months later she is pregnant, and he confesses that he cannot marry her, as he has taken the monastic vow. Horrified, she tells him to leave her and return to the Church. Gottfried returns from battle and proposes marriage to her but is rejected. When he realises why, he threatens to kill his betrayer, Faustus. Gretchen falls grievously ill because of her sin. Faustus, anguished with guilt at what he has done, reverts to the monk's habit and cries: \\"Send me my death, oh Heaven ‚Äì send me my death!\\" Gottfried bursts in to kill Faustus, but they reconcile at Gretchen's deathbed. As she dies, Gretchen forgives Faustus, advising him to devote the rest of his life to \\"faith, and truth, and works of charity\\". Roles *Dominic ‚Äì J. A.

Mousta in Broken Hearts (1875) is a hunchback rejected by a woman, and in The Yeomen of the Guard, Jack Point is destroyed by losing his love. A disappointment in love leads them to retreat from the world, to become misanthropes and outcasts.Crowther, Andrew. \\"Hunchbacks, Misanthropes and Outsiders: Gilbert's Self-Image\\", GASBAG no. 206 (Winter 1998) Faustus is a sympathetic, but deeply flawed character. Through him, Gilbert attempts to blur the moral absolutes of Victorian drama, just as he does in his comic plays.Crowther (2000), p. 114 Faustus has turned his back on the world which hurt him so deeply, but he is no happier in isolation in the monastery, as he cannot hew to the moral absolutes of the Church. He hopes to be purified by loving the pure Gretchen, but instead his influence corrupts and eventually kills her. He pleads for death, but Gretchen's dying words of advice are that he should not escape from guilt with \\"coward death\\", but instead atone through \\"faith, and truth, and works of charity\\". But Faustus has no correct course, unable to find peace by following the Church or living in the real world. There is no reason to believe that Faustus will be able to do hold to his promise of faith, truth and charity. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther commented that Faustus is part of a recurring theme of \\"the unresolvable paradox of the outsider who seeks acceptance, the misanthrope who wants to be loved\\", and represents an aspect of Gilbert himself. Crowther wrote: \\"Faustus calls himself a cynic, as the critics often called Gilbert, but retains his belief in female purity ‚Äì a sentimental aspect of Gilbert which is demonstrated clearly enough in [Broken Hearts and Gretchen]. Also, just as Gilbert satirised the Establishment of which he became at length a part, so Faustus scorns worldly things and at the same time desires them\\". See also *List of W. S.

The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties is Frances Burney‚Äôs last novel. Published in March 1814 by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown, this historical novel with Gothic overtones set during the 1790s tells the story of a mysterious woman who attempts to support herself while hiding her identity. The novel focuses on the difficulties faced by women as they strive for economic and social independence. Begun in the 1790s, the novel took Burney fourteen years to complete. She worked on it sporadically while she wrote plays and was an exile in France. Although the first edition sold out on the strength of Burney's reputation, the scathing reviews of the novel caused it to sell poorly. Reviewers disliked its portrayal of women and its criticism of English society. Composition Burney spent fourteen years writing The Wanderer‚Äîthe longest amount of time she spent writing any of her works. She began the novel in the late 1790s, after finishing Camilla, but stopped, deciding to write plays, which were more profitable.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", viii‚Äìix. In 1801, Burney's husband, General Alexandre-Jean-Baptiste Piochard D'Arblay, returned to his home country of France and tried to acquire a commission in the French army that would not require him to fight the English. He was unsuccessful and could not then leave France without raising the suspicions of the government, so Burney joined him in April 1802. The Napoleonic Wars, which had halted briefly, resumed and Burney was forced to spend ten years as an exile in France.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", ix. While there, she worked on a draft of The Wanderer; however, no manuscript of the novel exists, so it is impossible to track the exact progress of the novel.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", x. In 1812, Burney left France with her son on the Mary Anne, ostensibly to go to the United States; in actuality, she intended to return in England. The ship illegally docked in England and was captured, making Burney and a few other passengers nominally prisoners.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xi. Burney had not originally intended to work on the novel while in England, but during a long wait for her ship at Dunkirk, she had decided to continue working on it. Burney's husband sent her the manuscript there, to do which he had to promise the French government that \\"upon his Honour...the Work had nothing in it political, nor even National...possibly offensive to the Government\\". The customs officer, however, was enraged that the manuscript had been sent. According to Burney, he \\"began a rant of indignation & amazement, at a sight so unexpected & prohibited...He sputtered at the Mouth, & stamped with his feet\\".Qtd. in Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xii, note 6. He accused Burney of being a traitor; Burney herself believed that without the help of an English merchant at the time, her manuscript would have been destroyed. However in her Dedication Burney gave a completely opposite account, no doubt to avoid any difficulties for her husband in France.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xi and xii, note 6. Plot and themes The Wanderer is set during the Reign of Terror, exemplified by the rise and fall of Maximilien Robespierre. The Wanderer opens with a group of people fleeing the Terror. Among them is the protagonist, who refuses to identify herself. No one can place her socially‚Äîeven her nationality and race are in doubt. As Burney scholar Margaret Doody explains, \\"the heroine thus arrives [in England] as a nameless Everywoman: both black and white, both Eastern and Western, both high and low, both English and French.\\"Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xv. She asks for help from the group, but because she knows no one, she is refused. The protagonist, later identified as Juliet Granville, tries to become self-sufficient, but her story reveals the ‚Äúdifficulties‚Äù of a woman in her friendless situation. Women take advantage of her economically and men importune her. She is ‚Äúa woman totally dispossessed by political events‚Äù. Miss Arbe, for example, takes control of Juliet's life and her money (although inexpertly); she also attempts to organise a ladies committee, becoming \\"a comic spectacle of political life\\".Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xviii. Specifically, Burney compares Miss Arbe to Robespierre: as Doody explains, \\"the arrangements of both become swallowed in egotism, are highly disorganized if impetuously directed, and are bound to end in failure\\".Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xix. Throughout The Wanderer, Burney comments on the tyrannical hold that the rich have over the poor in England, showing how the wealthy will accept music lessons from Juliet but refuse to pay for them, placing her in a desperate situation. She also charts the downward spiral of Juliet from gentility to working woman; she begins as a musician and slips into the less-reputable positions of milliner and seamstress. In her cross-class analysis of the problems of women, Burney was probably influenced by Mary Wollstonecraft's Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798).Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxxi‚Äìxxxii. However, according to Doody, \\"Burney is the first novelist seriously to express sympathy for the working women in their normal conditions of work‚Äîand to see how the system of employment, not merely individual bad employers, creates conditions of impossible monotony.\\"Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxxi. Elinor Joddrel is the antagonist of the story. She controls her own destiny, largely because she is an umarried heiress, and articulates \\"feminist views on the economic and sexual oppression of women\\". During the 1790s, novelists often portrayed feminist characters, sometimes as heroines, such as in Mary Hays‚Äôs Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796), but more frequently as \\"grotesque satires\\" as in Elizabeth Hamilton‚Äôs Memoirs of Modern Philosophers (1800). In the character of Elinor, Justine Crump argues in her article on the novel for The Literary Encyclopedia, Burney represents feminist arguments, but she does not either explicitly criticise or endorse them. Doody, however, contends that Burney endorses Elinor's feminist arguments because no character contradicts them and Juliet appears to agree with them. When the two discuss women's issues, Juliet does not dispute Elinor's point of view, she adds more points to her argument.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxx. Elinor falls hopelessly in love with Harleigh, the brother of her fianc√© and a suitor of Juliet's. Harleigh is uncertain whether he should propose to Juliet, as he knows nothing of her family and she earns money by giving young ladies music lesson and instruction on the harp. After Harleigh rejects her, Elinor ‚Äúabandons decorum altogether‚Äù; she dresses up as a man and frightens Juliet with her threats of suicide. It is Harleigh who discovers Juliet's true identity‚Äîshe is the daughter of a \\"clandestine\\" marriage of the Earl of Granville. She was raised in France and forced to marry a revolutionary to save her guardian from the guillotine. Juliet fled the marriage, but her husband pursued her, believing that she would inherit the Granville fortune. The Granville family know of her predicament, but refuse to help her. Harleigh abandons Juliet after discovering that she is married. She is eventually rescued by a friend. In the end, Juliet's husband is deported and executed as a spy; her guardian comes to England, thereby granting her respectability and her inheritance. Harleigh returns and proposes. Finally, ‚ÄúElinor is brought to repudiate, if not her feminist principles, at least her suicidal intentions, and order is restored to the novel‚Äù. However, as Doody explains, \\"Burney gives us the 'happy ending' of course, but not until after she has made sure that we see it is just a formality, and by no means a solution.\\"Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiv. The reader cares little for Juliet's marriage to Harleigh and recognises instead that she has become a commodity. The love triangle between Harleigh, Elinor, and Juliet suggests that Elinor should be a villainess who disrupts the happy love of Harleigh and Juliet, however the characterisations of both Elinor and Harleigh challenge this assumption. Harleigh is a \\"very passive and fussy person\\", and as Doody argues, \\"he does not satisfy our ideas of the 'hero' of a love story‚Äîwho ought to be handsome, dashing, strong, and courageous, if a trifle self-willed.\\"Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxiii. His purpose in the novel is to mark out what is respectable and proper, claiming that Juliet should not perform her music in public nor should she profit monetarily from it.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxiv‚Äìxxv. Juliet's defence of her performances to Harleigh mirror Burney's own defence of playwriting to her father, Charles Burney, who strongly disapproved.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxv. Harleigh is named after Henry Mackenzie's Harley in The Man of Feeling (1771) and reminiscent of him‚Äîa hero of \\"sentiment and delicacy\\". Genre The Wanderer is a historical novel, part of a new genre that was a response to the French Revolution. During the 1790s and early 19th century, novelists examined the past using fiction. Charlotte Turner Smith analysed the revolution in Desmond (1792) and The Banished Man (1794) while Jane West's The Loyalists looked at the English Civil War. Sir Walter Scott's Waverley (1814) was published the same year as The Wanderer.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xiii. Although the novel is set during 1793‚Äì94, \\"the dire reign of the terrific Robespierre\\", Burney does not fill the text with references to specific historical events. Neither Louis XVI nor Marie Antoinette are mentioned in the novel, for example.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xiii‚Äìxiv. The Wanderer also draws on the conventions of Gothic fiction, specifically \\"mystery and concealment, spying and flight\\".Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xiv. Like Ann Radcliffe's The Romance of the Forest (1791), the heroine of The Wanderer is unknown and in need of sympathy at the beginning of the story. Throughout the story, the heroine's name is consistently concealed and later only half-revealed. Publication and reception Critic William Hazlitt's harsh review of The Wanderer helped turn public opinion against it. The Wanderer was published in five volumes by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown on 28 March 1814.Doody, \\"Note on the text\\", xxxviii. Burney was one of the most popular novelists in Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, but she had not published a novel since 1796. The Wanderer was greatly anticipated and Longman printed a large first edition of 3,000 copies. All of these copies were sold to booksellers before the novel's actual release. Believing the novel would be a best-seller, they issued a second edition of 1,000 copies on 15 April 1814 and planned three additional ones. However, compared to Burney's earlier novels, The Wanderer was not a success. Only 461 copies of the second edition were sold during 1814 and over the next ten years, only 74. The leftovers were pulped. The Wanderer was translated into French by and Auguste-Jacques Lemierre d'Argy under the title La Femme errante and published in Paris in 1814; Burney described the translation as \\"abominable\\".Doody, \\"Note on the text\\", xxxix. A three-volume American edition was published in New York in 1814. No other editions were published until Pandora Press's 1988 reissue. The Wanderer received unfavorable reviews, \\"with one or two quite damning\\",Crump which may have seriously affected its sales. Reviewers argued that Burney's earlier novels had been better; The Wanderer was improbable and the language was \\"prolix and obscure\\". They were also taken aback by its criticism of England at a time when the entire country was celebrating its victory over Napoleon.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiii. The negative reviews were published quickly (for the 19th century): two hostile reviews appeared in April 1814; a genuinely favourable review did not appear until April 1815.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxxiii, note 18. Critic William Hazlitt, in particular, complained in the Edinburgh Review about the novel's focus on women: ‚ÄúThe difficulties in which [Burney] involves her heroines are indeed, ‚ÄòFemale Difficulties;‚Äô ‚Äì they are difficulties created out of nothing.‚Äù According to Hazlitt, women did not have problems that could be made into interesting fiction. The reviewer for the British Critic found the character of Elinor distasteful and guided readers to Hamilton's more conservative Memoirs of Modern Philosophers.Doody, \\"Introduction\\", xxix. Since the 1980s, The Wanderer, along with Burney's other works, has become the focus of serious scholarship and is popular among students.

The long, narrow island is approximately long and at its widest point. The island has served in the past as a fishing settlement and a Coast Guard life saving station. History The earliest residents of the island were the Abenaki, who called the island Aquahega or \\"place of landing.\\"Woodard, p. 84. As early as 1604, the island was settled as a commercial fishing enterprise, with Francis Popham among those sending fishing vessels there on yearly expeditions.Duncan, p. 48 Captain John Smith charted the island as \\"Damerils Iles\\" after a visit in 1614, with the name traditionally attributed to Humphrey Damerill.Griffin, p. 17. Damerill had been a member of the failed Popham Colony, but moved to Damariscove in 1608 to establish a store to supply the fishing community.Duncan, p. 111 By 1622, the island was home to 13 year-round fishermen, with 2 shallops in the winter and up to 30 sailing ships fishing the waters in the spring.Boothbay Region Land Trust The fishermen had also constructed a fort with a palisade and mounted gun. When the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony were facing starvation in the spring of 1622, they sent a boat to Damariscove to beg for assistance. The fishermen responded by filling the colonists‚Äô boat with cod which helped ensure the Pilgrims‚Äô survival.Duncan, p. 111; reprinted in . Damariscove had become a thriving community when in 1671, Massachusetts Bay Colony laid claim to the island, extending their eastern borders. Over the next few years, the Massachusetts General Court established a local government there, and appointed a military officer and constable. The court also granted a license for a house of entertainment, while assessing taxes for the first time.Griffin, p. 20. On August 20, 1676, in the aftermath of King Philip's War, a massive Native American assault attacked and burned every settlement east of the Kennebec River, including the nearby settlement of Pemaquid.Woodard, p. 109. Approximately 300 Refugees from Pemaquid, Boothbay, Damariscotta and Sheepscot converged on the island, seeking shelter. Despite the presence at the time of farms, a fort and a tavern, there were not enough provisions to support this many refugees. When nearby Fisherman's Island was attacked a few days later, everyone crowded into boats and fled to the better protected Monhegan Island to the east.Woodard, p. 110. The residents did not abandon the island for long, as records indicate that a sloop was seized and a man killed in another raid later that year.Duncan, p 128 Damariscove was also the target of attacks at the start of King William's War in 1689. Richard Pattishall, who had bought the island in 1685, was slain in the first attack. In another raid that summer, thirteen Abenaki were driven back, and no casualties were reported.Duncan, pp. 133-134 Despite additional attacks in 1697 and during Father Rale's War in 1725, Damariscove Island continued to survive as a fishing station.Griffin p. 21Williamson p. 115 In 1717, Damariscove was the destination of the pirate Black Sam Bellamy after taking 53 ships and over sixty cannon; but on April 26 of 1717 his ship, Whydah Galley, wrecked on the backside of Cape Cod before he could reach the island. According to historian and pirateologist Kenneth J. Kinkor and the Boston trial records of the Whydah's survivors, it was the intent of Bellamy to establish a pirate republic on Damariscove and join forces with the Pirate Republic of the Bahamas, thus completely blockading the entire Eastern seaboard and wrestling control of North America from England and the rest of Europe. By the time of the American Revolution, farming had begun to play a significant role on the island. Just prior to the Burning of Falmouth in 1775, Captain Henry Mowatt raided the island, burning at least one home to the ground. Historical records show that Mowatt's forces carried off seventy-eight sheep and three hogs.Griffin, pp. 23-24. By the late 19th century, most farming and fishing had moved elsewhere, while many of the surrounding areas, such as Squirrel Island, Southport and Boothbay Harbor were developing into resort communities. The remaining inhabitants of Damariscove Island primarily made a living dairy farming, with some additional income from fishing and running an ice house with ice harvested from the fresh water pond on the island. The produce was delivered by boat to local hotels and summer communities.Griffin, p. 27 As recently as 1914, there was a large enough population on the island to establish a school,Griffin, p. 85. but by 1917, enough families had moved off the island for the school to close.Griffin, p.43. Coast Guard station In 1897, the Damariscove Lifesaving Station was built on the island in response to the frequent shipwrecks on the ledges and shoals that surround the island. The station, which still stands today at the southern end of the harbor, was manned by the United States Life-Saving Service and later the U.S. Coast Guard until 1959. The station was entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Present day Damariscove Island has been protected land since the majority of the island was donated to The Nature Conservancy by Mr. and Mrs. K.L. Parker in 1966. Prior to the summer of 2005, The Nature Conservancy transferred ownership of the island to the Boothbay Region Land Trust (BRLT), while maintaining a \\"forever wild\\" conservation easement.Maine Legacy, Spring 2005 While the life station and surrounding area remains under private ownership, the remainder of the island is now uninhabited. Damariscove harbor is still actively used for moorings and storage docks by the local commercial fishing fleet. BRLT maintains two guest moorings, the stone pier, and several hiking trails that are open to the public during the summer. The northern half of the island is a protected nesting site each spring for the common eider. Because of the island's rich history and consequent archaeological sensitivity, most of it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Wind power test site In December 2009, Governor John Baldacci named Damariscove, together with Monhegan and Boon islands as test sites for offshore deepwater wind power technologies. The legislation permits testing off Damariscove for three years, with the intent that successful tests would lead to a permanent wind farm further offshore. Critics have called for careful oversight to ensure that local lobster fisheries and migratory bird paths are not affected.Lincoln County News, 2009-12-16 See also * List of islands of Maine * National Register of Historic Places listings in Lincoln County, Maine NotesReferences *Boothbay Region Land Trust, \\"Damariscove Trail Guide and History\\".

Overview  Lisa Paulsen is the former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF), a charitable organization representing the collective philanthropy of the television and film businesses. Under Lisa Paulsen‚Äôs leadership, EIF‚Äôs annual charitable giving grew from $1.8 million to more than $100 million. As part of her growth strategy, Lisa Paulsen engaged support from the entire entertainment industry with every president and/or CEO from major studios, networks and entertainment agencies serving on EIF‚Äôs Honorary Board of Governors, and enlisted some of Hollywood‚Äôs most celebrated actors to volunteer their time and talent in support of EIF‚Äôs work, including Halle Berry, Pierce Brosnan, Johnny Depp, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Harrison Ford, Whoopi Goldberg, Nicole Kidman, Hilary Swank and Charlize Theron. Paulsen spearheaded the launch of several national EIF initiatives; each raises awareness and significant funds for important social causes such as cancer research, diabetes awareness, creative arts and education.  Work at EIF  The Entertainment Industry Foundation is a major force in the fight against cancer, raising critically needed dollars for research and treatment, fast-tracking the most promising science, and generating awareness. Lisa Paulsen is a co-founder of Stand Up To Cancer. This EIF initiative raises philanthropic dollars to accelerate ground-breaking cancer research and bring new therapies to patients more quickly in order to end cancer's reign as a leading cause of death. Harnessing the power and influence of the media, many of the world's most renowned entertainers offered their full support for an historic, nationally-televised program, simultaneously broadcast live and commercial-free on ABC, CBS and NBC. More than $100 million was raised during this one hour telecast which aired on September 5, 2008. EIF‚Äôs National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance, co- founded with Katie Couric and Lilly Tartikoff, has been credited for the dramatic 20 percent increase in colonoscopy screenings and the colon cancer death rate is declining significantly. EIF-funded research has led to a new, highly reliable and non-invasive screening test for colorectal cancer and isolated one of the genes that may cause colon cancer, opening up doors for new research. Created with Lilly Tartikoff and Ronald O. Perelman, the EIF Revlon Run/Walk for Women (Los Angeles and New York) is one of the largest 5k fundraisers, attracting nearly 100,000 participants annually. With proceeds from this event, Paulsen streamlined the grantmaking process to help fast- track scientific breakthroughs such as Herceptin, which successfully treats one in four cases of the most aggressive form of breast cancer. In 2003, EIF launched the Women‚Äôs Cancer Research Fund (EIF‚Äôs WCRF) with entertainment leadership support from EIF‚Äôs WCRF honorary chairs Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, and Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, along with co-founders Kelly Chapman Meyer, Jamie Tisch, Anne Douglas, Quinn Ezralow, and Marion Laurie. Paulsen and her staff brought together a new consortium of internationally recognized scientists at leading biomedical-research institutions, who are embarking upon an intensive quest to pinpoint breast-cancer biomarkers‚Äîunique proteins in the blood that may be used to detect cancer at its earliest stages, when survival rates are highest. EIF‚Äôs commitment has helped leverage an additional $100 million allocation by the National Institutes of Health to advance the science of biomarker discovery. EIF established a program called Picture Quitting, a groundbreaking quit smoking program available to members of the entertainment industry and their families. Run in conjunction with the Motion Picture & Television Fund with support from the Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plan, this is the first ever industry-led smoking cessation program that combines free counseling with low-cost medication. The success rates of Picture Quitting are more than twice the national average for smoking cessation programs. As part of EIF‚Äôs ongoing effort to reduce the impact of smoking on young people, EIF united all six major studios ‚Äì Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros. ‚Äì for an historic anti-smoking campaign. Though this campaign, these studios have committed to placing California's highly successful anti-smoking public service announcements in the opening minutes of DVDs of all new movies with tobacco use that are rated G, PG and PG-13.

It serves as the second team for RK Eurofarm Pelister. History The original team was the first handball club in Macedonia, formed in 1946 under the name Pelagonija. It later changed its name to Pelister in 1955. The 60s were very successful, winning 4 championships starting in 1960 till the last one in 1969. The club ended up winning three more titles in the 70s. In the 80s, the 1981 season was the last winning season, capturing their 8th Macedonian league title. From the 1983-84 season, Pelister began to participate regularly in the Yugoslav Handball Championship. They finished in third place in 1985 and were runners-up in back-to-back seasons (1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88) behind the dominant club Metaloplastika ≈†abac. Around that time the slogan \\"He who hasn't played in Bitola doesn't know what real support looks like\\" gained popularity, being uttered by the likes of Vlado ≈†ola, Lino ƒåervar and Zlatan Saraƒçeviƒá. Pelister became the first Macedonian club to play in Europe. In 1986 they defeated AS Filippos Veriasand in the 1st round, but they ended up losing in 1/8 finals from Atl√©tico Madrid BM winning 24:19 at home and 10:19 away (34:38) aggregate. In the 1988/1989 season they reached the EHF Cup quarterfinal, eliminating SPE Strovolos Nicosia, HC Banik and finally losing out to German club ASK Vorw√§rts. The first leg in Bitola was won by six goals, but the second leg in Berlin resulted in a loss by seven points 22:16 and 13:22 (35:38). When the Macedonian Handball Super League was formed in 1992, Pelister became the most successful club in the country, winning five league titles and five Cups that decade. In 1996, they made it to the semi-finals of the EHF Cup Winners' Cup where they lost on aggregate by one goal to the eventual champion TBV Lemgo. A record, 7,000 fans were in attendance for the rematch in Bitola. Another proof of Pelisters' dominance at the time, seven players on Macedonia's squad at the 1999 World Men's Handball Championship in Egypt played for the club. The club's most successful European run was made during the 2001/02 season when they played in the EHF Challenge Cup. First, they started by beating Zilant Kazan in the 3rd round and advanced to round 4, where they went on to defeat Paris St. Germain on away goals. In the quarterfinal they got past Kilkis GAC 52-51, setting up a semifinal match-up with Frederiksberg IF. Pelister would go on to win that tie in dramatic fashion in Bitola, when Naumƒçe Mojsovski scored a goal in the final seconds of the game to even the score on aggregate, going through on a penalty shootout by the final score of 61-60. In the final, Pelister lost to Skjern H√•ndbold, but even in that match-up they still ended up winning the home game by 7 goals. Proving yet again that it was no easy task for any road team to win in Bitola. In 2005, Trifun Kostovski's Kometal became sponsor of the club bringing back the glory days, winning another double crown and capturing its sixth domestic league title, which was a record at the time. However, the success was short lived as Kometal left the following season. Since then, Pelister had been marred by financial problems and struggled to achieve the same level of success. On 29 November 2019, a joint ownership was signed by the owners of RK Eurofarm Rabotnik (owned by Eurofarm) and RK Pelister (owned by Bitola Municipality). According to the platform, RK Eurofarm Rabotnik would change the name to RK Eurofarm Pelister, and the original RK Pelister would change its name to RK Eurofarm Pelister 2. Eurofarm Pelister will be the leading club with high European ambitions, while Eurofarm Pelister 2 will be a developmental club filled with young handball players from Bitola and all of Macedonia. The combination of a strong sponsor and a sports brand known throughout the former Yugoslavia took final shape through an agreement with the city administration in 2020. Eurofarm Pelister has already surpassed the domestic framework, played in the EHF Champions League and set the contours of a team that could return trophies back to \\"Boro ƒåurlevski\\" arena.

It was built in 1975 by the citizens of Bitola and is mainly used for handball by RK Pelister and RK Bitola, and for basketball by KK Pelister. There is also room for bowling and table tennis plus it has been used for concerts. The Arena hosted the 2007 Macedonian Basketball Cup. This sports hall was the largest on the territory of North Macedonia before the construction of the Boris Trajkovski Sports Center in Skopje. On 21 July 2009, the arena is undergoing renovation. A new parquet floor will be installed along with new seats. The locker rooms will also be updated to meet EHF standards. Total cost of the project is about ‚Ç¨30,000. In January 2017, renovation of interior of the hall started. The renovation covered the floor, the stands, a new score board and a new heating system. The first match in the renovated arena was played on April 6, 2017 with the match between RK Pelister and RK Metalurg in the second round of the handball Super League play-off. At the end of July 2018, the name of the hall was changed to \\"Boro Churlevski\\", in honor of the late Boro Churlevski, a former handball player from Bitola.Churlevski Arena has a capacity of 4000 sits. Supporters Abdomens () are an Ultras group, established in 1985, who support the Macedonian sports clubs from Bitola that compete under the Pelister banner, mainly FK Pelister in football and RK Pelister in handball. The group was founded in 1985 when a caravan of 15 buses traveled to support RK Pelister who was playing against Partizan Bjelovar in a handball relegation play-off match. At that time they used the name BMƒåM - Bitolƒçani, Motorcyclists, ƒåkembari, Macedonians (–º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏: –ë–ú–ß–ú - –ë–∏—Ç–æ–ª—á–∞–Ω–∏, –ú–æ—Ç–æ–∫–∞—Ä–∏, –ß–∫–µ–º–±–∞—Ä–∏, –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏) later shortened to just ƒåkembari.

The company was founded in 1993 by Sheldon Zinberg as a small Southern California regional medical group. Today, CareMore serves 100,000 patients across 8 states with annual revenues of $1.2B. CareMore's President and CEO is Shaden Marzouk. The company has developed a care model designed to target high-risk, chronically ill patients through focused care coordination, patient education, and proactive disease management. This model has resulted in costs 18% below industry average, while tangibly increasing quality: hospital admissions are 42% below national average, average length of stay is 32% below traditional Medicare FFS, and diabetic amputation rates are 67% below traditional FFS. These results have led some health policy experts to point to CareMore as one of the most innovative models to reform Medicare. However, CareMore has also been criticized as a one-off success story that will not be able to scale beyond its core markets.  History  CareMore Health System was founded by Dr. Sheldon Zinberg in 1991 in an effort to reorganize the healthcare delivery system to proactively manage health and improve quality in high risk populations. The company‚Äôs website highlights that the name ‚ÄúCareMore‚Äù was selected as a representation of its philosophy and mission-driven nature. By 1993, the group had grown to include 28 offices in the greater Los Angeles area. CareMore restructured in 1997 as a privately managed Medicare health plan, shifting its focus to primarily elderly, high risk patients. In 2003, it formalized this focus, becoming a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. As an MA plan, CareMore embraced full capitation reimbursement, aligning its financial incentives with favorable patient outcomes. In 2006, JP Morgan‚Äôs CCMP Capital acquired CareMore, refining and expanding the plan‚Äôs model of care. CareMore introduced a number of Special Needs Plans in 2007 that were aimed at high- cost, high-need patients with chronic diseases. By 2010, CareMore had expanded to Northern California, Arizona, and Nevada. Serving over 50,000 patients, CareMore was acquired by WellPoint ‚Äì now Anthem ‚Äì in 2011 for $800 million. Between 2011 and 2016, CareMore diversified its care delivery services by providing care to Medicaid and Dual-Eligible patients in CA, NV, TN, OH, and IA.  CareMore Model Overview  CareMore‚Äôs clinical model is designed to improve coordination across care settings and proactively manage patients with high-risk, chronic conditions. The company does this through three primary mechanisms: the CareMore Care Center, CareMore‚Äôs chronic care management programs, and the CareMore Extensivist. = The CareMore Neighborhood Care Center = CareMore operates neighborhood-based care centers that act as supplementary extensions of the patient's primary care physician offices. The goal of the Care Center is to provide a one-stop shop for care services, reducing travel time, likelihood of missing an appointment and duplication of efforts. Each Center provides a range of primary care medical services as well as podiatry, mental health services, diabetes management, wound management, hypertension management programs, and prevention services. In 2016, CareMore announced a partnership with the ride-sharing application Lyft to provide free rides for patients to the Care Center and further increase accessibility. = Chronic Care Management Programs = CareMore offers its patients a high- touch, proactive approach to chronic disease management designed to minimize the probability of an acute episode of care. After a comprehensive medical evaluation, patients with chronic conditions are enrolled in one of CareMore‚Äôs 14 different disease management programs. Once in a program, patients are seen periodically in a CareMore Care Center by CareMore‚Äôs interdisciplinary care team. The team monitors disease-specific metrics to determine whether a patient requires more intensive management. Roughly 30% of CareMore‚Äôs Medicare Advantage patients are engaged in a disease management program. The company has seen particularly strong outcomes in its Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, End Stage Renal Disease and Diabetes programs. = The CareMore Extensivist = CareMore employs Extensivist physicians who manage hospitalized patients and monitor their transition from the hospital back to the Care Center, Skilled Nursing Facility, or other site of care. The Extensivist acts as the leader of the CareMore clinical team, connecting the company‚Äôs PCP‚Äôs, Nurse Practitioners, Medical Assistants, and Case Management teams. CareMore leadership cites this cross-functional coordinating role as a key differentiator for the model and credits the Extensivists for readmission rates approximately 40% below the national average.  Outcomes  CareMore‚Äôs outcomes led Arnold Milstein and Elizabeth Gilbertson to dub CareMore a ‚Äúmedical home run‚Äù in their 2009 Health Affairs article. CareMore‚Äôs average length of stay is 3.7 days compared to a FFS average of 5.2 days. Bed days per 1000 is 48% lower, diabetic amputation rate is 67% lower, and end-state renal disease hospital admissions are 50% lower. From a cost perspective, CareMore has reported an 18% reduction versus the industry average. An article in the American Journal of Managed Care reported cost reductions for intermediate risk patients of $500 (a 33% drop) and reductions for highest risk patients of $1,250 (a 35% drop). CareMore claims that 97% of its members are either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their CareMore health plan. They also self-report that more than 80% have recommended the company to a friend.  Expansion and Innovation = Medicaid Delivery = In 2013, CareMore expanded into the Medicaid managed care space by partnering with another Anthem subsidiary, Amerigroup, to provide coverage in Tennessee, Iowa, and Ohio. Unlike its traditional model, in the Medicaid space CareMore serves only as the patient care delivery organization, while Amerigroup provides the insurance layer. Though significant gains in clinical outcomes remain to be seen, CareMore Health System and Amerigroup believe the partnership has the capability to transform Medicaid patient care across the United States. = Dementia Care = In 2012 CareMore launched a Brain Health pilot geared towards providing support to patients suffering from dementia, with funding from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). The program initially consisted of 42 patients suffering from dementia and resulted in a decrease in patients‚Äô ER utilization and fall incidence. Critics of the program suggest the pilot‚Äôs findings are not scalable over large patient bases, though CareMore is currently expanding the program through its multiple markets. Supporters of the program highlight its focus on support for the caregiver, a role that is often neglected and subject to caregiver stress. = Patient Transportation = In 2016, CareMore began a partnership with ride service company Lyft. A 1 month pilot program in which 500 patients were provided transportation to a CareMore Care Center saw average wait times of 8 minutes. Both companies believe the partnership can significantly improve patient access to healthcare services. = CareMore- Emory Partnership = In 2015, CareMore began a partnership with Emory Health System in which the two entities will work together to redesign Emory‚Äôs clinical delivery infrastructure and coordination to ready the system for value-based care delivery. The partnership features Emory‚Äôs adoption of the Extensivist physician role and the outpatient clinic focused on managing chronic disease. The partnership ‚Äì among the first of its kind ‚Äì has shown some notable improvements in care quality, with a 30-day hospital readmission rate of 8.9% for the cohort of patients cared for in the experimental model. While CareMore Health System and Emory Health System have remained optimistic about their partnership and the opportunities for other Academic medical centers to follow suit, some experts warn that the long-term results may not be as favorable as promised.

However, the station buildings and platforms are no longer accessible to the public, given that there are currently no passenger services. Construction The process of building the station was hampered by the rainy season. \\"A considerable advance was thus taken during the first year and, in 1931, the Company concentrated all her effort on the one hand on the Phnom Penh train station, including embankments, buildings and facilities, which are of an exceptional importance, and secondly on ballast supplies. Meanwhile, nature, so often hostile in Cambodia, became the main auxiliary against the engineers by packing embankments and consolidating them with vegetation. Good weather having returned, work actively resumed with the rehabilitation of the embankments and the levelling of the platform.\\" The station was built in 1932 from reinforced concrete to service the railway to Battambang.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Lyon received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in social science and history at the University of Bradford in Yorkshire, England, fuelling a fascination with driving forces behind and social consequences of some major transformations of the modern world. Best known internationally for his work in surveillance studies, Lyon defines surveillance as the \\"operations and experiences of gathering and analyzing personal data for influence, entitlement or management.\\" As well, he has developed key concepts in the field, such as \\"social sorting\\". Lyon has also taught and researched in the areas of information society, globalization, secularization, and postmodernity. He is author, co-author, editor or co- editor of 28 books. His books have been translated into 16 languages. He is a co-editor of the journal Surveillance & Society, associate editor of The Information Society, and is on the international editorial board of a number of other academic journals. Since 2000 Lyon has led a series of team projects; currently, \\"Big Data Surveillance\\" (2015‚Äì2020). He is also on the international advisory boards of other major projects in surveillance studies. He has held visiting appointments in a number of universities including Auckland, Bir Zeit, Edinburgh, Leeds, Melbourne, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, the Centre for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore, and the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. Lyon has also encouraged surveillance research initiatives and groups around the world, especially in Israel/Palestine and the Middle East, Japan, and Latin America.  Sociology, religion, the secular  Lyon‚Äôs dissertation focused on the historical sociology of belief-change in Victorian England and his early work explored the mutual relations of Christian social thought and the social sciences in works such as Karl Marx: A Christian Appreciation of his Life and Thought (1979) and Sociology and the Human Image (1983). The Steeple‚Äôs Shadow: On the Myths and Realities of Secularization (1986), questioned theories which suggest that religious belief and practice decline with the coming of modernity. Locally, he wrote a parish study of St James‚Äô Anglican church, Kingston; Living Stones (1995). Jesus in Disneyland (2000) investigated the ways in which religious activities are affected by the so-called postmodern turn, and the co-edited (with Marguerite Van Die) Rethinking Church, State and Modernity: Canada between Europe and America (2000) examined the question from the perspective of political sociology. The latter research was funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Lyon has contributed to the debate over the \\"post- secular\\" both directly, for example in \\"Being post-secular in the social sciences: Charles Taylor‚Äôs social imaginaries\\" New Blackfriars, 91: 648-662, 2010 and indirectly, in \\"Surveillance and the Eye of God\\" Studies in Christian Ethics, 27(1): 21-32, 2014.  Surveillance, technology, digital modernity  During the 1980s Lyon examined how new technologies are involved in social change and offered a balanced assessment in books such as The Information Society: Issues and Illusions (1988). In a short book on Postmodernity (1994) he suggested that currently fashionable theoretical debates had to be understood in relation to social changes, especially the development of new media and the cultural prominence of consumerism. Today, he refers more to \\"liquid\\" and \\"digital\\" modernity. Lyon‚Äôs work on social aspects of new technologies concerns the processing of personal data. See The Electronic Eye: The Rise of Surveillance Society (1994). This blossomed into a research program that became increasingly collaborative, international and multi- disciplinary. Lyon‚Äôs \\"social sorting\\" concept signals that while \\"privacy\\" is not to be minimized, broader questions of ethics and social justice, including civil liberties and human rights, are also prompted by the intensification of surveillance. This is seen even more starkly in a post-Snowden environment (see Surveillance After Snowden, 2015) where Big Data practices now play a central role (see \\"Snowden, surveillance and big data: capacities, consequences and critique\\" Big Data & Society, 1(1), 2014. The argument of The Electronic Eye was complemented by Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life (2001) that focused on global developments and the increasing use of the body as a source of data, and then by Surveillance after September 11 (2003) that focuses on 9/11‚Äôs role in expanding surveillance and diminishing human rights, capitalizing on fear, suspicion and secrecy. In the ironically titled Surveillance Studies: An Overview (2007) Lyon lays out dynamically the key features of surveillance studies.  Identification, ethics, human flourishing  Identifying Citizens: ID Cards as Surveillance (2009) picked up on themes explored by Lyon since the late 1980s but also relating to more recent technical and political developments. The parallel volume here is the co- edited (with Colin Bennett) Playing the Identity Card: Surveillance, Security and Identification in Global Perspective (2008). Each book refers to Lyon‚Äôs concept of the \\"card cartel\\" as a means of understanding the political economy of IDs at a time when \\"showing ID\\" has become a central ‚Äì and novel ‚Äì feature of social relations around the world. Ethics has been integral to Lyon's work over many years, seen in his current work (e.g. \\"Liquid Surveillance: the Contribution of Zygmunt Bauman to Surveillance Studies\\" International Political Sociology, 4: 325-338, 2010 and Liquid Surveillance, co-authored with Zygmunt Bauman 2013). Today, says Lyon, more than ever, ethical questions demand attention because the issues are so large, urgent and intractable. While educational, legal, technical and other approaches are vital, he insists that it is also crucial both to confront the agents of surveillance and to consider current developments in terms of emerging political subjects, the common good and human flourishing.

Founded in 1912 as the Stephenson Company, the company has undergone several buyouts and ventures in different geographical markets. Rideau was the first Canadian company to produce the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian decoration, as well as the first Canadian company to be granted its own Coat of Arms by The Heraldic Authority. History Rideau Hall, the company's namesake =Growth and Transition= In 1912 the Stephenson Company, situated on Saint-Maurice Street in old Montreal, began as a producer of emblematic jewelry for associations such as the Masons, the Knights of Columbus, and other organizations. During World Wars I and II, the company produced military insignia for the armed forces. However, in the mid 1950s the company's shares were sold to a U.S.-based company that moved Stephenson Company's headquarters to Montreal North. The company was later sold back to two Montrealers who had numerous business interests but nevertheless, Stephenson went into a steady state of decline. By 1968, The Stephenson Company was almost bankrupt and was reduced to a staff of five. In that same year, Stephenson was purchased by Ed and Phyllis Hart. Its largest customer was Avon Cosmetics, which used the company's awards to help incentivize its sales force. In the 1970s Avon began selling Stephenson's jewelry door-to-door along with its traditional cosmetics, which proved successful and helped both Avon and Stephenson flourish. In 1974, the Harts partnered with Maurice Bradden of D‚ÄôOrlan Jeweler‚Äôs, helping to launch its manufacturing capabilities on the European continent in the Republic of Ireland. The facility produced Nina Ricci fashion jewelry in the European Common Market. In 1978, the Harts sold the operation to their four children and family friend and continued to expand in Europe. In 1979, The Stephenson company opened a subsidiary, The Jeweller's Guild, in the United Kingdom. The Jeweler's Guild sold fashion jewelry exclusively by mail order. In 1980 other subsidiaries were set up in France, Holland and Germany and they too sold fashion jewelry by mail order. Stephenson and its subsidiary companies did well until 1982, when the company's over-expansion coupled with the economic recession forced the company to change and reinvent itself. Rideau was the first Canadian company to produce the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian decoration. In 1983, the newly restructured Stephenson Company started producing the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian decoration.

At the suggestion of Bruce Beatty, the chief designer of the Canadian Honours System, the owners renamed the company Rideau to reflect their service the Governor General of Canada, who resides in Rideau Hall in Ottawa.McCreery, Christopher (2006). The Order of Canada, p.336. University of Toronto Press, Toronto. . In 1989, Rideau shifted its focus from government decorations and medals to their current focus of corporate recognition and point-based recognition solutions. In 2006, Rideau acquired Recognition Management Institute (RMI) a company whose focus was helping businesses grow by building relationships with their employees and customers. Rideau made an investment in analytic data (big data) research in 2008 and proved the link between employee recognition and company's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In that same year, RMI became \\"Vistance Learning\\". By 2012, the implementation of Vistance Analytics made Rideau the first data-driven recognition company. In 2015, Vistance was fully deployed within a major global financial services company.http://www.rideau.comj =Business under the Rideau name= Towards the end of the 1980s promotional products and fashion jewelry were increasingly being off-shored to the Far East, so the company began focusing on corporate recognition programs. It began providing fully outsourced recognition programs to RBC, Scotiabank, BMO, Molson, Alcan, Canadian Pacific, and the Government of Canada. In 1991, Rideau Recognition became the first Canadian company to be granted its own Coat of Arms by The Heraldic Authority, bearing the Latin motto Opus excellentiae (\\"Impressions of excellence\\"). Rideau Recognition is also a sponsor of Recognition Professionals International. =Acquisitions and Alliances= In April 2006, Rideau Recognition announced their acquisition of Recognition Management Institute (RMI), a London, Ontario-based consulting organization specializing in training managers how to recognize and retain top employers. In August 2015, Rideau Recognition executed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Birks Group, Inc. whereby Birks Group sold its corporate sales division, also known as \\"Birks Business\\" to Rideau for CAD $5.625 million (approximately USD $4.3 million.newswire.ca \\"Birks Group and Rideau announce strategic alliance: Rideau acquires Birks Corporate Sales Division and the two enter into supply and licensing agreements for Birks Business products\\" On August 1, 2017, Rideau acquired Pressed Metal Products, a Vancouver-based company that manufactures emblematic insignia jewelry, awards and medals. =Rebranding= In March 2017, Rideau Recognition underwent a rebranding which included a new logo, website, corporate signature and colors and a new Vistance platform and proprietary score called Recognition Quotient (RQ).newswire.ca \\"Rideau rallies behind 'Return on Recogniton' with newrobust Vistance platform and proprietary Recognition Quotient\\" =Vistance= Vistance Analytics & Prescriptive Learning is a division of Rideau. Vistance Analytics analyzes the impact of recognition programs and employee perceptions on an organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Vistance Learning is a prescriptive online assessment and learning management system to help leaders improve their organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPI) through critical development, employee recognition and engagement skills. The initial concept for Vistance was created in 2007 from a think tank of organizational psychologists and recognition experts hired by Rideau Recognition Solutions to determine whether employee recognition has a measurable impact on business outcomes. =Environmental Awareness= Rideau Recognition is the first recognition firm to be certified as Carbon Neutral. The firm has been a participant and stakeholder to the United Nations Global Compact (UNCG) since 2005. Rideau has helped plant over 100,000 native trees and was the recipient of the Eterne Award in 2015.

A p operation on L is a map X mapsto X^{[p]} satisfying * mathrm{ad}(X^{[p]}) = mathrm{ad}(X)^p for all X in L, * (tX)^{[p]} = t^pX^{[p]} for all t in k, X in L, * (X+Y)^{[p]} = X^{[p]} + Y^{[p]} + sum_{i=1}^{p-1} frac{s_i(X,Y)}{i}, for all X,Y in L, where s_i(X,Y) is the coefficient of t^{i-1} in the formal expression mathrm{ad}(tX+Y)^{p-1}(X). If the characteristic of k is 0, then L is a restricted Lie algebra where the p operation is the identity map. Examples For any associative algebra A defined over a field of characteristic p, the bracket operation [X,Y] := XY-YX and p operation X^{[p]} := X^p make A into a restricted Lie algebra mathrm{Lie}(A). Let G be an algebraic group over a field k of characteristic p, and mathrm{Lie}(G) be the Zariski tangent space at the identity element of G. Each element of mathrm{Lie}(G) uniquely defines a left-invariant vector field on G, and the commutator of vector fields defines a Lie algebra structure on mathrm{Lie}(G) just as in the Lie group case. If p>0, the Frobenius map x mapsto x^p defines a p operation on mathrm{Lie}(G). Restricted universal enveloping algebra The functor A mapsto mathrm{Lie}(A) has a left adjoint L mapsto U^{[p]}(L) called the restricted universal enveloping algebra. To construct this, let U(L) be the universal enveloping algebra of L forgetting the p operation. Letting I be the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form x^p - x^{[p]}, we set U^{[p]}(L) = U(L) / I. It satisfies a form of the PBW theorem.

Family background and early life His father George James Luchford (1868‚Äì1939) was born in Rochester, Kent, and served in India as Garrison Quartermaster Sergeant with the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment. There, in Colaba, in 1894, he married Helena Elizabeth Hunnisett (1875‚Äì1946), born in Chatham, Kent. They had three sons: Harry George Ernest, born in Lucknow, then Leonard Eustace (1896‚Äì1974) and Cyril Gordon (1898‚Äì1977), who were both born in Plumstead. Lieutenant Cyril G. Luchford of the 14th (Service) Battalion (Pioneers), Northumberland Fusiliers, was awarded the Military Cross on 1 January 1919. Military service When the war broke out in August 1914, Luchford was living with his family in Bromley, Kent, and working as a clerk in Martin's Bank, Lombard Street. He enlisted almost immediately in the Norfolk Regiment, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps on 26 September. He served in France attached to the Divisional Cavalry of the 7th (Meerut) Division from December 1914 to January 1917, receiving promotion to lieutenant on 1 August 1915. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and qualified as a pilot on 19 May 1917.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), pp.82‚Äì83. =Flying service= From May 1917, Luchford served as a pilot with No. 20 Squadron, flying the F.E.2d.

He then scored steadily throughout July, totting up seven more wins over enemy fighters that month. Luchford scored twice more in August, then changed mounts to the two-seater Bristol F.2 Fighter. He was appointed a flight commander with the rank of captain on 11 September. Flying with a number of different observers such as Richard Hill, Victor White, and William Benger, Luchford was credited with 13 more triumphs between 9 September and 21 October 1917. His first award of the Military Cross was gazetted on 27 October, and his second on 26 November. He was killed in action by Walter von B√ºlow-Bothkamp on 2 December 1917.

She is also mentioned in The Deluge and in Colonel Wolodyjowski. Helena is a beautiful orphaned princess living with her aunt and cousins in Roz≈Çogi. Jan Skrzetuski falls in love with her and vies for her hand against the Cossack colonel Bohun to whom she was promised. In the 1999 film, she is portrayed by Izabella Scorupco.  Story  Helena was born in 1630. Her mother died in childbirth. Her father, prince Wasyl Kurcewicz Bu≈Çyha, was the master of Roz≈Çogi and served prince Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniowiecki. In 1634, he was charged of treason and forced to leave the country. Since then nobody heard of him, he probably soon died. Few years later he was cleared of the charge. Helena was raised by her uncle, Konstantyn. She grew in Roz≈Çogi with her five cousins. After Konstantyn's death, his wife looked after Helena. As it turned out, she cared more for Wasyl's fortune than for the young orphan. Helena soon became completely dominated by her aunt who regarded herself the mistress of Roz≈Çogi, even though Helena was its legal owner. In the meantime the old princess' sons became friends with Bohun. The young Cossack fell in love with Helena but she didn't return his feelings. She was afraid of his cruelty and quick temper since he once killed a man in her presence. Bohun asked the Kurcewiczs for Helena's hand in marriage, promising to waive the right to Helena's dowry (Roz≈Çogi). Driven by her greed, the widow accepted his proposal. Helena and the princess meeting Skrzetuski, by Juliusz Kossak In 1648, Helena met Polish lieutenant Jan Skrzetuski and they fell in love with each other. Skrzetuski threatened the Kurcewiczs and forced them to promise Helena's hand to him. Bohun soon discovered the old princess' betrayal. In the company of Onufry Zag≈Çoba, he rushed to Roz≈Çogi, intending to take revenge. During the fight, the widow and her two sons were killed. Zag≈Çoba, seeing Bohun's cruelty, decided to save Helena from him. They managed to escape from Roz≈Çogi but Bohun almost immediately set off in pursuit of them. For many weeks Zag≈Çoba and Helena wandered the country at war. They finally managed to get to Bar, where Helena was supposed to be safe from pursuit. Bar, however, was soon captured by Cossacks led by Bohun. At the sight of him, Helena stabbed herself with a knife. Bohun took the wounded girl to the ravine on the river Dniester in order to hide her. He put Helena in the Devil's Valley, in the care of his friend - witch Horpyna and left to the war. Thanks to information from Rzƒôdzian, Skrzetuski's friends (Zag≈Çoba, Wo≈Çodyjowski and Rzƒôdzian) found Helena and freed her. On their way back they had to divide into two groups because of Tartars' attack. Rzƒôdzian and Helena escaped to Zamo≈õƒá. After the Siege of Zbarazh and signing the treaty with Cossacks, Helena finally reunited with her beloved Skrzetuski. They soon went to Lviv to get married. In next parts of the Trilogy (\\"The Deluge\\" and \\"Colonel Wolodyjowski\\") Helena is mentioned sporadically. She is a happy wife and mother. She has twelve sons and in 1672 her first daughter was born.  Description  Helena is described as an extraordinarily beautiful woman. She has dark eyes and long black hair, usually in two braids. She makes a big impression on many men. She is loved by Bohun and Skrzetuski, even Wo≈Çodyjowski becomes slightly infatuated with her.

At the beginning of the novel, Helena is shy and dominated by her aunt. In spite of being surrounded by crude people since childhood, she is good-natured and sensitive. She has a strong, trusting faith in God. She quickly falls in love with Skrzetuski and is sure of her feelings for him. As a noblewoman, she is brave and very proud. She treasures her honor above all else, she is even ready to commit a suicide to avoid disgrace. She deeply loves Skrzetuski and is faithful to him.

Hu migrated to Shenzhen in 1992, attracted by the public perception and entertainment media accounts of Shenzhen (designated as one of China's new Special Economic Zones) as a cosmopolitan city with opportunities for upward mobility. She initially worked at a mineral water factory earning the equivalent of US$70 per month. At night she would listen to radio call-in shows that were becoming popular in China under its new policy of \\"Reform and Opening\\". In late she called into a talk radio and mentioned her own hopes of becoming a show host, and gave out her phone number and address. This led to many letters, but also to her employer firing her for using their telephone for personal purposes. Out of work, she brought her resume to the radio station to ask for a job. One producer decided to hire her as a host beginning December, 1992. The show she hosted from 2003 through 2007 eventually became the top rated show in Shenzhen.

According to one medical outcomes and guidelines source book - 1996, Outcomes research includes health services research that focuses on identifying variations in medical procedures and associated health outcomes. Though listed as a synonym for the National Library of Medicine MeSH term \\"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)\\", outcomes research may refer to both health services research and healthcare outcomes assessment, which aims at Health technology assessment, decision making, and policy analysis through systematic evaluation of quality of care, access, and effectiveness. Description Outcomes research is applied to clinical and population based research that seeks to study and optimize the end results of healthcare in terms of benefits to the patient and society. The intent of this research is to identify shortfalls in practice and to develop strategies to improve care. Like clinical trials, outcomes research seeks to provide evidence about which interventions work best for which types of patients and under what circumstances. However, the evaluation methodology of outcomes research may include both experimental and non-experimental designs: further, the \\"intervention\\" being evaluated is not limited to medications or new clinical procedures, but may also include the provision of particular services or resources, or even the enforcing of specific policies and regulations by legislative/financial bodies. Also, while traditional clinical trials focus primarily on therapeutic efficacy and safety, outcomes research may consider additional parameters such as cost, timeliness, convenience, geographical accessibility and patient preferences. Consequently, the field is more multi-disciplinary, involving, in addition to healthcare professionals and the manufacturers of medical devices or pharmaceuticals, medical economists, sociologists, and public health researchers. The results of outcomes research are used to inform the decisions of legislative bodies that make decisions related to healthcare, as well as of financial bodies (governments, insurers, employers) who seek to minimize cost and waste while ensuring the provision of an acceptable level of care. Patients also have a significant stake in outcomes research because it facilitates their decision- making, both in deciding what intervention is best for them given their circumstances, and as members of the public who have ultimately to pay for medical services.  Origins  The c. 1847 work of Ignaz Semmelweis on the association between puerperal fever and the absence of aseptic procedures (specifically, doctors who failed to clean their hands before delivering babies) and the subsequent use of calcium hypochlorite to reduce risk, is an early example of outcomes research. Semmelweis' results were not accepted until after his death, when the germ theory of infection became established. Although the exact origins of the term \\"outcomes research\\" is unclear, the methods associated with outcomes research first gained wide attention in the 1850s as a result of the work of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War. Nightingale studied death as her primary outcome, recording the cause of death, including wounds, infections, and other causes. The intervention - a combination of effective nursing, hygiene, better nutrition, reduced crowding - reduced mortality significantly. After returning to England, Nightingale studied variation in childbirth practices at home and at institutions and their effect on maternal mortality. Both Semmelweis' and Nightingale's work were characterized by the continual gathering of detailed statistics. Ernest Amory Codman, a Boston orthopedic surgeon, noted in 1914 that hospitals were reporting the number of patients treated but not how many patients benefited from treatment. At that point he argued that all hospitals should produce a report \\"showing nearly as possible what are the results of treatment obtained at different institutions.\\" However, Codman's advocacy of disclosure of institutional data by hospitals has yet to be universally adopted: such disclosure occurs only after being legally mandated. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, professional organizations and hospital authorities began to adopt a standard form of medical record. In the UK, this was also adopted in primary care. Standardized data recording meant that for the first time medical records could be used as a moderately reliable data base for research. During World War I, intense efforts to improve the outcomes of care for battle casualties, with careful attention to outcomes led to major advances in orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, blood transfusion and the prevention of tetanus and gangrene. There were also major advances in the organization of care and in record keeping. During World War II, the UK centralized many medical services: the resulting infrastructure was used as the basis of a National Health Service in 1948. Centralization facilitated the establishment of national and local databases. Avedis Donabedian's 1966 paper \\"Evaluating the Quality of Medical Care\\" first used the term \\"outcome\\" as part of the framework of quality assessment. Archie Cochrane's 1971 Rock Carling Fellowship monograph Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services clarified a number of key concepts in outcomes research and evidence-based medicine. John Wennberg's studies of variations of healthcare practice in the United States resulted in the publication of The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, which reports on healthcare usage and distribution within the US. Wennberg described his methods in his book Tracking Medicine: A Researcher's Quest to Understand Health Care. Paul Ellwood's 1988 Shattuck Lecture coined the term \\"outcomes management\\" to describe a scenario where patient care would be driven by detailed analysis of how similar patients fared after alternative treatments. Carolyn Clancy and John Eisenberg's 1998 Science paper emphasized the importance of considering patients' experiences, preferences and values in outcome evaluation, as well as the needs of those who provide, organize and pay for healthcare, including the public.  Examples of health outcomes  A wide variety of outcomes are measured ranging from interventions such as acute clinical events like mortality to measuring the performance of a system. The goal of outcomes research, is to measure tangible events experienced by the patient such as mortality and morbidity. Patient engagement in research presents opportunities to increase outcomes of both the studies themselves as well as the patients and their medical conditions. The common outcomes that are measured can be divided into broad categories of patient- and system-related. Patient outcomes are experienced by the patient and have a more proximal relationship with the healthcare intervention. System measures are more distal to the patient experience but are important for assessment of quality of care and influence the patient experience as well. Common themes Common themes of outcomes research are: ;Safety * Misuse of medical therapy and oversight in the course of clinical care * Medical mistakes that place patients at risk for adverse events ;Effectiveness * The gap between what can be achieved through medical intervention or policy and what is actually accomplished * Whether policies are adapted by clinicians, the way they are applied, the skill of practitioners, the characteristics of the patients receiving interventions and whether patients are adherent to therapy ;Equity * Examination of disparity in healthcare delivery that focuses on whether nonclinical factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status influence the care of patients ;Efficiency * With increasing healthcare costs, outcomes research focuses on ways to maximize efficiency, limit healthcare costs, and reduce waste in the healthcare system. ;Timeliness * Patient access to healthcare: barriers to access, and uninsured patients inability to benefit from healthcare. ;System responsiveness * Educational efforts amongst the medical community and implementation of healthcare policies that improve patient care. ;Patient- centeredness * How medical interventions will affect patients, what patients feel and what they can do to effect medical decision making. * The burden of illness, adverse effects of medications, and complication from procedures that affect the quality and quantity of life.  Study designs used  *Randomized control trials *Cross-sectional studies *cohort studies *Meta-analysis *Systematic reviews *Planned Experimentation (QI Research method) Difficulties * Fragmentation of outcomes research: Databases and patient registries are fragmented and limited in the number of patients, and many are of unknown data quality. Studies with a small number of patients in health systems limits the use of proper statistical methods and inferences from particular studies. Limited information is available about certain priority populations and sub groups. * Coordination across outcomes research framework: A number of groups conduct outcomes research within the United States and across the federal government but much of this research effort is not coordinated. * Underrepresentation of certain subgroups in outcome studies: Efforts must be made to attain information about the elderly, persons with disabilities, and racial and ethnic minorities in clinical and other research studies, as the majority of outcome research studies do not include these subgroups. * Lack of human and scientific capital: Methods for conducting outcomes research need to be developed, and there are limited trained researchers who can conduct outcomes research within the United States and abroad. Increased emphasis must be placed on training outcomes researches both nationally and internationally. * Improper reporting of health related outcomes: Many hospitals/healthcare providers do not properly report outcomes creating bias in studies. * Lack of interpretability of measures/incorporation into clinical practice: Clinicians must be educated about the usefulness of outcome measures, and outcome measures must be easy to include into daily practice. * Efficacy of funding outcomes research vs direct research: the efficacy or 'outcome' of outcomes research itself has never been objectively measured.

The village is to the east of the B3109 road from Bradford on Avon to Corsham. The parish includes the village of Lower Wraxall, to the south of South Wraxall; one field separates the two villages. The hamlet of Bradford Leigh is in the southeast of the parish. History The name comes from old English wrocc, meaning a buzzard, although it was also used as a personal name. Its name was first mentioned in 1468 as Suthwroxhall, distinguishing it from North Wraxall which is away. Other spellings of the name included wroxhal (1227) and wrokeshal (1242). Nevertheless, South Wraxall was not mentioned in Domesday Book, as it was grouped in with Bradford on Avon. In the 13th century, estates at South Wraxall were held by Monkton Farleigh Priory and by Shaftesbury Abbey. Robert Long (c. 1391 ‚Äì 1447) had a house at Wraxall in 1429 and obtained land from Shaftesbury; South Wraxall Manor became the principal residence of the Long family, who also owned Draycot manor through inheritance by Thomas Long (c. 1451‚Äì1508). A later generation acquired the land formerly held by Monkton Farleigh, and the combined estate remained in the Long family until being broken up by a sale in 1919. The civil parish of South Wraxall was created in 1894 by combining the former tithings of South Wraxall, Bradford Leigh and Cumberwell which were parts of the extensive ancient parish of Bradford on Avon. Most of the buildings of South Wraxall are of the 17th and 18th centuries, built from locally quarried dressed stone, or stone rubble construction with stone slates. Besides quarrying, the main occupation around the area was agriculture, including shepherding; there were also weavers in the early 19th century, and some clothworkers by the mid-19th century. Notable buildings South Wraxall Manor is a Grade I listed country house dating from the early 15th century. The manor farmhouse is also Grade I listed. The heirs of Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long sold the house in the 1960s, after several hundred years of continuous ownership, and in 2004 it was bought by the musician John Taylor. St. James parish church is Grade II* listed. Its tower dates from the early 14th century but the rest has been rebuilt: the north aisle in 1823 by Henry Goodridge, and the chancel and arcade in 1882 in late Perpendicular Gothic style. The six bells in the tower were cast by Abraham Bilbie in 1769; they are currently unringable. Anciently a chapel of Bradford parish church, today the church is one of four in the Churches of North Bradford on Avon and Villages group. Amenities There are no longer any shops in the village and the school, built as a National school in 1841, closed in 1972. The school building now serves as the Village Hall. The Longs Arms public house is in the centre of the village. South Wraxall Club is located in Lower South Wraxall.

Smithsonian Institution Research Information System. (retrieved 12 February 2010) =University of Oklahoma= Susie Peters, while working at the Indian Agency, encouraged Oscar Jacobson, the director of the University of Oklahoma's art department to create a special program for the Kiowa artists. In 1926, Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, and Mopope moved to Norman, Oklahoma. They were soon joined by Lois Smoky in 1927 and lived together in a house rented by Lois Smoky's parents. Jacobson provided studio space for the group, but felt that he did not want to interfere with the direction their painting was taking. Dr. Edith Mahler, an art professor at OU provided painting instruction and critiques. In the fall of 1927, James Auchiah joined the program at OU. Lois Smoky returned home in 1927, leaving the program. She married and was devoted to her family. Although she did not continue painting, she became a beadwork artist. Since her paintings are the rarest, they have become the most collectible of the group. Art career While Jacobson did not wish to dictate subject matter to the six artists, he actively promoted their work. He arranged for their work to be shown at the Denver Art Museum. In 1928, Jacobson entered their watercolor paintings in the First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where they received international acclaim. Their work continued to be exhibited throughout Europe. In 1929, Jacobson collaborated with a French printer to produce Kiowa Art, a portfolio of 24 pochoir prints of paintings by Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, Mopope, and Smoky of intertribal dancers, ceremonies, musicians, and Kiowa daily life. When they participated in the 1932 Venice Biennale, their exhibit \\"was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled.\\"Dunn, 240 The Kiowa Six are considered significant in the development of Native American painting by bridging the era of Ledger Art to flat-style Southern Plains painting. While not the first Native Americans to be successful in the international mainstream art world, their careers proved inspirational to many Native artists in the 20th century. Artwork Inspired by the narrative, representational qualities of Plains hide painting and ledger art, the Kiowa Six created a new style of painting that portrayed ceremonial and social scenes of Kiowa life and stories from oral history, which is characterized by solid color fields, minimal backgrounds, a flat perspective, and emphasis on details of dance regalia.

Meyer was one of the early German military aviators, volunteering on 1 February 1916. He would serve through the end of the war, rising to squadron command in the process. He would be recommended for Germany's highest award for valor, the Pour le Merite. Meyer remained in aviation postwar, and was head of aviation training at Magdeburg when he was killed in a motorcycle accident. Early life Georg Meyer was born in Bremen in the German Empire on 11 January 1893. His father was a merchant. After George Meyer completed elementary and high school, he went to work for the customs service from 1911-1912. He also completed his required military service. He joined Infantry Regiment No. 75 in 1911. Just before World War I began, he was conscripted into the Guards Ersatz Division. He went into battle with the Guards in France. Aerial service during World War I Meyer transferred to duty with Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches on 1 February 1916. By 18 August, he had been trained and was piloting a two-seater reconnaissance craft for Feldflieger Abteilung 69 in Macedonia. From there, he transferred to flying two-seaters on artillery direction duty with Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 253 on the Western Front. On 7 February 1917, he scored his first aerial victory, downing a Nieuport over Lemmes, France. In April 1917, he was transferred to fly single-seater fighters with Jasta 22. He had two unconfirmed victories there; then Josef Jacobs transferred to Jasta 7 on 2 August, taking Meyer with him. Meyer ran his score to four confirmed and two unconfirmed victories before being posted on to Jasta 37 on 25 March 1918. He ascended to command as Staffelf√ºhrer on 14 April 1918. In June, the unit re-equipped with Fokker D.VIIs, and Meyer began to quickly accumulate victories. He became a balloon buster, with six confirmed and two unconfirmed. He was also credited with an additional 18 enemy airplanes destroyed, with two more claims unconfirmed. On 18 October 1918, he was lightly wounded and remained on duty. He had been awarded both classes of the Iron Cross, his native Bremen's Hanseatic Cross, as well as the Knight's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern. On 5 November 1918, he was recommended for the Blue Max. The recommendation died with the German Empire upon the emperor's abdication. Post World War I On 22 January 1920, the Prussian National Assembly decided that Meyer should be awarded the Blue Max later. However, it is uncertain if this ever happened. Meyer remained in aviation. By 1926, he was head of the airline training school at Magdeburg. Georg Meyer was killed in a motorcycle accident on 15 September 1926.

The Pali Suttas, in Anguttara Nikaya(7:59; IV 91-94), records that the Buddha was delivering a teaching near or at Anathapindika's home when he was disrupted by the sounds of Sujata scolding the servants. The Buddha called for Sujata to be brought to him and delivered a Theravada teaching, which became famous, on the proper conduct of wives. In the story of Sujata the Buddha speaks of seven types of wife. The first three kinds are heading for unhappiness (in this world or the next). They are: # The destructive-wife (vadhaka or vadhakabhariya: alternate translations include ‚Äútroublesome-wife‚Äù and ‚Äúslayer-wife‚Äù) ‚Äì she is described as pitiless, fond of other men and neglectful, even contemptuous, of her husband; # The thievish-wife (chorisama or corabhariya: an alternate translation is ‚Äúrobber-wife‚Äù) ‚Äì she squanders the family wealth and is dishonest with her husband, especially as regards money; # The mistress-wife (ayyasama or ayyabhariya or \\"swamibhariya\\": alternate translations include ‚Äúlordly-wife‚Äù, ‚Äúmaster-wife‚Äù and ‚Äútyrant-wife‚Äù) ‚Äì she is shrewish, rude and coarsely-spoken when it suits her, lazy and domineering. The Buddha then states that the following four types are heading for happiness ‚Äì in this world or the next. A common feature of each of these wives is that they are also imbued with ‚Äúlong term self-control‚Äù. They are: # The motherly- wife (matusama or matubhariya) ‚Äì she treats her husband like her son in every way, being compassionate and kind, as well as caring responsibly after his wealth; # The sisterly-wife (bhaginisama or bhaginibhariya) ‚Äì she defers to her husband as she would her older brother. She is modest and is obedient to her lord and master (her husband) and wishes to please him in every way; # The friend-wife (sakhibhariya ‚Äì sakha means ‚Äúintimate friend‚Äù, as opposed to ‚Äúacquaintance friend‚Äù; an alternate translation for sakhibhariya is ‚Äúcompanion-wife‚Äù) ‚Äì she loves her husband as he is her best friend; through friendship and love she is devoted to him; # The slave-wife (dasisama or dasibhariya -dasi in Pali appears to mean ‚Äúslave-woman‚Äù or ‚Äúslave-servant‚Äù. Alternate translations include ‚Äúslave-like wife‚Äù, ‚Äúhandmaid-wife‚Äù and ‚Äúmaid- wife‚Äù) ‚Äì she behaves as an understanding wife when her shortcomings are pointed out. She remains calm and does not show any anger although her husband uses some harsh words. She is obedient to her husband's wishes. After speaking these things, Sujata was deeply moved by Buddha's words. Upon being asked which wife she was to be, she answered: \\"From today onwards, let the Exalted One think of me as the one in the last example for I'll be a good and understanding wife.\\" It may be argued that in the last case, the Buddha was not praising the qualities of the husband's abuse. Rather, he was praising the qualities of patience and emotional strength of the woman who finds herself in this position. Self-restraint is a virtue only found in the best women. Indeed, the first three wives are the prime examples of abusive women, who bring ruin to all and are thus to be avoided if possible.

Ordained a priest on June 8, 1950, and consecrated a bishop on December 14, 1962, he was the Bishop of Victoria until he retired on March 18, 1999. He was born in Swan Lake. This makes him Canada‚Äôs longest-serving Catholic bishop. As bishop he was notable for his advocacy of social justice, and the mismanagement of diocesan finances. Education De Roo has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin philosophy from the Coll√®ge de Saint-Boniface (University of Manitoba). In 1952 he earned a doctorate in sacred theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome with a dissertation entitled Regina in Coelum assumpta : les rapports entre l'assomption et la souverainet√© de Marie (Queen assumed into Heaven : The relationship between the Assumption and the sovereignty of Mary). He also has several honorary degrees and is an Enneagram of Personality teacher. Second Vatican Council De Roo attended all four sessions of Vatican II. This experience deeply affected him and he still refers to himself as \\"a pilgrim of the Second Vatican Council\\". He describes attending the sessions as \\"a voyage of discovery that would radically alter my whole outlook on reality\\" and \\"it was indeed a time of euphoria\\". Since his retirement, De Roo has continued to travel and lecture about Vatican II and gave the keynote address, Rebuild my church ‚Äì a Vatican Council Father Shares an Inspired Vision, at a Call to Action conference in 2008. Ordinary of Victoria De Roo was at the centre of a financial scandal that left his diocese nearly bankrupt. Over a 15-year period, he made a series of large investments in real estate and in a horse- breeding ranch, without adhering to canonical requirements for consent from the Vatican, consultation with diocesan clergy, or financial record-keeping. When the ventures failed, the diocese was left with a debt of over $17 million.Victoria Times Colonist De Roo was not accused of fraud, but did not obtain Vatican approval for any of these transactions. Vatican approval is required for transactions over $3.5 million. In May 2000, De Roo issued an apology to all Catholics in his former diocese which was printed in parish bulletins. In the apology he wrote that \\"I am truly sorry and beg your forgiveness.\\" The diocese sold off assets and issued bonds to clear the debt. During his tenure as diocesan bishop, De Roo was known as a strong proponent of social action and liberation theology and was a critic of capitalism. He was the main force behind the 1983 Canadian bishops' statement Ethical Reflections on the Economic Crisis. That document stated that the \\"goal of serving the human needs of all people in our society must take precedence over the maximization of profits and growth.\\" References 1924 births Living people Participants in the Second Vatican Council Canadian Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Remi De Roo"},{"id":"21330156","text":"Graphane is a two-dimensional polymer of carbon and hydrogen with the formula unit (CH)n where n is large. Graphane should not be confused with graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon alone. Graphane is a form of hydrogenated graphene. Graphane's carbon bonds are in sp3 configuration, as opposed to graphene's sp2 bond configuration, thus graphane is a two-dimensional analog of cubic diamond. Structure The structure was found, using a cluster expansion method, as the most stable of all the possible hydrogenation ratios of graphene in 2003. In 2007, researchers found that the compound is more stable than other compounds containing carbon and hydrogen, such as benzene, cyclohexane and polyethylene. This group named the predicted compound graphane, because it is the fully saturated version of graphene. The compound is an insulator. Chemical functionalization of graphene with hydrogen may be a suitable method to open a band gap in graphene. P-doped graphane is proposed to be a high-temperature BCS theory superconductor with a Tc above 90 K. Any disorder in hydrogenation conformation tends to contract the lattice constant by about 2.0%. Variants Partial hydrogenation leads to hydrogenated graphene rather than (fully hydrogenated) graphane. Such compounds are usually named as \\"graphane-like\\" structures. Graphane and graphane-like structures can be formed by electrolytic hydrogenation of graphene or few-layer graphene or high-oriented pyrolytic graphite. In the last case mechanical exfoliation of hydrogenated top layers can be used. Hydrogenation of graphene on substrate affects only one side, preserving hexagonal symmetry. One-sided hydrogenation of graphene is possible due to the existence of ripplings. Because the latter are distributed randomly, the obtained material is disordered in contrast to two-sided graphane. Annealing allows the hydrogen to disperse, reverting to graphene. Simulations revealed the underlying kinetic mechanism. Density functional theory calculations suggested that hydrogenated and fluorinated forms of other group IV (Si, Ge and Sn) nanosheets present properties similar to graphane. Potential applications Graphane has been proposed for hydrogen storage. Hydrogenation decreases the dependence of the lattice constant on temperature, which indicates a possible application in precision instruments.

History The regiment traced its lineage to the 7th Field Artillery Brigade that was formed as part of the 3rd Division in March 1916, which served on the Western Front during World War I. This unit was re-formed during the inter-war years as a part-time unit in New South Wales. In 1938 the unit was redesignated as the 7th Field Regiment RAA (Militia) and throughout the war undertook garrison duties in New South Wales and Western Australia. Although it was later gazetted as an AIF unit after the majority of its personnel volunteered for overseas service, the regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and disbanded in October 1943 and its personnel used to reinforce other units. During the post war period, the regiment was re-raised when the Citizens Military Force was established in 1948. Personnel were received from the disbanded 21st Field Regiment in 1957, and in 1960 the regiment also gained personnel from the 14th Field Regiment. In 1965, 26 Field Battery's 25-pounders were replaced with L5 howitzers but these were withdrawn in 1967, the battery reverting to 25-pounders. The regiment reorganised several times, with various component batteries existing at various times: R, P and Q batteries existed during the 1950s and early 1960s before being reorganised. Later the regiment contained 5, 26, 27, 28, and 113 Batteries. In 1996, the regiment's headquarters moved to Suakin Street, Pymble, following the closure of the Warrane Road, Willoughby, depot on 16 March of that year. Following changes brought about by Plan BEERSHEEBA, the regiment was disbanded on 1 January 2013 and replaced by a battery sized establishment known as 7 Light Battery. It is equipped with 81mm mortars. The former gun batteries were reduced to troop size and remain at the same depots. Structure Just prior to its disbandment, the regiment had two gun batteries which were equipped with the L119 Hamel Gun: *28 Field Battery based at Dee Why. *113 Field Battery based at Adamstown with a Troop at Erina.

The dolls had substantial popularity during the Victorian era. The name of the doll originates from the American folk ballad Fair Charlotte, based on the poem \\"A Corpse Going to a Ball\\" by Seba Smith, which tells of a young girl called Charlotte who refused to wrap up warmly to go on a sleigh ride because she did not want to cover up her pretty dress; she froze to death during the journey.Dolls Antonia Fraser, 1963, p. 62 History The Frozen Charlotte doll is made in the form of a standing, naked figure moulded as a solid piece. The dolls are also sometimes described as pillar dolls, solid chinas or bathing babies.Coleman. Dorothy S., Elizabeth A. and Evelyn JK.; The Collector's Encyclopaedia of Dolls Volume One, (USA, 1978) The dolls ranged in size from under an inch to 18 inches plus. The smallest dolls were sometimes used as charms in Christmas puddings. and smaller sizes were very popular for putting in doll's houses. Occasionally versions are seen with a glazed china front and an unglazed stoneware back. This enabled the doll to float on its back when placed in a bath.Eaton, Faith; Dolls In Colour (London, 1975) Frozen Charlotte dolls were popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. Smaller versions of the dolls were also known as penny dolls, because they were often sold for a cent.Melbourne Museum; Frozen Charlotte Doll (Victoria, 2002) Most were made in Germany. They are also made in bisque, and can come in white, pink-tinted, or, more rarely, painted black. Some rare examples have moulded chemises. Male dolls (identified by their boyish hairstyles) are called Frozen Charlies.

He is the entrepreneur behind the Greater Springfield Development in Queensland, the largest master-planned community in Australia. In 2019, Sinnathamby's Springfield City Group was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in recognition of their visionary entrepreneurship in establishing Springfield, as a nation-building project and Australia's first privately- constructed city.  Early life and education  Born in Malaysia on 10 December 1939, Maha Sinnathamby is a Hindu of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. His childhood was spent on a British-owned rubber estate in the small farming village of Rantau, Negeri Sembilan. His father worked for the plantation but was taken as a prisoner of war in July 1944 during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia. In September 1945, his father was released. Maha moved to Australia and studied civil engineering at the University of New South Wales. After graduating, he worked as a civil and design engineer for several years in South East Asia before returning to Australia.  Business career  He started his own property business in Perth in 1971, before moving to Queensland in the early 1980s. He continued building the company with numerous small residential subdivisions and several commercial projects in the region. = Greater Springfield Development = In 1992 with business partner Bob Sharpless, Maha bought a 2,860 hectare (approx 7067 acre) area of land in Ipswich, south-west of Brisbane, for $7.9 million. He then lobbied for basic education and transport infrastructure to be built in the area, which required a rezoning bill to be passed. On 24 January 1997, Queensland Parliament unanimously voted in favour of the legislation. The Greater Springfield area was designed as Australia's largest master-planned community (10th largest globally), and is focused on interconnected pillars of health, education, and information technology: * Education City: the educational core of Greater Springfield located in Springfield Central. It contains a University of Southern Queensland campus, 10 public and private schools, student accommodation, and a technical college. It is currently home to approximately 14,000 students. * Health City: A 52 hectare (128.5 acre) health precinct currently under construction, the area will offer Springfield residents and the wider region access to a range of professional health services. It currently contains the Mater Private Hospital. Aveo Group has been appointed exclusive developer for 2,500 new senior housing units and other health integrated facilities. * Idea City: The IT hub of Greater Springfield features Australia's leading Polaris Data Centre, and has a strong research focus on commercialising innovation in partnership with government and business. Currently, more than $15 billion has been invested by public and private stakeholders into the project. A$1.2 billion dual track major rail line and transit hub was established in 2013 and connected Greater Springfield to the wider South East Queensland area. Greater Springfield's current population is approximately 35,000, with a predicted growth to 105,000 by 2030. Greater Springfield's masterplan also retains 30 per cent of the land holding for open, green space. = Springfield City Group = Maha established Springfield City Group (formerly Springfield Land Corporation), of which he is the chairman, in conjunction with the purchase of the plot that would become Greater Springfield. The company is responsible for overseeing the development of the Greater Springfield area.  Personal life  In 1968 he married Yoga, and had his first child. Maha has three daughters ‚Äì Raynuha, Meera, Uma ‚Äì and a son, Naren. Maha has said that he enjoys spending his spare time golfing at Brookwater. = Philanthropy = Maha has donated more than $200 million of land and funds for vital social infrastructure, and established a program of scholarships within Greater Springfield to assist people with limited access to education. Maha also mentors a select group of young professionals, helping them to achieve personal excellence. Awards and recognition Sinnathamby's work was acknowledged globally in 2010 with the emerging Greater Springfield being named the world's best master-planned community by the International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI). He also won the Ernst and Young Master Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2017, the Australian Financial Review added Sinnathamby to its Billionaire Rich List at 57th position with a wealth of $1.02 billion.

The band was founded in 2002, initially consisting of three members: David Gold, Aaron Palmer and Brian McManus. Their lineup frequently changed afterward, with over 20 members in the band through its various incarnations, which saw operations later based out of Toronto from 2003‚Äì2007, and Sault Ste. Marie from 2008‚Äì2011. Their only constant member was multi-instrumentalist and frontman David Gold, with the band ending after Gold's death in December 2011, just before releasing their album Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light, which won the 2013 Juno Award for the Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year. Biography=Formation and history= Woods of Ypres was formed in Windsor, Ontario in 2002 by David Gold, Aaron Palmer and Brian McManus. The trio released the first Woods of Ypres demo, Against the Seasons: Cold Winter Songs from the Dead Summer Heat, the same year. After McManus' departure that same year, Woods of Ypres expanded to a quintet with new band members. Northern Lights Fest 2003 (L-R: Aaron Palmer, Dustin Black, Robin Cross, David Gold) That December, David Gold moved to Toronto to begin working on a full-length album, completely overhauling their lineup in the process. Following the departure of singer Chris Jones, David took over as Woods of Ypres' lead singer and guitarist. In 2004, the band's first full-length album, Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth, was released on David Gold's record label, Krankenhaus Records. Woods of Ypres 2004 (L‚ÄìR: Chris Jones, David Gold, Connor Sharpe, Jessica Rose, Steve Jones) The third Woods of Ypres album, Woods III: The Deepest Roots and Darkest Blues, was released at the end of 2007. Contrasting the two albums, critic Laura Taylor wrote, \\"While Pursuit of the Sun verged on metalized Pink Floyd, Woods' latest unearths more of the band's black and dark metal inspirations\\".Wiebe Taylor, Laura (March 2008). \\"Woods Of Ypres: Deepest Roots and Darkest Blues\\", Exclaim!.

Marie, Ontario in 2008, where he united with existing local metal band Gates of Winter to both form the core of the new six-piece Woods of Ypres lineup, and join Gates of Winter himself on drums. After a series of lineup changes and departures, they recorded their fourth album Woods IV: The Green Album the following year. Released in November 2009, Exclaim! called it \\"the band's most amorphous and powerful creature so far.\\"Taylor, Laura (February 2010). \\"Woods Of Ypres: Woods 4: The Green Album\\", Exclaim!. Retrieved April 24, 2010. Earlier in 2009, Woods of Ypres also put out a compilation of 12 of the songs from their three main Krankenhaus-released albums entitled Independent Nature 2002‚Äì2007 and a vinyl- only single release of their 2004 song \\"Allure of the Earth\\", which also featured a cover of that song by Australian cellists Sebastian Simpson and Chris Doig. Woods of Ypres 2009 (L-R: Steve Furgiuele, Evan Madden, David Gold, Bryan Belleau) Sessions towards an unreleased EP named Woods 4.5: You Were The Light were made in Sault Ste. Marie in 2010 as well, but just two tracks from those sessions have been released as part of a vinyl-only single named Home in 2011, which has retroactively been referred to as Woods 4.5 in some interviews. Woods of Ypres announced their breakup in late 2010 partly due to frontman David Gold's move to Kuwait for work reasons, but it was announced that fall that the split was entirely false, and that Woods of Ypres had signed to Earache Records, who would later put out the band's last two studio albums. Woods of Ypres' lineups had been noticeably unstable since their inception, with only David Gold participating on every release by the band. Woods of Ypres' live lineups ranged from three to six members at differing points, with lineups almost completely changing when Gold relocated the band, while two of their full-length albums only credit two musicians as full band members. Singles and compilations aside, the only band member to appear on two of the band's main albums other than Gold was keyboardist Jessica Rose, who performed on both Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth and Woods III. All of Woods of Ypres's albums (except Woods V) saw their initial release or pre-2011 reissues on independent labels ran by David Gold, including Krankenhaus Records from 2004 to 2009, and Practical Art Records from 2009 to 2011. While Krankenhaus released albums by a few different Canadian metal bands, Practical Art only released albums from musical projects that Gold was a performer on. As well, Woods of Ypres were notorious for their independently ran and booked headlining tours of Canada and the United States. =Death of David Gold and breakup= Woods of Ypres played what would turn out to be their last concert in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 2011. After the dismissal of Shane and Evan Madden shortly afterward, remaining band members David Gold and Joel Violette recorded the band's final studio album Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light that August at Beach Road Studios in Goderich, Ontario. On December 22, 2011, David Gold died at age 31, in a collision with an automobile near Barrie, Ontario. Gold's death ended plans for Woods of Ypres to play their first European tour in early 2012, along with scuttling the planned debuts of new band members Brendan Hayter and Rae Amitay. Guitarist Joel Violette indicated in interviews that Woods of Ypres would not carry on recording or touring without Gold, effectively ending the band. Woods 5, was released on February 27, 2012, in Europe, with the North American release coming two months later. The band received a posthumous Juno nomination in the Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year category in February 2013, and won the award in April. Official tribute concerts in Toronto and Sault Ste. Marie were held in April 2012, featuring bands such as Kittie and Novembers Doom. The Toronto concert served as the CD release party for Woods 5, while Sault Ste. Marie saw Woods of Ypres former band members Joel Violette, Bryan Belleau, and Rae Amitay play an acoustic set of Woods of Ypres material. A Woods of Ypres tribute album has been released, while the surviving members of Woods of Ypres' final lineup have since joined forces in the New Brunswick-based black metal band Thrawsunblat.

The ecoregion covers a region of highlands and plateaus that includes Mount Mulanje (3,002 m) in the southeast and the lower Shire Highlands to the northeast and east, with the Tuchila Plain between them. The Shire Highlands includes the Zomba Plateau (2,087 m) in the north and the Thyolo Mountains (1,462 m) to the south. The low valley of the Shire River, part of the African Rift Valley system, bounds the Shire Highlands to the northwest, west, and southwest. The valley of the Ruo River, a tributary of the Shire, bounds the ecoregion on the south and southeast. The Phalombe Plain and the valley of Lake Chilwa lie to the northeast. The ecoregion enjoyed lush forests, fertile soils, ample water, and mild climate, and is one of the most densely populated regions of Malawi. Blantyre, Malawi's second-largest city, is in the Shire Highlands. Tea is grown commercially in the highlands, especially around Thyolo and Mulanje, and is one of Malawi's chief exports. The highlands' climate and geology are home to communities of plants and animals distinct from the woodland and savanna ecoregions of the surrounding lowlands. The ecoregion is bounded to the southeast by the Eastern miombo woodlands, and to the northwest by the Southern miombo woodlands. The generally drier Zambezian and mopane woodlands lie to the southwest in the Zambezi lowlands, and to the east in the basin of Lake Chilwa. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical highlands climate, generally cooler and more humid than the surrounding lowlands. There is a single summer rainy season between November to April. Moisture-bearing winds from the southeast, known as Chiperone weather, provide occasional moisture during the dry season, producing mist and rain as they encounter the mountain slopes. Northern and western slopes are generally drier than the south and east-facing slopes. Frosts occur at the highest elevations in the Mulanje Massif. Flora The ecoregion has several distinct plant communities, which vary with elevation and exposure. Until recently, rainforests were predominant on the southern and southeastern slopes of Mt. Mulanje, with the trees Newtonia buchananii and Khaya anthotheca predominant. Most have been cleared, but remnants exist in stream valleys. Mid-elevation forests are found between 900 and 1,350 meters elevation. Newtonia buchananii, Albizia adianthifolia, Funtumia africana, and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum are the dominant trees in the low-canopy forest, and host many lichens, mosses and epiphytes. Afromontane forests occur in fragmented patches above 1600 meters elevation, with Mulanje cedar (Widdringtonia whytei), Olea capensis, Podocarpus latifolius, Ekebergia capensis, Cassipourea malosana, and Rapanea melanophloeos as the dominant trees. Mulanje cedar is endemic to the ecoregion, found only on Mulanje in valley forests protected from fire. Other plant communities include tussock grasslands, and Afromontane heathlands on the highest elevations of Mulanje. Fauna The endangered Thyolo alethe (Chamaetylas choloensis) is a near-endemic bird species.

He is a famous Cossack colonel of unknown origin, and originally a friend (more like an adopted son) of the Kurcewicz family. He falls in love with Helena Kurcewicz√≥wna and wants to marry her. However he is thwarted by his rival, Jan Skrzetuski, a Polish nobleman, who forces the matron, Princes Kurcewicz to promise him Helena's hand, with Helena's approval. Betrayed and rejected Bohun raids the Kurcewicz estate, slaughters the family, kidnaps Helena and joins the ongoing Cossack uprising. The novel revolves around the struggle between Skrzetuski and Bohun with the Khmelnytsky Uprising as historical background. The character is based on the historical figure, Ivan Bohun. Bohun is portrayed by Aleksandr Domogarov in 1999 Jerzy Hoffman's film With Fire and Sword. Character history Date of Bohun's birth is unknown, as well as the origin of his parents. He grew up in Zaporizhia, from early age becoming familiar with expeditions to the Black Sea and skirmishes with Tartars. He quickly gained fame among Cossacks for his outstanding courage and became their leader (ataman). He became a friend of the Kurcewicz brothers, who often joined Cossacks on expeditions. He was treated like a member of their family. Their mother, widowed princess Kurcewicz, regarded him as her own son. Bohun fell in love with Kurcewicz's orphaned cousin, princess Helena but she despised him since he killed a man in her presence. Her aunt, however, agreed to give Bohun Helena's hand in marriage when he promised to let her keep Roz≈Çogi (which was Helena's dowry). Bohun and Zag≈Çoba by Juliusz Kossak In 1648 Bohun served Poland as the lieutenant-colonel of the Pereiaslav regiment. At this time Helena and the Polish lieutenant Jan Skrzetuski fell in love with each other. Bohun discovered that Kurcewiczes had betrayed him and promised the girl to the Pole. In the company of Zag≈Çoba and some Cossacks from his regiment, he rushed to Roz≈Çogi, intending to kidnap Helena and take revenge on her family. During the fight he killed Symeon and Miko≈Çaj, the two Kurcewicz brothers. The old princess was strangled by Bohun's Cossacks. Helena escaped from Roz≈Çogi with Zag≈Çoba and Bohun with his men set off in pursuit. On his way, Bohun attacked a group of Polish troops, which was equivalent to joining the ongoing Cossack rebellion. Despite a long and desperate search, he didn't manage to find Zag≈Çoba and Helena. Eventually he finally discovered the girl in the Bar fortress, where Zag≈Çoba had hidden her. He captured the city and saved his beloved from the slaughter. Helena, at the very sight of him, stabbed herself with a knife. Bohun took her to Devil's Valley at the Dniester. He put her in witch Horpyna's care and left. He was sent against Polish troops as a spy. He defeated a group led by Zag≈Çoba and imprisoned him. However, Polish relief led by Micha≈Ç Wo≈Çodyjowski soon came. Wo≈Çodyjowski rescued Zag≈Çoba and forced Bohun to escape with Cossack survivors. Later on, when Bohun traveled as an envoy, he challenged Wo≈Çodyjowski to a duel. After a long fight, he was seriously wounded. He recovered with the help of Rzƒôdzian, who unbeknown to Bohun was Skrzetuski's servant. He asked the boy to go to the Devil's Valley and take Helena to Kiev. Instead Rzƒôdzian helped Zag≈Çoba and Wo≈Çodyjowski find Helena and free her. Shortly after the Siege of Zbarazh began. Bohun didn't manage to get there on time. He arrived a few days after the battle was over, when the peace treaty was signed. Enraged with the news, Bohun attacked the whole Polish army along with 300 men. He was taken prisoner by Wo≈Çodyjowski and his group (Sienkiewicz didn't write how Bohun was wounded). Skrzetuski, admiring Bohun's courage, set him free. Bohun then gives his final farewell to Skrzetski and Helena as he rides his horse away to join back with the Cossacks . In the Epilogue of the novel, Bohun is said to have taken part in the Battle of Berestechko in 1651. He then became the leader of Cossacks during Khmelnytsky's absence. Although the battle was lost by Cossacks, Bohun managed to save himself and some part of Cossack army from the slaughter. He lived in rebuilt Roz≈Çogi and fought against Poles in the following wars. Description Bohun is a tall, strong, young man. He's black-haired and has got dark eyes. > He saw now a young hero, straight as a poplar, with splendid brunette face, > and rich, dark, drooping mustache. On that face gladness burst through the > pensive mood of the Ukraine, as the sun through a mist. The leader had a > lofty forehead, on which his dark hair drooped as a mane above his powerful > brow. An aquiline nose, dilated nostrils, and white teeth, shining at every > smile, gave the face a slight expression of rapacity; but on the whole it > was a model of Ukraine beauty, luxuriant, full of character and > defiance.Sienkiewicz, H. & Curtin J., With Fire and Sword, Chapter 4 Although Bohun is generally a villain in the novel, his character is rather ambiguous. He is very passionate and hot-tempered. As an impulsive person, he often takes risk and often acts in a foolhardy manner. He often shows the cruel and violent side of his personality - he murders Kurcewicz brothers and nearly kills Rzƒôdzian in the heat of anger. He is also willful and arrogant, he disobeys commands and doesn't care much for the possible consequences. After falling in love with Helena, he doesn't accept her refusal, and wants to force her to marry him. On the other hand, Bohun is a man of incredible, almost insane bravery. He has no fear of death and many of his actions are simply reckless. He is a fine soldier who eagerly fights for the Cossack's freedom and always stays true to himself. He is also able to love one woman deeply and faithfully. Although Helena despises him, he respects her and is willing to do anything for her. In the Epilogue of the novel we learn that after many years Bohun didn't change at all. As before, he wanted to stay independent and, most probably, still loved Helena. > The haughty Bogun refused every guardianship, and was ready to defend his > Cossack freedom with the sword. It was said, too, that a smile never > appeared on the lips of this strange man. He lived not in Lubni, but in a > village which he raised from its ashes, and which was called > Rozlogi.Sienkiewicz, H. & Curtin J., With Fire and Sword, Epilogue See also * Ivan Bohun * Zaporozhian Cossacks References Sienkiewicz's Trilogy Fictional Ukrainian people Literary characters introduced in 1884 Characters in novels of the 19th century pl:Bohun ","title":"Yuri Bohun"},{"id":"21330873","text":"St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and Joshua Thomas Chapel is a historic Methodist Episcopal church complex located at Deal Island, Somerset County, Maryland.

The book is the sequel to The Princess and the Goblin. The adventure continues with Princess Irene and Curdie a year or two older. They must overthrow a set of corrupt ministers who are poisoning Irene's father, the king. Irene's grandmother also reappears and gives Curdie a strange gift. A monster called Lina aids his quest. Synopsis Two years have passed since the last book, and Princess Irene and her father go to Gwyntystorm, while Curdie (a miner boy who is the friend of the Princess) stays at home with his mother and father. As the years go by, Curdie begins to hunt for pleasure. He also slowly begins to doubt Irene's story of her great- great grandmother. One day, he shoots down a white pigeon. Curdie then remembers Irene's tale of her grandmother's pigeons, assumes the one he has shot down was one of them, and becomes aware of his folly. A light appears at the roof of the castle, and Curdie follows it. There, Curdie meets the old Princess, who appears small and withered, contrary to Irene's descriptions. The old Princess gently tells Curdie of his wrong thinking, and he confesses. Because he now believes, the pigeon heals. He is then told to keep his bow and arrows but use them for good instead of bad things. The old Princess then tells Curdie he must go on a special quest. Before she sends him, she burns his hands in her special fire of roses. His cleansed hands now possess the ability to be able to feel the hands of his fellow men and detect what kind of person (or beast) they are on the inside. She also gives Curdie's father a special emerald to keep while Curdie is away on the quest. If Curdie is in danger, the emerald will change colour, to alert his father to go after him. Curdie is given a monstrous yet friendly beast, Lina, as his only travelling companion. Lina saves him from many perils as they travel to Gwyntystorm. Once they reach their destination, Curdie's task becomes clear: he finds himself at the King's palace, where the King lies weak and ill in his bedchamber with his daughter Irene his only nurse. Having sneaked in to spy on what is going on and eavesdrop on the palace servants, Curdie realises that the King's \\"doctor\\" is actually slowly poisoning him. The palace servants and courtiers have all become morally corrupt and enemies of the king. No one can be trusted and both the Princess and the King are in mortal danger, so Curdie realises why the Old Princess has sent him: he must save the king (Irene's father) from a plot to poison him and steal his kingdom by forcibly marrying his daughter Princess Irene to an evil pretender. With the aid of the old Princess, who has been disguised as a housemaid, the king, his daughter, and the kingdom are saved.

Canon Arthur Pierce, Ph.D., Anglican Maryland, 1692-1792, Virginia Beach: The Donning Company, 1992, pp. 5, 12, These old parishes often had a church and several chapels of ease near population centers. This building, stands surrounded by farm fields and a historic Presbyterian Church near the Pocomoke River in what was then called Rehoboth but is now Rehobeth, Maryland to distinguish it from a beachfront community in Delaware. Coventry Parish's vestry erected a two-story seven-by-three-bay Flemish bond brick church between 1785 and 1788, one of the most difficult times for the denomination in Maryland, since it reorganized as the Episcopal Church as well as was disestablished (lost state support). At the time of its construction, the 76 foot by 56 foot structure was the largest Episcopal church on Maryland's Eastern Shore, only slightly smaller than Hungars Church further down the Delmarva Peninsula in Northampton County, Virginia. It was partially built using bricks from an older church nearby, which was dismantled. The church remained in use until the late 19th century, when the few remaining parishioners decided to combine with what had been the chapel of ease, St. Paul's at Marion, Maryland (where Maryland route 667, on which this stands connects to U.S. Route 13 down the Delmarva Peninsula, as well as Maryland Route 413).

Early life and career He was born in Hong Kong in 1917, and spent his early years in Guichi, Anhui. Yao joined the Communist Party of China in 1935. During the December 9th Movement, Yao was the secretary of the Beijing city Party study group. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, he became the vice-director of the Finance Office of the Communist-controlled area. This began a long period of leadership in financial positions. In 1979, Yao became the Vice-Premier of the State Council. At the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1987, Yao was elected to the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China and later rose to the position of First Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China. Role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Yao Yilin held the position of First Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China and was responsible for economic planning and management.Zhang Liang. Tiananmen Papers. Public Affairs, 2002. p. 639. Yao was associated with the conservative side of the party which denied that the students were patriotic and advocated a quick suppression to the movement. Yao Yilin and Li Peng were both able to effectively oppose Zhao Ziyang in order to ensure that conservative influence would dominate the decisions made in the CPC.George H. W. Bush Library. \\"White House Situation Room Files, Tiananmen Square Crisis File, China ‚Äì Part 1 Of 5 Tianamen Square Crisis\\" Tiananmen Square and U.S.-China relations, 1989‚Äì1993, May‚ÄìJune 1989. p 76. Retrieved November 12, 2010, from Archives Unbound. =Involvement with April 26 Editorial= The April 26 editorial published in the People's Daily angered the students and greatly contributed to the growing numbers in the square. The official report of the Communist Party of China stated that the movement was not patriotic and the students were being led by a small group of anti- communist conspirators to cause \\"turmoil\\". Deng Xiaoping's own opinions were placed in the editorial to help support it and ensure that the people of China would obediently accept the party's view of the protests. However, two opposing sides emerged in the party: one supported keeping the editorial the same, the other wanted to change the editorial to appease the students. Yao rejected Zhao's offer to take the blame for changing the party's opinion of the movement because the people would begin to doubt the cohesiveness of the party. Yao proposed less conciliatory action with the students. Instead he wanted to further prevent other political leaders from supporting the protests, force students to end class boycotts, and maintain labor discipline in industry and commerce to keep production on track. Yao Yilin and Li Peng were the leaders of the conservative faction and gained support by siding with Deng Xiaoping's view of the protests. Deng Xiaoping held a considerable amount of honour and prestige in China because of his long term involvement with the Communist Party and his close ties with China's previous iconic leader, Mao Zedong.Ming Pao. \\"Balance of Power\\" Daily Report, June 1989. p 5.

Yao Yilin attacked Zhao because he blamed the party for allowing corruption to go unchecked and making democracy and law worse in China. Zhao found himself in a difficult situation when Yao and other conservatives worked together and opposed the decisions he made with other reformers such as Chen Yizi and Bao Tong.Cheng Ming. \\"CPC Split\\" Daily Report, June 1989. p 28.

The need for martial law came from the fear that the continuing stream of students entering the square were secretly coerced by anti-communist powers. Party leaders were afraid that these powers were continuing to fill Tiananmen Square with students and protesters that would only function to obstruct the CPC from governing the Chinese people. Martial law was seen by the conservative faction as the only method that could bring about a crackdown with enough force to prevent future protesters from attempting to reach the square. According to Tony Saich, Yao was such a strong supporter of martial law because he saw it as a last resort option to end the protests and return proper functioning to Beijing.Saich, Tony. \\"The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement.\\" Contemporary China Center, Australian National University, no. 9, July 1990. p 201. Retrieved November 23, 2010, from JSTOR. In a discussion with other party leaders, Yao Yilin was quoted saying \\"The nature of this student movement has changed. It began as a natural expression of grief and has turned into social turmoil.\\" He advocated that all unofficially recognized student organizations should be considered illegal because he feared they would spread the turmoil outside Beijing and throughout the rest of the country. Yao was also the only member of the Standing Committee to refuse dialogue with the students because he believed that a small group of conspirators were behind these student organizations and dialogue with them would only strengthen their ability to overthrow the CPC. Chow Chung-Yan discusses in his article published in the South China Morning Post how Li Peng and Yao Yilin favoured martial law because it would allow the hardliners to hold the power they had in the country.Chow Chung-Yan. \\"Zhao Ziyang alleges Li Peng 1989 scheming; Late leader's explosive memoirs out\\" South China Morning Post, May 2009. p 1.

The daily strip about two-fisted undercover cop Barry began Monday, March 19, 1934, as one of several strips introduced to compete with Dick Tracy by Chester Gould (no relation). A Sunday strip was added on February 3, 1935. The daily strip ran for three years, until August 14, 1937, and the Sunday page ended almost a year later, on July 17, 1938. Background In 1929, Gould began as a sports cartoonist for the Bronx Home News where he also drew the comic strip Felix O'Fan. For the New York Graphic he created Asparagus Tipps (1926-1929). Relocating to California in 1930, he freelanced to several syndicates before creating Red Barry, which he wrote and drew from 1934 to 1938. Gould drew Red Barry in a crisp, clean line style. His assistant on the strip was Walter Frehm. Contract disputes between Gould and King Features brought Red Barry to an end in 1939.LambiekWare, Hames and Leiffer, Paul. The Comic Strip Project. WebCitation archive. New York Evening Graphic journalist Frank Mallen wrote: :Those of us who were acquainted with Will Gould, popular sports cartoonist on the Graphic in its early days, were never able to understand why he abandoned the drawing board, after achieving considerable success at it, to disappear in Hollywood. He had shown promise of becoming one of the greatest artists in the business and had a tremendous following. Gould left the Graphic to join King Features. There he drew a daily sports panel and a detective comic strip serial called Red Barry, which were widely distributed. Then suddenly he chucked it all. :\\"I got bored too easily,\\" was his recent explanation, \\"especially when I discovered California and that delightful narcotic known as golf.\\" He now works for TV and radio.Mallen, Frank.

Since its founding in 1983, the Shinjuku, Tokyo based organization has launched more than 100 voyages. These cruises, the main operation of the Peace Boat organization, are on average carried out at least three times a year. Peace Boat, described by the San Francisco Chronicle as a \\"floating university of sorts\\", offers educational opportunities aboard, with conferences related to global events. They also provide humanitarian aid at their various stops and visit local organizations. Besides the international voyages, Peace Boat carries out a number of other projects seeking justice in various international realms such as a campaign for the abolition of land mines, the Global Article 9 Conference to Abolish War or Global Hibakusha Forums onboard and in ports. Peace Boat also acts as the Northeast Asia regional secretariat of the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict and is member of ICAN (International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons), having played a significant role in negotiations to strengthen the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 2017. Peace Boat is an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and a committed campaigner for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  History = Founding = In 1983, Yoshioka Tatsuya and Kiyomi Tsujimoto, then students of Waseda University, initiated Peace Boat in answer to Japanese history textbook controversies. With the assistance of like-minded students, they organized the first voyage. Peace Boat has since visited more than 270 ports with over 70,000 participants. = Past Peace Boat cruises = Short cruises in Asia  During the first six years after it was founded, Peace Boat ran one- to two-week long cruises to various Asian countries around Japan at the rate of one per year. Time on the boat was used to hold lectures and events with guest speakers invited from the countries to be visited. When at port, international exchange events were carried out with local NGOs and student groups. This became the foundational style for which the rest of the cruises would be based on.  Start of circumnavigational cruises  In 1990, the 10th Peace Boat cruise marked the beginning of the circumnavigational cruise series. During the cruise, the Gulf War broke out and the ship encountered a US aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. After the success of first round-the-world cruise, Peace Boat continued them on a regular basis.  'Citizen's Diplomacy' trip to Kuril Islands  In 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, set out to the Kuril Islands with the notion of a 'Citizen's Diplomacy' mission, stopping at Iturup, Kunashir, and Shikotan islands. There were homestays and tours. This was the first trip made to these islands without a visa by an NGO from Japan.  More cruises  Over the past 30 years, Peace Boat has organized over 100 voyages, including more than 60 around-the-world voyages, carrying over 70,000 participants to over 270 ports.

Operated as Peace Boat between 200 and 2008. *Clipper Pacific (18,416 GT) - Built in 1970 for Royal Caribbean. Operated for Peace Boat briefly in 2008. However, due to numerous repeated problems with the ship, the charter was cut short, ending in Piraeus, Greece instead of ending in Japan as scheduled. *Mona Lisa (28,891 GRT) - Built in 1966 by a shipyard in Scotland. Chartered to replace the Clipper Pacific and completed the remainder of the voyage. Operated as Peace Boat between 2008 and 2009. * OlviaIMO 7359498 *Oceanic (38,772 GT) - Built in 1965 by an Italian shipyard. Operated as Peace Boat between 2009 and 2012. *Ocean Dream (32,265 GT) - The ship currently chartered by Peace Boat. Built in 1981 by a Danish shipyard. Operated as Peace Boat since 2012. *The Zenith (47,413 GT) - In July 2019 it was announced the Zenith would leave Pullmantur's fleet in early 2020 to Peace Boat. The was delivered to Peace Boat in February 2020 and renamed The Zenith. In September 2020 Peace Boat announced to charter a Sun-class cruise ship, which will replace the Ocean Dream and the The Zenith.  Other projects = Landmine Abolition Campaign = Since 1998, Peace Boat has continually run a project called P-MAC, or Peace Boat Mine Abolition Campaign, to support organizations carrying out landmine removal in such countries as Cambodia and Afghanistan. In the world there are approximately 110 million landmines in the ground, and even now many continue to be injured or lose their life without a trace. Most of these victims are not combatants but normal civilians. As of 2009, through a number of campaigns, Peace Boat raised money to clear 886,472 sq meters of landmine inundated areas and open five elementary schools. Fund raising campaigns are ongoing. = Peace Ball Project = Since 1999, Peace Boat has donated over 12,000 soccer balls to 43 countries. The Peace Ball project delivers soccer balls and other sports equipment to disadvantaged children, and uses the power of the world's most popular sport to build bridges of communication and solidarity. = GET Language Programme = Launched in 1999, the onboard GET language programme allows participants to communicate more effectively with the people they meet onboard and in port. The programme focuses on oral communication, viewing languages as global tools for international and intercultural exchange, and combines onboard classroom study with exchange programmes and home-stays in selected ports of call. = Global University Programme = In 2000, Peace Boat established its Global University peace education programme. Seminars at sea and study/exposure tours at ports of call make up the Global University curriculum, an intensive peace and sustainability education programme focused on experiential learning. = Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) = In 2004, Peace Boat became the Northeast Asia regional secretariat for the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC). This is an international network of NGOs working in peacebuilding and conflict prevention. It is made up of 15 regions, each working with its own action plan to address issues specific to each region. = Global Article 9 Campaign = In light of the Japanese government's pressure to amend it, Peace Boat together with the Japan Lawyers' International Solidarity Association (JALISA), launched the Global Article 9 Campaign to Abolish War in 2005. The Campaign strives not only to protect Article 9 locally, but also to build an international movement supporting Article 9 as the shared property of the world, calling for a global peace that does not rely on force. = Vietnam Defoliate Victim Support Campaign = From 2005 to 2008 Peace Boat raised approximately $13,000 in funds which were donated to Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange and subsequently used to cover a portion of construction costs for a facility for supporting victims. On the 2009 cruise, Peace Boat visited the facility with a group of Japanese atomic bomb victims, and held the first exchange program there. = International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) = The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) is a coalition of NGOs in 100 countries around the world. Peace Boat is a member of the campaign's international steering group, led by Executive Committee Member Kawasaki Akira. ICAN played a significant role in advocacy leading to the adoption of a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons at the United Nations in New York in July 2017. In October 2017, the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017 to ICAN. The organization received the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons. = The Hibakusha Project = The Hibakusha Project was started by Peace Boat to highlight the inhumanity of nuclear weapons and to forge a path toward a nuclear abolition. As part of the project, Hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki) join Peace Boat voyages to give their testimonies to the world of their first hand experiences with nuclear weapons, and call for their abolition. In 2016, the project has taken place on ninth separate Peace Boat voyages and more than 170 Hibakusha have travelled around the world sharing their testimonies. = Peace Boat Millennium Development Goals Campaign = Since 2009, Peace Boat run its own Millennium Development Goals Campaign in partnership with various international organizations and NGOs to raise awareness of the MDGs and the role of civil society in achieving these goals. Peace Boat's ship displayed the United Nations Millennium Campaign logo ‚ÄòEnd Poverty 2015‚Äô. = Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Centre = The Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center was established following the tremendous devastation caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. The Center based its activities in one of the worst affected areas, Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture, and dispatched thousands of volunteers there to support local residents in carrying out emergency relief efforts. PBV carries out domestic and international emergency relief work at sites affected by natural disasters such as typhoons, floods and heavy snow. At the same time, it works toward future disaster prevention and reduction by proactively building partnerships with business and local government authorities and cultivating a network of volunteer leaders ready to act. The Peace Boat, Ocean Dream, at Easter Island in June 2019 = Ecoship = Peace Boat's Ecoship is a transformational programme to construct the planet's most environmentally sustainable cruise ship. Peace Boat organised a multi-disciplinary charrette, bringing together world experts from fields as diverse as naval architecture, renewable energy, and biophilic and biomimetic design with the goal of defining the specifications for a ‚Äòrestorative‚Äô vessel ‚Äì where radical energy efficiency and closed material flow combine for a net positive impact on the environment. It will be a flagship for climate action. Its whole-system design and maximization of renewable energy use will enable 40% CO2 cuts. Ecoship was introduced in an official press conference at COP21. = The Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassador Programme = A group of young leaders from states on the front line of climate change and marine degradation joined Peace Boat's 95th Global Voyage in Barcelona on September and October 2017 as a part of a new programme to highlight these crucial issues and build momentum for climate action and the Bonn 2017 UN Climate Change Conference (COP23). These young women and men between 19 and 26 years of age were from the regions of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Caribbean. The Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassador Programme was an endorsed event of the COP23 in line with Fiji's vision for the COP23, as recognized by the COP23 Presidency Secretariat. In June and July 2018, the second edition of the programme took place from Stockholm to New York City. The third edition took place on May and June 2019 from Valletta to New York City.

Plot The Conchords are playing a gig at a local public library. During the performance Bret disses every rapper that comes to mind. At the band meeting the next day, Bret and Jemaine are criticized by Murray for making too much noise at the library, and for dissing the rappers. They proceed to launch into a rap about \\"Hurt Feelings\\". The meeting concludes with Murray warning the duo about the rappers hurting them back. Dave tells Bret and Jemaine that American rappers hold grudges and seek retribution. This worries Bret so much that he begins to recruit a gang for protection. The members include \\"Johnny Boy\\" an elderly man with a history of gang involvement, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, two Asian Internet cafe owners who want retribution against vandals, and Dave (who claims to have been a Navy Seal). Murray is harassed by several Australian men who work at the Australian consulate. Bret's gang has its first meeting. They figure out a timetable for guarding against any rapper attacks. Outside the apartment, Jemaine is accosted by Mel, who has painted a hideous portrait of him. Upon entering the apartment Jemaine is ambushed by the gang. Jemaine complains about this at the next band meeting, and Murray tries to persuade Bret to disband the gang. Bret refuses, but an argument is averted by the arrival of Greg, who informs Murray that they are invited to a function at the Australian consulate. Mel finds her painting in the garbage. Jemaine claims that he had to throw it out because Bret was jealous. Mel promptly leaves to remedy this. Jemaine and Murray go to the function at the Australian consulate, which is much more posh than the New Zealand consulate. They are once again harassed by the Australians, who call Jemaine \\"Miss New Zealand\\". Even the ambassador joins in on the needling. The cast launches into another round of \\"Hurt Feelings\\". Dave and Bret are keeping an eye out for ambushes by rappers. Murray, Greg, and Jemaine run into the Australians from the consulate. Bret is called on by the Lees to stop some kids from vandalizing their cafe. Both the gang and Murray launch into a West Side Story style dance off with their foes, complete with snapping. Bret ends up kicking one of the vandals, and Johnny takes him and Dave to hide at his old hideout. Upon discovering that it is no longer there, Johnny quits the gang. That evening, Jemaine discovers that Mel has returned the painting, and now Bret is included. Jemaine tries to get rid of it, but Mel catches him and not wanting to offend, says that he is simply showing it to the neighborhood. Meanwhile, the police show up to question Bret about him kicking the boy. While Bret gets off with a warning, Dave falls off the windowsill while trying to escape. He winds up in the hospital, and quits the gang. Murray and Jemaine join, but after Jemaine and Bret quit, Murray is the only remaining member. The episode ends with Mel and Jemaine showing the horrendous painting around. Songs The following songs are heard in this episode: =\\"Hurt Feelings\\"= A rap song in which Bret and Jemaine describe occasions on which they experienced hurt feelings. The accompanying music video includes a shot in which Bret and Jemaine are dressed as Mozart. =\\"Hurt Feelings\\" (Reprise)= An alternative version of \\"Hurt Feelings\\" featuring Murray, Mel, Doug, Greg, and Jemaine (with Bret doing background vocals) in which they hurtfully describe slights made against them by other characters in the episode. =\\"Stay Cool\\"= Stay Cool features lyrics and choreography mimicking the performance of \\"Cool\\" from the musical West Side Story. Bret, Murray and their respective \\"gangs\\" confront their tormentors, dance style. =Other songs= At the very beginning of the episode, the Conchords are seen singing a brand new rap song at their library gig. Each line of the song consists of the name of a famous rapper followed by the words \\"is not very good\\". The exceptions are the announcement of the beginning and end of Jemaine's \\"bass solo\\" and the preceding line: \\"but the Rhymenoceros is very, very good\\", Rhymenoceros being Bret's rapping name.

It is located on the site of former George High School, and it formed as the result of the merger of George and nearby Fulton High School. It has been transformed into a campus of four small schools. As of the 2008-2009 school year, it had an enrollment of approximately 1000 students. History South Atlanta was established in 1994 after the merger of Walter F. George High School (which was located at the current South Atlanta complex) and Fulton High School (which was located at the present-day Dobbs Elementary near the Lakewood area). George High School hosted a vocational program which offered classes such as woodworking, brickwork, auto mechanics, home economics, and welding. It was also the only high school in Atlanta Public Schools (APS) to have an airplane hangar. Fulton High School was also unique in its own right. It was the only high school in the school system to have four different campuses during its tenure. First, it was located at the corner of Whitehall and Garnett St., second, it moved down Whitehall to the corner of Trinity Street, third, it was located on Washington St. But in 1952 when the City of Atlanta implemented its Plan of Improvement and annexed the area south of McDonough Boulevard, including Lakewood Heights, a new building was built, and Fulton moved to its last site on Jonesboro Road. (It's possible that Fulton County actually built the building in 1950 or '51.) That building was torn down and Dobbs Elementary School replaced it in 2004. Although Fulton High dates back to 1917, it was not an Atlanta public school until 1952. Prior to that, Fulton, North Fulton, and West Fulton, were in the Fulton County school system until Atlanta annexed the respective areas into the city under its Plan of Improvement. In 2005, APS implemented the small- schools model at Carver High School. This model is used when a comprehensive high school is divided into a number of career-specific small schools of around 400 or 500 each. Each school has its own administration, but they share athletics and arts programs. The model worked with profound success, so APS decided to convert all of its high schools into small schools. South Atlanta was one of the next two schools to be transformed. In 2006, the building was renovated, and the campus became home to four small schools. The schools are: *South Atlanta School of Computer Animation and Design *South Atlanta School of Health and Medical Science *South Atlanta School of Law and Justice *South Atlanta School of Leadership and Economic Empowerment Notable alumni * Corey Barlow - former NCAA and NFL player for the Auburn Tigers and Philadelphia Eagles; NCAA football coach for the Savannah State Tigers * Derrick Favors - New Jersey Nets 2010 draft pick * Reginald Vaughn Finley - radio personality the Infidel Guy * Evander Holyfield (born 1962) - world champion heavyweight boxer * Daron Jones - member of the band 112 * David Rocker - former NCAA and NFL player for the Auburn Tigers and Los Angeles Rams‚Ä† * Tracy Rocker - former NCAA and NFL player for the Auburn Tigers and Washington Redskins; former NCAA football coach; NFL coach for the Tennessee Titans‚Ä† * Marvin Scandrick - member of the band 112 * Young Thug - rapper *LaShun Pace - gospel singer ‚Ä† Alumni of either Walter F.

Her research interests include Bayesian modeling of biomedical data, particularly genetic and genomic data. Education and career Sebastiani obtained a first degree in mathematics from the University of Perugia, Italy (1987), an M.Sc. in statistics from University College London (1990), and a Ph.D. in statistics from the Sapienza University of Rome (1992). She came to Boston University in 2003, after previously having been an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Contributions Her most important contribution is a model based on a Bayesian network that integrates more than 60 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other biomarkers to compute the risk for stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia. This model was shown to have high sensitivity and specificity and demonstrated, for the first time, how an accurate risk prediction model of a complex genetic trait that is modulated by several interacting genes can be built using Bayesian networks. A controversial paper regarding the genetics of aging with which she was associated was retracted from the journal Science in 2011 due to flawed data. The corrected version was published in PLOS ONE, and several of the genes found associated with exceptional human longevity were replicated in other studies of centenarians.

Identification  ;South-west Britain A Saint Constantine is revered in Devon and Cornwall. Based purely on similarity of a common name, some have identified him with the monarch Constantine of Dumnonia, despite the latter's condemnation for immoral behaviour by Gildas. If this is correct, he must have mended his ways.Since there were distinct tribes named Dumnonii in the South West and in Scotland it is only highly probable that Gildas writes about the South-western one. He gives his name to the parish church of Milton Abbot in Devon and the villages of Constantine and Constantine Bay in Cornwall, also extinct chapels in Illogan and Dunterton. The saint at Constantine Bay was almost certainly the 'wealthy man' of this name mentioned in the Life of Saint Petroc. He was converted to Christianity by that holy man at nearby Little Petherick after the deer Constantine was hunting took shelter with him. A Constantine \\"King of the Cornishmen\\" also appears in the Life of Saint David as having given up his crown in order to enter this saint's monastery at St David's. ·Ωâ ·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ŒúŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒ≠Œ±œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ£Œ∫œéœÑœâŒΩ. 9 ŒúŒ±ŒêŒøœÖ. ŒúŒïŒìŒëŒ£ Œ£Œ•ŒùŒëŒûŒëŒ°ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒóŒ£. ;Scotland and Ireland The conversion of a Constantine is recorded in the Annals of Ulster in 588 and a Constantine appears in the Breviary of Aberdeen as entering a monastery in Ireland incognito before joining Saint Mungo (alias Kentigern) and becoming a missionary to the Picts. He was martyred in Scotland about 576 and John of Fordun tells how he was buried at Govan (where his shrine can still be seen today). Although revered on the same day as the Cornishman, the date has probably been transferred from one to the other. The Life of Saint Kentigern names a Constantine as the son and successor Riderch Hael, king of Alt Clut, later known as Strathclyde. = Veneration = Constantine in Kerrier: the 15th-century Church, dedicated to Saint Constantine ;South-west Britain The cult of Saint Constantine (of Dumnonia) centred on the two places bearing his name, both of which may have originally supported monastic establishments. However, Dr. Lynette Olson (1989) has challenged Charles Henderson's assertion (Henderson 1937) that there was a monastic establishment at Constantine, Kerrier, Cornwall. The ruined chapel at Constantine Bay also has a nearby holy well (uncovered in 1911). Taking the waters there was said to bring rain during dry weather. The chapel's splendid font is now in the parish church at St Merryn. The name of the village of Constantine is recorded as Sanctus Constantinus in the Domesday Book. However, the monasteries seem to have declined into parish churches, after the Norman Conquest. The present Kerrier building is 15th century and bears no remnants of Constantinist iconography. The saint's day is generally celebrated on 9 March. An annual \\"Feast\\" is held in the village of Constantine, on the Sunday nearest to 9 March. ReferencesSources Doble, G. H. (1962).

Although it has since moderated its stance on the issue, it still advocates that American Jews distance themselves from Israel politically, and does not view Israel as a universal Jewish homeland. The ACJ has also championed women's rights, including the right for women to serve as rabbis, and has supported Reform Jewish congregations and contributed to the publication of new editions of prayer books for religious services predominately in the English language for Jews in English-speaking countries.These include The Union Prayer Book and the new edition of The New Union Haggadah. The Union Prayer Book: Sinai edition revised (Central Conference of American Rabbis 2012) and Berman, Howard and Zeidman, Benjamin, The New Union Haggadah: Revised Edition (Central Conference of American Rabbis 2014)  Background and formation  The rabbis of Reform Judaism had opposed Zionism prior to World War I, supporting freedom, democracy and equal rights for Jews in the countries where they lived.Kolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948, (Temple University Press 1990) p. 30 The influential American Jewish Committee was also anti-Zionist until 1918, when it shifted to a non-Zionist platform until the 1967 Six-Day War. The Central Conference of American Rabbis of the Reform movement declared itself officially neutral on Zionism in 1937. In 1942, a split within the Reform movement occurred due to the passage of a resolution by some rabbis endorsing the raising of a \\"Jewish Army\\" in Palestine to fight alongside the Allies of World War II. The American and British general staffs opposed the placing Jews in segregated armed forces.Kolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948, (Temple University Press 1990) p. 43 The founders of the American Council for Judaism regarded the potential segregation of Jews to be a highly regressive and harmful measure. The ACJ was founded in June 1942 by a group of leading Reform rabbis including six former presidents of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the president of the Hebrew Union College, as well as laymen, who opposed the creation of a religiously segregated Jewish Army to fight alongside the Allies and the new political direction of some in their movement, including, but not limited to, on the issue of Zionism as redefined by the Biltmore Program in May 1942.Kolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948 (Temple University Press 1990) p. 42‚Äì49 The leading rabbis included Louis Wolsey, Morris Lazaron, Abraham Cronbach, David Philipson, and Henry Cohen but their most vocal representative for a time became Elmer Berger, who became the council's Executive Director. The ACJ described itself as anti-nationalist, and followed a universalist interpretation of Jewish history and destiny. According to its statement of principles, the ACJ supported the \\"rehabilitation\\" of Palestine, and did not support political Zionism. It also declared that \\"Jewish nationalism tends to confuse our fellowmen about our place and function in society and diverts our own attention from our historic role to live as a religious community wherever we may dwell.\\" The ACJ's leaders felt that they represented the views of a majority of American Jews, and began a large membership drive. By 1946, it had numerous local chapters throughout the United States and regional offices in Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. During World War II, the council was active in opposing Zionism. In 1944, it protested the formation of the Jewish Brigade by the British Army, which was composed of Palestinian Jews led by British-Jewish officers. In a message to Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, it stated that \\"newspapers report a British Government decision to form a so-called Jewish Brigade under a so-called Jewish flag. We hereby protest against that action and designation. We urge that our military and civil officials be warned against that error and instructed to use the accurate designation of Zionist Brigade and Zionist flag. Americans of the Jewish faith are and always have been in the American armed forces. The flag of Americans of the Jewish faith is the Stars and Stripes.\\"https://www.jta.org/1944/09/24/archive/american-council-for-judaism- protests-formation-of-jewish-brigade-by-britain While protesting the White Paper of 1939, which imposed strict limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine and land purchases in the country, it also opposed \\"Zionist nationalism\\" and urged American Jews to \\"organize in strength, out of deep concern for oppressed Jews everywhere, behind a non-nationalistic program to deal with the total Jewish problem.\\" It declared that \\"Beyond the abrogation of the White Paper lies the need for a basic solution. That solution, we believe, can come only when there is world wide recognition of the rights of Jews to full equality. It can come in Palestine only when the pretensions to Jewish Statehood are abandoned and we seek instead freedom of migration opportunity based on incontestable rights and not on special privilege. The declaration of our Statement of Principles is beyond challenge from any quarter. We look forward to the ultimate establishment of a democratic autonomous government in Palestine, wherein Jews, Moslems and Christians shall be justly represented; every man enjoying equal rights and sharing equal responsibilities; a democratic government in which our fellow Jews shall be free Palestinians whose religion is Judaism even as we are Americans whose religion is Judaism.\\"https://www.jta.org/1944/01/11/archive/american-council-for-judaism- issues-statement-against-british-white-paper Postwar anti-Zionist campaign Following World War II, with the question of Palestine's future being considered, the AJC continued to support a joint Jewish-Arab state rather than a Jewish state in Palestine, and opposed dispossessing the Arabs who were then living in Palestine.Kolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948 (Temple University Press 1990) pp. 136‚Äì38 The presidency of the ACJ was accepted by the well-known philanthropist Lessing J. Rosenwald, who took the lead in urging the creation of a unitary democratic state in Mandatory Palestine in American policy-making circles. Rosenwald testified before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946, urged the creation of a unitary Jewish-Arab state in Palestine, and allowing Jewish immigration to Palestine to continue only upon \\"renunciation of the claim that Jews possess unlimited national right to the land, and that the country shall take the form of a racial or theocratic state,\\" and said that the United States and other UN member states should allow more Jewish immigration to solve the European-Jewish refugee problem.U.S. Asked to Admit Displaced Jews on Immigration Quotas Not Used During the War It later endorsed the Committee of Inquiry's recommendations, including that Palestine be become neither a Jewish or Arab state and the admittance of 100,000 Jewish refugees into Palestine.American Council for Judaism Submits Its Views on Palestine Report to State Department In addition, it opposed the establishment of a Jewish state anywhere else in the world, not just in Palestine. The ACJ's official position was that European Jews should be rehabilitated by restoring their civil, political, and economic security. To demonstrate that American Zionists did not represent the views of American Jewry, the ACJ sent anti-Zionist letters to various government officials. = Terrorism and illegal immigration to Palestine = During the Jewish insurgency in Palestine, a campaign against the British by Jewish underground groups in Palestine (the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi), the AJC opposed what it viewed as Jewish terrorism. Following the King David Hotel bombing, it issued a statement calling for American Jews to \\"repudiate the perpetrators of those outrages and those leaders of Jews, in and out of Palestine, whose incitement is equally responsible.\\" In a statement, Lessing Rosenwald called for the American Jewish community to condition any further assistance to the Yishuv (Palestinian Jewry) on the end of violence.American Council for Judaism Calls on U.S. Jews to Repudiate Palestine Terrorism It also opposed the Haganah's Aliyah Bet program, which attempted to bring Jewish refugees into Palestine illegally past a British blockade. Following a statement by the Vice-President of the Zionist Organization of America that American Jews were prepared to spend millions to finance illegal immigration to Palestine, Rosenwald repudiated him, calling Aliyah Bet a \\"shocking disregard for law and order\\" and stating \\"lawlessness even in the name of mercy cannot be tolerated.\\"‚Äúillegal‚Äù Immigration to Palestine Must Not Be Encouraged. Council for Judaism Says In the final year before the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the Council became very close to San Francisco born rabbi Judah Magnes, humanitarian and founder of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the leading Palestinian-Jewish advocate for a binational state, who was forced to return to the United States. In 1948, the AJC had 14,000 members.New York Times, obituary for Rabbi Elmer Berger \\"A Foe of Zionism as well as Israel\\"Raising of Funds for Israel in U.S. Attacked by Council for JudaismCouncil for Judaism Announces Aid for Jews Leaving Israel = After 1948 = After the State of Israel declared independence in 1948, the ACJ continued its anti-Zionist campaign, leading to the resignation of several prominent Reform rabbis, including its founder, Louis Wolsey, who called on the ACJ to dissolve itself since the Zionist movement had succeeded. In a speech to his congregation, Wolsey said that \\"I believe we should support the present reality of a land of Israel, with all our strength.\\"https://www.jta.org/1948/05/23/archive/rabbi-wolsey-urges- dissolution-of-council-for-judaism-calls-for-support-of-israel The ACJ responded by stating that \\"we shall continue to seek the integration of Jews into American life.

In December 1948, Lessing Rosenwald urged that the US condition friendship with Israel on Israel building an inclusive Israeli nationalism confined to its own borders and inclusive of its Muslim and Christian citizens rather than Jewish nationalism.https://www.jta.org/1948/12/22/archive/lessing-rosenwald-wants-u- s-to-stipulate-conditions-of-friendship-to-israel Murray Polner, a historian of Judaism in the United States, wrote that \\"by 1948, with the establishment of an independent Israel, the council had earned the enmity of the vast majority of American Jewry, who viewed the group as indifferent, if not hostile, to Jews who had lived through the Holocaust and had nowhere to go.\\" The ACJ switched its focus to battling what it viewed as its primary foe‚Äîthe political influence of Zionism upon American Jewry. In addition to supporting a network of religious schools committed to Classical Reform Judaism, the Council fought American-Jewish fundraising for Israel and agitated against the merging of Zionist fund-raising organizations with local Jewish community boards, provided financial aid to Jews emigrating from Israel and to Palestinian refugees, and enjoyed friendly relations with the Eisenhower State Department under John Foster Dulles. The ACJ also vocally supported the efforts of William Fulbright to have the lobbyists for Israel in the United States legally registered as foreign agents. In 1955, the ACJ's head, Elmer Berger, advocated the complete assimilation of Jews into American life by switching the Jewish Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, creating a new menorah to \\"reflect the appreciation of American Jews of the freedom of life in the United States,\\" and to broaden the interpretation of the holiday of Sukkot \\"to be broadened to take on meaning to [all] citizens of an industrial society.\\" = Support = Support for the American Council for Judaism came primarily from Jews of British, Dutch, French and German descent who were historically attached to Classical Reform Judaism, but also from many Jewish socialists who opposed Zionism, and many more of whom who were uncomfortable with the Jewish religion coalesced around William Zukerman and his Jewish Newsletter. Jewish intellectuals who at one time or another passed through the Council included David Riesman, Hans Kohn, Erich Fromm, Hannah Arendt, Will Herberg, Morrie Ryskind, Frank Chodorov, and Murray Rothbard. Among the notable gentile friends of the council were Dorothy Thompson, Norman Thomas, Freda Utley, Arnold J. Toynbee, and Dwight Macdonald. The ACJ was particularly influential in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Dallas.San Francisco Jewish Elite: America's Leding Anti- ZionistsKolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948 (Temple University Press 1990) p. 82-84  Later activities  The ACJ rapidly declined in both political activity and influence following the Six-Day War in 1967, when the American Jewish community was swept up in overwhelming support of Israel, and moderates within the Council forced Elmer Berger to resign the following year for declaring that Israel had been the primary aggressor in the war. The council continued to support progressive Judaism, but its views became less popular with American Jewry, and as a result it shrank. According to The New York Times, it was effectively \\"consigned to irrelevancy.\\" In 2010, its mailing list was only a few thousand.On Religion ‚Äì A Resurgence for American Jews Who Reject Zionism, The New York Times The ACJ has since moderated its views on the state of Israel, but does not view it as a universal Jewish homeland, and advocates equal rights and religious freedom for all people living there.Kolsky, Thomas A., Jews Against Zionism: The American Council for Judaism 1942‚Äì1948 (Temple University Press 1990) p. 93 According to its statement of principles, \\"the State of Israel has significance for the Jewish experience. As a refuge for many Jews who have suffered persecution and oppression in other places, Israel certainly has meaning for us. However, that relationship is a spiritual, historical, and humanitarian one‚Äîit is not a political tie. As American Jews, we share the hope for the security and well being of the State of Israel, living in peace and justice with its neighbors\\". Allan C. Brownfeld, the editor of the ACJ's magazine, who has strongly criticized Israel in the Washington Report on Middle Easts Affairs (WRMEA), said that \\"I think we represent a silent majority. We are Americans by nationality and Jews by religion. And while we wish Israel well, we don‚Äôt view it as our homeland.\\" In the United States, the council seeks \\"to advance the universal principles of a Judaism free of nationalism, and the national, civic, cultural, and social integration into American institutions of Americans of Jewish faith.\\" = Issues magazine = The organization publishes a magazine called Issues, which is published in print and online.

She and Bren walk home, but on their way, they meet a homeless man. They give him something to eat and as a reward for their kindness he gives them his dog, Ooshka. That night, an evil giant named Nasookin comes, seeking the Golden Pine Cone, which is really an earring, belonging to Tekontha (Ooshka, who can talk, tells them this). They hide in the cow tunnel, as Nasookin cannot fit. The next day, Ooshka tells them to give the Golden Pine Cone to the Fish Hawk, who will take it to Tekontha's Valley, but he drops it into the Lake Snake's Mud Swamp, at the far end of the Big Lake. That night, the children go to the Floating Island, which comes out of the water every full moon in the middle of the lake. There lives the beautiful princess, Onamara. She tells them that she is Nasookin's wife, and that her Heart is at the bottom of the lake; the Pearl Folk live there. The children are sucked down into the Wishing Pool on the Floating Island, which brings them to the Pearl Folk. The Pearlies tell them that the Lake Snake still has the pine cone, and, if they slay him, they will give them Onamara's Heart back. Bren and Lucy succeed, and come out of the Big Lake, landing by a slough, where they meet Head Goose. The next day, Head Goose and his friends find a net and use it to carry them and Ooshka to Tekontha'so Valley, but they crash and land in Nasookin's Valley, instead. Nasookin cares for them, and it is revealed he has a crush on Lucy (he nicknamed her \\"Little Squirrel\\"), who thinks that he is not as bad as they had originally assumed.

He cares for them, and gets the Squareheads to give them a ride to Tekontha's Valley, but the sleighs crash at the Ice Witch's castle. They kill her with an axe, and revive a mammoth that was frozen by the Ice Witch. As a reward for saving him, the Mammoth then takes them the rest of the way to Tekontha's Valley, where they return the Golden Pine Cone, and free Ooshka and Nasookin of their crimes. Nasookin takes Bren and Lucy to Onamara, his wife, and they give her her Heart. Bren and Lucy are then safely returned to their parents.

Beginning his career as a prop man, Levee worked his way up to an executive at several different studios, including First National Studios, United Artists Studios, and Paramount Pictures. Levee was one of the original 36 founding members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and served as the third president from 1931-1932.Daily Variety. 26 May 1972. Levee was also one of Hollywood's top agents until his retirement in 1956, working with such stars as Mary Pickford, Joan Crawford, and many more.  Personal life  Levee was one of six children growing up in Chicago. He had four brothers named Louis, George, Eddie and Sidney and a sister named Rose Levee. He was married to Rose (Mimi) Levee and had 2 sons. His oldest son, Michael Levee Jr., served as Vice- President of Radnite-Mattel Productions. His youngest son, John Levee, was a painter who lived in Paris.Daily Variety. 26 May 1972. M. C. Levee's second marriage was to Trudy Levee. He died at the age of 83 from cancer in Palm Springs, California.Daily Variety. 26 May 1972. Career Levee began his career in the film industry by working as a prop man at Fox Film Corporation in 1917, earning $20 a week working on A Tale of Two Cities. Within a year, Levee became the assistant to Abe Carles, the General Superintendent at Fox. Levee left Fox in 1920 in order to become a business man at Robert Brunton Studios with Robert Brunton.Baily, Tom In 1920, Levee organized United Studios, serving as President. While working at United Studios, Levee produced The Isle of Lost Ships (1923), The White Moth (1924), starring Barbara La Marr, and Sweet Daddies (1926). In April 1926, Levee sold United Studios to Paramount Pictures.Daily Variety. 26 May 1972. Levee then joined First National, also known as Warner Bros., in order to build more studio facilities in Burbank. Levee joined Nicholas Schenck as General Studio and Business Manager until 1929, when he left to become Executive Manager at Paramount.Nicholas M. Schenck In 1932, Levee was let go by Sam Jaffe, the General Production Manager, who believed he could cover both jobs.Hall, Barbara. An Oral History with Sam Jaffe. Levee was also the founder and first President of Artists Management Guild. In the 1930s Levee started the M.C. Levee Agency directly after working at United Artists. He ran a one-man business with no staff or organization.Hall, Barbara. An Oral History with Sam Jaffe. He had several important clients, most of which were from Warner Brothers. Most agents do not stick to one studio, it was simply a coincidence that Levee's client base were all working under Warner Brothers. Because he had several large clients, Levee was very well off. Some of Levee's star clients included Mary Pickford, Joan Crawford, Merle Oberson, Bette Davis, Paul Muni, Jeanette MacDonald, Leslie Howard, Greer Garson, Claude Rains, Dick Powell, and Franchot Tone. He was also the agent of creators Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Borzage, and Mervyn LeRoy.Daily Variety. 26 May 1972. Robert Cowan referred to Levee as being a fair and reliable agent.Hall, Barbara. An Oral History with Robert Cowan.  Founding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  In 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was founded in order to improve the media industry without receiving government help. The founders knew they could create a stronger industry by establishing unity between all groups such as writers, directors, and technicians. With such exponential growth in American film, the industry also desperately needed a standardization of equipment and techniques. The founders saw that gathering a group of professionals together could create a positive response to the issues facing the industry and so the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was born.Sands, Pierre Levee was considered one of the fathers of the Academy alongside Douglas Fairbanks, Conrad Nagel, Milton Sills, William C. deMille and Thalberg. Much of the work Levee did for the Academy was for little or no pay, working simply for the good of the Academy. Levee, along with the other 35 founding members had great hope for what the Academy could become for the film industry. They hoped to establish a professional society which might work toward the betterment of the motion picture industry.Sands, Pierre M.C. Levee believed in the objectives of the academy.Hall, Barbara. An Oral History with Robert Cowan. Levee served as treasurer of the Academy for 12 years. He was the founder and President of the Permanent Charities Committee of the film industry, one of the many different organizations created within AMPAS in order to get the view on all sides. In early March 1933, Levee resigned from the Board of Directors of the Academy as a statement that the business was being run into the ground by the studio executives and Wall Street bankers who ran the industry.Hall, Barbara.

History  Freiburg Charterhouse, inner courtyard Charterhouse entrance Charterhouse garden Freiburg Charterhouse was founded in 1345 or 1346 by Johannes Schnewlin (Snewelin, Snewlin), knight, B√ºrgermeister of Freiburg. It was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, in honour of the Grande Chartreuse near Grenoble, and was known as Sankt Johannisberg or St. Johannes des T√§ufers Berg (\\"St John's Mount\\" or the \\"Mount of St. John the Baptist\\"). It was to begin with a very modest establishment of only two monks' cells, increased on the death of the founder in 1347 to five. The original endowment consisted of a piece of land on the Mussbach below Sankt Ottilien; later endowments made it possible to increase the number of cells to twelve. In the early 16th century, the premises were extended by the addition of the refectory and the church, which was constructed in the Late Gothic style with ribbed vaulting and flying buttresses. It featured magnificent stained glass windows to designs by the Swabian painter Hans Baldung Grien. At its height the charterhouse maintained close contact with the University of Freiburg. From 1502 to 1525 the prior was Gregor Reisch, a significant representative of late Scholasticism and a professor at the university. The monastery supported impoverished students and in its turn received donations and novices from the circles round the university. The monastery gradually built up a significant library, particularly through its contact with the university, mainly through the gifts of new entrants to the monastery, and also through legacies from university staff and local clergy. For example, in 1537 the monastery inherited the library (consisting of c. 390 books) and the estate of Otmar Nachtgall. The Thirty Years' War and the ravages of the Swedish army caused a huge disruption. Like many other Carthusians the monks of Freiburg took refuge in Ittingen Charterhouse in Switzerland. Between 1753 and 1756 the buildings were enlarged by the addition, in front of the medieval cell range, of a grand Baroque courtyard of three wings for the accommodation of prelates, plus a guest wing. The prior's attempt to attain the rank of prelate caused an internal revolt, which was put aside in 1781, after the monastery had suffered a serious fire the previous year. Emperor Joseph II commanded the dissolution of all Carthusian monasteries, including Freiburg, within five months of the decree dated 13 February 1782. Its buildings and lands became the property of the state and were sold to the Baron von Baden in 1783. The library was dispersed; only a few incunabula can now be traced, in the library of Freiburg University. After the dissolution the buildings were converted for a country house of the nobility, with the prior's lodging as the main residence. The cloisters with the monks' cells were demolished to make way for a park, but the church was kept. The precious stained glass windows were sold off to various villages. The charitable foundation of Freiburg acquired the property in 1894 and between 1895 and 1897 converted it into a nursing home, with places for 200 almspeople, as an extension to the Hospital of the Holy Ghost (Heilig-Geist-Spital). In 1897 Heinrich Hansjakob, the priest of Sankt Martin, was granted three rooms, by the intervention of the B√ºrgermeister and chairman of the charity committee, Otto Winterer. These rooms have been kept until today as a memorial. In 1969, the nursing home moved to the newly built St. John's HomeFoundation Administration Freiburg: \\"St. John's Home was built in 1969 as a nursing home in a scenic location on the southern slope of Mount Hirzberg in Freiburg.\\" next door. The buildings are presently (2009) mostly empty, as a refurbishment is economically unfeasible, and though the monastery is a protected monument, its future is uncertain. From fall 2014 onwards, the facilities will accommodate a college of the UWC which will be called Robert Bosch College.UWC Robert Bosch College in Freiburg The two tablets to either side of the main entrance, giving the history of the building, set up after its conversion to a nursing home in 1897Left: Founded as Carthusian monastery \\"St. John the Baptist's Mountain\\" in 1346 by Knight J.

Allen & Unwin) Marriage and Morals is a 1929 book by philosopher Bertrand Russell, in which the author questions the Victorian notions of morality regarding sex and marriage. Russell argues that the laws and ideas about sex of his time were a potpourri from various sources and were no longer valid. The subjects range from criticisms of social norms, theories about their origins and tendencies, evolutionary psychology, and instinctual attachment to children (or lack thereof), among others. Notably, the book found marital rape to be common, stating: \\"Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution.\\" Cultural response Marriage and Morals prompted vigorous protests against and denunciations of Russell during his visit to the United States shortly after the book's publication. A decade later, the book, along with his protest of US involvement in WWI and his generally controversial position in public discourse, cost him his professorial appointment at the City College of New York due to a court judgment from a Catholic judge that his opinions made him \\"morally unfit\\" to teach. A public outcry, initiated by the mother of a student who was ineligible for his course in mathematical logic, preceded the ruling. John Dewey and several other intellectuals protested his treatment.

On the topic of \\"negative eugenics\\" (selecting against undesirable qualities), he concludes that most such qualities are too subjectively defined, but that sterilization on the basis of \\"mental deficiency\\" is justifiable. He explores the idea of \\"positive eugenics\\" (selecting for desirable qualities), concluding that such a program would be fraught with moral issues but could produce a very militarily capable nation. On the subject of race, he accepts the common belief that black and aboriginal races are somehow inferior, but says that most racial eugenics is \\"an excuse for chauvinism.\\" Nobel Prize According to Russell, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for Marriage and Morals.

As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 107. Rock Point was named for the rockfish, or striped bass. Today Rock Point is largely a vacation land, but in the early 20th century, Rock Point had a large hotel serving summer vacationers and winter duck hunters, a steamboat wharf and warehouse, and a sizable general store. Fish were caught by a net hauled between two boats at some distance from each other, a method then called \\"Hauling Seine\\". Rock Point also had an oyster shucking and packing plant, which served as a crab steaming and picking plant during the summer months, enabling the shipment of finfish, oysters and crabs in season to restaurants in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. The packing house was owned by three prominent Rock Point families, named after two of them as \\"Hill & Lloyd\\" with the third (silent) partner being one John William Furbush (1882-1963). Today, Furbush Road at Rock Point is named after him. One of his descendants, a grandson, James Carroll Simms (1928‚Äìpresent), is the author of Searching for Identity, Truth and Meaning. General Billy Mitchell, a duck hunter, was a regular patron during these early years. Earlier, Rock Point had become a center of Confederate activity, and was occupied by 300 Union troops throughout the Civil War. Columbus Lancaster, who owned the old general store, was arrested and put in the Old Capitol Prison in Washington on suspicion of collaborating with the Confederates.

Max Lessmann and Leo Lessmann founded the Familienblatt, which was published by the printing and publishing house Buchdruckerei und Verlagsanstalt Max Lessmann first in Hamburg (1898‚Äì1935), and then in Berlin (1935‚Äì1938). The editorial and printing offices were located in ABC-Stra√üe 57 in Hamburg. The Hamburg agglomeration, consisting of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the Danish-Holsteinian cities of Altona and Wandsbek as well as the Hanoverian city of Harburg upon Elbe, had been an important Jewish centre in Europe and in number with 9,000 persons, the biggest in Germany. Only by the first third of the 19th century did Berlin, Prussia's capital, overtake with Jews migrating from the former Polish provinces, which Prussia annexed in the Polish Partitions. Originally directed to readers in Hamburg's metropolitan area the Familienblatt gained more and more readers and spread nationwide in Germany. Israelitisches Familienblatt was prohibited to appear any further after the November Pogroms on 9‚Äì10 November 1938.  History and characteristics  Herbert Strauss characterised Israelitisches Familienblatt \\"as the gem√ºtliche, middle-brow journal written for the average petit- bourgeois family in city and country, the Sunday paper that wants to edify, educate and comfort, the Jewish equivalent to the (antisemitic) Gartenlaube.\\"David Flinker, The Jewish Press that was. Accounts, Evaluations and Memories of Jewish Papers in pre-Holocaust Europe, Tel Aviv-Yafo: World Federation of Jewish Journalists, 1980, p. 323 The Lessmanns kept the Familienblatt out of the controversies on assimilation or Zionism, as fought between the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens (literally: Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith, founded in 1893) with its C.V.-Zeitung (founded in 1922) and the Zionistische Vereinigung f√ºr Deutschland (founded in 1897 and chaired by Pinchas Rosen in 1920-1923) with its J√ºdische Rundschau. The Familienblatt provided broad-scale information and news about life in the Jewish communities, Jewish celebrities, Jews around the world, Judaism, Jewish traditions and history, recipes for kosher cooking. In its cultural insert the Familienblatt presented music, performing and visual art by examples of creative works by Jewish artists. Esriel Carlebach, since 1931 permanently appointed to the Familienblatt, went to the theatre on four to five evenings each week and afterwards composed his reviews. Over time the Familienblatt spread and specific editions appeared for Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and one Reich's edition for the rest of Germany. In 1933 the circulation amounted to 25,000, which meant that about one-fourth of all Jewish families in Germany had subscribed to the Familienblatt. Education took up much space in the Familienblatt. Another editorial emphasis was to strengthen Jewish identity and self-confidence by taking a positive attitude to Jewish matters. The Familienblatt covered the establishment of a Jewish museum in Berlin. In 1905, Albert Wolf (1841‚Äì1907), a jeweller from Dresden, donated his collection of Jewish art, at that time the biggest of its kind in Germany, to the J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin (founded in 1671).It was a community, which accepted among its members all denominations, orthodox, liberal, reform and offered in its different synagogues services of different styles and traditions. The majority of its members were of mainstream alignment, not needing any further terminological specification. In the 20th century, mainstream meant, what is most appropriately termed by the Anglo-Saxon 'conservative', which was no term in Germany of that time. Exclusively orthodox communities, like Berlin's Israelitische Synagogen-Gemeinde Adass Jisroel (founded in 1869), used to distinguish themselves and accepted only orthodox members. The community further enriched the art collection by its own possessions, acquisitions and donations and showed it the first time in 1917 and then with irregular frequency. In November 1929 an association established to found a Jewish museum. On 24 January 1933 J√ºdisches Museum zu Berlin (1933‚Äì1938), run by the community, opened in Oranienburger Stra√üe 31. Later confronted with growing anti-Semitism the Familienblatt worked towards resolving and enlightening as to Jewish matters. Carlebach had unveiled that Joseph Goebbels, who so vehemently defamed Jews and their alleged detrimental influence, had studied with Jewish professors, to whom he owed his scholarship at that time. In the beginning of the 1930s the general atmosphere grew more aggressive. In November 1932 to January 1933 the Familienblatt published a series named 'Sowjetjud√§a' (Soviet Judea) on Jewish life under communist reign, a report written by Carlebach on his journey through the USSR in summer 1932. He came to the conclusion that there were neither the possibilities nor an adequate milieu for a genuine Jewish life. Albert Einstein occasionally brought the Sowjetjud√§a series up for discussions, so that they had a much broader response than usual. Especially adversaries of Hitler, who relied on the USSR and who na√Øvely or willfully downplayed the crimes there, were incited to rimunate or to be angry with Carlebach.Ezriel Carlebach, 'Let Us Remind Ourselves ' ['◊ú◊ê÷∏◊û◊ô◊® ◊ñ◊ô◊ö ◊ì◊¢◊®◊û◊ê÷∏◊†◊¢◊ü' (Lomir zikh dermonen; letter to Chaim Finkelstein September/November 1955; Engl.], Mort Lipsitz (trl.), in: Chaim Finkelstein (◊§÷ø◊ô◊†◊ß◊¢◊ú◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ü, ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù), Yiddish: ◊î◊≤÷∑◊†◊ò: ◊ê ◊¶◊≤÷∑◊ò◊ï◊†◊í ◊ë◊≤÷∑ ◊≤◊ì◊ü, ◊™◊®◊°◊¥◊ó÷æ◊™◊®◊¶◊¥◊ò (Haynt: a Tsaytung bay Yidn, 668-699, {1908-1939}), Tel Aviv-Yafo: ◊§÷ø◊ê◊®◊ú◊ê◊í ◊ô.◊ú. ◊§◊®◊• (Farlag Y.L.

The camouflage name of this group (in German: Arbeitsgemeinschaft j√ºdischer Werkt√§tiger, Hamburg) aimed at disguising the harassing of Carlebach, the avowed Jew, by the Communist Youth Federation in Hamburg. On the night of 3 January 1933 the harassment culminated in an assassination attempt. A gunshot cut through his hat, barely missing him.Ruth Heinsohn (mar. Gerhold; * 1911-2003* ), Interview of December 13, 1999, recorded by Ulf Heinsohn (private oral history project) Carlebach fell over, got concussed and lost consciousness. The police found him later senseless. Israelitisches Familienblatt offered a reward of 2,000 Reichsmarks for the capture of the person who did it. By February he had recovered so far that he could resume his work for the Familienblatt. In January 1933 the Familienblatt still assumed, that the German citizenry in its majority would refuse anti- Semitism. On 30 January 1933 Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler, only since recently German after his seventh attempt to get naturalised finally succeeded on 25 February 1932, chancellor of a coalition government of right-wing forces. On 2 February the Familienblatt declared, that it can hardly stand the idea, that an outspoken anti-Semite is appointed head of government, and expressed its hope, that once in office the anti-Semitic movement of National Socialism will have to come to terms. After the fire in the Reichstag on 27 February Hindenburg could be persuaded that this, and not his appointment of Hitler, caused an emergency situation, and that he thus needed to decree the partial suspension of the Reich's constitution, which he did. After the Prussian Coup the Nazis in the Reich's government, with Hermann G√∂ring holding simultaneously the Reich's and Prussian ministry of the interior, could command executive forces of Prussia's police. Thus the Nazis could start to arrest political opponents. Also Carlebach, the Familienblatt's editor, was arrested. He attributed his arrest to Goebbels, who resented Carlebach for unveiling facts from the times, when Goebbels was still studying.Ezriel Carlebach, 'Let Us Remind Ourselves ' ['◊ú◊ê÷∏◊û◊ô◊® ◊ñ◊ô◊ö ◊ì◊¢◊®◊û◊ê÷∏◊†◊¢◊ü' (Lomir zikh dermonen; letter to Chaim Finkelstein September/November 1955; Engl.], Mort Lipsitz (trl.), in: Chaim Finkelstein (◊§÷ø◊ô◊†◊ß◊¢◊ú◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ü, ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù), Yiddish: ◊î◊≤÷∑◊†◊ò: ◊ê ◊¶◊≤÷∑◊ò◊ï◊†◊í ◊ë◊≤÷∑ ◊≤◊ì◊ü, ◊™◊®◊°◊¥◊ó÷æ◊™◊®◊¶◊¥◊ò (Haynt: a Tsaytung bay Yidn, 668-699, {1908-1939}), Tel Aviv-Yafo: ◊§÷ø◊ê◊®◊ú◊ê◊í ◊ô.◊ú. ◊§◊®◊• (Farlag Y.L.

He was released from custody because no judicial warrant existed. Just out of prison, Carlebach had to go into hiding, for the Nazis meanwhile noticed that he had been released, and started to search for him. He found aides, who provided him with a hideout and forged papers and smuggled him out into Poland. The last genuine election under Nazi rule on 5 March 1933 and was heavily influenced by the party. All elected communists and many elected social democrats and liberals were arrested or hiding, so that the number of Nazi-opponent members of the Reichstag, able to attend the decisive sessions of parliament, was sufficiently reduced in order to create a parliamentary majority for the Nazi party, which it could not gain in the election itself. A law, the Enabling Act of 1933, was passed (only opposed by the few unarrested social democrats who risked attending the session) that empowered the Reich's government to rule without parliamentary legislation. Violent atrocities accompanied the Boycott of Jewish shops on 1 April 1933. On 7 April the Reich's government decreed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which allowed to cleanse the public service from all unwelcome persons, such as liberals, social democrats, communists and persons of Jewish descent. This law became the first official expression of the Nazi definition of Jewishness. The Nazis did not bother about halakhic definitions and the individual creed of the concerned persons. The Nazis declared Jewishness in their view being a matter of inheritance, thus persons were discriminated against as Jews, if they had three or four grandparents, who were registered after their birth as members of a Jewish congregation. This was easy to detect, because mostly religious bodies were busy with the recording of births, marriages and deaths, before official recording became obligatory in 1875. Thus it happened that Gentiles, completely unaware of their Jewish descent, suddenly figured out that the Nazi government regarded them as Jews. The cleansing wasn't restricted to the public service only, but included also the withdrawal of public permissions or approvals for lawyers, physicians and professors. In view of this development the Familienblatt aimed at new objectives. The paper now sought to collect Jewish Germans, converted by the Nazi government into a community of fate, to build up support for the new Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden (Reich's Deputation of German Jews seated in Berlin), the umbrella organisation established on 17 September 1933, which for the first time ever united all the quarrelling Jewish organisations and religious bodies on a nationwide range. The Reichsvertretung helped Jewish Germans to organise self-help, established central welfare organisations, occupational retraining for dismissed officials, preparation for emigration, built up schools and institution of elementary to higher education open for Jewish students and pupils. The Familienblatt promoted these activities, searched for employers still employing Jewish Germans, gave hints and tips to cope with discriminations and restrictions, reported on opportunities to emigrate. Especially emigration was difficult, not only because after the Great Depression many countries restricted immigration, but because in 1931 the German government had introduced the Reichsfluchtsteuer, a tax at prohibitive tariffs against capital outflow. This tax made many German and foreign investors very hesitant to withdraw their capital from Germany. But in 1932 the Reichsfluchtsteuer did not really shy away German and foreign investors from withdrawing their capital from the country any more, so that the German government banned free marketing in foreign exchange in late 1932. From then on every sale and purchase of foreign exchange was subject to government approval. A great release was then the Ha'avarah Agreement initiated by Arlosoroff, which enabled about 50,000 Jewish German investors to withdraw capital at all, if they emigrated to Palestine, even though under the very costly prerogatives of the Reichsfluchtsteuer. The Familienblatt informed its readers about this little loophole in the German entrenchment against capital flight. Until 1935 the Familienblatt could increase its circulation to 36,500. = Move to Berlin in 1935 = In 1935 the Buchdruckerei und Verlagsanstalt Max Lessmann rented from Alfred Japha two stores in his business building in Lindenstra√üe 69 at corner with Jerusalemer Stra√üe in Berlin, not far from today‚Äôs Jewish Museum Berlin in Lindenstra√üe 14. From 1 April on the Familienblatt appeared in Berlin and became the organ of the Reichsvertretung. New inserts were created 'Economy and Law', 'Youth and School', 'German Jew - where to go to!' covering the urgent problems of Jewish Germans under Nazi reign. Also the advertisements, such as 'situations abroad wanted' and 'advertisements for a marriage partner abroad' revealed this situation. After the exclusion of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent from participating in almost all organisations and public events, the Familienblatt tried to provide compensation, as tried the Kulturbund Deutscher Juden (Cultural union of German Jews; est. in 1933The Kulturbund Deutscher Juden was forced to change its name in April 1935 to J√ºdischer Kulturbund (Jewish cultural union). Cf. Ingrid Schmidt, 'Kulturbund Deutscher Juden ‚Äì J√ºdischer Kulturbund Berlin: Ein Namensstreit?', In: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 223-230, here p. 229.), which carried out theatrical performances, concerts, operas and lectures all over Germany, exclusively open for Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent and their eventually Gentile spouses. In September 1935 the Nazis fixed their definition of Jewishness, which until then had gradually emerged by laws dealing with specific cases, in the so-called Nuremberg Laws, which officially declassed Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent to second-class state citizens, as opposed to other Germans being Reich's citizens. Discriminatory laws had gradually impoverished Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent by prohibiting them the performance of many businesses and professions. The circulation of the Familienblatt dropped to 26,500 in 1938 due to emigration and impoverishment. In 1938 the impoverishment accelerated after the November Pogroms on 9 and 10 November. Special taxes were levied, Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent had to sell their property at ridiculous prices often never paid out to the vendors. The last edition of Israelitisches Familienblatt appeared on 3 November. The edition of 10 November could not appear anymore. = J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt (1938‚Äì1943) = By the end of November the J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt (Jewish news gazette) appeared the first time. It was an official gazette under Gestapo control, occupied to a large extent with announcing the ever-growing number of anti-Semitic discriminations imposed by the Reich's government in the aftermath of the November Pogroms. On 16 December Hans Hinkel, State commissioner for Prussian theatre affairs including the Kulturbund Deutscher Juden, in Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry, declared in front of Dr. Werner Levie (1903‚Äì1945* ), a Dutchman and therefore one of the few available members - not hiding or arrested - of the Kulturbund's executive board, that until the end of December all the still existing 76 Jewish publishing companies were to be shut down or sold to new owners. The few publications, which would still be permitted to appear, are to be directed by a publishing department to be formed within the Kulturbund.Werner Levie, 'Arbeitsbericht des J√ºdischen Kulturbundes in Deutschland e.V. vom 1.10.1938-30.6.1939', activity report rendered on 12 July 1939, Berlin, published in: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 321-340, here pp. 323seq. In January 1939, the Kulturbund's publishing department opened in the offices formerly used by the Zionist J√ºdische Rundschau, which had been shut down right after the pogrom, with its former editor, Erich Liepmann, being the manager of publishing department. The Kulturbund managed to save a great deal of the book stocks of the to-be-shut publishing houses from being pulped. Levie reached the concession, that Jewish publishers obliged to liquidate their companies, might export their book stocks on their own until April 1939 ‚Äì only few succeeded, because the market for German books was narrow, since impoverished German emigrants could not buy but eventually flooded the western markets by selling their last belongings ‚Äì if the pertaining purchaser would pay in foreign exchange to the Reichsbank, while the respective publisher would be paid in inconvertible Reichsmarks only. The Kulturbund's publishing department bought the remaining book stocks from their old proprietors at a discount of 80‚Äì95% of the original price and would only pay, once proceeds from sales abroad or to German or Austrian Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent would materialise. Also Austria, annexed by Germany in March 1938, was covered by the Kulturbund's publishing department, and mid-January 1939 Levie arranged the production of an Austrian edition of J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt, because Jewish Austrians and Gentile Austrians of Jewish descent were legally in an even more precarious situation than Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent, because with Austria's annexation they lost their citizenship and turned stateless, since they were even denied the second-class status of state citizens. Commemorative plate for J√ºdische Rundschau on the fa√ßade in Meinekestra√üe #10. From January 1939 on the editorial offices of J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt were located in Meinekestr. 10, Berlin, formerly used by the J√ºdische Rundschau. The new paper was restricted to announce public orders and new restrictions and organisational changes as well as to promote emigration.Werner Levie, 'Arbeitsbericht des J√ºdischen Kulturbundes in Deutschland e.V. vom 1.10.1938-30.6.1939', activity report rendered on 12 July 1939, Berlin, published in: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 321-340, here p. 330. In January 1939 Nova, a company of so-called Aryan owners, bought the Buchdruckerei und Verlagsanstalt Max Lessmann. On 21 March 1939 Alfred Japha, the proprietor, had to sell his house Lindenstra√üe 69 to the Papiergro√ühandlung Ferdinand Flinsch, a paper wholesales company and proprietor of the neighboured house Lindenstra√üe 70. Also Japha counted as Jew according to the Nuremberg Laws.Maren Kr√ºger, 'Das ¬ªIsraelitische Familienblatt¬´ und die Nova-Druckerei', In: Juden in Kreuzberg: Fundst√ºcke, Fragmente, Erinnerungen ‚Ä¶, Berliner Geschichtswerkstatt e.V. (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, pp. 363-370, here p. 365. The Reich's Propaganda Ministry only allowed the Kulturbund to continue to exist, if it would change its statutes to that effect that the minister (Goebbels) may - at any time - interfere in affairs of the executive board, dissolve the Kulturbund and dispose of its assets. The changed statutes came into effect on 4 March 1939. Levie was appointed executive secretary of the reorganised Kulturbund. Thus the ministry ordered that the Kulturbund's publishing department commissioned the company Nova, using Lessmann's former devices, to print the J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt. At the beginning of 1939 being the only organ occupied with matters of interest and information of concern for Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent in Germany and annexed Austria, the circulation of the German edition reached 62,000 and the Austrian edition 14,000. By mid-1939 the circulation dropped mostly due to emigration by 5,000. And the prohibition to publish advertisements of hauliers and shipping companies of so-called Aryan owners in mid-1939, severed the income situation of the Kulturbund's publishing department.Werner Levie, 'Arbeitsbericht des J√ºdischen Kulturbundes in Deutschland e.V. vom 1.10.1938-30.6.1939', activity report rendered on 12 July 1939, Berlin, published in: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 321-340, here p. 330. Nevertheless, a surplus remained, which partly covered losses in the cultural department and a considerable sum was transferred to the Central Office for Jewish Emigration, to pay emigration fees levied from lucky receivers of foreign visas, but who were too poor to pay them. Erich Liepmann, the executive manager of the publishing department emigrated to Palestine in summer 1939.In Palestine Liepmann became the Kulturbund's sales agent for books. The Palestinian Schocken publishing house could buy 90% of the book stock, which its Berlin branch Schocken Verlag had to sell to the Kulturbund earlier. Few other publishers, like Joseph Schlesinger from Vienna, did the same by their foreign subsidiaries in Budapest and Amsterdam. The Kulturbund's executive secretary Levie remigrated to the Netherlands at the end of August 1939. He was first succeeded by Johanna Marcus, who soon also emigrated and then by Willy Pless. In July 1939 the Reich's ministry of the Interior subjected the Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden (Reich's deputation of German Jews, renamed in February 1939 in Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, Reich's association of Jews in Germany) to its influence and commissioned its subordinate Gestapo with the supervision. The Gestapo appointed by the end of 1939 Adolf Eichmann to chair its Judenreferat in Berlin's Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe. By this reorganisation the Reichsvereinigung had become a device to better control and discriminate against German and Austrian Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent. The Nazis counted all Germans and Austrians with three or four grandparents of Jewish community affiliation as Jews according to the Nuremberg Laws and forcibly enrolled them as members of the Reichsvereinigung, regardless if they were Jews according to the Halachah (roughly meaning: Jewish by birth from a Jewess or conversion), apostates, irreligionists or Christians. The members of the Reichsvereinigung's executive board were not elected anymore, but appointed in consent with the Gestapo. The Reichsvereinigung made the Nachrichtenblatt its organ, since all the other 64 papers of Jewish alignment had been forbidden after the November Pogroms. New Synagogue in # 30, photo of April 1948 After Germany started the Second World War by invading Poland, the Nachrichtenblatt's two editions per week were both halved in their number of pages. Due to further emigration and impoverishment of the subscribers the circulation had dropped to 35,000 by August 1940.'Gesamtbericht 1.9.1939-31.8.1940', rendered on 1 September 1940, published in: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 358-370, here p. 366 The offices in Meinekestr. had to be evacuated by 31 August 1941. The publishing department moved to Wilsnacker Stra√üe 3 and the editorial offices of the Nachrichtenblatt to Oranienburger Stra√üe 40/41, only to move again and reunite in Oranienburger Stra√üe 29 in January 1943. On 11 September 1941 the Gestapo ordered the Kulturbund's closure, but excepted its publishing department, which was to be taken over by the Reichsvereinigung.Bernd Braun, 'B√ºcher im Schlussverkauf: Die Verlagsabteilung des J√ºdischen Kulturbunds', In: Geschlossene Vorstellung: Der J√ºdische Kulturbund in Deutschland 1933-1941, Akademie der K√ºnste (ed.), Berlin: Edition Hentrich, 1992, pp. 155-168, here p. 166. On 18 October 1941 systematic deportations from Germany started.Spontaneous deportations ordered by local Nazi leaders took place on 11-12 February 1940, when about 1,200 Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent from Pomerania were deported to occupied Poland and on 22-23 October, when 7,000 from Baden, Palatinate and the Saar to Gurs in the Pyrenees in Vichy France. The government agencies, busy with discriminating and persecuting Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent, learned their lessons from public unease with the open terror in the November Pogroms. After the decision to murder all Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent was taken, the involved government agencies were worried - whether well-founded or not - about the acceptance of murdering Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent. In the Wannsee conference they prepared, among others, huge logistical efforts to transport the deportees over long distances to the East, instead of killing them by mobile squads - as practised in the occupied East -, wherever they would find them. In the East in occupied Poland and Lithuania, where the local population was anyway subject to open terror and public executions. The Holocaust was then carried out, far away from most eyes and ears of the general German and Western European public. The Nachrichtenblatt's chief editor Leo Kreindler died in a Gestapo interrogation in 1942. The Nachrichtenblatt ceased to appear in June 1943, when the Gestapo ordered the Reichsvereinigung's dissolution. The only Jewish organisations, which then continued, were the few hospitals such as the J√ºdisches Krankenhaus Berlin and the Israelitisches Krankenhaus Hamburg, mostly taking care of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent, who were not deported due to a so- called mixed marriage with a so-called Aryan spouse. From the religious point of view, many of these couples were not mixed, because in many cases one spouse had converted to the other's faith.

The Cathedral is located at Kotahena, in the north east of Colombo, on 18,240 sq. ft. of land. It traces its origins to a small structure for worship built during the Dutch occupation.  architecture  Named after and dedicated to the virgin and martyr saint Saint Lucy, the cathedral is considered the oldest and largest parish cathedral in Sri Lanka. The facade rests on massive Ionic columns and is adorned with seven statues. Silhouetted against the sky is the cross on the concrete lantern crowning the dome, the pinnacle of the cathedral. The interior of the cathedral consists of a row of ornate, larger-than-life statues of saints along the side aisles, sculptured and painted in minute detail; many of these statues were installed in 1924 by priest and artist Rev. Fr. J Milliner. Open confessionals of intricately carved dark wood are also placed along the aisles. On the left, in front of the sanctuary, is a unique dark-skinned Madonna called 'Our Lady of Kotahena', which is taken in procession during the annual celebrations. Altars of white marble are located in the transepts of the church with relics enshrined within them. Surmounted on the main altar is a statue of St. Lucy holding up her eyes on the palm of her hand. The stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular baptismal font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300 lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934. The view of the cathedral from the choir loft is a grand one, with the episcopal throne of the Archbishop of Colombo standing out as a majestic highlight in the sanctuary below.  History  By 1779, the sizeable Catholic community in Dutch-administered Colombo had selected the hill at Kotahena to be the centre of worship. While there exist records of the Dutch government granting ten acres of land to these Catholics in 1779, there are no records to attest to the initiation of the small, thatched hut-like chapel that already existed on the land. This small and rustic structure is said to have been built by the Oratorian Fathers in 1760, although rumour suggests the structure as being even older. A larger church of brick and mortar began construction under the guidance of Fr. Nicholas Rodriguez and Fr. Cosmo Antonio in 1782, with the aim of replacing the smaller structure. In 1796, the newly built church provided refuge for many citizens of the city when the invading British encamped across the Kelani river. By 1820, Kotahena had become the headquarters of the Oratorian Fathers. The church on the site naturally became the principal Catholic church of Colombo, and of a newly unified British Ceylon. With the installation of Reverend Vincent Rozairo Dias as the first Vicar Apostolic of Colombo at St. Lucia's on 14 January 1838, the little church was elevated to cathedral status. Sixteen years later in 1836, the church saw its one of its most notable events, with the remains of Fr. Monteiro c‚Äôe Setuvel, one of the first missionaries in Ceylon, being brought in a procession and interred within it. Just a year later, the Most Rev. Vicente do Rosayro, an Oratorian from Goa was formally installed as the first Vicar Apostolic of Ceylon. On 11 February 1846 the ceremony for the consecration of a bishop took place for the first time at St Lucia's, and with the Papal Rescript of 1857, St. Lucia's Church was confirmed to be the Cathedral Church of the Vicariate of Colombo. In September 1863, the Rt. Rev. Hilarion Silani was named Vicar Apostolic of Colombo, with Bishop Christopher Bonjean being the Vicar Apostolic of Jaffna. This began the period known as \\"the golden age\\" of the Catholic church in Ceylon. With the existing structure on the danger of collapse, Bishop Silani called a meeting of the priests and lay leaders of the city to initiate plans for building a new cathedral on 8 September 1872. Plans were drawn up to collect the necessary funds: the Catholics of Colombo, churches outside the city, and even the fisher folk contributed their share to the building fund. Fr. S. Tabarrani was entrusted with the work of designing and supervising the building of the new church. The following year saw the Feast of the Assumption held as a farewell to the old cathedral, with the work of dismantling it beginning in August of the same year. As an interim measure, nearby St. Benedict's College was converted into a public chapel to serve the Catholics of Kotahena. The construction did not go to plan, however, with work having to be halted in 1877 due to a lack of funds. The following years saw more problems, with Bishop Silani dying in Rome in 1878, and Fr. Tabarrani leaving Ceylon in 1880 (and dying just two years later in Rome). Nevertheless, May 1880 saw Fr. Bonifiglio Baldoni take charge of the project, the four planned arches being completed by the end of August. Nearly a year later, \\"at 11.00, the last keystone was driven in place.‚Äù The work on most of the main portion of the cathedral, despite the many problems in funding, had been completed. The church celebrated \\"the Great Day\\", with Bishop Clemente Pagnani (now Vicar Apostolic of Colombo) blessing the nave and the aisles of the new Cathedral and opening it for public worship. The highlight of the day was the first Holy Mass offered for the benefactors of the Cathedral. Construction was far from done, however, and in 1883 the new Vicar Apostolic, Bishop Bonjean, appointed Fr. Tanganelli to carry on the building of the cathedral. Less than a year later, both men had left Ceylon (Bonjean to Rome, and Tanganelli to China), leaving the project in the hands of Fr. Joseph Mary Louise Boisseau. Boisseau, by 1885, had completed work on the Sanctuary vault and the southern vault, with the final one being completed in December of that year. It would not be until 1902, however, that the last of the work would be completed and the scaffolding removed. Pope Leo XIII, in his apostolic brief of 1885 conferred a number of privileges on St. Lucia's Cathedral, one of which was it being declared the Cathedral Church of the 'Vicariate of Colombo‚Äô. Bishop Bonjean returned to the island soon after this, bringing with him an authentic portion of the bones of St. Lucy, which are preserved in the cathedral to this day. 6 January 1887 was a significant date for Catholicism in Ceylon: the Church's hierarchy was formally established, and the first episcopal synod was held in the country. A papal delegate and the bishops of the island were gathered in the Cathedral to witness this singular event in the history of the Church of Ceylon. On 12 December, the vigil for the feast of St. Lucy, the patroness of the newly completed Cathedral, was formally held. With construction still ongoing, September 1889 saw the crypt dedicated to the Sacred Passion of the Lord being declared open for public worship. The first Holy Mass was celebrated on the first Friday of that month. By the end of the construction project, the church had costed a total of Rs. 160,000- an enormous amount of money in the last century, provided by the Ceylonese Catholics of the time.Chevalier Jusey de Silva, Knight of St. Gregory - Dr. K.N.M.D.Fernando Cooray Sunday Times (Sri Lanka) Retrieved 22 December 2014 =Recent history= * From 22 May to 15 July 1950, the world-famous statue of Our Lady of Fatima made a visit to various parishes in the country, including Kotahena. * 1959 marked the 450th anniversary of the first Eucharistic celebration on Sri Lankan soil.

Placidus De Silva began a large- scale restoration project to address many of these issues.

The company was founded by the philosopher Albrecht von M√ºller as a consultancy company in 1993.Financial Times, 2001 The Initial Public Offering In the company's IPO on March 24, 2000, at the peak of the dot com bubble, the shares were issued at CHF 270. On the first trading day the share price peaked at CHF 1050, driven by investor excitement generated by the company's connections to the World Economic Forum and promises that the company would play a central role in transferring the world to knowledge economy through the software tools the company claimed to be developing. The peak share price corresponded to a market valuation of CHF 2.52 billion. Software Tools for Knowledge Economy In addition to consultancy, the company had developed tools for supporting corporate problem solving by allowing its users to graphically visualize their thinking: a kind of an intelligent notepad to assist the user in solving problems. However, the software, called Think Tools Suite, did not have any knowledge representation, problem-solving, or reasoning capability by itself. The company advertising made general claims about their software's ability to strengthen organizations' ability to generate, store, and utilize knowledge, and the tools being the result of a decade-long research program at the Max Planck Institute of Physics into ways to support cognitive processes.Preparing for the Global Knowledge Economy, Think Tools AG product brochure, 2001 Nelson Mandela was cited as a reference client who uses the Think Tools software \\"for policy formulation and policy coordination between the national, provincial and local levels\\".Wall Street Journal Europe, January 29, 2001 The company was profitable prior to the IPO, with a net income of CHF 3.9 million with sales of CHF 10.6 million in 1999, mostly from services to companies with close relations to the World Economic Forum, but these figures were only a very small fraction of the value of the company's stock after the IPO (corresponding to an extremely high price-to-earning ratio), characteristic of dot com bubble companies before share price collapse. In the peak year, 2000, sales were CHF 25.3 million, but the company made a CHF 19.8 million loss. Controversies and the Collapse of the Company The downward slope of the share price resulted from analysts reporting the stock to be seriously overvalued,Don't Think Twice: Think Tools is Overvalued, The Wall Street Journal Europe, October 30, 2000 from the allegations of plagiarism of the works by the biochemistry professor Frederic Vester in its Think Tools Suite product,Computerwoche, March 16, 2001 from the collapse of sales after the IPO, and the company's inability to progress toward implementing the visions that had raised the investors' expectations extremely high. It also turned out that the information about the company and its product had been misleading. For example, most of the reference clients at the time of the IPO did not actually use the Think Tools Suite for anything.Sonntags Zeitung, April 10, 2005 The company's business model was to sell the Think Tools Suite software licence for a one time fee, up to CHF 1 million per licence, and the market of companies willing to buy the software was very quickly exhausted. In 2001 sales were only CHF 3.4 million, and the company made a CHF 14.5 million loss. On November 2, 2001 shares traded at CHF 26. Only after the company's failure became apparent did the investors start questioning whether the Think Tools software actually had the capabilities claimed by von M√ºller.Finanz und Wirtschaft, November 28, 2001 On January 3, 2003 the company's shares traded at CHF 8.20. Sales in 2003 were CHF 1.9 million, with operating expenses of CHF 12.2 million.Think Tools AG Annual Report, 2003 In May 2004 Think Tools agreed to merge with the Swiss IT company redIT AG. As a result, redIT AG became a publicly traded company in the Swiss stock exchange. In October 2004 redIT AG sold the rights to the main remaining Think Tools asset, the Think Tools Suite, to the Parmenides Foundation (also founded by Albrecht von M√ºller).redIT AG press release, October 13, 2004 The sales price was CHF 350,000.redIT AG Annual Report 2004 Parmenides Foundation renamed Think Tools Suite to Parmenides Eidos Suite - Visual Reasoning and Knowledge Representation, and is selling it.

Engelgarten Charterhouse or W√ºrzburg Charterhouse (; ) is a former Carthusian monastery, or charterhouse, in W√ºrzburg in Bavaria, Germany. History The monastery was dedicated on 13 May 1352 by the bishop-elect of W√ºrzburg Albrecht von Hohenlohe. The extensive monastery precinct, with church and outbuildings, gardens and fishponds, through which the K√ºrnach flowed, stretched from the present Berliner Ring as far as the Mainfranken Theater, on both sides of the modern Ludwigstrasse, where the hotel Zum Karth√§user and the street name Kartause still indicate the area's past. During the Thirty Years' War Engelgarten gave refuge in 1631 to the Carthusian community from Gr√ºnau, who had been forced to take flight from the Swedes. Shortly afterwards, however, W√ºrzburg was also taken, and the charterhouse was plundered. The monastery was dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation of Bavaria. The church was given to the Protestants. In 1853 it was demolished to make way for the construction of the former railway station of the Ludwigs-West-Bahn, on the site of the present Mainfranken Theater.

Following a crossover with the Teen Titans in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #16 and the Teen Titans/Legion Special, a new Legion of Super-Heroes series was launched; written by Mark Waid (who had previously rebooted the title following the events of Zero Hour) and penciled by Barry Kitson. This new series recreated the team from the beginning and used the Boy/Lad/Girl/Lass/Kid codenames which the end of the original continuity and the prior reboot continuity had moved away from using. Initial issues of this series reintroduced the characters and provided new and divergent origins for them. Most characters resembled their previous counterparts in costume and powers, with the most notable exceptions including Chameleon Boy, now called simply Chameleon and depicted as an androgynous creature, Star Boy, who in this version of the Legion is black, Colossal Boy, who is now a giant who shrinks to human size, and Phantom Girl, who exists in two universes at once and has conversations with people in her own dimension while talking to Legionnaires at the same time. The future universe of this Legion is an emotionally and mentally repressive society which involves human sexuality and contact being kept at arms' length as well as Orwellian surveillance of minors. The Legion's main goal is social reform as well as protecting people and inspiring them with the legends of superheroes of old, even though the team isn't appreciated by various government authorities. The Legion is worshiped by thousands of young people on various different worlds who worship the group in a cult-like manner, collectively known as the \\"Legionnaires\\". The Legionnaires based on Earth keep a constant vigil outside Legion headquarters. Beginning with issue #16, The Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) was retitled Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes with Supergirl traveling to the future and joining the Legion. With issue #31, Tony Bedard replaced Waid as writer. The title reverted to The Legion of Super-Heroes with issue #37 and Jim Shooter became writer. The series ended with issue #50, in which the script was credited to \\"Justin Thyme\\", a pseudonym previously used by uncredited comic book artists. =Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds= This version of the Legion also appeared in the 2008‚Äì09 Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds limited series, written by Geoff Johns and drawn by George P√©rez.

It is typically found growing in sandy ground at sea level, and on dry hills and flat ground up to 1000 feet elevation. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a pioneer in evolutionary theory, first described and named the plant \\"lanceolata\\" in 1791. Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg, who was delayed in South Africa on the way to Japan, first collected it nearly twenty years earlier, along with approximately 3,000 plants that he later described. It wasn't until 1800 that Thunberg gave the plant the specific epithet \\"nivea\\", meaning 'snowy' in Latin, referring to the color of the foliage. Because of the rules of nomenclature, Lamarck's name had precedence because he was the first to name it. Salvia lanceolata is a much branched shrub growing 3 ft tall and 2‚Äì4 ft wide, with stems that become woody and light tan as they age. The leaves are lanceolate and evergreen, thick textured, and dove-gray with a green undertone. The .5 inch long calyx expands to 1 inch after the flowers are fertilized, turning pink. The 1.5 inch flowers are an unusual dull rosy brownish color. The plant blooms sparsely over a long period, from May through November. When crushed, the leaves give off a light fragrance reminiscent of lemon pepper, and are used in South Africa for cooking, most commonly with fish.

Relegated to freight service in 1971 when passenger rail operations were transferred to Amtrak, the FP45 was donated to the Orange Empire Railway Museum by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 1999. The locomotive underwent an extensive restoration which was completed in late 2018. The completed restoration returned the locomotive to its as delivered external arrangement, including the original Santa Fe passenger paint scheme and being renumbered back to ATSF #108.http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2017/10/17-santa-fe- update Up until December 2012, when the restoration project was started, the locomotive was used in demonstration service at the museum and special excursions.

It has not been demonstrated that all these languages form a clade, characterized by shared innovations, within Sino-Tibetan. Shafer, who coined the term \\"Bodish\\", used it for two different levels in his classification, called \\"section\\" and \\"branch\\" respectively: It is now generally accepted that the languages Shafer placed in the first three subgroups are all descended from Old Tibetan, and should be combined as a Tibetic subgroup, with the East Bodish languages as a sister subgroup. More recent classifications omit Rgyalrongic, which is considered a separate branch of Sino-Tibetan. Bradley (1997) also defined a broad \\"Bodish\\" group, adding the West Himalayish languages, which Shafer treated as a sibling of his Bodish section. The resulting grouping is roughly equivalent to the \\"Tibeto-Kanauri\\" group in other classifications. Within this grouping, Bodish proper is a subgroup with two branches, Tibetic and East Bodish: East Bodish is among the least researched branches of Sino-Tibetan. Languages regarded as members of this family include Bumthang (Michailovsky and Mazaudon 1994; van Driem 1995), Tshangla (Hoshi 1987; Andvik 1999), Dakpa (Lu 1986; Sun et al. 1991), Zhangzhung (Nagano and LaPolla 2001), and maybe Zakhring (Blench & Post 2011). According to Shafer, East Bodish is the most conservative branch of the Bodish languages. As for grammars of the East Bodish languages, there is Das Gupta (1968) and Lu (2002).

It is sometimes nicknamed the \\"Liberty Gateway\\" despite never having been a major disembarkation point.Wolfe, Gerald R. New York, 15 walking tours: an architectural guide to the metropolis. New York, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003 Pier A is the last surviving historic pier in the city. The Pier was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and was designated a New York City landmark in 1977.  History  Pier A was built from 1884 to 1886 to serve as the headquarters of the New York City Board of Dock Commissioners (later known as the Department of Docks); it also served as a home for the Harbor Police. The engineer in charge of construction and design was George Sears Greene Jr. (1837-1922), who had served as the engineer-in- chief of the New York City Board of Docks from July 1875 to 1898. He was the son of the civil engineer and Union general George S. Greene (1801-1899). The building's roof, made of tin, was painted green to resemble the color of oxidized copper. During a renovation by the Battery Park City Authority, this roof was discarded and replaced with copper. The pier was expanded in 1900 and again in 1919 with a clock installed in the pier's tower as a memorial to 116,000 US servicemen who died during World War I. The clock is a ship's clock and was donated by Daniel G. Reid, founder of United States Steel Corporation.Wind ship's clock today, The New York Times (January 25, 1919) The clock was unveiled at noon on January 25, 1919 by Rear Admiral Josiah S. McKean, with speeches made by Mayor John Francis Hylan and Docks Commissioner George Murray Hulbert. It is said to be the first World War I memorial erected in the United States.Canon, Laura. \\"A Survey of New York City World War I Monuments\\" The New York City Fire Department used the pier from 1960 to 1992 as a fireboat station. In 1991, the American Merchant Mariners' Memorial was installed on a rebuilt stone breakwater just south of Pier A, connected to it by a dock. Designed by the sculptor Marisol Escobar, the memorial depicts four merchant seamen with their sinking vessel after it had been attacked by a U-boat during World War II. One of the seamen is in the water, and is covered by the sea with each high tide.American Merchant Mariners‚Äô Memorial, New York City Department of Parks & Recreation From 1992 onward, the pier was vacant and fell into disrepair.

Fair Oaks Avenue in Pasadena, California. It was built in the late 1880s as part of the Doty Block in the Old Pasadena district. According to sources at the Pasadena Museum of History, it originally was a showroom for a stage coach or carriage company. In later years it was a freight depot for the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railroad, which became part of the Pacific Electric Railway, and which is indicated by the faded \\"Pasadena and Los Angeles\\" sign on the South wall. In the early 1900s the building was converted to the Hotel Mikado and served the Japanese American community. In the 1940s it was purchased by Percy Carter and his family, and became Pasadena's first black-owned hotel. The name was changed to \\"The Hotel Carver,\\" after George Washington Carver. It was directly across the street from the Hotel Green. The Green catered to prominent white clientele, while the Carver served African American clientele. It was similar to the Dunbar Hotel in Los Angeles. The Blue Room was the dining room on the second floor and the basement held the nightclub called at one time The Onyx Club and later The Club Cobra where many famous, but unconfirmed musicians were reported to have played. In the 1950s, as part of a widening of Fair Oaks Avenue, the Victorian bay windows and turret on the southeast corner were removed from the building and similar structures were removed from other buildings to the north. In its later years, The Hotel Carver was operated by Percy Carter's sons, Percy Jr., Robert, and Littleton. In 1970 the hotel was sold to an owner who changed the building into art studios on the upper floors and the Pasadena Repertory Theatre under artist director Duane Waddell in a large space on the ground floor. In 1973, the Pasadena Repertory Theatre won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Director, Gill Dennis, and Best Screenplay, David Storey, for their production of In Celebration. Later productions included the world premiere of Academy Award nominated (Coal Miner's Daughter) screenwriter Tom Rickman's play Balaam starring Academy Award nominee Elizabeth Hartman (A Patch of Blue), Peter Brandon {Altered States, Another World, Dallas, The Waltons), Howard Whalen, and was the theatrical debut of Ed Harris (The Right Stuff, Jackson Pollock). The Pasadena Repertory Theatre also hosted the west coast premiere of Tennessee Williams' Kingdom of Earth, which was the retitled Broadway play The Seven Descents of Myrtle. It was directed by Elizabeth Hartman's husband, Gill Dennis and starred Ed Harris, Marie Peckinpah (n√©e Selland), and Duane Waddell. The resident acting teacher for the Pasadena Repertory Theatre was Florence MacMichael (Woman Obsessed, Gunsmoke, Twilight Zone, Mr. Ed, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Bonanza). During the years from 1970 until the building was sold in 1985, The Hotel Carver, as it was still called by its residents, held the studios of well over 100 artists, writers, musicians, directors, dancers, tapestry weavers, and other artists.Keller, L., Four man show at Carver Hotel, Pasadena Star News, July 13, 1979 Tenants during parts of that time included notables such as the Latino soul band El Chicano, performance artist Paul McCarthy, Howard the Duck comic book creator Steve Gerber, the writer-director Gill Dennis, who later wrote the Oscar- winning (best actress Reese Witherspoon) biopic of Johnny Cash, Walk the Line, the painter-muralist Betty Dore, the painter and long-time preparator of the Norton Simon Museum James Mayner, the director-writer-cinematographer J. Robert Wagoner (Disco Godfather, Black Fantasy), the prominent jazz bass player Herbie Lewis, artist-weavers Margo Farrin and Gail Stephenson, artists Jack McIntosh, Hap Tivey, Paul Waszink, Ron Benom, Milan Tomovich, and dancers Helga deKansky, Pat Turnbull, Collie Valadez, and many other artists. From the 1970s through the late 1980s a controversial mural adorned the north facade of The Hotel Carver. It was a simple quotation, painted in tall, dark green letters on a cool gray background. It said, \\"My people are the people of the dessert,\\" said T.E. Lawrence, picking up his fork. It was partially destroyed in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, and later painted over after the building was repaired. It had been painted by Paul Waszink, and was the subject of much speculation thereafter. In the early 1980s The Hotel Carver changed owners twice. Then in mid-April, 1985, all tenants entering the building encountered 30-day eviction notices nailed into every entrance door. The remaining tenants immediately organized a final art exhibit titled \\"The End of the Hotel Carver,\\" that filled the ballroom, the old Blue Room, and most of the vacant spaces throughout the building. It included works by over 40 artists who had worked in the building over the years. By June, 1985 The Hotel Carver was empty. The building was later remodeled and earthquake retrofitted. The interior was gutted of its redwood framing to install an elevator and more modern steel framework. The massive ornate wooden staircase with turned wood balustrade was removed. The original lath and plaster was replaced with plaster board. The steel fire escapes on three sides of the building were all removed. Eleven years later, as part of a large art festival in Old Pasadena sponsored by Newtown Pasadena, a group of artists from the Carver came together for a one-evening reunion art show on the sidewalk in front of the building called \\"A Brief Re-birth of The Hotel Carver.\\"Burry, Jennifer ‚ÄúOpening new windows onto Old Pasadena: Artists reclaim trendy enclave.

Roussillon (Rosilio) was bestowed on Sancho in 1209, when Cerdagne was also restored to him. is, as its Latin title indicates, a book (liber, in fact a chartulary) registering the fiefs (feudi) within the counties of Cerdagne (Ceritania), Roussillon and Conflent, and the feudal obligations of the count and his vassals. It is preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Arag√≥ (Cancelleria Reial, reg. no. 4) and consists of 272 charters in 379 folios with 32 colourful miniatures on a golden background. It was probably originally copied from a part of the Liber feudorum maior (LFM), which is several decades older. It contains all the documents pertaining to Cerdagne and Roussillon found in the LFM and in exactly the same order, as well as six documents more. Most of the charters in it cover the years 1172-6. The text of the Liber probably dates to between 1200 and 1209, though Lawrence McCrank has dated it later, to 1237-41.Lawrence J. McCrank (1993), \\"A Medieval 'Information Age': Documentation and Archives in the Crown of Aragon\\", American Archivist 56:2. In the latter year Peter II of Aragon, who held the counties of Cerdagne and Roussillon, bestowed them on his uncle Sancho, who had been dispossess of them in 1185 by his brother, Peter's father, Alfonso II, who was king during the period when most of the charters were made. The oldest charter in the collection dates from the reign of Lothair I. It may represent the first and only completed part of a larger project of regional libri feudorum made to accompany the LFM, which itself was left uncompleted. Illustrations The 32 miniatures are, with the exception of the one on the first folio, from the hand of a single artist. There is one for each document in the chartulary and they are consistent in size, with a maximum height of 11.5 cm and maximum width of 9.5 cm. They are all alike in content, depicting the count either receiving his vassals' hands in his own or negotiating with them from his throne. The scene is always set in an interior marked by large arches and columns. Despite this, the miniatures have not been the object of any serious artistic or iconographic study.Mar√≠a Eugenia Ibarburu Asurmendi (1999), De capitibus litterarum et aliis figuris: Recull d'estudis miniatura medieval (Barcelona: Edicions Universitat Barcelona, ), 358. The first folio, by a different artist from the rest, depicts Isarn and Dalmau, lords of Castellfollit, rendering homage to Wifred II of Cerdagne. It is of a higher calibre than the other miniatures and is painted in the Byzantinist style that was becoming dominant in Catalonia around 1200.Ibarburu Asurmendi, 359. This artist has been identified with the painter of the altar fronts at Sant Sadurn√≠ de Rotgers and Avi√°. He also illustrated a manuscript of Augustine of Hippo's De civitate Dei.MS. 20 of the Archivo Capitular de Tortosa. It is more artistic than the Liber, but the Byzantine influence is still acutely felt. The lesser artist of the remaining 31 miniatures was probably a native Catalan accustomed to painting altars.

The second largest of the twelve undergraduate houses, Quincy House was named after Josiah Quincy III (1772‚Äì1864), president of Harvard from 1829 to 1845. Quincy House's official counterpart at Yale University is Branford College. House colors are red, gold, and black, and the House's seal in those colors is emblazoned on a wall of the dining hall wing facing the House's main courtyard. In 2005, Quincy House adopted the penguin as its official mascot.Oreilly, Kara M \\"Mascot-less, But Not For Long\\" Harvard Crimson. April 21, 2005.Lonyai, Anna \\"Photo: Penguin Parade\\" Harvard Crimson. May 25, 2005. Its residents, nicknamed \\"penguins\\" after the mascot, live in the house during their sophomore through senior years. History Officially opened in September 1959, Quincy House symbolized the \\"new\\" Harvard. As a part of the Edward Harkness bequest, it was the first House to be built after construction of the original seven river Houses. Three buildings currently house Quincy House students: Old Quincy, New Quincy, and 20 DeWolfe Street. The older of the sections of Quincy House, \\"Old Quincy\\", underwent extensive renovations during academic year 2012-13 and opened in the fall of 2013 as Stone Hall. It had originally been named for early Harvard president Increase Mather and was part of Harvard's Leverett House until 1960. Constructed in 1929-30 during Abbott Lawrence Lowell's university presidency, its neo-Georgian exterior has been retained, but its finely detailed suites, high ceilings, carved moldings, and fireplaces have given way to modern suites, corridors that invite interaction between suite residents, and sunlit common rooms. Until the construction of New Quincy in the late 1950s necessitated their removal, the now open east side was enclosed by a one-story range of squash courts. Designed by the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson, and Abbott, New Quincy is a modern eight-story high-rise with views of its more traditional neighbors. It consists of a two-story commons wing along Mt. Auburn Street, a nine-story main residence unit with split level suites having splendid views, and the raised, glass-walled House Library, nicknamed \\"the Qube\\", the placement of which adds a second interior court to the series of courtyards and gardens that are a distinctive part of the House.Quincy House: An introduction to its architecture. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959. The 20 DeWolfe Street residence hall is a brick structure with a double mansard roof of lead-coated copper. The 10 and 20 DeWolfe Street residences are overflow housing that have at various times housed freshmen, students from Leverett House, Dunster House, and Kirkland House. House Traditions At the beginning of each academic year, Quincy House hosts a field day in which second, third, and fourth year students compete against each other in athletic contests. The \\"Quincy Assassins\\" is an annual event in which students target a fellow house member with a Nerf gun. Another recently implemented tradition of the House is its annual lip-sync battle. On the day each spring when freshmen learn of their House affiliations for their upperclass years, Quincy House students storm the yard with their house flag, led by someone wearing a penguin suit. The 2011 theme for Quincy was \\"Quinception\\", inspired by the film Inception. There had been a tradition in the 1970s for a regular dinner in one of the small rooms off the main dining hall (which were often used for meals organized by campus or house organizations), where cannabis was smoked by the attendees; by the end, or even the middle, of dinner a haze would usually settle over the room. This continued at least into spring term 1980 but was phased out not long after that. The regular event was called \\"The Space Table\\" and fliers advertising it included the Star Trek slogan \\"To Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\" House Life The current Quincy House faculty deans are Eric Beerbohm and Leslie Duhaylongsod.https://quincy.harvard.edu/administrative-staff Beerbohm is a Professor of Government in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Duhaylongsod is a professor in the Secondary and Higher Education department at Salem State University. House events are coordinated by the Quincy House Committee, or HoCo. The committee operates separately from the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC) to organize student events and manage funding. Like other house organizations, HoCo is funded by the UC. Each Harvard House possesses unique characteristics and Quincy is no different. The Quincy Grille is a student-run diner that is popular among students of all Harvard dormitories. The grill is open seven days a week and serves a standard board of grill fare such as mozzarella sticks, fries, and chicken fingers but additionally serves signature items such as the Lee and Nerden burgers (named after House Master Lee Gehrke and Building Manager Dick Nerden, respectively) as well as Too Much Swag (a combination of cheese-covered popcorn chicken and curly fries) and Quinception (a quesadilla with chicken and mozzarella sticks). Quincy House's library is called \\"the Qube\\", a reference to its shape and glass walls. The Qube has one of the best comic book collections at Harvard. The House's dining hall is unrestricted except to first-year students and on Thursday night for Community Dinner. Large glass walls surround the dining hall, allowing natural light to enter and affording views of the House courtyards, Mt. Auburn Street, and even sunsets sometimes. The dining hall's interior is also unique, as it has a \\"ski lodge\\" feel and a large abstract mural occupies its entire back wall. Quincy's Junior Common Room, decorated with mid-century modern period furniture, is a popular location for doing homework and having informal and formal gatherings, but only Quincy students have swipe access. The House lobby features pool and ping-pong tables that promote House socializing. The House also contains a pottery studio, dance studio, and gym. Quincy House is sometimes called \\"The People's House\\" because it seems to belong to everyone at Harvard; its central location and few restrictions enable undergraduates from all Houses and student organizations to meet there freely. Pronunciation As Quincy House was named after Josiah Quincy III, the correct pronunciation is . It is widely mispronounced, however, as .

History The Common English Bible is sponsored by an alliance of several denominational publishers in the United States operating under an umbrella group called the Christian Resources Development Corporation (CRDC), incorporated in 2009 and based in Nashville, Tennessee.Trademarkia page The publishing houses participating are Chalice Press (Disciples of Christ), Westminster John Knox Press (Presbyterian Church U.S.A.), Church Publishing Inc (Episcopal Church), Pilgrim Press (United Church of Christ), and Abingdon Press (United Methodist Church). According to the CEB's preface, the motivation for producing a new translation was that \\"it has proved difficult to combine concern for accuracy and accessibility in one translation that the typical reader or worshipper would be able to understand.\\" One hundred twenty scholars from twenty-four different denominations worked on the translation.Translator information on CEB site Textual basis The CEB New Testament was translated from the Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament (27th Edition), a standard edition of the Greek used in many versions of the Christian scriptures. For the Old Testament various editions of the traditional Masoretic text were used: the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (4th edition), Biblia Hebraica Quinta (5th edition), and in some cases the Hebrew University Bible Project. However, as with many modern Bibles, the Old Testament was occasionally emended using readings from the Dead Sea Scrolls, the ancient Septuagint Greek translation, and other sources. For the apocrypha, the currently unfinished G√∂ttingen Septuagint was used as the basis. Books that were not available in the G√∂ttingen project were translated from the latest revision of Rahlfs' Septuagint (2006). Surviving Hebrew manuscripts of some Septuagint books were consulted as well. Translation methodology The CEB uses a balance of dynamic equivalence and formal equivalence translation principles. Ease of comprehension was measured using the standard Dale-Chall Readability Formula so a seventh grade reading level could be attained. The translators' goal is to produce a rendering of the Bible at the same reading level as the USA Today newspaper.CEB bookstore staff training tutorial Portions of scripture were assigned to each of the 120 translators. Each produced a draft translation which was then reviewed and modified by a co-translator. The resulting text was then sent to one of 77 \\"reading groups\\", teams of five to ten non-specialists that read it out loud and noted awkward translations. The rendering, along with suggestions for improvement, was then sent to a readability editor to check style and grammar, followed by a complete review by the editor for that section of the Bible. The text was then put before the entire editorial board which resolved any lingering controversies and ensured consistency throughout the entire Bible translation.Info on translation methodology The translators include Tremper Longman, Luke Timothy Johnson, David L. Petersen, Joel B. Green, Brent A. Strawn, Beverly Gaventa, Gail O'Day, Cynthia Westfall, and Emerson B. Powery. Protestant, Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Reform Judaism were represented among the translators and reviewers .http://www.commonenglishbible.com/files/uploads/CEBStudyBibleSampler.pdf =Features= The CEB attempts to substitute more natural wording for traditional biblical terminology. For instance, where most Bibles use the term \\"son of man\\" in the Old Testament (e.g. Ezekiel 2:1) the CEB translates it as \\"Human one\\". In the New Testament where Jesus uses the Greek version of this term of himself‚Äîprobably with messianic overtones‚Äîthe CEB renders it \\"the Human One\\".CEB blog \\"From Son of Man to Human One\\" Another example of common English is substituting \\"harass\\" for \\"persecute\\": \\"If the world harassed me, it will harass you too\\" (John 15:20). Contractions are used more frequently in the Common English Bible than in more Formal Equivalent translations. For example, the New Revised Standard Version renders Luke 12:7 as, \\"But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.\\" The CEB has, \\"Even the hairs on your head are all counted. Don't be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.\\" The maps of biblical lands in the Common English Bible are produced by the National Geographic Society.Sample National Geographic maps The full Common English Bible, both Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha, can be accessed for passage lookup online at the CEB website.CEB Passage look up page Circulation The CEB was finished in 2011 and a marketing campaign was begun in late 2009.

The mine was worked to a depth of 575 feet, with several levels 100 feet apart below the 250 foot level. The first levels, at 250 and 350 feet, extended nearly 1,000 feet in length. The 450 foot level did not extend as far.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907 The formation in which the ore occurred is a fine, even-grained granodiorite. At the surface were several veins at distances varying from three to twenty feet. At greater depth, these branching fissures united to form an irregular vein, with a tendency to send off shoots into the surrounding rock, chiefly into the foot-wall side. The foot-wall streak often contained high grade ore. The auriferous iron sulfide was finely disseminated through the quartz.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907 In 1881 with the arrival of the California Southern Railroad nearby at Pinacate a five-stamp mill was constructed to crush the ore from the mine and developed the underground quartz deposit. In the 1890s an eastern corporation, the Good Hope Mining Company, took control and brought in a twenty stamp mill which was powered by coal from nearby Terra Cotta, California.Bill McBurney, Good Hope Mine, The Valley News, Friday, March 27th, 2009. Issue 13, Volume 13.Report of the State Mineralogist, California State Mining Bureau, State Office, 1894, pp. 220-223 Ore from the Good Hope was one requiring fine crushing and very careful amalgamation and concentration. After the installation of the twenty stamp mill, water supplies were insufficient for efficient operation of the mill. The four concentrating machines were in operation, with very poor separation of sulfides. Under such conditions, it would have been better to run a ten stamp mill, which would have allowed greater extraction and increased net profits. As a result of the diminished efficiency, the tailings carried sufficient value to make them profitable to cyanide operators who subsequently worked them. Had there been less desire to maximize the volume of ore running through the mill and greater attention to efficiency, there would have remained little profit for the cyanide man.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907 The mine produced about $2 million in gold before 1896. The mine operated steadily until about 1903.Clark, Gold districts of California, p.175 An attempt was made in the 1930s by metallurgist James M.

Early life  Brisbane was born in Fitzroy, Melbourne, the son of an ironmonger. The family moved to WA the year after his birth, and he attended Fremantle Boys' School and Perth Technical School.  Career  In 1909 he started a draughtsman apprenticeship in Perth with Wunderlich Ltd, a building materials company. His career was interrupted by World War I: in 1915 he enlisted in the AIF. He served in the Middle East in Australian and British units, was Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the Egyptian Order of the Nile. After a promotion to temporary major in February 1919 he returned home where his army appointment terminated on 14 October. Business life In 1927 entrepreneur Reginald Long bought a controlling interest in Westralian Potteries Ltd and recruited Brisbane as general manager in 1929. Despite Brisbane not being a major shareholder, the company's name was changed to H. L. Brisbane & Co. Ltd. Despite the Great Depression, he expanded the company until it challenged Brisbane's former employer Wunderlich as market leader. In 1938 Wunderlich merged its Western Australian operation with H. L. Brisbane on condition Brisbane wouldn't expand his business interstate. H. L. Brisbane & Wunderlich Ltd became the state's largest clay tile producer and enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the industry. Over the next 28 years Brisbane built the firm into a large and diversified manufacturing enterprise: it made stainless steel products, clay sewer-pipes, porcelain, refractory bricks, aluminium fabrication, building cladding and plastics. It sold to Australian Fine China in the 1990s.

He was knighted in 1961, and appointed by the Brand state government to its Industries Advisory Committee, a body composed of leading businessmen. He also worked for the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children. Wembley Ware In 1946 Brisbane and Wunderlich created a range of decorative crockery called Wembley Ware. The range was Brisbane's brainchild. The first product was the Cruet Set. To avoid paying a high sales tax the piece was fashioned into a salt and pepper shaker and a mustard dish. It was extremely popular, and hundreds more pieces of functional fancy tableware and other items followed, such as ashtrays in unusual shapes. The Old Mill In 1957 there was a confrontation between the state government and conservationists when it was discovered the ruins of Shenton's Mill lay in the path of the proposed Narrows Bridge and Freeway. After a win for the conservationists, the State Government ordered a change in the Freeway Route, and Brisbane funded the reconstruction and upgrading of the Mill as a folk museum. Personal life Brisbane married Frances Leonard Hoyle on 21 September 1921 at St Mary's Anglican Church, West Perth: they had two daughters. He died in Bethesda Hospital, Claremont and was cremated. His estate was worth $178,442.

He continued with his career of photography and produced a significant body of work. In 1885, he photographed the famous Pink and White Terraces and, after the destruction of the area by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886, photographed the area again creating a definitive record of this natural disaster. The Pink and White Terrace locations were finally mapped in 2017 after a lost 1859 survey was recovered and analysed. He produced many of what were to become the classic iconic images of early New Zealand, including geyser studies in the thermal region and studies of New Zealand bush and waterfalls. Valentine died in 1890, just six years after his arrival in New Zealand. His work is represented in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Auckland Art Gallery.

Green's functions and scattering matrix are the fundamental objects in quantum field theory which determine basic physically measurable quantities. Formal expressions for Green's functions and S-matrix in any physical quantum field theory contain divergent integrals (i.e., integrals which take infinite values) and therefore formally these expressions are meaningless. The renormalization procedure is a specific procedure to make these divergent integrals finite and obtain (and predict) finite values for physically measurable quantities. The Bogoliubov‚ÄìParasyuk theorem states that for a wide class of quantum field theories, called renormalizable field theories, these divergent integrals can be made finite in a regular way using a finite (and small) set of certain elementary subtractions of divergencies. The theorem guarantees that computed within the perturbation expansion Green's functions and matrix elements of the scattering matrix are finite for any renormalized quantum field theory. The theorem specifies a concrete procedure (the Bogoliubov‚ÄìParasyuk R-operation) for subtraction of divergences in any order of perturbation theory, establishes correctness of this procedure, and guarantees the uniqueness of the obtained results. The theorem was proved by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Ostap Parasyuk in 1955. The proof of the Bogoliubov‚ÄìParasyuk theorem was simplified later.  See also  * Renormalization * O. I.

Martin (June 25, 1900 ‚Äì August 15, 1979) was an American old-time musician, singer, and guitarist, who made many recordings during the 1920s and 1930s and was closely associated with renowned fiddle player Doc Roberts, for whom he played rhythm guitar. In turn, Roberts frequently played mandolin on Martin's recordings; Roberts' son James also sang duets with Martin under the name Doc Roberts Trio. Biography Martin was born in Winchester, Kentucky, into a music-loving family. His mother, who was a piano teacher, also played the guitar, and his father played the fiddle.Russell 2007, p. 90. Because of low finances, Martin decided to drop out of medical school and try his hand at a career in music. In the early 1920s, he played in several dance bands, and in the meantime, he worked in a cinema as a background musician for silent movies. With the advent of talking pictures, he had to find another job. Martin met fiddler Doc Roberts at a fiddler's convention in Winchester. They began performing together, and soon, Martin and Roberts went to Richmond, Indiana for a recording session.Russell 2007, p. 91. Martin made his recording debut with Doc Roberts on May 14, 1928, for Gennett Records. They recorded two songs at their first session together, \\"Second Love\\", and \\"Lost Love\\"'.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 588. Their recordings sold well, and Martin soon became one of the best-selling old-time artists of Gennett Records. At their second session in August 1928, Doc Roberts' son James was added as a singer. In 1931, the band switched to ARC Records. In addition to being a recording star, Martin performed on radio stations in Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio.Russell 2007, p. 92. In 1935, he hired an aspiring young banjo player, David Akeman. Martin gave Akeman the moniker \\"String Beans\\" during an onstage presentation when he could not remember the banjo player's name. The name eventually became \\"Stringbean\\".Wolfe 2001, p. 249. Martin's pseudonym on the Champion label was Jesse Coats. Martin retired from music in the 1940s and went to work at a steel plant in Ohio. In the 1950s, he moved to Irvine, Kentucky, where he had purchased land just outside the town. He resumed his musical career on a small-scale basis in the 1960s with his new band, the Cumberland Rangers. In the early 1970s, they recorded an album for Rounder Records, Dr. Ginger Blue. Martin died at home in 1979 from a heart attack.
