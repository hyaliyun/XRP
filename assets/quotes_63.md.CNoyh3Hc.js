Originally known as \\"Sharbrough's Landing\\" to river boat pilots the community was established by the Sharbrough family in 1877. Located on the Sunflower River, early delta cotton planters used the river to ship their cotton to Vicksburg and New Orleans. Geography Location of Holly Bluff, Mississippi Holly Bluff is located at (32.82139, -90.70889). The Sharbrough family Following the Civil War, two brothers, Franklin Wilson and John Walter Sharbrough came to the area now known as Holly Bluff. Their father, Franklin Wilson Sharbrough, a cotton planter from Smith County, Mississippi had lost everything during the war. The Sharbrough brothers first lived in the area around Green Hill Plantation on Silver Creek. They worked together buying and clearing land for farming. The older brother, Franklin Wilson Sharbrough purchased the land on the north side of the Sunflower River and established Valley Home Plantation. John Walter purchased the land on the southern or Sharkey County side of the Sunflower River and called his place Patmos Plantation. Together, they built the first roads, bridges, levees and cotton gin in this part of the Mississippi Delta. Later, they built the first church then called \\"Sharbrough's Chapel\\" which still operates today as Holly Bluff United Methodist Church. In 1906, the railroad requested the Sharbrough family change the name of Sharbrough's Landing to Sharbroughville. However, the family thought Sharbroughville would be too hard to spell and settled on the name Holly Bluff. Holly Bluff post office was established July 31, 1906, with Marcia M. Hackler as first postmaster.Gallagher, John S. and Patera, Alan H. (1996) Mississippi Post Offices, p. 197. Lake Grove, Oregon: The Depot, The Yazoo Delta Railroad The Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad had been incorporated in 1882 by the Illinois Central to penetrate the fertile Yazoo Delta. In 1905 a line of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, affectionately called the \\"Yellow Dog,\\" was laid from Silver City, Mississippi to Holly Bluff. The principal purpose of the Holly Bluff line was to gain access to the cotton grown by the Sharbrough family in this rich section of the Mississippi Delta. After the building of the railroad, most of the cotton from Holly Bluff was sold in Memphis rather than New Orleans. Archaeological site Located just outside Holly Bluff on Mississippi Highway 16 is the Lake George Mound Site. The mounds were built during the prehistoric Temple Mound period. The largest mound rises 55 feet and is the fourth tallest native American mound in the United States. The mounds were built for religious ceremonies and not habitation. The site is important in that it is on the southern margin of the Mississippian cultural advance down the Mississippi River and on the northern edge of that of the Cole's Creek and Plaquemine cultures of the South. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Holly Bluff has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Holly Bluff, Mississippi Education Residents are within the Yazoo County School District.

Jane, an orphan, is employed as a governess, and becomes romantically involved with her employer, the mysterious and moody Edward Rochester. Jane is noted for her dependability, strong mindedness and individualism. She is prepared to face near-starvation, rather than enter a bigamous marriage, and she remains true to her Christian faith throughout. The author deliberately created Jane as an unglamorous figure, in contrast to conventional heroines of fiction, and possibly part-autobiographical. Jane has retained a strong influence on literature, especially romantic and feminist writing. Plot arc Jane Eyre is an orphan living unhappily with her relations, the Reeds. Mrs. Reed only keeps Jane on because it was the dying wish of her late husband, Jane's maternal uncle. The Reeds openly resent, neglect, and abuse Jane, and justify it by saying she is a charity case and she should be grateful for any care. In addition, Jane is not a pretty child, nor is her demeanor sweet. She keenly feels the injustice of her treatment. After a fight with her older cousin, John, Jane is locked into the Red Room, which she believes is haunted, and goes into a swoon. This is something of a catalyst: Mrs. Reed decides to get Jane out of the house, for the benefit of her own children. Mrs. Reed sends Jane to Lowood Hall, a school for other charity girls where they will learn to be governesses. At Lowood, Jane is desperate to be loved and accepted, but learns from her friend Helen Burns to be more patient and seek solace in prayer and her own conscience. Helen Burns dies, and Jane weathers a typhoid epidemic at the school. Over time, Jane gets a good education and becomes a particular friend of Miss Maria Temple, the school's principal. After a few years of teaching at Lowood (without once returning to the Reeds' house, Gateshead) Jane decides it is time to go out into the world. She seeks work as a governess, and is employed to Thornfield Hall, to care for a solitary orphan, Adele. Jane goes to Thornfield, learns about the distant master, a Mr. Rochester, and starts to teach his ward, although she finds Adele to be a less-than-stellar student. One morning when Jane is out for a walk, she meets a mysterious man when his horse slips and he falls ‚Äì this is Mr. Rochester. Jane and Rochester are immediately interested in each other. She is fascinated by his rough, craggy, dark appearance as well as his abrupt, almost rude manners, which she thinks are easier to handle than polite flattery. He is very interested in figuring out how Jane is herself, comparing her to an elf or sprite and admiring her unusual strength and stubbornness. Rochester quickly learns that he can rely on Jane in a crisis ‚Äì one evening, Jane finds Rochester asleep in his bed with all the curtains and bedclothes on fire, and she puts out the flames and rescues him. Jane and Rochester find that they can have interesting and in-depth conversations, and both fall steadily in love with each other. However, Rochester soon invited some of his acquaintances to Thornfield, including the beautiful Blanche Ingram. Rochester lets Blanche flirt with him constantly in front of Jane to make her jealous and encourages rumors that he's engaged to Blanche. During the week-long house party, a man named Richard Mason shows up, and Rochester seems afraid of him. At night, Mason sneaks up to the third floor and somehow gets stabbed and bitten. Rochester asks Jane to tend Richard Mason's wounds secretly while he fetches the doctor. The next morning before the guests find out what happened, Rochester sneaks Mason out of the house. Before Jane can discover more about the mysterious situation, she gets a message that her Aunt Reed is very sick and is asking for her. Jane, forgiving Mrs. Reed for mistreating her when she was a child, goes back to take care of her dying aunt. When Jane returns to Thornfield, Blanche and her friends are gone, and Jane realizes how attached she is to Mr. Rochester. Although he lets her think for a little longer that he's going to marry Blanche, eventually Rochester stops teasing Jane and proposes to her. She blissfully accepts. On the day of Jane's wedding, during the church ceremony, two men show up claiming that Rochester is already married. Rochester admits that he is married to another woman, but tries to justify his attempt to marry Jane by taking them all to see his \\"wife.\\" Mrs. Rochester is Bertha Mason, the \\"madwoman in the attic\\" who tried to burn Rochester to death in his bed, stabbed and bit her own brother (Richard Mason), and who's been doing other creepy things at night. Rochester was tricked into marrying Bertha fifteen years ago in Jamaica by his father, who wanted him to marry for money and didn't tell him that insanity ran in Bertha's family. Rochester tried to live with Bertha as husband and wife, but she was too horrible, so he locked her up at Thornfield with a nursemaid, Grace Poole. Meanwhile, he traveled around Europe for ten years trying to forget Bertha and keeping various mistresses. Ad√®le Varens (Jane's student) is the daughter of one of these mistresses, though she may not be Rochester's daughter. Eventually he got tired of this lifestyle, came home to England, and fell in love with Jane. After explaining all this, Rochester claims that he was not really married because his relationship with Bertha wasn't a real marriage. He wants Jane to go and live with him in France, where they can pretend to be a married couple and act like husband and wife. Jane refuses to be his next mistress and runs away before she's tempted to agree. Jane travels in a direction away from Thornfield. Having no money, she almost starves to death before being taken in by the Rivers family, who live at Moor House near a town called Morton. The Rivers siblings ‚Äì Diana, Mary, and St. John (pronounced \\"Sinjin\\") ‚Äì are about Jane's age and well-educated, but somewhat poor. They take whole-heartedly to Jane, who has taken the pseudonym \\"Jane Elliott\\" so that Mr. Rochester can't find her. Jane wants to earn her keep, so St. John arranges for her to become the teacher in a village girls' school. When Jane's uncle Mr. Eyre dies and leaves his fortune to his niece, it turns out that the Rivers siblings are actually Jane's cousins, and she shares her inheritance with the other three. St. John, who is a devoted clergyman, wants to be more than Jane's cousin. He admires Jane's work ethic and asks her to marry him, learn Hindustani, and go with him to India on a long-term missionary trip. Jane is tempted because she thinks she'd be good at it and that it would be an interesting life, and she would be doing God's work. Still, she refuses because she knows she doesn't love St. John, and he does not love her back. He just believes Jane would make a good missionary's wife because of her skills. To top it off, St. John actually loves a different girl named Rosamond Oliver, but he won't let himself admit it because he thinks she would make an unsuitable wife for a missionary. Jane offers to go to India with him, but just as his cousin and co-worker, not as his wife. St. John won't give up and keeps pressuring Jane to marry him. Just as she's about to give in, she imagines Mr. Rochester's voice calling her name. The next morning, Jane leaves Moor House and goes back to Thornfield to find out what's going on with Mr. Rochester. She finds out that Mr. Rochester searched for her everywhere, and, when he couldn't find her, sent everyone else away from the house and shut himself up alone. After this, Bertha set the house on fire one night and burned it to the ground. Rochester rescued all the servants and tried to save Bertha, too, but she committed suicide and he was injured. Now Rochester has lost an eye and a hand and is blind in the remaining eye. Jane goes to Mr. Rochester and offers to take care of him as his nurse or housekeeper. He asks her to marry him and they have a quiet wedding, and after two years of marriage Rochester gradually gets his sight back ‚Äì enough to see their firstborn son. And Adopted Adele Varens. Physical appearance Jane Eyre is described as plain, with an elfin look. Jane describes herself as, \\"poor, obscure, plain and little.\\" Mr. Rochester once compliments Jane's \\"hazel eyes and hazel hair\\", but she informs the reader that Mr. Rochester was mistaken, as her eyes are not hazel; they are in fact green. It has been said that \\"Charlotte Bront√´ may have created the character of Jane Eyre as a means of coming to terms with elements of her own life.\\" By all accounts, Bront√´'s \\"homelife was difficult.\\" Jane's school, Lowood, is said to be based on the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, where two of Bront√´'s sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, died. Bront√´ declared, \\"I will show you a heroine as plain and as small as myself,\\" in regards to creating Jane Eyre. When she was twenty, Bront√´ wrote to Robert Southey for his thoughts on writing. \\"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be\\", he said. When Jane Eyre was published about ten years later, it was purportedly written by Jane, and called Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, with Currer Bell (Bront√´) merely as editor. And yet, Bront√´ still published as Currer Bell, a man. Historical and cultural context The Victorian Era in which Charlotte Bront√´ wrote her novel, Jane Eyre, provides the cultural framework in which the narrative was developed. The complex role of the woman in Victorian society is highlighted by Bronte's exploration of the appropriate conventions of gender relations in tandem with economic class, marriage, and social status. The woman as a dependent object of a man's economic and social capacity, very much defines the marriage contract as an institution of reproduction and morality. This image of Victorian England is challenged by Bronte's representation of Eyre's relationship with Rochester, as one that is not motivated by calculated obligation to achieve a desirable social status but rather an autonomous choice made by a woman to marry for love. Jane Eyre has been described by historian David Hackett Fischer as evocative of a cultural and geographic milieu of the North Midlands of England that in the mid-17th century had produced the Religious Society of Friends, a Protestant religious sect. Many members of this sect immigrated to North America and settled the Delaware Valley in the late 17th and early 18th century. This geographical area had for many centuries contained a significant population of Scandinavian-descended people who were oppressed by and resisted the Norman Conquest based in French Catholicism (the Gothic feature in Jane Eyre, represented by Edward Rochester) and had remained distinct from the Anglo-Saxon culture that produced the Puritan sect (the evangelical Calvinist feature in Jane Eyre, variants of which are represented by Brocklehurst and St. John).Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, pp. 445‚Äì446.

He was a member of the Christian Social Party, and by profession a historian. Life Mayr was born in Adlwang in Upper Austria, the son of a farmer. He studied history and geography at the University of Vienna and earned a doctorate in 1890. From 1897 through 1920 he served as director of the Tyrol State Archives (Tiroler Landesarchiv). In 1900 he became a Professor of Modern History at the University of Innsbruck. Mayr's political career began under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when from 1907 to 1911 he was a member of the Imperial Council (Reichsrat) legislature and from 1908 to 1914 of the Tyrolean Landtag assembly. With the breakup of the Empire at the end of World War I, Mayr was in 1919/20 a delegate for the Christian Social Party to the National Assembly drafting the new Constitution of Austria. State Chancellor (Staatskanzler) Karl Renner appointed him a state secretary in his grand coalition government on 17 October 1919. After Renner's cabinet finally collapsed, Mayr on 7 July 1920 succeeded him as acting \\"director of the state chancellery\\", as part of an interim government of his Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Labor Party (SDAP). Renner himself remained State Secretary for Foreign Affairs until the Social Democrats left the Austrian government after their disappointing outcome in the Austrian legislative election of October 17, to remain in opposition until the end of World War II. From 10 November 1920, with the Constitution's coming into force, the cabinet formed the Austrian Federal Government, with Mayr as Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). On 20 November 1920, the newly established National Council parliament elected Mayr Chancellor of a Christian Social minority government. He also remained Foreign Minister of the country, until the cabinet resigned on 1 June 1921, in response to a referendum that was called in Styria proposing that the state leave Austria and join Germany contrary to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Mayr was succeeded as chancellor by non- partisan Johann Schober, backed by the Christian-Socials and the Greater German People's Party. He died about a year later in Waldneukirchen. Writing *W.

It was written by one of the season's co-executive producers, Jack Burditt and it was directed by Dennie Gordon. It aired on March 8, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars who appeared in this episode were Dan Bakkedahl, Katrina Bowden, Henry Boyle, Anna Chlumsky, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Chris Hoch, Alice Kremelberg, Nathan Lane, Boris McGiver, John F Mooney, Brian Murray, Maulik Pancholy, Lonny Ross, Molly Shannon, Jason Sudeikis and Kristen Sudeikis. The episode features the appearance of Jack Donaghy's (played by Alec Baldwin) brother, Eddie Donaghy (Nathan Lane), who visits Jack claiming that their father (Brian Murray) is dead. Jack also tells Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) that she has to fire ten percent of her staff. Liz struggles with this task until she meets Floyd's (Jason Sudeikis) girlfriend, Liz Lemler (Anna Chlumsky), who works in the accounting department at TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series for which Liz is the head writer. Plot Jack's down-and-out brother, Eddie, pays him a visit claiming that their father is dead. Jack and Eddie, after feuding, later bond and they even decide to invite their sisters (Molly Shannon and Siobhan Fallon Hogan) and brother- in-law (Boris McGiver) to 30 Rock for an impromptu family reunion. As his family are about to watch a taping of TGS, Jack's supposedly dead father visits Jack in his office, claiming that Eddie is dead. This eventually leads to an argument on the TGS stage and Liz getting beaten up by one of Jack's sisters, Katherine Catherine. Meanwhile, Liz has been told by Jack that she has to fire ten percent of her staff. While the staff try their best to keep their jobs, Liz struggles with making a decision of whom to fire. Liz's problem is solved when Floyd, for whom Liz has romantic feelings, tells her that his girlfriend works in accounting at TGS. After Liz fires Floyd's girlfriend, she goes on a rampage around 30 Rock firing people, including her producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), who disagrees with her decision to fire Floyd's girlfriend for her own personal gain. Jack later tells her that he hired all the fired people back, but he is transferring Floyd's girlfriend to General Electric headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has been told by his lawyer that he should join a religion. He asks advice of people including Liz and Jack, going as far as attending church with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). When Eddie explains Irish Catholicism to Tracy, emphasizing the seeming free ride aspect of confession, he decides that this is the religion he was looking for and joins. He changes his mind after learning about the constant crushing guilt from Jack. Production Jason Sudeikis, Molly Shannon and Siobhan Fallon Hogan, who played Floyd, Katherine Catherine and Patrica in this episode, have all appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live, a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Kristen Sudeikis, the sister of Jason Sudeikis, appeared in this episode as an \\"advanced hip-hop groove\\" gym class instructor. Kristen Sudeikis is a professional choreographer. Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank Rossitano in 30 Rock, is known for his trademark trucker hats which he wears in and out of the Frank character. The hats normally have short words or phrases glued onto them. Friedlander has stated that he makes the hats himself. He has also said that \\"some are in-jokes, and some are just flat out jokes.\\" The idea came from Friedlander's stand-up persona in which his hats are all printed with \\"world champion\\" in different languages in different appearances. In this episode, Frank wears an \\"extra-flashy 'Liz Rocks' hat\\" to try and persuade Liz not to fire him. This episode is the third episode written by Jack Burditt after \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\" and \\"The Baby Show\\". Also, this is the first episode directed by Dennie Gordon. Reception In the U.S., this episode was viewed by 5.2 million viewers and received a rating of 2.5/6 in the key adults 18‚Äì49 demographic according to the Nielsen ratings system. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and the 6 refers to 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast.

In the 1980s and 1990s it was a manufacturer of a line of UNIX-based workstations called \\"\\". Their flavor of System V was called ; it was the first port of System V performed in Germany. They also developed a networking protocol that was based on the Newcastle Connection (\\"UNIXes of the World Unite!\\") and dubbed MUNIX/net, at the time competing with Sun Microsystems' NFS. In addition to UNIX computers, PCS also manufactured industrial terminals. In 1985, PCS founded a US daughter company named Cadmus Computer Systems to distribute the workstations in the US. Eventually, PCS was bought out by Mannesmann-Kienzle, which in turn was bought out by Ken Olsen to become part of DEC, Digital Equipment Corporation. The main driver for the buyouts was a client/server ERP product developed by a dynamic young team at Mannesmann Kienzle Software, competing with SAP R/3. Ken Olson had planned to diversify the corporation, but was ousted by shareholders who did not share his vision of no longer relying on the more and more commoditized computer systems sale and rather jump on the ERP bandwagon early on. One of the reasons for naming DECs last line of CPUs (AlphaAXP) was that they were intended to be sold as the Alpha and the Omega (codename for the ERP system). As a result, Digital-Kienzle, including its PCS subsidiary, entered into a staff buy-out of the company, in part sponsored by some of the German states. The timing of this decision pulled the financial bottom out of the whole setup in terms of the ERP system that was just getting a decent foothold in the market. As a result, there is not much left to be said or heard about said ERP system. In the late 1980s, whenever Mannesmann-Kienzle's representatives were speaking at conferences prior to SAP's presenters, SAP during Q&A; usually had to state that they were planning to be in their development of R/3 where the \\"Omega\\"-team already had arrived at. One of the more prominent figures of the former PCS might be J√ºrgen Gulbins, who authored several books on Unix and related tools, as well as Jordan Hubbard, who spent several years at PCS (in the X11 group) before departing for Ireland, where he co-founded the FreeBSD project.

He was born in Ireland to Brigit Ann Clarke (n√©e Conway) and Thomas Kevin Clarke, and died in Vancouver, British Columbia of a brain tumor. From 1964 until his death in 2003 Clarke spent at least six months of each year on extended backcountry trips, usually into the Coast Mountains of British Columbia using the technique of dropping food caches from small planes along an intended route, then traveling that route for weeks at a time. His routes regularly led him along the high ridges and glaciated icefields of the west coast, and allowed him to make hundreds of first ascents of the many mountains along the way. Many of these trips exceeded 30 days in length, and were often done solo, simply because nobody could afford the time to accompany him. Biography Born in Ireland, Clarke moved to Canada with his parents at age 11, attending the Monastery School in Mission, British Columbia. Some time in around 1964 Clarke began his forays into the Coast Mountains, and over the course of the next 39 years made an amazing 600 first ascents. In 1994, during a multi-week traverse of the Kitlope region of the Coast Mountains, Randy Stoltmann, a good friend of Clarke's, was killed in an avalanche while attempting a summit. This was a turning point for Clarke. Stoltmann, already a noted conservationist and volunteer, had left a hole in the mountain community that Clarke stepped in to fill. He began his wilderness education efforts in memory of him. In 1995, Clarke was the subject of a documentary called \\"Child of the Wind\\" by Canadian director and producer Bill Noble which won the Best film on Climbing at the 1995 Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1996, Clarke and Lisa Baile founded the Wilderness Education Program (WEP). In 1997, Clarke, Chief Bill Williams (hereditary chief of the Squamish First Nation), and artist photographer Nancy Bleck founded the Uts'am Witness Project, providing an opportunity for city folk to reconnect with nature and to take part in a Coast Salish First Nations witness ceremony. In 1998, because of his work and his knowledge of the Squamish First Nation Territory, Clarke was given the honor of being adopted into the nation, and was given the Coast Salish name \\"Xwexws√©lkn\\" which means \\"mountain goat\\" (a reference to his shock of unruly, wooly white hair). In July 2002, he became one of the few mountaineers in Canada to be inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada. He was also an honorary member of the Alpine Club of Canada and the British Columbia Mountaineering Club. On January 23, 2003, Clarke died of a brain tumor, with his family at his side. He leaves wife Annette Clarke (n√©e Lehnacker) and son Nicholas 'Skookum', as well as his parents Brigid and Kevin, his sister Cathaleen and his brother Kevin. In 2012, Harbour Publishing released the book John Clarke Explorer of the Coast Mountains written by Lisa Baile. In October 2013 a book about the Uts'am Witness Project which Clarke co-founded was published by Figure 1 Publishing. Picturing Transformation Nexw-√°yantsut features the photographic artwork of Nancy Bleck and was written Katherine Dodds with Bleck and Chief Bill Williams.

BCR is one of the two genes in the BCR-ABL complex, which is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Function  Although the BCR-ABL fusion protein has been extensively studied, the function of the normal BCR gene product is not clear. The protein has serine/threonine kinase activity and is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases including RhoA.  Clinical significance  A reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 22 and 9 produces the Philadelphia chromosome, which is often found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The chromosome 22 breakpoint for this translocation is located within the BCR gene. The translocation produces a fusion protein that is encoded by sequence from both BCR and ABL, the gene at the chromosome 9 breakpoint.  Structure  The BCR-ABL oncoprotein oligomerisation domain found at the N-terminus of BCR is essential for the oncogenicity of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. The BCR-ABL oncoprotein oligomerisation domain consists of a short N-terminal helix (alpha-1), a flexible loop and a long C-terminal helix (alpha-2). Together these form an N-shaped structure, with the loop allowing the two helices to assume a parallel orientation. The monomeric domains associate into a dimer through the formation of an antiparallel coiled coil between the alpha-2 helices and domain swapping of two alpha-1 helices, where one alpha-1 helix swings back and packs against the alpha-2 helix from the second monomer.

Akumetsu was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion from 2002 to 2006. Plot The setting for the story is a near-future Japan where politicians and businessmen pamper and lavish themselves amidst growing public unrest, while excessive corruption and speculation lead the country to a massive economic downfall, increasing the public deficit to an enormous seven hundred trillion yen and triggering an economic recession. When her father's company goes bankrupt, Shiina finds out and resolves to sell herself into prostitution by attending high-class parties through an escort agency, in order to help pay off her family's debt. It is during the first and only such party she attends, where the guests were mainly VIPs and high-profile officials of the Ministry of Finance, and what was set to become an orgy, is suddenly interrupted by a young man wearing an Oni mask, who after giving a speech on how savage and corrupted the upper class of Japan has become, shoots the attendants in order to state his point and then proceeds to brutally slaughter the most prominent guest using a fire axe. Recognized by a frantic Shiina as Shou, the man simply waves the statement off as a misunderstanding, then grabs the mauled body of his victim and walks calmy to the front lobby, where he is gunned down by police and, before dying, has his head blown off by a device implanted into his own mask. Thus, the act introduces a long, exceptionally violent campaign of murders performed by such masked individuals, targeting those who are deemed as responsible for the massive economic crisis and, as such, labeled as evil by the masked men, who all goes by the common alias Akumetsu (literally destroyer of evil).

He was born in Saint-Michel, Quebec, and graduated from Universit√© Laval with a bachelor's degree in 1960 and a master's in economics two years later. He received a law degree in 1969 and was called to the Quebec Bar in June 1970. He was editor of Garnier, the student newspaper at Coll√®ge des J√©suites de Qu√©bec (now known as St. Charles Garnier College) from 1956 to 1958, as was an executive member of Escholiers griffonneurs, an association of student newspapers, in 1957 and 1958. He participated in campus politics and served as prime minister of the Universit√© Laval's model parliament Political activism He taught at Universit√© Laval and C√©gep Limoilou. As an early supporter of the Quebec independence movement he became the vice-president of the pro-sovereignty group Rassemblement pour l'Ind√©pendance Nationale in the Quebec City area in 1962. Provincial politics He was one of the founding members of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1968. He ran for the National Assembly of Quebec in 1973 in the constituency of Charlevoix, but lost. He was elected in the constituency of L√©vis in 1976 and was re-elected in 1981, 1985, 1989 and 1994. Under Ren√© L√©vesque, he was Agriculture Minister. His most notable accomplishment as Cabinet Member is the passage of a law on agricultural zoning in 1978. After L√©vesque resigned as party leader in 1985, Garon ran for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois leadership in 1985 but finished third with 16% of the vote, defeated by Pierre-Marc Johnson (59%). As a Member of the Official Opposition, Garon vice-chaired, then chaired a number of parliamentary committees, including the one on Economy and Labor. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois won the 1994 election and Premier Jacques Parizeau appointed Garon as Education Minister. The resignation of Parizeau as Premier corresponds to a decline of Garon's influence in provincial politics. Garon, who belonged to the more radical wing of the PQ, was considered a close ally of Parizeau. Premier Lucien Bouchard, who succeeded Parizeau and is widely viewed as a moderate concerning constitutional issues, did not appoint Garon to his Cabinet. Nonetheless, Garon chaired the Parliamentary Committee on Culture. In 2013, Garon said he is convinced that like Ren√© L√©vesque, Pierre Karl P√©ladeau will be able to rally the necessary sovereigntist forces to make Qu√©bec a country. Garon was one of 12 sovereigntist personalities who signed a letter of support for the candidacy for the businessman for the riding of Saint- J√©r√¥me. He confessed to having doubts that Pauline Marois would be the one who would succeed in unifying the partisans of an independent Qu√©bec. According to him, this unity is an essential condition to obtain a majority support from Qu√©b√©cois to the Oui side during a referendum. City politics Garon did not run for re-election to the National Assembly in 1998. Instead, he became leader of the municipal political party √âquipe Jean Garon/Parti des citoyennes et des citoyens and was elected mayor of L√©vis, Quebec. He was re-elected with a majority at the City Council in 2001 (defeating Christian Jobin),Les municipales, Radio-Canada, November 2001 in the aftermath of the province-wide municipal merger imposed by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government. In 2004, four City Councillors (Danielle Roy-Marinelli, Guy Dumoulin, Philippe Laberge, Anne Ladouceur) resigned from Garon's party and founded L√©vis Force 10, √âquipe Roy- Marinelli. While running for re-election in 2005, Garon declared that opposition in city politics is a nuisance. The controversial remark undermined his campaign.Jean Garon d√©fait √† L√©vis, Isabelle Porter, Le Devoir, November 7, 2005 He lost the election, finishing second (with 28% of the vote) behind L√©vis Force 10 candidate Danielle Roy-Marinelli (42%).Changement de garde √† L√©vis, Radio-Canada, November 7, 2005 His party won four seats out of fifteen on the City Council, becoming the Official Opposition.R√©sultats officiels de l'√©lection municipale √† L√©vis, Ville de L√©vis, November 6, 2005 City Councillor Isabelle Demers succeeded Garon as party leader.

History A station opened at New York Avenue (now Guy R. Brewer Boulevard) on June 24, 1890, when the local Atlantic Avenue rapid transit trains were extended from Woodhaven Junction through Jamaica to Rockaway Junction. The station was closed in 1905, but in response to complaints about the reopening of Jamaica station on Sutphin Boulevard (primarily because the downtown core of Jamaica was centered on Union Hall Street, the site of \\"Old Jamaica\\"), the LIRR opened a new one a block away at Union Hall Street in 1913, when the tracks through Jamaica were grade- separated. Union Hall Street station was built near the site of the \\"Old Jamaica station,\\" originally at ground level and eventually elevated between 1929 and 1931. The construction of the newer Jamaica station led to commercial development around Sutphin Boulevard, and as a result, the new station became Jamaica's primary LIRR station. Eventually, the Union Hall Street station's patronage dropped, since it was only half a mile from the station at Sutphin Boulevard. Union Hall Street closed on May 20, 1977, although in recent years a decorative wall mimicking a station house was placed over the bridge where the former Union Hall Street station was located. Twelve years after the station closed, the Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer subway station opened two blocks west of the former Union Hall Street station; the subway station was intended to replace the former 160th Street elevated station a block north on Jamaica Avenue.

The plot focuses on a series of random murders in Los Angeles, in which the only common link between the perpetrators is a mysterious batch of LSD that they had all taken years prior. Over the years, the film attracted a cult following, and was released on special edition DVD by Synapse Entertainment in 2003. It has been shown at many film festivals since. Plot During a party, Frannie Scott (Richard Crystal) croons a Sinatra song and playfully tries to kiss his friend's date, causing the friend to pull Frannie's hair, which unexpectedly comes off. The bald Frannie then has a psychotic break, brutally murders several party guests, and chases Jerry Zipkin (Zalman King) into the nearby road, where Frannie is hit and killed by a passing truck. Jerry is wrongly accused of the murders and goes on the lam, trying to gather evidence to prove his innocence, helped by his friends Alicia Sweeney (Deborah Winters) and surgeon David Blume (Robert Walden). After learning about a similar sudden mass murder by a bald police officer, Jerry discovers that ten years prior, a group of college students had taken a new form of LSD called \\"Blue Sunshine,\\" provided by dealer Ed Flemming (Mark Goddard), and are now suddenly losing their hair and becoming homicidal maniacs many years after their trips are over. Flemming, now a respected local politician running for Congress, lies and tells Jerry he never heard of Blue Sunshine. When Jerry visits Flemming's estranged wife, Wendy, he finds she is also bald and about to murder two children she is babysitting. Jerry saves the children by pushing the knife-wielding Wendy off her apartment balcony, but ends up wrongly accused of her murder as well. Jerry schemes to prove that Blue Sunshine is causing homicidal psychosis by finding a past user of the drug who is still living and can be tested for chromosome damage caused by the drug. Armed with a paraldehyde dart gun, Jerry goes to a Flemming rally at a shopping mall, having learned that Flemming's campaign manager/ bodyguard Wayne Mulligan (Ray Young) was a heavy Blue Sunshine user. Before Jerry's arrival, the now-bald Wayne goes on a rampage through the mall discotheque, beating and terrorizing its patrons including a police detective and Alicia, and causing crowds to flee the mall in panic. Jerry tracks Wayne to an empty department store and paralyzes him with the dart gun. An on-screen epilogue states that Wayne was tested, found to have \\"extensive chromosomic aberrations\\", and confined to a sanitarium, and that 255 doses of Blue Sunshine are still unaccounted for. CastProduction Critical reception  AllMovie gave the film a mildly favorable review, calling it \\"too uneven to please a general audience\\" but \\"offers enough moments of interest for fans of horror films and offbeat cult items.\\" Fawn Krisenthia of Cult Reviews wrote: > The movie gets a thumbs-up since quirky (Jeff) Lieberman directs.

Bouillaud was an early advocate of the localization of cerebral functions (especially of speech). He received his medical doctorate in 1823 and later was a professor at the Charit√© in Paris. Puerto Rican independence leader, surgeon and L√©gion d'honneur laureate, Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances, was one of his prominent students.Ojeda Reyes, F√©lix, El Desterrado de Par√≠s, pp. 20, 29‚Äì30 In 1862 Bouillaud was elected president of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine, and in 1868 he became a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences. Bouillaud performed research of many medical diseases and conditions, including cancer, cholera, heart disease and encephalitis, to name a few. He is remembered for providing a correlation between rheumatism and heart disease, and French medical dictionaries still refer to acute rheumatoid endocarditis as \\"Bouillaud's disease\\". He described this condition in the treatise \\"Trait√© clinique des maladies du coeur\\". Bouillaud was an early advocate of the drug digitalis for treatment of heart ailments. He referred to digitalis as the \\"opium of the heart\\". Along with cardiologist Pierre Potain (1825‚Äì1901), he performed studies of \\"heart sounds\\" involving the differentiation between normal and abnormal heart rhythms. Bouilland was an ardent follower of Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais (1772‚Äì1838) in regard to the dubious practice of bloodletting. In 1825 Bouillaud published \\"Trait√© clinique et physiologique de l'enc√©phalite, ou inflammation du cerveau\\" in which he includes one of the earliest studies on localization of brain functions. He maintained that loss of articulate speech was associated with lesions of the anterior lobe.

Fenobam has anxiolytic effects comparable to those of benzodiazepine drugs, but was never commercially marketed for the treatment of anxiety due to dose-limiting side effects such as amnesia and psychotomimetic symptoms. Following the discovery of its activity as a potent negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5, fenobam has been re-investigated for many applications, with its profile of combined antidepressant, anxiolytic, analgesic and anti-addictive effects potentially useful given the common co-morbidity of these symptoms.

The work was written by Ben Jonson, with costumes, sets, and stage effects designed by Inigo Jones, and music by Nicholas Lanier. Masquing resumed At the start of his reign in 1625, Charles discontinued the practice of staging annual masques during the Christmas season, which had prevailed throughout the reign of his father James I, from The Masque of Blackness in 1605 to The Fortunate Isles and Their Union in 1625. His new bride, Henrietta Maria of France, was too young and inexperienced to take over the role of the previous queen, Anne of Denmark, who had been the prime mover in the production of the masques. The resumption of masquing in 1631 has been seen as a sign of the greater maturity and the growing influence of Charles's then 21-year-old queen.Leapman, pp. 221‚Äì4, 241‚Äì3. King and courtiers Love's Triumph Through Callipolis, performed at Whitehall Palace on 9 January 1631, was only the first of two masques mounted at Court that winter season; the second was Chloridia, staged on 22 February. The first masque featured King Charles himself, performing with fourteen lords of his Court; the second featured Henrietta Maria and her ladies in waiting. The former circumstance constituted a major innovation: in the previous reign, Queen Anne had regularly appeared in masques, but the King never did. Charles would perform again in the next year's masque, Albion's Triumph by Aurelian Townshend (designed again by Inigo Jones), and in subsequent masques as well. Both the text of the masque and Charles's personal participation in it supported his traditionalist position of absolute royal authority. Yet three of the noblemen who participated in the masque with Charles, the Earls of Pembroke, Newport, and Holland, were dissenters from Charles's policy of personal rule; they were part of the Parliamentary party at Court that would assert itself a decade later.Martin Butler, \\"Reform or reverence? The politics of the Caroline masque,\\" in Mulryne and Shewring, pp. 127‚Äì55. Platonic love Both of the 1631 masques deal with the theme of Platonic love, a concept dear to the heart of Henrietta Maria; she was at the center of a Court circle that favored the concept. Callipolis is an idealized Platonic city, dedicated to virtue and beauty. At the start of the masque, however, the suburbs of Callipolis have been penetrated by twelve depraved and sensuous lovers ‚Äì \\"A glorious boasting lover,\\" \\"A whining ballading lover,\\" etc., down to \\"A sensual brute lover.\\" These figures, shown in the anti-masque, are not English but from continental European nations. This, however, is not an indictment of the Queen's origin in France; to the contrary, the masque specifies that if the King embodies \\"heroic love,\\" the Queen, as the loved one or the object of that love, is essential to the affirmative whole that the masque celebrates.Britland, pp. 66‚Äì8. The depraved lovers perform a complex dance through circles and mazes; once they are expelled, the place is purified with censors and the proper and ordering love of the King and Queen is celebrated, with the usual mythical figures of the masque form ‚Äì Oceanus and Amphitrite, sea gods and cupids, Jupiter, Juno, and others. Publication Shortly after their performances, both 1631 masques, Callipolis and Chloridia, were published together in a quarto issued by the bookseller Thomas Walkley. (The 1631 quarto was dated \\"1630,\\" since prior to 1751 England started the New Year on 25 March instead of 1 January. See: Old Style and New Style dates.) Callipolis was reprinted in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641. NotesReferences * Britland, Karen. Drama in the Courts of Henrietta Maria.

Membership There are currently 16 members including a Chairman, Secretary, and Rules Development Secretary in the Board. All of them have played and/or umpired hockey. Indeed, most of them are still very active with their current involvement in the game ranging from coaching at the top level to playing at veteran‚Äôs level. The members of the Board come from all over the world. The overall shared experience (with some members having taken part in the game in various ways at different times) is: 8 international players, 5 coaches, 7 international umpires, 6 senior Tournament Officials and 3 international team managers. Reasons to change the rules The Board change the rules owing to three main reasons. One reason is to keep up with technical advances. The development of synthetic playing surfaces, player fitness, stick manufacturing and coaching tactics has changed the game and it is important that the rules keep pace with such changes. Another reason for change is to address safety issues. Everyone‚Äôs view of safety and liability has changed over the years. For example, thirty years ago goalkeepers did not wear helmets but today‚Äôs standards and personal expectations demand increased protection. A third reason is to ensure that hockey continues as a popular sport throughout the world. In today‚Äôs fast paced electronic age, the public, especially young children, are attracted by sports they see on television. The Olympic movement has recognised this and are now including more attractive and exciting sports in their programmes. Whether one likes this or not, it is very clear that, if a sport is to attract young players and indeed keep its place in the Olympics, it must be an attractive game to watch and to play. Hockey has considerable room for improvement in this area and the Hockey Rules Board together with the FIH is aware of this. Procedure to change the rules The Board usually introduces significant rules change through extensive trial and a period of mandatory experiment. Experience suggests that monitoring the effectiveness of significant rule change(s) is best done when only one change is implemented at any one time ‚Äì so it tries to operate in this way whenever possible. Other amendments to the rules are essentially of a minor nature and will not affect the conduct of the game to any great extent and so a few are sometimes implemented at the same time. Everyone must play by this rule until the Hockey Rules Board decides whether or not to make it an official rule. During the period of a mandatory experiment the Hockey Rules Board is therefore very keen to get feedback through National Associations. Before a mandatory experiment is introduced, the Hockey Rules Board will first encourage National Associations to trial the proposed change voluntarily in a recognised league or other series of matches and to report the results, after the Board considers a substantial rules change. If the results are favourable the Hockey Rules Board may then introduce a mandatory experiment.

A Clive Churchill Medallist and two-time Dally M Medallist, he made 309 first- grade appearances with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, winning grand finals with them in 1987 and 1996. Lyons also represented New South Wales and Australia, being part of the successful 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France. Lyons, known as Napper or Cliffy to his mates, started his rugby league career playing forward, but was often moved into the role which is where he was considered to be at his best. It was at five-eighth that Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles coach Bob Fulton started playing Lyons on a permanent basis. Lyons' success with the Sea Eagles, winning premierships in 1987 and 1996, saw him selected in the Manly Sea Eagles 60th Anniversary Dream Team in 2006, being named on the bench of the 17-man line-up. He was notable for his elusive cross-field runs, creating doubt in the minds of defenders and setting up gaps for support players, most famously second-rower Steve Menzies, to run back into. Biography=Background Born in Narrandera, New South Wales on 19 October 1961, Lyons played junior rugby league with Gundagai Tigers. As a teenager he moved to the Cronulla district as a boarder from Tregear near Mount Druitt. Lyons was graded as a second rower with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in 1981. He played with the Gundagai Tigers in the Group 9 competition for three seasons, from where he represented Riverina against New Zealand in 1982 and against Great Britain in 1984. Playing career1980s= Lyons entered the NSWRFL Premiership for the first time with the North Sydney Bears midway through 1984, following his Riverina coach Greg Hawick. He made his first grade d√©but for the Bears in Round 2 of the 1985 NSWRL season, playing , and contributing a field goal in a 15-10 win over the Illawarra Steelers at the Wollongong Showground. He then played in England in the Australian off-season with stays with Leeds (1985‚Äì86) and Sheffield Eagles (1986‚Äì87). Lyons moved to the neighbouring team, the Bob Fulton-coached Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles for the 1986 NSWRL season, though he mostly played at lock forward that year due to a broken arm suffered by regular lock and team captain Paul Vautin. This saw Fulton play former Wallaby Mitchell Cox at five- eighth for most of the season with mixed results. Manly finished 4th at the end of the minor round with 14 wins, 9 losses, a draw (plus 2 byes) and were bundled out in a 29-22 loss to Balmain in the Minor Preliminary Semi-final. With Vautin fully recovered by the start of the 1987 season, Lyons became the Sea Eagles' first choice five-eighth alongside speedy Australian Kangaroos test half back Des Hasler. Lyons made his State of Origin d√©but for New South Wales in Game 2 of 1987 State of Origin series on a wet and muddy Sydney Cricket Ground, beating out Canterbury-Bankstown pivot and 1986 Kangaroo tourist Terry Lamb as the Blues' five-eighth at the end of the representative career of Brett Kenny, and playing opposite the King of Origin football, Australian and Queensland captain Wally Lewis. Lyons also played in 1987's exhibition state of Origin match in Los Angeles. Manly went on to record a new club record of 12 straight wins during the season which culminated in the 1987 Grand Final against the Canberra Raiders. Lyons scored the only try of the first half against the Raiders after a strong 25m run from a scrum win, but it was his damaging runs that cut holes in the Raiders defence that saw him win the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match. Following the grand final victory he travelled with Manly to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against the 1986‚Äì87 English champions, Wigan. In front of an official 36,895 fans at Wigan's Central Park (though many in attendance believe the crowd to be closer to 50,000), Wigan stunned the Winfield Cup premiers 8-2 in a try- less game. Despite being born and bred in the country, Lyons made the first of three appearances for City Origin in 1988 in the annual City vs Country Origin game. He appeared in two games of the 1988 State of Origin series, vying for the five-eighth position with Terry Lamb. At the end of the 1988 NSWRL season, Lyons made his international d√©but when he was selected on the bench for a Rest of the World team that narrowly lost 30-28 to Great Britain at Headingley in Leeds, England. Joining Lyons in the side were his Manly teammates Dale Shearer (), Michael O'Connor () and Noel \\"Crusher\\" Cleal (Second-row), as well as fellow Australians Steve Ella (5/8), Allan Langer () and Sam Backo (). During the 1988‚Äì89 Rugby Football League season Lyons played at , and was awarded the White Rose Trophy as man of the match in Leeds' 33-12 victory over Castleford in the 1988 Yorkshire Cup Final at Elland Road, Leeds on Sunday 16 October 1988. =1990s= Lyons' ability to set up tries for his support players with his unpredictable weaving runs saw him consistently win player awards, culminating in his 'breakthrough' season in 1990, age 29. After winning the coveted Gold 'Dally M' award for Player of the Year in the regular club season he received his call-up to the Australian team on the 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France. Australia lost the first Test 19-14 at Wembley Stadium (the Kangaroos first loss on English soil since 1978), and Lyons was thrust into the second Test side at Old Trafford. He repaid the faith shown in him by his former club coach Fulton by finishing one of the best team tries ever seen in a Test as Australia kept The Ashes alive with 14-10 win over Great Britain. He then produced a solid display in the third Test as Australia retained The Ashes with a resounding 14-0 win at Elland Road.Great Britain vs Australia 1990 (Test Series Highlights) He then went on to play in both winning Tests against France, being named man-of-the-match for the 34-10 second test win at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in Perpignan. Lyons again played for NSW in the 1991 State of Origin series, but lost his test place to a returning Wally Lewis for the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand, and then was passed over in favour of North Sydney pivot Peter Jackson for the final two tests. At the end of the 1991 NSWRL season Manly finished in 2nd place behind eventual premiers Penrith in the minor round, but bombed out in straight sets in the finals with losses to North Sydney and Canberra. Lyons was then selected for the Australian national team for the 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea, regaining his test spot due to an injury to Jackson. On tour he played in both test matches for Australia against the Papua New Guinea Kumuls, scoring a try in the first test in Goroka in which he partnered Manly teammate Geoff Toovey in the halves, but was relegated to the bench for the final test against the Kumuls in Port Moresby. Cliff Lyons was particularly in his element in rugby league sevens competitions, winning the 'Player of the Competition' during Manly's 1994 Sevens' win and captaining an Aboriginal 'Dream Team' in the 1996 competition. Despite winning his second Gold 'Dally M' award in 1994, as well as becoming Manly's first Rugby League Week \\"Player of the Year\\" since his coach Bob Fulton had won in 1975 (and the club's last as of 2016), he missed selection for that year's Kangaroo tour at the age of 33 in favour of younger players. Lyons resisted a lucrative offer from the Western Reds to stay with the Sea Eagles in 1995, and went on to play in three consecutive grand finals from 1995‚Äì97, winning his second premiership in 1996 with a 20-8 win over St. George. At the end of the 1998 season, in which he was mainly used off the bench, Lyons reluctantly retired after not being offered a contract. In January 1999 Lyons was playing for Warringah in a rugby sevens competition, but following the Sea Eagles' disastrous start to the 1999 NRL season, he made a comeback with the club, passing the 300 first-grade game mark late in the season. He became the oldest player in the NRL at 37 years and 313 days, and also retired with Manly's club record for most first-grade appearances.Club records at seaeagles.com.au At the end of the year, he was named Aboriginal Sportsman of the Year (tied with Nicky Winmar) and captained Australian Aborigines in an unofficial 'test' against Papua New Guinea in Cairns. Lyons in 2008 =2000s= In the year 2000 Lyons was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Cut from the newly formed Northern Eagles at year's end, he signed with Umina and captain-coached the Central Coast club in 2001, the year he celebrated his 40th birthday. Lyons made a cameo appearance in the 2006 film, Footy Legends. Lyons' 309 first grade games for Manly is the club record. Into his 40s Cliff's career continued with the Hornsby Lions, and more recently the Narraweena Hawks. In 2018, Lyons was inducted in the National Rugby League Hall of Fame. Coaching career Having coached Narraweena to consecutive premierships in the Manly A-Grade competition, Lyons joined moved into the NSW Cup as coach of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles side just before the 2012 season. After leading Manly to a 6th-place finish in the 2012 NSW Cup season, Lyons was replaced as Manly's NSW Cup coach for the 2013 season by former Sea Eagle Luke Williamson.

He was a dominant master of the sport in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, and was also a winner of the Peruvian and Makaha International titles. Early life=Learning to surf Kekai was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1920, and lived with his five siblings and parents near the shore at Waikiki. He first surfed at the age of three when his uncle, a lifeguard, began to teach him how to surf, and by the age of five, Kekai was surfing on his own. As surfing became a bigger part of his life, the boy looked to role models like Duke Kahanamoku, who instructed the ten-year-old Kekai in surfing and outrigger canoeing. Teenage years Although surfing was consuming more of his life as he grew older, Kekai managed to concentrate on his school work and excelled academically. He was offered athletic scholarships to attend college, but chose to enter the workforce after high school, and earned a living on and off the beach through numerous odd jobs. By the mid 1930s, Kekai had risen in the ranks of surfing devotees as he innovated drop-knee bottom turns and hotdogging on shortboards, and surfed on finless boards called \\"hot curls\\". He is often mentioned as having been the top hot curl wave rider of his day. At this time he also began surfing on the North Shore, which is still a popular world-class surf spot. Prime surfing years=Duty in World War II Like most young American men of the time, Kekai served in the military during World War II, and was fortunate to be stationed in Haleiwa on the North Shore for part of his service. Not wanting to let his surfing skills deteriorate, Kekai would surf after finishing his duties for the day. He worked on the Underwater Demolition Teams, or UDTs, that operated in the Pacific Theatre deploying depth charges to destroy Japanese ships and clear the way for American troops to capture the Federated States of Micronesia from Japan. After serving three years, Kekai was discharged from the Navy. Return to surfing Kekai was one of the founding members of the Waikiki Surf Club and helped it win numerous surfing championships and canoe races; he also won numerous international surfing titles independently. By the 1950s, Kekai made a point of passing on the surfing techniques he had acquired over the years to a younger generation, including Joey Cabell, Donald Takayama, Harold Iggy and many others. He also catered to celebrities who visited Hawaii on vacation, teaching them the basics of the ancient sport. Later years Rabbit Kekai (center) with some of the children who competed in the 2009 Rabbit Kekai Keiki Surf Contest. Rabbit Kekai was married and a great-grandfather, remaining an avid surfer until his death. The Rabbit Kekai Keiki Surf Contest was held every year at Waikiki Beach to promote surfing for Hawaii's children (keiki means \\"child\\" or \\"little kid\\" in the Hawaiian language). Kekai attended the contests and presented the prizes to the winners. In August 2012, Kekai was inducted into the Surfers' Hall of Fame in Huntington Beach, California. Kekai died on May 13, 2016 at Leahi Hospital in Honolulu. He was 95.

He attended Monte Vista High School in Danville, California. He later went to Chabot College and then to Texas Tech. Standing at 6'1\\", 190 pounds, Kolb was originally drafted by the Oakland Athletics 1077th overall in the 1993 draft. Deciding not to sign, he would have to wait until to be drafted again, when he was selected by the Padres in the fourth round. This time, he chose to sign. Originally a starter in the minors, his best record was 16‚Äì9, which he achieved in 1996 with the Clinton LumberKings. Although he showed promise as a starter in the minor leagues, he was being used mostly as a reliever by 1998. He spent 1998 and 1999 entirely as a reliever. He made his Major League debut on May 12, 2000 against the Arizona Diamondbacks at the age of 26. Although he struck out one batter in the single inning he pitched that game, he also gave up two hits and an earned run. He would improve down the stretch, lowering his season ERA to 4.50. Although he gave up 16 hits in 14 innings that year, not one of them was a home run. He walked 11 and struck out 12 that year. During the 2000/2001 offseason, Kolb was sent to the Brewers with a player to be named later for Santiago P√©rez and a player to be named later. The players to be named would end up being Will Cunnane for the Padres and minor leaguer Chad Green of the Brewers. His career took a major turn for the worse while with the Padres in 2001. He did not give up a single earned run until his fifth appearance of 2001, but he still posted a season ERA of 13.03. He gave up six home runs in 9 innings of work, including three in one inning‚Äîon June 20 against the Cincinnati Reds, Kolb gave up home runs to Sean Casey, Michael Tucker, and Pokey Reese. Since he had given up two home runs the game before, Kolb ended up allowing five home runs over a two-game span‚Äîhe pitched a total of only 1 innings in that time. His season ended on September 19, 2001. In his final career game, Kolb allowed two earned runs. He did strike out the final batter he faced in his career, though. It was pitcher Steve Kline. After his big league career ended, Kolb spent time bouncing around the minors until 2004, even spending time in independent baseball. Overall in his Major League career, Kolb was 0‚Äì1 with a 7.99 ERA in 21 games. In 23 innings of work, Kolb walked 19 and struck out 20. He went 0-for-2 as a batter, although he did score a run. His fielding percentage was .667. He wore numbers 47 and 38 in his career. He lives in Flower Mound, Texas and is a private instructor.

It is with the basin of the Burnett River. The area is within two local government areas, South Burnett Region and Gympie Region. Towns Towns located within this region with a population of more than 1,000 include Kingaroy, Murgon, Wondai and Nanango. Towns with a population under 1,000 people include Kilkivan, Goomeri, Proston, Blackbutt, Kumbia, Tingoora, Hivesville, Memerambi, Wooroolin, Moffatdale, Crawford, Coolabunia, Mount Mowbullan, Goodger, Booie, Benarkin, Cloyna and Wheatlands. Transport The D'Aguilar Highway leads south east, while the Bunya Highway enters the region from the south west. The Wide Bay Highway connects to Gympie and the Bruce Highway towards the coast and the Burnett Highway continues north of the region. The Brisbane Valley railway line reached Blackbutt in 1905. The line was closed in the 1980s. Wine region The South Burnett Wine Region is another attraction, with Verdelho grown successfully, due to the warm climate and rich soils. With around ten wineries, it is a relatively new wine region. Grapes were first planted in the area in 1898. Industrial production began in 1993. Most of the wineries are located close to Kingaroy or in the Moffatdale area north of Murgon. There are none in the west of the region. Shiraz and Chardonnay are the most prevalent varieties with production roughly halved between red and white wines. Attractions One of the best known attractions in the area is the peanut-growing district centered on Kingaroy. 12 km from Murgon is the Bjelke-Petersen Dam. Other dams in the region include Gordonbrook Dam and Boondooma Dam. Tarong Power Station and the Tarong National Park are both in the south of the Burnett. The Bunya Mountains, protected within the Bunya Mountains National Park, which contains the largest natural bunya pine forest in the world, are a popular natural attraction in the south of the region. At Kinbombi Falls there are picnic and camping facilities next to a large waterfall, gorge and rocky creek. Rock-wallabies can be seen on local cliffs, particularly around twilight hours. Garnet gem fields are found just west of Proston.

The airport is located 38 kilometers west of the city of Ambon. The airport was named after Pattimura, an Indonesian national hero who fought against the Dutch colonialists in the nineteenth century. Pattimura Airport is an airport located in Ambon City, Maluku Province, Indonesia. The airport also caters for domestic and overseas trips. The airport is 35 kilometers outside Ambon City with travel time approximately 30‚Äì45 minutes. At this airport there are immigration facilities, quarantine, customs, cargo building, restaurant, public phone, and post office. Pattimura Airport Ambon is a very strategic area in the Maluku Islands which is divided into two provinces namely, North Maluku and Maluku. Pattimura Ambon Airport is located in Ambon Island, located in Maluku Province. History The airport was established by the Dutch in 1939 as Laha Airfield. In early February 1942, the airport was captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Ambon and used as a base for the Japanese to do battle against the allied forces in the Pacific. After the independence of Indonesia was proclaimed, Pattimura was used as an air base. This lasted until August 1, 1962, when the government formed a working unit in charge of organizing the civil aviation maintenance and operation of airports for the benefit of civil air transport. Pattimura Airport continued to be operated as an Air Force Air Base. Based on the Joint Decree of the Minister of Defense / Armed Forces Commander, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance, in 1975, Pattimura airport was designated as a civilian airfield and came under the full control of the Department of Transportation. On October 11, 1995, the management of the Pattimura Airport was transferred to PT. Angkasa Pura I (Persero), a state- owned enterprises that manages several airports in central and eastern Indonesia.  Facilities  This airport is located 36 kilometers from the city of Ambon.Ambon City Government Website  http://www.ambon.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=19&Itemid;=26 It has an immigration office, a quarantine facility, a tax office, a cargo storage building, several small restaurants, public pay phones, and a post office. Free wi-fi internet is available throughout the airport. The international terminal is 1,200 m2 (gates C & D) and has an annual capacity of 70,000 passengers. The domestic terminal is 7,393 m2 (gates A & B) and has an annual capacity of 406,000 passengers. Currently there are no regularly scheduled international flights to or from Ambon, so the international terminal is used for domestic flights which are operated with larger airplanes and can make use of the two jet bridges for easier loading and unloading of the airplanes ‚Äì especially during rain. The cargo terminal size is 1,192 m2. The outside parking area is 8,574 m2.Angkasapura 1 website  Airlines and destinations=Passenger=Proposed development Pattimura Airport has a capacity of 800 thousand people, while in fact, the airport has served 1.3 million people per year. Therefore, when hearing the news, Minister of State- Owned Enterprises (SOE), Rini M. Soemarmo immediately followed up the report by telephoning the main director of Angkasa Pura (AP) I. According to AP I president, airport development has been planned. This is evidenced by the absence of development design, namely the addition of one terminal, including the addition of garbarata. Despite the news, the minister is still worried that by the end of 2017 the total number of passengers will be 1.5 million. Former foreign routes Since 1998, there have been no international routes operating out of the Pattimura International Airport. Previously there was a flight from Ambon to Darwin, Australia. There have been occasional flights to Darwin at the time of the various boating events, but no regularly scheduled international flights since 1998. Recently there has been talk of resuming international flights out of Ambon, but nothing specific has been announced yet. Land transportation= DAMRI Bus  Perum DAMRI has buses operated to connect the airport to the surrounding area. During this time, this bus journey only has one route. The route is Pattimura International Airport- Merdeka Square. Bus routes from the airport to Lapangan Merdeka are as follows.

Taxis serving this airport has two types of cars, namely sedans and minibuses. In the past, passengers still had to pay a ferry to cross Ambon Bay. However, there is now a Red and White Bridge that shorten the time. Incidents * On 24 July 1992, Mandala Airlines Flight 660 crashed when on approach to Pattimura Airport. All 70 passengers and crew on board were killed. * On 7 June 1997, a Merpati Nusantara Airlines flight collided with a tree on approach but was able to land safely. * On 2 January 2007, Lion Air Flight JT 797 skidded on the runway stopping just 4 meters before the end of the runway. Neither the plane nor any of the passengers were injured, but a runway light was damaged. The accident occurred at 8:14am during heavy rains.

Origin The Aztec writing system is adopted from writing systems used in Central Mexico, such as Zapotec writing. Mixtec writing is also thought to descend from the Zapotec. The first Oaxacan inscriptions are thought to encode Zapotec, partially because of numerical suffixes characteristic of the Zapotec languages.Justeson (1986, p.449) Aztec Silabary Structure and use Aztec was pictographic and ideographic proto-writing, augmented by phonetic rebuses. It also contained syllabic signs and logograms. There was no alphabet, but puns also contributed to recording sounds of the Aztec language. While some scholars have understood the system to not be considered a complete writing system, this is a changing topic. The existence of logograms and syllabic signs are being documented and a phonetic aspect of the writing system has emerged, even though many of the syllabic characters have been documented since at least 1888 by Nuttall. There are conventional signs for syllables and logograms which act as word signs or for their rebus content. Logosyllabic writing appears on both painted and carved artifacts, such as the Tizoc Stone. However, instances of phonetic characters often appear within a significant artistic and pictorial context. In native manuscripts, the sequence of historical events are indicted by a line of footprints leading from one place or scene to another. The ideographic nature of the writing is apparent in abstract concepts, such as death, represented by a corpse wrapped for burial; night, drawn as a black sky and a closed eye; war, by a shield and a club; and speech, illustrated as a little scroll issuing from mouth of the person who is talking. The concepts of motion and walking were indicated by a trail of footprints. A glyph could be used as a rebus to represent a different word with the same sound or similar pronunciation. This is especially evident in the glyphs of town names. For example, the glyph for Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, was represented by combining two pictograms: stone (te-tl) and cactus (nochtli). Aztec Glyphs do not have a set reading order, as do Maya hieroglyphs. As such, they may be read in any direction which forms the correct sound values in the context of the glyph. However, there is an internal reading order in that any sign will be followed by the next sign for the following sound in the word being written. They do not jumble up the sounds in a word. Numerals The Aztec numerical system was vigesimal. They indicated quantities up to twenty by the requisite number of dots. A flag was used to indicate twenty, repeating it for quantities up to four hundred, while a sign like a fir tree, meaning numerous as hairs, signified four hundred. The next unit, eight thousand, was indicated by an incense bag, which referred to the almost innumerable contents of a sack of cacao beans. Historical Aztecs embraced the widespread manner of presenting history cartographically. A cartographic map would hold an elaborately detailed history recording events. The maps were painted to be read in sequence, so that time is established by the movement of the narrative through the map and by the succession of individual maps. Aztecs also used continuous year-count annals to record anything that would occur during that year. All the years are painted in a sequence and most of the years are generally in a single straight line that reads continually from left to right. Events, such as solar eclipses, floods, droughts, or famines, are painted around the years, often linked to the years by a line or just painted adjacent to them. Specific individuals were not mentioned often, but unnamed humans were often painted in order to represent actions or events. When individuals are named, they form the majority of the corpus of logosyllabic examples.

He was jailed by Nyerere from 1972, and, after his release following an international campaign, remained a vocal critic of imperialism, authoritarian states and excessively statist (as well as private capitalist) development models. Early years Abdulrahman Mohamed Babu was born in 1924 in Zanzibar, East Africa ‚Äì then a British protectorate, under the nominal control of the hereditary Sultan. The island's economy was centred on exporting cloves and coconuts, and its population included Arabs, black Africans and Indians.Amrit Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu: Politician, Scholar and Revolutionary,\\" Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 8‚Äì25. After serving in the British forces during World War Two, and a stint as a clerk on a clove plantation, he studied in Britain from 1951, where he was drawn first to anarchist-communism and then to Marxism-Leninism.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, p. 9. Anti-colonialism Influenced by the rise of anti-colonial movements and impressed by the rising power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Babu threw himself into the independence movement He was the leader of the first mass nationalist party on the island, the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP), and in 1958 attended the All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra, Ghana, where he met Kwame Nkrumah, Frantz Fanon and Patrice Lumumba, following which Babu visited Mao Zedong's China in 1959. Babu had built close relations with the Chinese leadership and was viewed by the British as \\"the best known Sinophile\\" in the area.Altorfer- Ong, Alicia (2009). \\"Tanzanian 'Freedom' and Chinese 'Friendship' in 1965: laying the tracks for the TanZam rail link\\" (PDF). LSE Ideas. London School of Economics (LSE): 655‚Äì670. Retrieved 16 September 2010. Babu was jailed for two years by the British. At independence in 1962, government was transferred to a coalition, drawn from the right-wing of the ZNP and a splinter off the moderate Afro-Shirazi Party of Abeid Karume, which retained the Sultan as constitutional monarch.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, p. 11. The ZNP left-wing, including Babu, quit to form the revolutionary Umma Party, which built a popular base across race lines. The Zanzibar Revolution, 1964 In early 1964, massive riots broke out, and the Umma Party played a key role, notable for having \\"prevented the revolution from taking a racial character i.e. African against Arab\\". A new government was formed by the Afro-Shirazi Party and the Umma Party, with Abeid Karume as President, and Babu the Foreign Minister, comprising the Zanzibar Revolutionary Council. Pressured by Britain, Karume pushed through a merger between Zanzibar and Tanganyika in April 1964, although this had little support in his government or the people. Babu was among the progressive, leftist members of the Zanzibari government who was retained in the new joint Cabinet Dar es Salaam. His connections to China continued, and his ideological affinity and work with the New China News Agency made him a good channel of communication with Beijing. Meanwhile he met ‚Äì in July 1964 at the second summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Cairo, Egypt ‚Äì and became friends with, as well as arguably influencing, Malcolm X.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, p. 21. After Union This also enabled Babu to a key role to play in the establishment of the TAZARA Railway with the help of Chinese aid. Julius Nyerere wanted to build on Zanzibar's close ties with China and create benefits for the whole country. Babu was named head of the trade delegation that preceded Nyerere‚Äôs presidential delegation to China in 1964. Due to his personal experience with the Chinese and his ideological affinity for their Marxist-Leninist model of development, Babu seized the initiative and mentioned the difficulties his government faced in trying to secure financing for the TAZARA Railway. On 1 July 1965 the Chinese Government made a firm offer of tied aid to the governments of Tanzania and Zambia, worth ¬£75 million and ¬£150 million to enable them to build the railway line. Another outcome of his trip was a trade agreement (separate from the ¬£11 million aid agreement) for ¬£5 million a year for five years. Under this agreement the Tanzanians were to buy whatever they could afford from the Chinese but the Chinese were to buy ¬£5 million worth a year from Tanzania. The Chinese would pay cash for the balance not taken up by purchases from Tanzania. Jail Babu rejected Nyerere's model of African Socialism, for failing to address Tanzania's reliance on raw material exports, a colonial legacy; for replicating, in its rural policies, fairly orthodox policies under the guise of 'Ujamaa' radicalism; and for irresponsible and unsustainable nationalization especially of small businesses, often owned by the Indian minority.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 13‚Äì15. Since the key task was to develop the forces of production in such a way as to end neo-colonial patterns, dislocating production, failing to provide funding to villagers, and aiming at a \\"fairer\\" integration into world capitalism, as Nyerere did, would not be successful.Babu, Abdulrahman Mohamed, 1981, African Socialism or Socialist Africa?, London: Zed Press. In 1972, Karume was assassinated, and Babu along with 40 other Umma Party members were jailed for alleged involvement, despite a lack of evidence, leading to death sentences three years later, but were finally released after an international campaign.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, p. 16. Babu and 12 other prisoners held on the mainland were freed by Nyerere in an amnesty. Development model and the \\"Letter to Mugabe\\" In his well-known book Socialist Africa or African Socialism, which was written in prison, and in work after his release, Babu stressed the importance of fundamental economic change. Internal change in the country, rather than changes in the global environment, were key, and this required careful management of contradictions among the people, including the national bourgeoisie, as advised by Mao Zedong . In his 1980 Open Letter to Robert Mugabe in 1980, he argued that experience showed that 'the taking over of ongoing viable farms' by states 'has invariably led to almost total collapse of agricultural production and has forced the countries concerned to incur heavy foreign debt to import food'.Wilson, 2007, \\"Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu\\", Journal of Pan African Studies, vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 17‚Äì18. He argued that the state should promote cooperative as opposed to peasant farms alongside the large white-owned commercial farms, obliging the latter to support the former, and split the more progressive white farmers from the \\"reactionaries\\". Rising rural incomes would boost the home market which would boost industrialization. He also spoke out repeatedly against authoritarian postcolonial states, and argued in favour of genuine democracy, which he saw as antithetical to capitalism and imperialism. He wished for a 'socialist and united Africa' Last years For most of the years after his release by Nyerere, Babu lived in the United States of America or Britain, but remained involved in African politics, including efforts to forge an alternative to neo-liberalism. He stayed in London for years as a scholar. However, he returned to Tanzania in 1995 to stand as a candidate for the NCCR-Mageuzi party, a mixed formation that was running in the first multi-party elections in decades Legal manipulations preventing him running as a candidate, and the elections were not free or fair; the incumbent party was re-elected. The old charges against and consequent conviction of Babu allowed the Electoral Commission to rejecting his bid to run for the vice-presidency. Babu died aged 72 on August 5, 1996, at the London Chest Hospital after a short illness.

Its main components consist of a heat shield (the forebody) and a back shell. The heat shield absorbs heat caused by air compression in front of the spacecraft during its atmospheric entry. The back shell carries the load being delivered, along with important components such as a parachute, rocket engines, and monitoring electronics like an inertial measurement unit that monitors the orientation of the shell during parachute-slowed descent. Its purpose is used during the EDL, or Entry, Descent, and Landing, process of a spacecraft's mission. First, the aeroshell decelerates the spacecraft as it penetrates the planet's atmosphere. The heat shield absorbs the resulting friction. During descent, the parachute is deployed and the heat shield is detached. Rockets located at the back shell are initiated to assist in the decrease of the spacecraft's descent. Airbags are also inflated to cushion the impact. The spacecraft bounces on the planet's surface directly after the first impact. The spacecraft's lander petals are deployed after the airbags are deflated and retracted. Communication throughout this entire process is relayed back and forth from mission control and the actual spacecraft through low-gain antennas that are attached to the back shell and on itself. Throughout the entry, descent, and landing stages, tones are sent back to earth in order to communicate the success or failure of each of these critical steps. Aeroshells are a key component of space probes that must land intact on the surface of any object with an atmosphere. They have been used on all missions returning payloads to the Earth (if one counts the Space Shuttle thermal protection system as an aeroshell). They are also used for all landing missions to Mars, Venus, Titan and (in the most extreme case) the Galileo probe to Jupiter. Components The aeroshell consists of two main components: the heat shield, or forebody, which is located at the front of the aeroshell, and the back shell, which is located at the back of the aeroshell. The heat shield of the aeroshell faces the ram direction (forward) during a spacecraft's atmospheric entry, allowing it to absorb the high heat caused by compression of air in front of the craft. The backshell acts as a finalizer for the encapsulation of the payload. The backshell typically contains a parachute, pyrotechnic devices along with their electronics and batteries, an inertial measurement unit, and other hardware needed for the specific mission's entry, descent, and landing sequence. The parachute is located at the apex of the back shell and slows the spacecraft during EDL. The pyrotechnic control system releases devices such as nuts, rockets, and the parachute mortar. The inertial measurement unit reports the orientation of the back shell while it is swaying underneath the parachute. Retrorockets, if equipped, can assist in the terminal descent and landing of the spacecraft vehicle; alternatively or additionally, a lander may have retrorockets mounted on its own body for terminal descent and landing use (after the backshell has been jettisoned). Other rockets may be equipped to provide horizontal force to the back shell, helping to orient it to a more vertical position during the main retrorocket burn. Design factors A spacecraft's mission objective determines what flight requirements are needed to ensure mission success. These flight requirements are deceleration, heating, and impact and landing accuracy. A spacecraft must have maximum value of deceleration low enough to keep the weakest points of its vehicle intact but high enough to penetrate the atmosphere without rebounding. Spacecraft structure and payload mass affect how much maximum deceleration it can stand. This force is represented by \\"g's\\", or Earth's gravitational acceleration. If its structure is well-designed enough and made from robust material (such as steel), then it can withstand a higher amount of g's. However, payload needs to be considered. Just because the spacecraft's structure can withstand high g's does not mean its payload can. For example, a payload of astronauts can only withstand 12 g's, or 12 times their weight. Values that are more than this baseline will cause death. It must also be able to withstand high temperature caused by the immense friction resulting from entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed. Finally, it must be able to penetrate an atmosphere and land on a terrain accurately, without missing its target. A more constricted landing area calls for more strict accuracy. In such cases, a spacecraft will be more streamlined and possess a steeper re-entry trajectory angle. These factors combine to affect the re-entry corridor, the area in which a spacecraft must travel in order to avoid burning up or rebounding out of an atmosphere. All of these above requirements are met through the consideration, design, and adjustment of a spacecraft's structure and trajectory. The overall dynamics of aeroshells are influenced by inertial and drag forces, as defined it this equation: √ü=m/CdA where m is defined as the mass of the aeroshell and its respective loads and CdA is defined as the amount of drag force an aeroshell can generate during a freestream condition. Overall, Œ≤ is defined as mass divided by drag force (mas per unit drag area). A higher mass per unit drag area causes aeroshell entry, descent, and landing to happen at low and dense points of the atmosphere and also reduces the elevation capability and the timeline margin for landing. Factors that increase during EDL include heat load and rate, which causes the system to forcefully accommodate to the increase in thermal loads. This situation reduces the useful landed mass capability of entry, descent, and landing because an increase in thermal load leads to a heavier support structure and thermal protection system (TPS) of the aeroshell. Static stability also needs to be taken into consideration as it is necessary to maintain a high-drag altitude. This is why a swept aeroshell forebody as opposed to a blunt one is required; the previous shape ensures this factor's existence but also reduces drag area. Thus, there is a resulting tradeoff between drag and stability that affects the design of an aeroshell's shape . Lift-to-drag ratio is also another factor that needs to be considered. The ideal level for a lift-to-drag ration is at non-zero. Planetary Entry Parachute Program USAF Aeroshell \\"Flying Saucer\\" on public display in Missile Park at White Sands Missile Range. NASA's Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP) aeroshell, tested in 1966, was created to test parachutes for the Voyager Mars landing program. To simulate the thin Martian atmosphere, the parachute needed to be used at an altitude more than 160,000 feet above the Earth. A balloon launched from Roswell, New Mexico was used to initially lift the aeroshell. The balloon then drifted west to the White Sands Missile Range, where the vehicle was dropped and the engines beneath the vehicle boosted it to the required altitude, where the parachute was deployed. The Voyager program was later canceled, replaced by the much smaller Viking program several years later. NASA reused the Voyager name for the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes to the outer planets, which had nothing to do with the Mars Voyager program. Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator or LDSD is a space vehicle designed to create atmospheric drag in order to decelerate during entry through a planet's atmosphere. It is essentially a disc-shaped vehicle containing an inflatable, doughnut-shaped balloon around the outside. The use of this type of system may allow an increase in the payload. It is intended to be used to help a spacecraft decelerate before landing on Mars. This is done by inflating the balloon around the vehicle to increase the surface area and create atmospheric drag. After sufficient deceleration, a parachute on a long tether deploys to further slow the vehicle. The vehicle is being developed and tested by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Mark Adler is the project manager. June 2014 test flight Video of the 2014 test flight The test flight took place on June 28, 2014, with the test vehicle launching from the United States Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kaua ªi, Hawai ªi, at 18:45 UTC (08:45 local). A high-altitude helium balloon, which when fully inflated has a volume of , lifted the vehicle to around . The vehicle detached at 21:05 UTC (11:05 local), and four small, solid-fuel rocket motors spun up the vehicle to provide stability. A half second after spin-up, the vehicle's Star 48B solid-fuel motor ignited, powering the vehicle to Mach 4 and an altitude of approximately . Immediately after rocket burn-out, four more rocket motors despun the vehicle. Upon slowing to Mach 3.8, the tube- shaped Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD-R configuration) deployed. SIAD is intended to increase atmospheric drag on the vehicle by increasing the surface area of its leading side, thus increasing the rate of deceleration. Upon slowing to Mach 2.5 (around 107 seconds after SIAD deployment), the Supersonic Disk Sail (SSDS) parachute was deployed to slow the vehicle further. This parachute measures in diameter, nearly twice as large as the one used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. However, it began tearing apart after deployment, and the vehicle impacted the Pacific Ocean at 21:35 UTC (11:35 local) travelling . All hardware and data recorders were recovered. Despite the parachute incident, the mission was declared a success; the primary goal was proving the flight worthiness of the test vehicle, while SIAD and SSDS were secondary experiments. 2015 test flights Two more test flights of LDSD will take place in mid-2015 at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. These will focus on the SIAD-E and SSDS technologies, incorporating lessons learned during the 2014 test. Changes planned for the parachute include a rounder shape and structural reinforcement. Shortly after re-entry the parachute was torn away.  Gallery  File:Viking Orbiter releasing the lander.jpgArtist impression of the Viking Orbiter releasing the aeroshell-clad lander (Don Davis).

During at least part of that period, he lived with future Washington mayor Richard Wallach.Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, Volume 20 By Columbia Historical Society Lenox served on the Washington city council (the lower of its two legislative chambers) from 1842 to 1843, then as an Alderman from 1843 to 1849, serving his last term as President of the Board of Aldermen. Thus when mayor William Winston Seaton declined to run for a sixth term in 1850, Lenox was the heir apparent -- although because of his young age (only 33), he was dismissed by many residents of the city, particularly when the popular former mayor Roger C. Weightman announced his intention to seek the office again. Ultimately, Lenox won the election by 32 votes. Lenox's term as mayor was of little note; his most prominent accomplishments were his presiding at the laying of the cornerstone of the extension to the U.S. Capitol, service on the Washington Monument Association, and proclamation of an official day of mourning for the deceased President Zachary Taylor. The records of the Columbia Historical Society also note that he was \\"deeply concerned with the education of the youth. He gave greater attention to the public school question than any other.\\" Lenox was a Whig, which became a liability in the mayoral election of 1852 (the year in which the Whig Party collapsed). His Democratic opponent, John Walker Maury, defeated Lenox by almost 900 votes. After his mayoralty, Lenox married but became a widower after only eighteen months. He enlisted with the Confederate Army when the Civil War erupted, and upon returning to Washington in 1863 to settle the estate of a deceased relative, spoke openly in contempt of the Union and was arrested and imprisoned by his old friend, General Winfield Scott. Prison at Fort McHenry shattered Lenox's health, and he died in 1874 at the age of 57. He was interred at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington. In 1887, the Walter Lenox School at 5th and G SE opened and was named in his honor. It closed in 1931 and the building served various non-profit organizations until the late 1990s when it was sold for development. In 2006 it opened as condominiums.

The poem belongs to what is collectively known as The Lais of Marie de France. Like the other lais in the collection, Equitan is written in the Anglo-Norman language, a dialect of Old French, in rhyming octosyllabic couplets. In this 320 line poem, the author cautions that those who plot to harm another person may find only their own misfortune. Plot summary Equitan, the king of Nantes, falls in love with the beautiful wife of his seneschal. The king agonises between his feelings for her and his loyalty towards the seneschal. When Equitan declares his sentiments for her, she is incredulous because of the difference in rank between them. He convinces her that his feelings are genuine and he would be willing to be her servant. The couple begins their affair. As the affair progresses, Equitan's advisors pressure him to marry. One day, the seneschal's wife tearily asks the king if she will one day be set aside in favour of another, more highly-born woman who can become his wife. The king tells her that she is his only love, and that he would marry her if not for her husband. The wife suggests the idea of killing the seneschal by preparing a bath of boiling water. Her idea is that the king and her husband will take a bath, and then the king will claim that the seneschal mysteriously died while bathing. Later on, the king and the seneschal go on a hunting trip. They stay in a lodge where there are two bathtubs side by side in the bedroom. When the seneschal goes out to fetch something, the king and the woman prepare their trap, then they have intercourse. The seneschal returns to the lodge and finds the bedroom door locked. He bangs on the door so persistently that the door bursts open, showing the couple in each other's arms. The king, ashamed by his nakedness, tries to hide himself and runs straight into the tub of boiling water. The seneschal, angered by his wife's infidelity, tosses her into the tub as well, and the unfaithful couple are scalded to death. Themes The purpose of Equitan seems to be didactic. Marie summarizes the lesson of the lay, \\"Whoever wants to hear some sound advice/ can profit from this example:/ he who plans evil for another/ may have that evil rebound back on him\\" (lines 307-310). The tub of boiling water becomes a symbol, according to scholars Hanning and Ferrante, \\"of the trickster tricked, and of the immoderate lover fatally burned by his ungoverned passion\\" (Marie de France 69). The love described is irresponsible because the lovers give in to passion while knowing the negative consequences, it is unbalanced, and it prevents the king from having a legitimate heir, a cause of social insecurity. It is inappropriate because it causes the king to break the bond of loyalty to his seneschal and the wife to break marriage vows with her husband without good reason.

He is an anchorman for ABS-CBN's regional news program, TV Patrol Central Visayas, the host of current affairs program Arangkada over radio station DYAB, and a columnist in Cebu's newspaper The Freeman.  Early life  Lastimosa was a son of a farmer and a public school teacher. Growing up in Talisay in poverty, he dreamed of becoming a writer. In high school, he submitted an unsolicited article to the publisher of The Freeman, a Cebu local daily. His submission was published the next day, an event that encouraged him to pursue a journalistic career. He then took up a degree in political science at the University of San Jose-Recoletos.  Career  His first stint in professional journalism started in 1984 at DYLA radio station. He later moved to another radio station, DYRF. At the height of first EDSA revolution, he was involved in the radio's newsroom work. In 1995, he became a news director in the newly-launched radio station, DYAB, and started hosting the regular television program, Banat Visayas, Sulong Mindanao. He claimed he had received death threats in the course of his journalistic career. Alt URL Later, he became an anchor for the TV Patrol Central Visayas in 2006. He had also started a column, Arangkada, written in Cebuano language in The Freeman, a local daily newspaper.  Decriminalizing libel  In 2007, then Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia filed a libel case against Lastimosa. The suit alleged that Garcia was the subject of his column entitled Doling Kawatan (Doling the Thief) that was published on The Freeman last June 29, 2007. On August 27, 2010, Regional Trial Court Branch 14 Judge Raphael Yrastorza signed a warrant of arrest against Lastimosa, who then posted bail. Lastimosa denied that Garcia was the subject of the article. On August 30, 2013, the court found Lastimosa guilty, and fined him Php 6,000 and an additional Php 2 million for moral damages. He lost his appeal as the Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision. Attorney Celso Espinosa, his counsel, filed a motion for reconsideration to reverse the ruling of the appellate court. His conviction, as well as other similar high-level cases filed against journalists in the country, prompted renewed calls to decriminalize libel in defense of press freedom.  CIDG subpoena  On August 17, 2018, Lastimosa appeared in the regional office of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) - Central Visayas in response to a subpoena that directed him to provide a copy of his interview with Senator Antonio Trillanes on his radio show last September 8, 2017. The subpoena came after former Davao City vice mayor Paolo Duterte, son of President Rodrigo Duterte, requested the police to obtain a copy of the interview as evidence in court for a libel case he was filing against Trillanes who accused him for being involved in Php 6.2 billion shabu shipment in 2016. Lastimosa executed an affidavit stating that audio recordings were long deleted as radio stations were only mandated to keep the records for 10 days or 30 days when there is a court order. He also declined to authenticate a recording of the said interview presented by the CIDG.  Give Up Tomorrow  Lastimosa also appeared in the documentary Give Up Tomorrow alongside other journalists who were interviewed regarding the controversial conviction of Paco Laranaga, one of the suspects of the murder of the Chiong sisters in the 1990s.  Personal life  Aside from journalism, he also ventured into music. He penned the lyrics of Awit ni Dodong, the winning entry of the theme song contest for the Jose ‚ÄúDodong‚Äù R. Gullas (JRG) Halad Museum. About a lover's hopes and fears for a beloved, the song was put into music by Emilio Villareal. Awards Lastimosa has won numerous awards and recognition for his work. Notably, the Talisay City Council passed a resolution congratulating him for his win at 2005 KBP Golden Dove Awards citing his \\"commendable competence, integrity and fairness in the field of newscasting and showed his dedication and deep love for his country and people by his humble service as a media man.\\" *Best TV Newscaster, The 14th Golden Dove Awards of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) * Garbo Sa Sugbo, by the Cebu Provincial Government in the field of broadcast journalism and television *Best TV News Program, TV Patrol Central Visayas, 16th Cebu Archdiocesan Mass Media Awards, 2013 * Outstanding Talisaynon, by the Talisay City Government in the field of media. * Hall of Fame, Radio News Category, Cebu Archdiocesan Mass Media Awards (CAMMA) * Hall of Fame, Radio Commentary Category, Cebu Archdiocesan Mass Media Awards (CAMMA) * Finalist, Column Writing Category, Cebu Archdiocesan Mass Media Awards (CAMMA) * Special Citation, Kasayurang Kinuykoyan, National Press Club (NPC), 1991 * Best Public Affairs Program (Arangkada), KBP Golden Dove Awards, 1998 * Best Public Affairs Program Host, KBP Golden Dove Awards, 2002 * Best Commentary Program (Kuwentas Klaras), KBP Golden Dove Awards, 2002 * Best TV News Program, Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA-Manila), 2005  See also  * TV Patrol Central Visayas * DYAB * The Freeman ReferencesExternal links * Profile on Google Docs * Profile on Scribd 1964 births Living people People from Leyte (province) People from Cebu City Filipino television news anchors Filipino radio journalists ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs people University of San Jose‚ÄìRecoletos alumni ","title":"Leo Lastimosa"},{"id":"9553353","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Santiago de Veraguas (erected 13 July 1963) is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Panam√°.

She was the daughter of Duke Witger of Lotharingia and Saint Amalberga of Maubeuge. Her brother Emebert was a priest in the diocese of Cambrai. Her biography mentions Gudula as her sister.

Veneration Saint Reineldis is primarily venerated in Saintes as the patron saint of the town. Some sources even indicate that Saintes owes its name to Reineldis' martyrdom. The parish church of Saintes is dedicated to Sainte-Renelde since the Middle Ages and has preserved the relics of Saint Reineldis. This church has a large bell tower built in the 17th century. Saint Reineldis' patronage for eye diseases is due to the association with a water well in Saintes known as \\"Sainte Renelde's well\\", water which is believed to cure eye diseases. Iconography Reineldis is commonly depicted with a sword or being dragged by her hair, referring to the decapitation. She is also portrayed as a pilgrim, because of her journey to the Holy Land.

This crested mangabey was previously thought to just be a population of the grey-cheeked mangabey (L. albigena). Colin Groves upgraded the Ugandan population to the new species L. ugandae on 16 February 2007. This species is significantly smaller than the grey-cheeked mangabey, with a shorter skull and smaller face. 2008 was the most recent year in which the International Union for Conservation of Nature assessed the conservation status of L. albigena, describing it as being of least concern, and the status of L. ugandae has not been assessed separately. Taxonomy In 1978, Colin Groves recognized three subspecies of Lophocebus albigena, namely L. a. albigena; L. a. johnstoni; and L. a. osmani. Three decades later, in 2007, he raised these subspecies to full species rank on phylogenetic grounds, at the same time recognising that the mangabeys present in Uganda were sufficiently different from the remainder of L. albigena as to constitute a separate species, which he named L. ugandae. Description The Uganda mangabey comes to the ground to cross roads, forage and socialise. The Uganda mangabey is rather smaller than the grey-cheeked mangabey (L. albigena). It is less sexually dimorphic and has a smaller skull. Individuals from the east of Uganda have a yellowish-brown colour while those from the west are a slightly darker greyish-brown. The mane and breast are pale chocolate-brown and contrast more with the body colour than do the equivalent parts of the Johnston's mangabey (Lophocebus johnstoni). Distribution and habitat The Uganda mangabey is known from the forests on the north and northwestern sides of Lake Victoria, including the Mabira Forest, from which it was first described, the Bujuko Forest, the Bukasa Forest, and the vicinity of Sango Bay. It also occurs near Kibaale, to the east of the Albertine Rift Valley. It occurs in both primary and secondary forests, and is an arboreal species, spending most of its time in the upper canopy, where it forages for fruits and seeds; favoured food items include the fruits of the false nutmeg and of the breadfruit, the fruits and seeds of Erythrophleum spp., the fruits of the date palm and the fruits of the oil palm. Conservation One of the largest populations of Uganda mangabey is in the Mabira Central Forest Reserve. This protected area is being illegally logged and parts are being converted to agricultural use. Attempts are being made to habituate several groups of mangabey to the presence of humans with a view to increasing wildlife tourism in the area as a means to discourage habitat destruction and provide an extra source of income for the local community.

Production The film was shot in Champaign and Chicago, Illinois. Press Start is scored by American video game music composer Jake Kaufman. The two characters played by Daniel and Carlos Pesina in Press Start, Sasori and Lei-Gong, are pastiches of their respective characters in the original Mortal Kombat game, Scorpion and Raiden. A sequel, Press Start 2 Continue, was released in 2011. Focus Press Start focuses its parodic tone primarily toward the era of 8-bit and 16-bit video games, but references more modern games as well. Games parodied range from Donkey Kong to Halo. The film also satirizes all aspects of gaming, including collectible card games, Saturday morning cartoons, comic books, and trends of turning games into breakfast cereals. Synopsis Press Start tells the story of a suburban youth in a videogame world who discovers his adventurous, if berserk, destiny when he's recruited by an ill-tempered ninja and a tough-as-nails space soldier to save the world from a tyrannical, but comically insecure, sorcerer. Cast * Joshua Stafford as Zack Nimbus * Peter A. Davis as Count Nefarious Vile * Daniel Pesina as Sasori * Carlos Pesina as Lei Gong * Lauren Chambers as Sam * Al Morrison as Lin-Ku * J.W. Morrissette as Johnson * Andy Dallas as Shopkeeper * Michael Kleppin as G. Fourman * Ben McDuffee as Telegram Man * J.R. Thomas as Uncle Lou * Meagan Benz as Zippy (voice) * Jane F. Cox as Life Lady * Arin Hanson as Forest Guardian (voice) * Jennifer Zahn as Villager Bonus Levels/Adventures While in production and post-production, a series of web shorts called Press Start: Bonus Levels (known as Press Start Adventures following the movie's release) were released on the film's website and Newgrounds. The series was created and animated by screenwriter Kevin Folliard and produced by Press Start director Ed Glaser. The pilot episode was directed by Folliard, while the following episodes were directed by Glaser. Original music is composed by Jake Kaufman. They premiered on April 28, 2006. Since, there's been a new episode on the last Friday of every following month. The episodes feature numerous visual gags and video game parodies. The cartoons were created as a way to generate hype for the feature film by introducing people to the world, characters, and humor of Press Start. They are also noted by their lack of budget constraints allowing more artistic freedom to be taken with the action and effects than that seen in the feature film. Back story, inside jokes, and running gags are further flushed out in the animations than what could be used in the film. A number of notable videogame voice actors have guest starred in the series as well, including Mortal Kombat's John Turk (who took over the ninja roles portrayed by Pesina), and David Humphrey, the original voice of Shadow the Hedgehog. The animations take place before the events of the movie, similar to two made-for-DVD animated prequels: Van Helsing: The London Assignment and The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. The animations started out being nonlinear and do not progress after one another. Notably missing is the character of Zack Nimbus who, in terms of the film, has yet to be made aware of his destiny. However, on November 24, 2006 the shorts began a five-part miniseries which led directly into the feature film. The shorts have since been hosted on the comedy media website That Guy with the Glasses, continuing new episodes now taking place after the film's conclusion, now known as Press Start Adventures. Count Vile is now depicted as being in Hell, and the character Zack Nimbus appears, as well. Critical reception PC Gamer wrote that the film was \\"a surprisingly well-written parody of video game conventions\\". Movie Cynics makes note that if a filmmaker were to do everything possible to make a bad movie, Ed Glaser has succeeded and that Glaser has not only made a bad movie, but he has made an \\"awesomely bad movie...that pokes fun at video games.\\" And in its being so bad, the \\"end result was a film that is a quintessential awesomely bad movie that is full of videogame references and is fun from beginning to end.\\" Sequel In 2011, a direct-to-video sequel was made entitled Press Start 2 Continue, also produced and directed by Ed Glaser.

He started his senior career as Abbot of Dunfermline (1240‚Äì52), becoming Chancellor of Scotland later in the 1240s. He took a prominent role as a supporter of Alan Durward during the minority of Alexander III of Scotland, and appears to have lost the Chancellorship as result. Following his resignation of the abbacy of Dunfermline, he became a Cistercian monk at Newbattle Abbey while continuing a comparatively less active role on the wider stage. In 1269 he became Abbot of Melrose (1269‚Äì1273), Newbattle's mother house, and held this position for the last four years of his life. Dunfermline His name suggests he came from or was associated with Kinleith, in Currie parish, Midlothian.Tait & Reid \\"Kenleith , Robert (d. 1273)\\". Robert began his career as a Benedictine monk at Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, Scotland. After the death of Abbot Geoffrey III on 5 October 1240, he was chosen as the new Abbot of Dunfermline.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, 68. He became one of Dunfermline's most successful abbots and enjoyed a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. After a request was made by the king, on 3 May 1245, Pope Innocent IV wrote to Abbot Robert granting permission for the latter to use a mitre and a ring, a privilege which increased the abbey's status.Anderson, Early Sources, 518. Robert further elevated the abbey's status by successfully spearheading a campaign to canonise Saint Margaret of Scotland, a figure who had been claimed to be Dunfermline's founder and whose shrine lay in the town; the translation of her remains took place in June 1250.Laing, Andrew of Wyntoun, 2.250‚Äì51; Barrow, \\"Margaret [St Margaret] (d. 1093)\\". Such successes were undoubtedly helped by Robert's good relationship with the Pope. Robert was officially a Papal chaplain,Anderson, Early Sources, 563, n. 3. and, for instance, the Pope had charged Robert to assist in a dispute with the Bishop of St Andrews regarding a benefice that he wished to bestow on a Florentine follower. National politics Robert's career rise continued when, at an unknown point between 1247 and 1251, he became Chancellor of Scotland. He was on the Council of Guardians formed to govern Scotland after the death of Alexander II on 6 July 1249.Anderson, Early Sources, 583, n. 2. The governing Council broke down around two rival factions, one centred on Walter Comyn and the other around Alan Durward; Robert became a firm member of the Durward faction. The Comyn's later accused Robert of using his seal (the Great Seal of the Chancellor) and influence in an attempt to legitimise Durward's wife, a bastard daughter of Alexander II, an act which would have made Durward heir to the throne.Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, 34; Tait & Reid \\"Kenleith , Robert (d. 1273)\\". However, Robert's position became difficult when in 1251 the Walter Comyn gained control of the government.Alan Young, \\"Political Role of Walter Comyn\\", 136. In 1252 Robert lost the position of Chancellor. Robert the Cistercian In the same year Robert resigned his position as Abbot of Dunfermline and retired to be a Cistercian monk at Newbattle Abbey.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, 68; both Tait gives the year 1253, the following year, and Anderson says \\"before 13th February 1253\\": Tait & Reid \\"Kenleith , Robert (d. 1273)\\", Anderson, Early Sources, 661-2, n. 8 on page 661. Nevertheless, Robert did not cease to be active on the wider stage, and his relationship with Pope Innocent continued even as a humble monk of Newbattle.See, for example, Anderson, Early Sources, 572, n.4. In August and September 1260, Robert was used as a messenger between King Alexander III of Scotland and King Henry III of England.Anderson, Early Sources, 661-2, n. 8 on page 661. Moreover, by the end of the 1260s he rose again to the position of Abbot. After the resignation of John de Ederham, Robert was chosen to become Abbot of Melrose.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, 151. Melrose Abbey was the mother-house of Newbattle and the position of Abbot of Melrose was the senior Cistercian post in Scotland.Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, 20-67. Robert held the position for four years. He resigned and died in the year 1273.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, 151; Tait & Reid, \\"Kenleith , Robert (d. 1273)\\". He was probably buried in Melrose Abbey. NotesReferences * Anderson, Alan Orr, Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500‚Äì1286, 2 Vols, (Edinburgh, 1922), vol. 2 * Barrow, G. W.

During the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, Kargowa was one of the places of Polish resistance against Prussia and a defensive battle took place. In 1807 Kargowa became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw and in 1815 was annexed by Prussia for the second time. After Poland regained independence Kargowa was captured by Polish insurgents in 1919, however, the Treaty of Versailles granted the town to Germany.

Soft energy technologies may be seen as appropriate renewable technologies.The soft energy path Soft energy technologies are not simply renewable energy technologies, as there are many renewable energy technologies which are not regarded as \\"soft\\". The character string including \\"Soft Energy\\" is a registered trademark of Soft Energy Controls Inc. in Japan (JP (Japan), 28.12.2018, 6110341.).  Definition  More specifically, soft energy technologies have five defining characteristics.Lovins, 1977, pp.38-39 They rely on renewable energy resources, are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances, are flexible and relatively simple to understand, are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale, and are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality. An energy technology must satisfy all five of these criteria to be soft. Residential solar energy technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, energy conserving, residential solar energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy. Active residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun's rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply. Passive residential solar technologies involve the natural transfer (by radiation, convection and conduction) of solar energy without the use of mechanical (active) devices.  Sociological definition  The term soft is not meant to be vague, speculative, or ephemeral, but rather sustainable, flexible, resilient, and benign.see Lovins, 1977, p.38 Soft technology impacts are generally seen to be more \\"gentle, pleasant and manageable\\" than high technology impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.see Lovins, 1977 More specifically, favourable socio-political impacts include:Morrison & Lodwick, 1981 * reduction in social conflicts and inequalities; * reduction in population concentration; * increase in employment, especially for the lower social classes; * increase in the satisfaction of basic human needs; * increase in consumer self-sufficiency; and * increase in social participation and democratic processes. The use of soft energy technologies, in conjunction with energy efficiency, and the transitional use of fossil fuel technology, comprise the soft energy path.

Early life  Born at Greatham, near Hartlepool, his mother Hannah died when he was four. After his father, Christopher (b. 1807 at Greatham), died of cholera when Wilson was ten, he worked in the mines, spent four years as a merchant seaman, and return to Durham as a miner in 1860. Married in 1832 to Margaret (n√©e Firth), the couple emigrated to the United States in 1864, where Wilson worked the mines in Pennsylvania and Illinois. They returned to Durham in 1867; the first two of their five children had been born in America. Wilson was one of the founders in 1869 of the Durham Miners' Association (DMA), which led to him being denied employment, but in 1878 he became a full-time union organiser, rising to become the DMA's general secretary in 1896.  Political career  The Reform Act 1867 had extended the vote to working-class men in urban areas, allowing the election in 1874 of Thomas Burt and Alexander Macdonald as Liberal‚ÄìLabour Members of Parliament (MPs). The Representation of the People Act 1884 extended the same qualifications to the county constituencies, enfranchising many miners for the first time. Wilson was elected at the 1885 general election as Liberal‚ÄìLabour MP for the new Houghton-le-Spring constituency, but lost his seat when the Liberal Party split at the 1886 general election over Irish Home Rule. He returned to House of Commons in 1890, at a by-election for the Mid Durham constituency following the death of William Crawford, a Liberal-Labour MP who was also Secretary of the Durham Miners' Association. In Parliament, Wilson impressed as an effective speaker. However, he followed a different political path to many of his mining colleagues. The Liberal‚ÄìLabour movement had consisted of local electoral pacts between trades unions and the Liberal Party, whereby trade union-sponsored MPs (who received no salary) were politically allied to the Liberal Party, but the movement declined after 1885. The formation in 1893 of the socialist Independent Labour Party was followed in 1900 by the Labour Representation Committee, which in 1906 changed its name to the Labour Party. The Labour movement no longer depended on the Liberal Party, and the alliance was formally broken when the MPs sponsored by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain joined the Labour Party before the January 1910 general election. However, some MPs, including Wilson did not join the Labour Party. A primitive methodist, he was a Liberal by conviction rather than by convenience, an admirer of Gladstone who believed in free trade when much of the rest of the Labour movement was following a socialist path.

Career Originally signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1993 as an undrafted free agent, P√©rez never got higher than High-A ball in their organization, although he did display good speed, stealing 17 or more bases three times in the five seasons he was in the Tigers' organization. On November 20, 1997, P√©rez was traded by Detroit along with Rick Greene and Mike Myers to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Bryce Florie. P√©rez started off in Double-A baseball in 1998, but by the end of the season he had seen some time in Triple-A. He remained at the Triple-A level until June 3, 2000, which is when he made his big league debut at the age of 24. He went 0-for-2 in his first game, and he started his career off collecting only two hits in his first 11 at-bats. He collected his first hit off of Valerio de los Santos. His season would not improve much after his poor start, in fact, it would basically stay the same. He ended up hitting .173 in the 52 at-bats that made up his first season. He was however 100% successful in the stolen base category, stealing four bases in four attempts. In the 2000‚Äì2001 offseason, the Brewers sent P√©rez with a player to be named later to the San Diego Padres for Brandon Kolb and a player to be named later. The two players to be named would end up being Will Cunnane from the Padres and minor leaguer Chad Green from the Brewers. Although P√©rez was with a new team, his luck did not improve much. He played 43 games with the Padres in 2001, coming to the plate 81 times. Overall, he collected 16 hits for a .198 batting average in 2001-a slight improvement over the previous season, but still a poor average. July 1, 2001, would end up being P√©rez's last game in the majors. He collected a walk in his only plate appearance in that game. Although his big league career was over, his professional career was not. In fact, he was bouncing around the minor leagues as recently as 2005, and in 28 games with Double-A Frisco in 2004, he hit .387. His career batting statistics were not stellar, as he hit .188 with no home runs and six RBI in 133 career at-bats. Yet he was still a valuable asset due to his defensive versatility. Not only did he play in all three outfield spots in his career, he also spent time at shortstop and second base. His career fielding percentage was .926. He wore two numbers in his career, 1 and 57.

The EnKF originated as a version of the Kalman filter for large problems (essentially, the covariance matrix is replaced by the sample covariance), and it is now an important data assimilation component of ensemble forecasting. EnKF is related to the particle filter (in this context, a particle is the same thing as ensemble member) but the EnKF makes the assumption that all probability distributions involved are Gaussian; when it is applicable, it is much more efficient than the particle filter. Introduction The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo implementation of the Bayesian update problem: given a probability density function (pdf) of the state of the modeled system (the prior, called often the forecast in geosciences) and the data likelihood, Bayes' theorem is used to obtain the pdf after the data likelihood has been taken into account (the posterior, often called the analysis). This is called a Bayesian update. The Bayesian update is combined with advancing the model in time, incorporating new data from time to time. The original Kalman filter, introduced in 1960, assumes that all pdfs are Gaussian (the Gaussian assumption) and provides algebraic formulas for the change of the mean and the covariance matrix by the Bayesian update, as well as a formula for advancing the covariance matrix in time provided the system is linear. However, maintaining the covariance matrix is not feasible computationally for high- dimensional systems. For this reason, EnKFs were developed. EnKFs represent the distribution of the system state using a collection of state vectors, called an ensemble, and replace the covariance matrix by the sample covariance computed from the ensemble. The ensemble is operated with as if it were a random sample, but the ensemble members are really not independent ‚Äì the EnKF ties them together. One advantage of EnKFs is that advancing the pdf in time is achieved by simply advancing each member of the ensemble.For a survey of EnKF and related data assimilation techniques, see Derivation=Kalman filter Let us review first the Kalman filter. Let \\\\mathbf{x} denote the n-dimensional state vector of a model, and assume that it has Gaussian probability distribution with mean \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu} and covariance Q, i.e., its pdf is : p(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\propto\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu })^{\\\\mathrm{T}}Q^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu})\\\\right) . Here and below, \\\\propto means proportional; a pdf is always scaled so that its integral over the whole space is one. This p(\\\\mathbf{x}), called the prior, was evolved in time by running the model and now is to be updated to account for new data. It is natural to assume that the error distribution of the data is known; data have to come with an error estimate, otherwise they are meaningless. Here, the data \\\\mathbf{d} is assumed to have Gaussian pdf with covariance R and mean H\\\\mathbf{x}, where H is the so-called observation matrix. The covariance matrix R describes the estimate of the error of the data; if the random errors in the entries of the data vector \\\\mathbf{d} are independent, R is diagonal and its diagonal entries are the squares of the standard deviation (‚Äúerror size‚Äù) of the error of the corresponding entries of the data vector \\\\mathbf{d}. The value H\\\\mathbf{x} is what the value of the data would be for the state \\\\mathbf{x} in the absence of data errors. Then the probability density p(\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\mathbf{x}) of the data \\\\mathbf{d} conditional of the system state \\\\mathbf{x}, called the data likelihood, is : p\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{d}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) \\\\propto\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{d}-H\\\\mathbf{x})^{\\\\mathrm{T}}R^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{d}-H\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right) . The pdf of the state and the data likelihood are combined to give the new probability density of the system state \\\\mathbf{x} conditional on the value of the data \\\\mathbf{d} (the posterior) by the Bayes theorem, : p\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\right) \\\\propto p\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{d}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) p(\\\\mathbf{x}). The data \\\\mathbf{d} is fixed once it is received, so denote the posterior state by \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} instead of \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mathbf{d} and the posterior pdf by p\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}\\\\right) . It can be shown by algebraic manipulations that the posterior pdf is also Gaussian, : p\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}\\\\right) \\\\propto\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}})^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\hat{Q}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}})\\\\right) , with the posterior mean \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}} and covariance \\\\hat{Q} given by the Kalman update formulas : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}+K\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{d}-H\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}\\\\right) ,\\\\quad\\\\hat{Q}=\\\\left( I-KH\\\\right) Q, where : K=QH^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\left( HQH^{\\\\mathrm{T}}+R\\\\right) ^{-1} is the so-called Kalman gain matrix. Ensemble Kalman Filter The EnKF is a Monte Carlo approximation of the Kalman filter, which avoids evolving the covariance matrix of the pdf of the state vector \\\\mathbf{x}. Instead, the pdf is represented by an ensemble : X=\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{x}_{N}\\\\right] =\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\\\right]. X is an n\\\\times N matrix whose columns are the ensemble members, and it is called the prior ensemble. Ideally, ensemble members would form a sample from the prior distribution. However, the ensemble members are not in general independent except in the initial ensemble, since every EnKF step ties them together. They are deemed to be approximately independent, and all calculations proceed as if they actually were independent. Replicate the data \\\\mathbf{d} into an m\\\\times N matrix : D=\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{d}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{d}_{N}\\\\right] =\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{d}_{i}\\\\right], \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{d}_{i}=\\\\mathbf{d}+\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon_{i}}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon_{i}} ~ N(0,R), so that each column \\\\mathbf{d}_{i} consists of the data vector \\\\mathbf{d} plus a random vector from the m-dimensional normal distribution N(0,R). If, in addition, the columns of X are a sample from the prior probability distribution, then the columns of : \\\\hat{X}=X+K(D-HX) form a sample from the posterior probability distribution. To see this in the scalar case with H=1: Let x_i = \\\\mu + \\\\xi_i, \\\\; \\\\xi_i \\\\sim N(0, \\\\sigma_x^2), and d_i = d + \\\\epsilon_i, \\\\; \\\\epsilon_i \\\\sim N(0, \\\\sigma_d^2). Then :\\\\hat{x}_i = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_x^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2} \\\\mu + \\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_d^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2} d \\\\right)+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_x^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2} \\\\xi_i + \\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_d^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2} \\\\epsilon_i \\\\right) . The first sum is the posterior mean, and the second sum, in view of the independence, has a variance :\\\\left(\\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_x^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\sigma_x^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1/\\\\sigma_d^2}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\sigma_d^2 = \\\\frac{1}{1/\\\\sigma_x^2 + 1/\\\\sigma_d^2}, which is the posterior variance. The EnKF is now obtained simply by replacing the state covariance Q in Kalman gain matrix K by the sample covariance C computed from the ensemble members (called the ensemble covariance), that is: K=CH^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\left( HCH^{\\\\mathrm{T}}+R\\\\right) ^{-1} Implementation=Basic formulation Here we follow. Suppose the ensemble matrix X and the data matrix D are as above. The ensemble mean and the covariance are : E\\\\left( X\\\\right) =\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\\\mathbf{x}_{k},\\\\quad C=\\\\frac{AA^{T}}{N-1}, where : A=X-E\\\\left( X\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_{1\\\\times N} =X-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\left( X\\\\mathbf{e}_{N\\\\times1}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_{1\\\\times N}, and \\\\mathbf{e} denotes the matrix of all ones of the indicated size. The posterior ensemble X^{p} is then given by : X^{p}=X+CH^{T}\\\\left( HCH^{T}+R\\\\right) ^{-1}(D-HX), where the perturbed data matrix D is as above. Note that since R is a covariance matrix, it is always positive semidefinite and usually positive definite, so the inverse above exists and the formula can be implemented by the Cholesky decomposition. In, R is replaced by the sample covariance \\\\tilde{D} \\\\tilde{D}^{T}/\\\\left( N-1\\\\right) where \\\\tilde{D} = D - \\\\frac{1}{N} d \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}_{1\\\\times N}and the inverse is replaced by a pseudoinverse, computed using the singular-value decomposition (SVD) . Since these formulas are matrix operations with dominant Level 3 operations, they are suitable for efficient implementation using software packages such as LAPACK (on serial and shared memory computers) and ScaLAPACK (on distributed memory computers). Instead of computing the inverse of a matrix and multiplying by it, it is much better (several times cheaper and also more accurate) to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the matrix and treat the multiplication by the inverse as solution of a linear system with many simultaneous right-hand sides. Observation matrix-free implementation Since we have replaced the covariance matrix with ensemble covariance, this leads to a simpler formula where ensemble observations are directly used without explicitly specifying the matrix H. More specifically, define a function h(\\\\mathbf{x}) of the form : h(\\\\mathbf{x})=H\\\\mathbf{x}. The function h is called the observation function or, in the inverse problems context, the forward operator. The value of h(\\\\mathbf{x}) is what the value of the data would be for the state \\\\mathbf{x} assuming the measurement is exact. Then the posterior ensemble can be rewritten as : X^{p}=X+\\\\frac{1}{N-1}A\\\\left( HA\\\\right) ^{T}P^{-1}(D-HX) where : HA=HX-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\left( \\\\left( HX\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_{N\\\\times1}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_{1\\\\times N}, and : P=\\\\frac{1}{N-1}HA\\\\left( HA\\\\right) ^{T}+R, with :\\\\left[ HA\\\\right] _{i} =H\\\\mathbf{x}_{i}-H\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\\\ =h\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\\\right) -\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}h\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\\\right) . Consequently, the ensemble update can be computed by evaluating the observation function h on each ensemble member once and the matrix H does not need to be known explicitly. This formula holds also for an observation function h(\\\\mathbf{x})=H\\\\mathbf{x+f} with a fixed offset \\\\mathbf{f}, which also does not need to be known explicitly. The above formula has been commonly used for a nonlinear observation function h, such as the position of a hurricane vortex. In that case, the observation function is essentially approximated by a linear function from its values at ensemble members. Implementation for a large number of data points For a large number m of data points, the multiplication by P^{-1} becomes a bottleneck. The following alternative formula is advantageous when the number of data points m is large (such as when assimilating gridded or pixel data) and the data error covariance matrix R is diagonal (which is the case when the data errors are uncorrelated), or cheap to decompose (such as banded due to limited covariance distance). Using the Sherman‚ÄìMorrison‚ÄìWoodbury formula : (R+UV^{T})^{-1}=R^{-1}-R^{-1}U(I+V^{T}R^{-1}U)^{-1}V^{T}R^{-1}, with : U=\\\\frac{1}{N-1}HA,\\\\quad V=HA, gives :\\\\begin{align} P^{-1} & =\\\\left( R+\\\\frac{1}{N-1}HA\\\\left( HA\\\\right) ^{T}\\\\right) ^{-1}\\\\ = \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =R^{-1}\\\\left[ I-\\\\frac{1}{N-1}\\\\left( HA\\\\right) \\\\left( I+\\\\left( HA\\\\right) ^{T}R^{-1}\\\\frac{1}{N-1}\\\\left( HA\\\\right) \\\\right) ^{-1}\\\\left( HA\\\\right) ^{T}R^{-1}\\\\right] , \\\\end{align} which requires only the solution of systems with the matrix R (assumed to be cheap) and of a system of size N with m right-hand sides. See for operation counts. Further extensions The EnKF version described here involves randomization of data. For filters without randomization of data, see. Since the ensemble covariance is rank deficient (there are many more state variables, typically millions, than the ensemble members, typically less than a hundred), it has large terms for pairs of points that are spatially distant. Since in reality the values of physical fields at distant locations are not that much correlated, the covariance matrix is tapered off artificially based on the distance, which gives rise to localized EnKF algorithms. These methods modify the covariance matrix used in the computations and, consequently, the posterior ensemble is no longer made only of linear combinations of the prior ensemble. For nonlinear problems, EnKF can create posterior ensemble with non-physical states. This can be alleviated by regularization, such as penalization of states with large spatial gradients. For problems with coherent features, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, firelines, squall lines, and rain fronts, there is a need to adjust the numerical model state by deforming the state in space (its grid) as well as by correcting the state amplitudes additively. In 2007, Ravela et al. introduce the joint position-amplitude adjustment model using ensembles, and systematically derive a sequential approximation which can be applied to both EnKF and other formulations. Their method does not make the assumption that amplitudes and position errors are independent or jointly Gaussian, as others do. The morphing EnKF employs intermediate states, obtained by techniques borrowed from image registration and morphing, instead of linear combinations of states. EnKFs rely on the Gaussian assumption, although they in practice are used for nonlinear problems, where the Gaussian assumption may not be satisfied. Related filters attempting to relax the Gaussian assumption in EnKF while preserving its advantages include filters that fit the state pdf with multiple Gaussian kernels, filters that approximate the state pdf by Gaussian mixtures, a variant of the particle filter with computation of particle weights by density estimation, and a variant of the particle filter with thick tailed data pdf to alleviate particle filter degeneracy.

Emery was the last mayor of the city of Washington, D.C.; the current office of Mayor of the District of Columbia has a different geographic jurisdiction. Born in Pembroke, New Hampshire, Emery moved to Baltimore, Maryland at the age of 19 (in 1837) and began apprenticing as an architect and builder. Three years later, he moved to Washington in hopes of gaining U.S. government contracts to construct Federal buildings. Over the next decade, Emery would cut and lay stones for, among others, the U.S. Treasury; the Navy Department; the U.S. Patent Office; repair work for the White House; and, most prestigiously, the cornerstone of the Washington Monument, which Emery cut, prepared, and laid in 1848. Emery served as a Washington Alderman from 1855 to 1857. Joining the newly formed Republican Party, he then acted as a marshal at the 1860 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. Elected again as an Alderman in 1869, friends and colleagues encouraged Emery to run the following year against the incumbent mayor Sayles J. Bowen, whose financial negligence had crippled the city with debt and with whom Emery had publicly feuded. Although both Bowen and Emery were Republicans, Bowen had been disowned by the city's chapter of the party, which actually ran Emery on the \\"Reform\\" ticket -- a ticket that Democrats endorsed rather than risk Bowen's reelection by splitting the vote again with their own candidate. Emery won the election by over 3000 votes. Emery's term was extremely short -- only 11 months -- but during that term, he oversaw the beginning of the largest construction projects ever seen in Washington up to that time. Of particular note within those projects were the paving and grading of 132 streets in the city. He also authorized the construction of a seawall along the Anacostia River and the easternmost section of the Potomac. After the city government was abolished in favor of the territorial government in June 1871, Emery remained a steadfast advocate for home rule in the District of Columbia, as well as for Congressional representation. He purchased the Washington home of William Tecumseh Sherman when the Civil War hero moved to St. Louis, dying there on October 12, 1901, at the age of 83. He was interred in Washington's Rock Creek Cemetery. Matthew G. Emery Elementary School, now Emery Education Campus, in Washington, DC was named for him.

Plot summary Nancy is on a student tour of Austria with Emerson college. After an attempted theft, the tour leader, professor Raymond Bagley, tells Nancy of his secret mission: to smuggle ten children aged six to thirteen out of an Iron Curtain country to relatives in England, France, and the United States. Another Emerson student, Eric Nagy, who had been paralyzed by an accident and uses a wheelchair, is also in on the mission as his thirteen-year-old cousin is one of the children. Upon arriving in Salzburg, the large group finds that their hotel reservations have been canceled. An obnoxious man named Herr Gutterman offer reservations at another hotel for a large group that had canceled. Grudgingly, the professor accepts the offer as there is no other alternative. At the hotel, Nancy is now able to focus on an assignment given to her by her father. A famous film director named Kurt Kessler created a devastating political film about the oppression of human rights in his home country in Eastern Europe. However, the film was stolen and the studio with the negative burned down, so the stolen film is the only copy of Kessler's Captive Witness. Kurt Kessler had hoped to enter the film in a film contest in five days, and unless Nancy can find his film, he will not be able to show the world his important work. Nancy thinks that the stolen film is in Vienna, which the tour will not reach for another few days, so she convinces her boyfriend Ned Nickerson to drive with her to Vienna. Because no rental cars are available, Nancy convinces Herr Gutterman to take her and Ned in his car. As soon as they leave, however, Nancy realizes that she and Ned are being kidnapped by Herr Gutterman, who is the person who tried to steal Professor Bagley's luggage. Herr Gutterman and his chauffeur, Herr Burger, drive Nancy and Ned high into the Alps. Herr Burger is not a cautious driver, and the car almost goes over the edge of a cliff. Later, Gutterman and Burger drive up to a small cabin high in the Alps. They question Nancy, but she quickly escapes and steals their car. The car is amphibious, and she and Ned drive into a river that turns into a waterfall. They make it safely to Vienna. After an attempt to find the film fails, Nancy goes with Gutterman and sees half of Captive Witness. She returns to the hotel to meet Ned, and later the rest of the tour arrives. While they are eating lunch, a man tells Professor Bagley that he has a message for him regarding the children. But before he can say anything, he has a heart attack. While being lifted into the ambulance, the man keeps looking at Eric as if trying to say something. Nancy has a sudden idea and takes apart Eric's wheelchair, where she finds an envelope containing information on where to bring the children across the border. Then, she meets Emile Popov, who asks for help in the rescue mission as two of the couples who planned to help the operation have been arrested and the refugee organization does not have anyone it can spare. Eric reveals that he can actually walk, and Nancy then devises a daring plan. She send her friends on a decoy mission the throw Gutterman off the trail, and she and Eric successfully rescue the children with the help of Emile Popov and his wife. She then finds the stolen film, Captive Witness . It is shown at the film festival and wins first prize. Background Captive Witness was ghostwritten by Richard Ballard. Due to its primary plot of pre-Glasnost international intrigue, many have theorized the title was originally written to be a part of The Hardy Boys series. In 2005, Simon & Schuster allowed Captive Witness and the seven titles before it to be republished by Grosset & Dunlap in hardcover \\"glossy flashlight\\" format for the first time. The reasoning behind it was for the 75th anniversary of the Nancy Drew character, and the 100th anniversary of the Stratemeyer Syndicate.  Characters  Nancy Drew Ned Nickerson: Nancy's boyfriend Professor Raymond Bagley: leader of the Emerson tour of Austria, who is using the tour as a cover for his secret mission to rescue ten orphans Eric Nagy: Emerson student involved in the mission to save the ten children Herr Adolph Gutterman: Obnoxious villain who wants to foil the rescue mission and have Kurt Kessler surrender George Fayne: Nancy's best friend Bess Marvin: Nancy's best friend and George's first cousin Burt Eddleton: George's boyfriend and Emerson college student who helps in the rescue mission Dave Evans: Bess's boyfriend and Emerson college student who helps in the rescue mission Emile Popov: A man who helps Nancy and Eric in the rescue mission Kurt Kessler: a film director from River Heights but originally from an Iron Curtain country. He created the film Captive Witness about his homeland Herr Burger: Herr Gutterman's chauffeur who almost drives their car over a cliff  Artwork  The original edition featured cover art by Ruth Sanderson and six internal illustrations by Paul Frame. It was published under the Wanderer imprint of Simon and Schuster. It was later republished under both Wanderer (1986, cover art by Hector Garrido) and Minstrel (1990) printings with a new cover each time. These two later printings did not include the internal illustrations. Scholastic also released the book in 1981 under the title \\"The Captive Witness Mystery\\", with different cover art. Adaptation  The 24th installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive, named Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse, is loosely based on the novel.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 14A in Penn Yan to a junction with the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 just east of the Canandaigua city limits. NY 364 follows a predominantly east-west alignment from Penn Yan to Middlesex and a north‚Äìsouth routing from Middlesex to Canandaigua, resulting in an L-shaped alignment. As a result, the route is posted as north‚Äìsouth north of Middlesex and east‚Äìwest east of the hamlet. In the Canandaigua area, the road serves as a connector between US 20 and NY 5, Finger Lakes Community College, and the eastern shore of Canandaigua Lake. The origins of NY 364 date back to the 1920s when the Middlesex‚ÄìPotter segment was briefly part of NY 52, the predecessor to today's NY 245\\\\. NY 364 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but initially went no farther west than Middlesex. North of Middlesex, what is now NY 364 was unnumbered south of North Vine Valley Road and part of New York State Route 21A from there to Canandaigua. NY 364 was extended north to meet NY 21A by the following year. NY 21A was eliminated and partially replaced with an extended NY 364 in the early 1940s. Route description=Penn Yan to Middlesex NY 364 begins at a four-way intersection with NY 14A (Liberty Street) in the northern portion of the village of Penn Yan in Yates County. The route heads west as Maple Avenue, passing north of the Penn Yan Central School District's campus before leaving the village for more rural areas of the town of Benton. NY 364 crosses open farmland and rapidly ascends in elevation as it travels northwestward out of the valley surrounding Keuka Lake. After ascending in roughly , the route begins to level off as it heads toward the town of Potter. In Potter, NY 364 turns to face due west, taking on a linear east-west alignment for most of its first in the town. At the end of the stretch, the road descends approximately into another valley containing Flint and Nettle Valley Creeks, both of which flow into a large marsh known as Potter Swamp. Upon crossing Nettle Valley Creek, NY 364 deviates from its east-west alignment and turns to the northwest, with the east-west road continuing as Italy Valley Road. Here, NY 364 runs along the side of the valley for , ascending to before returning to an elevation of as it crosses Flint Creek and enters the small hamlet of Potter. The road turns to run north-south through the community before turning back to the west north of the hamlet. Outside of Potter, NY 364 runs parallel to a small creek, occupying the base of a small, heavily forested valley created by the waterway. from the hamlet, NY 364 meets the southern terminus of NY 247. Due to the terrain surrounding NY 364, NY 247 runs parallel to NY 364 for a short distance as it ascends out of the valley. NY 364 at the split from NY 245 in Middlesex The route follows the isolated valley west into the town of Middlesex, where it ends near an intersection with Roach Road from the town line. Past this point, NY 364 curves to the southwest, descending roughly into another valley created by the West River as it approaches the hamlet of Middlesex on East Avenue. At the foot of the valley in Middlesex, NY 364 intersects NY 245\\\\. The two routes overlap for one block to the center of the hamlet, at which point NY 364 leaves NY 245 on Water Street. At the southern terminus of the concurrency, NY 364 shifts from an east-west route to a north-south roadway. Middlesex to Canandaigua After departing NY 245, NY 364 proceeds to the northwest as Water Street, crossing the West River and passing through the remainder of the hamlet before abruptly turning to the north at an intersection with West Avenue on the western edge of Middlesex. NY 364, now named Maple Avenue, ascends the western edge of the valley, climbing to exit the West River valley and the hamlet of Middlesex. North of the valley, the route traverses less populated areas primarily consisting of farmland. About from the hamlet, NY 364 meets North Vine Valley Road, the first of a number of roads linking NY 364 to East Lake Road, a local roadway running parallel to the eastern edge of Canandaigua Lake. North of the intersection, NY 364 turns to the northeast, running parallel to the lake as it crosses into Ontario County. NY 364 southbound at CR 18 in the town of Canandaigua Now in the town of Gorham, East Lake Road becomes County Road 11 (CR 11). Over the next , NY 364 and CR 11 slowly converge, with the two finally meeting at a junction just from the shore of Canandaigua Lake. At this point, NY 364 takes on the East Lake Road name as it becomes the westernmost roadway on Canandaigua Lake's eastern edge. Here, the surroundings around NY 364 change substantially as the route serves a number of seaside homes and communities. North of the intersection, NY 364 heads through the hamlet of Cottage City before intersecting CR 1 north of the community. The roadway continues north into the town of Canandaigua, with the surroundings initially remaining similar to those in Gorham. from the town line, NY 364 separates from Canandaigua Lake, taking a more eastern approach toward the city of Canandaigua. Farther north, East Lake Road meets Lincoln Hill Road (CR 18), the first of two roads connecting NY 364 to the adjacent Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC). East Lake Road continues onward, passing the Canandaigua Country Club before intersecting Lake Shore Drive, the second roadway leading to FLCC, a half-mile north of CR 18. Past Lake Shore Drive, NY 364 enters a much more commercialized area as it approaches Eastern Boulevard (US 20 and NY 5), the city of Canandaigua's main east‚Äìwest commercial strip. It passes one large shopping plaza before terminating opposite another at a junction with US 20 and NY 5. History The portion of modern NY 364 southeast of North Vine Valley Road at Overacker Corners in Middlesex was state-maintained as early as 1926. In the mid-1920s, the segment connecting the hamlets of Middlesex and Potter was designated as part of NY 52, which continued south from Middlesex on what is now NY 245 and north from Potter on current NY 247. This designation was short-lived, however, as NY 52 was realigned in the late 1920s to follow modern NY 245 between Middlesex and Rushville. The former routing of NY 52 from Middlesex to Potter remained unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, as did the remainder of what is now NY 364. In the 1930 renumbering, the segment of modern NY 364 from North Vine Valley Road to Lake Shore Drive (then part of US 20 and NY 5) near Canandaigua was designated as part of NY 21A, an alternate route of NY 21 between the South Bristol hamlet of Woodville and Canandaigua. Between Woodville and Overacker Corners, NY 21A was routed on North Vine Valley Road, South Lake Road, and an unknown road leading south from Vine Valley to Woodville. Also assigned at this time was NY 364, which initially began at NY 245 in Middlesex and ended in Penn Yan.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering NY 364 was extended northward from Middlesex by the following year to meet NY 21A east of Vine Valley. NY 21A was truncated northward to Vine Valley , separating the route from its parent. The NY 21A designation was eliminated in the early 1940s, at which time the portion of NY 21A's former routing north of Overacker Corners became part of an extended NY 364. The former spur of NY 21A to Vine Valley is now maintained by Yates County as part of CR 10. In the mid-1950s, a new four- lane roadway, Eastern Boulevard, was built north of Lake Shore Drive between South Main Street and the modern-day intersection of Lake Shore and Eastern Boulevard in Hopewell. US 20 and NY 5 were realigned onto the new road while NY 364 was extended north on a newly constructed portion of East Lake Road to meet the bypass.

It was proved in the 1950s in independent works by the mathematicians Emil Artin and David Rees; Here: Lemma 1 Here: Sect.7, Lemma 7.2, p.10 a special case was known to Oscar Zariski prior to their work. One consequence of the lemma is the Krull intersection theorem. The result is also used to prove the exactness property of completion . The lemma also plays a key role in the study of ‚Ñì-adic sheaves. Statement  Let I be an ideal in a Noetherian ring R; let M be a finitely generated R-module and let N a submodule of M. Then there exists an integer k ‚â• 1 so that, for n ‚â• k, :I^{n} M \\\\cap N = I^{n - k} ((I^{k} M) \\\\cap N).  Proof  The lemma immediately follows from the fact that R is Noetherian once necessary notions and notations are set up. For any ring R and an ideal I in R, we set B_I R = \\\\textstyle\\\\bigoplus_{n=0}^\\\\infty I^n (B for blow-up.) We say a decreasing sequence of submodules M = M_0 \\\\supset M_1 \\\\supset M_2 \\\\supset \\\\cdots is an I-filtration if I M_n \\\\subset M_{n+1}; moreover, it is stable if I M_n = M_{n+1} for sufficiently large n. If M is given an I-filtration, we set B_I M = \\\\textstyle\\\\bigoplus_{n=0}^\\\\infty M_n; it is a graded module over B_I R. Now, let M be a R-module with the I-filtration M_i by finitely generated R-modules. We make an observation :B_I M is a finitely generated module over B_I R if and only if the filtration is I-stable. Indeed, if the filtration is I-stable, then B_I M is generated by the first k+1 terms M_0, \\\\dots, M_k and those terms are finitely generated; thus, B_I M is finitely generated. Conversely, if it is finitely generated, say, by some homogeneous elements in \\\\textstyle\\\\bigoplus_{j=0}^k M_j, then, for n \\\\ge k, each f in M_n can be written as :f = \\\\sum a_{j} g_{j}, \\\\quad a_{j} \\\\in I^{n-j} with the generators g_{j} in M_j, j \\\\le k. That is, f \\\\in I^{n-k} M_k. We can now prove the lemma, assuming R is Noetherian. Let M_n = I^n M. Then M_n are an I-stable filtration. Thus, by the observation, B_I M is finitely generated over B_I R. But B_I R \\\\simeq R[It] is a Noetherian ring since R is. (The ring R[It] is called the Rees algebra.) Thus, B_I M is a Noetherian module and any submodule is finitely generated over B_I R; in particular, B_I N is finitely generated when N is given the induced filtration; i.e., N_n = M_n \\\\cap N. Then the induced filtration is I-stable again by the observation.  Krull's intersection theorem  Besides the use in completion of a ring, a typical application of the lemma is the proof of the Krull's intersection theorem, which says: \\\\textstyle\\\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\\\infty I^n = 0 for a proper ideal I in a commutative Noetherian ring that is either a local ring or an integral domain. By the lemma applied to the intersection N, we find k such that for n \\\\ge k, ::I^{n} \\\\cap N = I^{n - k} (I^{k} \\\\cap N). But then N = IN. Thus, if A is local, N = 0 by Nakayama's lemma. If A is an integral domain, then one uses the determinant trick (that is a variant of the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem and yields Nakayama's lemma): :Theorem Let u be an endomorphism of an A-module N generated by n elements and I an ideal of A such that u(N) \\\\subset IN. Then there is a relation: ::u^n + a_1 u^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_{n-1} u + a_n = 0, \\\\, a_i \\\\in I^i. In the setup here, take u to be the identity operator on N; that will yield a nonzero element x in A such that x N = 0, which implies N = 0. For both a local ring and an integral domain, the \\"Noetherian\\" cannot be dropped from the assumption: for the local ring case, see local ring#Commutative case. For the integral domain case, take A to be the ring of algebraic integers (i.e., the integral closure of \\\\mathbb{Z} in \\\\mathbb{C}). If \\\\mathfrak p is a prime ideal of A, then we have: \\\\mathfrak{p}^n = \\\\mathfrak{p} for every integer n > 0. Indeed, if y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak p, then y = \\\\alpha^n for some complex number \\\\alpha. Now, \\\\alpha is integral over \\\\mathbb{Z}; thus in A and then in \\\\mathfrak{p}, proving the claim.

It was performed at Shrovetide, 22 February 1631, with costumes, sets and stage effects designed by Inigo Jones. The masque Chloridia was the second of a duet of 1631 royal masques, the first being Love's Triumph Through Callipolis, which had been staged six weeks earlier, on 9 January. In the first work, King Charles I danced; in the second, Queen Henrietta Maria starred with her ladies in waiting. Both masques dealt with the theme of Platonic love, a concept dear to the Queen's heart. Chloridia depends on rich imagery of nature, greenery, and the seasons, with figures like Zephyrus, Juno, and Iris, along with naiads and personifications of \\"Poesy, History, Architecture, and Sculpture.\\" The anti-masque features dwarfs and macabre figures emerged from Hell; one of the dancers was the dwarf Jeffrey Hudson, the Queen's page and jester. The masque was as rich in spectacle as Jones's masques normally were: characters appear in clouds (a \\"bright cloud\\" and a \\"purplish cloud\\") floating in the air. The rivals The end of Jonson's career as a masquer for the Court, however, was due not to ill health but to a clash of personalities.Leapman, pp. 246-54. Jonson and Jones had been partners in the creation of masques for the Stuart Court since The Masque of Blackness in 1605; but Jonson had long nourished a resentment against Jones, feeling that the architect took and received too much credit for the success of their joint projects. The poet expressed his resentment with thinly veiled ridicule of Jones in his works, starting at least as early as Bartholomew Fair in 1614 -- the character Lanthorn Leatherhead in that play being a mockery of Jones.See also: A Tale of a Tub; Love's Welcome at Bolsover. Since Jonson arranged for the publication of the texts of his masques, his name always preceded Jones's in these volumes; but when Choridia was published together with Callipolis, in a 1631 quarto issued by the bookseller Thomas Walkley,The 1631 quarto was dated \\"1630,\\" since prior to 1751 the English began the New Year on 25 March, not 1 January. See: Old Style and New Style dates. Jones's name was omitted entirely. This was an insult that the very well-connected Jones was not prepared to swallow; he used his powerful Court connections to ensure that Jonson was never invited to write another masque for the Stuart Court. (Jonson's final two masques, The King's Entertainment at Welbeck and Love's Welcome at Bolsover of 1633 and 1634, were written for William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle.) When Chloridia was reprinted in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641 (four years after Jonson's death), Jones was appropriately credited. NotesReferences * Leapman, Michael.

Biography Dante Marioni grew up among many artistic influences. His father, Paul Marioni, was involved in the American studio glass movement and, as a result, Dante was constantly exposed to the glassblowing artists of the San Francisco Bay Area. His uncles are artists, Tom Marioni and Joseph Marioni. In 1979, the Marioni family moved to Seattle and Dante began to study glassblowing at The Glass Eye. He spent summers at the Pilchuck Glass School in Stanwood, Washington where his father taught. After graduating from high school, he started to pursue glassblowing as a career; working full-time at The Glass Eye. Marioni learned the art of glassblowing from masters like Lino Tagliapietra, Benjamin Moore, and Richard Marquis. He has taught in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Europe. About his work Marioni‚Äôs ensemble of glass vessels includes variations of vases, goblets, flasks, cups, and pitchers. His works reveal combinations of classical Greek, Italian, and modern forms using opaque and transparent colors. Some of Marioni‚Äôs pieces employ 'reticello', which resembles a net, and murrine (mosaic) techniques. As he has refined his technical skills, he tends to design with tall, sleek shapes.(see external link below)Box Drum, one of Marioni's collaborative works, along with Preston Singletary  References Bibliography Oldknow, Tina.

He is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. After playing with an independent football team in Ann Arbor and at Adrian College, Maulbetsch became one of the most famous American football players in 1914 while playing for the University of Michigan. Maulbetsch became known as the \\"Human Bullet\\" because of his unusual low, line-plunging style of play, and was also known as the \\"Featherweight Fullback\\" because of his light weight and small size. After his performance against Harvard in 1914, in which some reports indicated he gained more than 300 yards, eastern writers, including Damon Runyon, wrote articles touting Maulbetsch. Maulbetsch was also selected by Walter Camp to his All-American team. In 1915, Maulbetsch underwent surgery for appendicitis and did not perform to the same level as he had in 1914. He made a comeback as a senior in 1916 and was again one of the leading players in college football. Between 1917 and 1920, Maulbetsch was the head football coach at Phillips University. With Maulbetsch's name recognition, he was able to recruit big name talent to Phillips, including future Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Owen, and future United States Olympic Committee President Doug Roby. Maulbetsch quickly turned Phillips into one of the top programs in the southwest, as his teams beat Oklahoma and Texas and lost only one game in the 1918 and 1919 seasons. Maulbetsch was later the football coach at Oklahoma A&M; (later known as Oklahoma State) and Marshall College in the 1920s. He has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and the University of Michigan awards the John F. Maulbetsch Award each year to a freshman football player based on desire, character, and capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the football field. Ann Arbor High School and the Independents Maulbetsch was born and grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He attended Ann Arbor High School where he led the football team to consecutive state championships in 1908 and 1909. One account of the 1908 playoffs noted: \\"Ann Arbor's smashing play in the first half was wholly due to Maulbetsch, Ann Arbor's fullback, and his terrific line bucking. He clearly outshone his team mates.\\" After graduating from high school, Maulbetsch joined the Ann Arbor Independents, a football team made up of Michigan \\"varsity eligibles\\" and \\"townies.\\" Maulbetsch was once reportedly called upon to drive across the goal line for the Independents in a game in which a large crowd, including a farmer with his plow-horse, gathered in the end zone. \\"Head down and legs working like piston rods, Maulbetsch plowed ahead until head struck the plow horse amidships. Down went the horse Mauly on top of him.\\" College football player=Transfer from Adrian College Maulbetsch started his college football career at age 21, leading Adrian College to an 8‚Äì0 record in 1911, including a 15‚Äì0 win over the University of Michigan freshman team. Maulbetsch's performance drew the attention of Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost. After watching Maulbetsch dominate Michigan's freshman team, Yost concluded: \\"If I could get that kid into Michigan and keep him up in his studies I‚Äôd make an All-American place for him his first year.\\" Yost persuaded Maulbetsch to transfer, and he played with \\"the scrubs\\" in 1912. Yost told the press at the time he had \\"another (Willie) Heston\\" in Maulbetsch. 1914 season Maulbetsch did not play for the varsity team until the fall of 1914 when he was 24 years old. Before the season began, Maulbetsch was \\"touted as one of the fastest halfbacks who ever donned moleskins. He weighs 155 pounds, is built low, has a powerful pair of shoulders and his dashes are characterized by lightning speed.\\" Another pre-season account said he was \\"a wonder as a line plunger and a wizard in the open field.\\" From the outset, considerable attention was paid to his unusual running style. Observers noted \\"the peculiar manner in which he runs. . . . He has a corkscrew style of dashing, and even when tackled squarely has such a sturdy pair of legs that his assailant is usually carried back several yards.\\" Michigan opened the season with a 58‚Äì0 win over DePauw, followed by a 69‚Äì0 victory over Case Institute of Technology. Maulbetsch was the offensive star against Case, as he twice \\"carried several would-be tackles across the goal.\\" Playing Vanderbilt the following week, Maulbetsch had runs of 25 and 35 yards, scored two touchdowns, \\"was worked overtime and probably advanced the pigskin more than any two other players.\\" After starting the season 5‚Äì0, Michigan lost three of four games against top eastern schools: Syracuse, Harvard, Penn, and Cornell. 1914 Harvard game Maulbetsch's breakthrough came on October 31, 1914, in front of 30,000 fans at Harvard. The game was one of the most anticipated matches of the year. A special train brought Michigan fans to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and hundreds of Michigan alumni from the East were on hand as \\"reinforcements.\\" Though Harvard prevailed, 7‚Äì0, Maulbetsch was the big story in papers across the country. Writers from Ring Lardner to Damon Runyon told the story of Maulbetsch's performance. Lardner said: \\"If anyone tells you the East plays the best brand of football, Maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes.\\" According to Runyon, the Wolverines used \\"the mighty Maulbetsch as their battering ram\\", and he \\"gained enough ground against Harvard to bury a German army corps.\\" Football writer Frank G. Menke said: \\"No westerner ever created half the stir in the east as did this Michigander . . . His peculiar, baffling style of attack, backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20 yards every time he was called upon to carry the ball.\\" Another writer noted Maulbetsch's skill as a \\"line breaker\\" as he \\"carried the ball repeatedly through the Harvard line and into the secondary defense with bullet-like rushes that upset tackler after tackler.\\" Maulbetsch was responsible for four-fifths of Michigan's ground gains, and on several occasions his dives reportedly \\"had so much power that he dove right through a double line of crimson players and went sprawling on the ground twelve to twenty feet clear of the double line.\\" While every report indicates that Maulbetsch had a big day, the accounts vary dramatically as to exactly how many yards he gained. Frank Menke reported after the game that Maulbetsch gained 300 yards. A 1938 newspaper account said he \\"gained 350 yards from scrimmage.\\" Yet, his 1951 obituary indicated he gained 133 yards in 30 attempts. Despite Maulbetsch's efforts, Michigan was never able to punch the ball across the goal line. Many blamed Michigan's quarterback who switched to another back every time after Maulbetsch \\"took the ball to the shadow of the Crimson goal posts.\\" In answer to the question why Michigan was unable to score, Frank Menke said: \\"Ask the fellow who quarterbacked for Michigan that day. His actions were too mystifying for the spectators to figure out.\\" When Harvard reneged on an agreement to play a game in Ann Arbor in 1915, sports writers concluded it was to avoid facing Maulbetsch again. Said one reporter: \\"When faih Hahvahd [sic] saw what Maulbetsch did in the first clash, it decided it cared to see no more of him. He was too rough.\\" \\"Human Bullet\\" Much of the attention on Maulbetsch focused on his diminutive size and unique running style. At , and , Maulbetsch was a small back, even by the standards of his day. And his running style saw him bend his torso and propel himself like a projectile into the opposing line. Indeed, he won several nicknames based on his size, running style, and fighting spirit, including the \\"Human Bullet,\\" \\"Mauly\\", the \\"Human Shrapnel\\", the \\"Featherweight Fullback\\", the \\"Michigan Cannon Ball,\\" and the \\"German bullet.\\" Comparisons of Maulbetsch to military armaments were common. In addition to the \\"bullet\\", \\"shrapnel\\", and \\"cannonball\\" nicknames, the Syracuse Herald observed: \\"Standing up in front of a Krupp gun has its dangers, but it is not to be compared with the dangers of standing in front of Maulbetsch when he is going full speed ahead.\\" Maulbetsch's style was described as \\"line-plunging.\\" A New York newspaper noted: \\"When the ball is snapped to him he almost doubles himself up, and, with his head aimed at the knees of the opposing line, he dives head first. Those who have seen Maulbetsch in action marvel at the great momentum he can get up in two or three steps.\\" Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said: \\"Mauly is a little fellow, being built close to the ground. They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops ‚Äì that he hits so low that it's well nigh impossible to stop him.\\" An Iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible \\"for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with the force that Maulbetsch does and come out of the game without a broken neck.\\" Maulbetsch was said to run \\"so low that he could dash under an ordinary table without losing his feet.\\" At a coaching conference in the 1920s, a coach doubted the table-ducking story and challenged Maulbetsch. The doubter later recalled: \\"I began ribbing him about this table-ducking stuff and finally offered to bet him he couldn‚Äôt do it. Well, we got a table up in a room, Johnny tucked a water pitcher under his arm and backed against the wall. Darned if he didn‚Äôt do it, the only thing, that water pitcher broke in a million pieces.\\" Asked about the incident, Maulbetsch said it was true, except one part. Maulbetsch insisted there wasn‚Äôt a nick on the pitcher. Maulbetsch makes All-American After the loss to Harvard in 1914, Michigan rebounded with a 34‚Äì3 win over Penn. Walter Eckersall reported that the Wolverines were \\"led by the redoubtable Johnny Maulbetsch.\\" Despite being \\"a marked man\\" by the Penn defense, he was not thrown for a loss in the entire game, and he scored three touchdowns. Before Michigan lost to Cornell in the final game of the season, a scandal arose when it was revealed that the owner of an Ann Arbor pool room, Joe Reinger, had written a letter intimating that he could buy Maulbetsch and Michigan's quarterback to throw the Cornell game, and win US$50,000 from students willing to bet on Michigan. The letter was turned in to the Michigan athletic officials, and Reinger went to the athletic office \\"to try to hush the matter up.\\" Reinger became abusive and was thrown out of the office by Coach Yost. The incident caused \\"the biggest stir of the season on the campus,\\" as students demolished Reinger's pool room, and police had to guard Reinger's residence against threatening demonstrations that continued to \\"a late hour.\\" Although Michigan did lose to Cornell, Maulbetsch was said to be \\"practically the only successful ground gainer for Michigan.\\" Over the course of the 1914 season, Maulbetsch was said to have scored about half of Michigan's 252 points. A Wisconsin newspaper noted that, \\"when it comes time to write a resume of the 1914 football season\\", Maulbetsch's play \\"will live in the minds of men . . . for years to come.\\" As a reward for his efforts, Maulbetsch was named a first-team All-American at the end of the 1914 season. Pie and coffee diet As public attention focused on Maulbetsch as \\"the greatest line-plunger of a decade,\\" the press could not get enough of Maulbetsch, even interviewing his family. His sister revealed that Maulbetsch had a fondness for home cooking and received permission from the team trainer to eat at his family's Ann Arbor home. \\"Now, Johnny's sister explains that each day his mother baked two pies for the athlete's supper, and that in addition he had everything else his appetite craved, including coffee.\\" Confronted by reporters about the revelation, Maulbetsch replied: \\"The story was slightly exaggerated. I rarely ate more than one and one half pies for dinner.\\" Joking references to Maulbetsch's diet continued when it was reported in 1915 that he was suffering from \\"acute indigestion.\\" One reporter quipped, \\"Those much advertised pies of his maw's evidently aren‚Äôt as great training dope as they were cracked up to be.\\" It turned out that the indigestion was appendicitis, and Maulbetsch was hospitalized at St. Joseph's Sanitarium in Ann Arbor in April 1915, where he underwent an operation. 1915 season As the 1915 season was set to get underway, Coach Yost reported, \\"Johnny told me he was feeling fine when I saw him recently, although he doesn‚Äôt weigh as much as he used to.\\" Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that \\"a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight.\\" In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was \\"woefully weak on interference.\\" Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as \\"Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line.\\" After The Michigan Daily criticized his performance following the Marietta game, Maulbetsch \\"threatened to desert the Michigan squad and give up football for good.\\" It reportedly took Yost several hours to coax Maulbetsch to report for practice again, and in the next game against Case, Maulbetsch did not play until the third quarter. In the season's first big game, Michigan was soundly beaten by Michigan Agricultural College, 24‚Äì0, and most of Maulbetsch's runs \\"didn‚Äôt even get as far as his own line.\\" In the final four games of the season, matters got worse for Michigan and Maulbetsch, as the team went 0‚Äì3‚Äì1, scoring only 14 points in four games. In Maulbetsch's defense, some writers noted the weakness of the Michigan line, often allowing rushers into the backfield before Maulbetsch even had the ball. But some of those same observers noted that \\"Mauly\\" was not carrying the ball \\"at his usual pace.\\" Sports writer Frank Menke described Maulbetsch's 1915 performance this way: \\"[The] Wolverine halfback skidded from the heights of greatness to the level of mediocre. . . . The lines that he had crumpled like eggshells a year before stood up under his charges, often dumping him back for losses. The once 'unstoppable' Maulbetsch not only was stopped but forced to retract.\\" Despite the subpar performance in 1915, Michigan's varsity letter-winners elected him captain of the team for 1916. 1916 comeback Maulbetsch made a strong comeback in 1916. Instead of spending the summer recovering from appendicitis, he spent the summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between Chicago and St. Joseph, Michigan. Maulbetsch spent his afternoons swimming and running sprints up and down the beach. On one trip, a giant coal passer claimed to be the strongest man in the world, and Maulbetsch agreed to a wrestling match on the boat. \\"The coal passer rushed the stripling, who ducked, caught his opponent about the waist and crushed him to the deck. When the giant woke, he wanted to know if the boat hit a rock.\\" As the season started, The New York Times wrote: \\"Michigan's come-back football team, headed by Bullet Maulbetsch, is going to be an eleven to be reckoned with on the gridiron this Fall.\\" Maulbetsch returned to his prior form, and one of the writers who had criticized him in 1915 said \\"the great Michigander using the same method of attack, has repeatedly broken in fragments this year the lines that he couldn‚Äôt dent in 1915.\\" Professional football After the 1916 football season ended, Maulbetsch considered his options. There was a report that he had been engaged as a high school football coach (and math instructor) in Toledo, Ohio. Even more prevalent were reports that he had signed to play for a professional football team. Professional football was still in its infancy in 1917, and landing a well-known star would have been a boost to any of the budding franchises. In January 1917 newspapers reported that Maulbetsch had signed a contract to play professional football for Detroit Tigers owner, Frank Navin. Navin was supporting efforts to organize a professional football league in all the important Midwestern cities, including a Detroit franchise to play at Navin Field. As late as November 1917, newspapers reported Maulbetsch had played professional football after graduating and was offered \\"a handsome fee\\" to play with the Akron Burkhardts in November 1917. Although professional football records prior to 1920 are scarce, it appears unlikely that Maulbetsch played professional football, as press accounts show he was working as a college football coach starting in 1917. Head football coach=Building Phillips University into a football power (1917‚Äì1920) In June 1917, Maulbetsch announced that he had accepted a position as the football coach (and professor of chemistry) at Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma. Phillips was a small, private school without a well-known athletic program. In the fall, Enid residents were \\"leaving their work every afternoon to watch [Maulbetsch] and his husky young Oklahoma youths work out on campus.\\" Within a year, Maulbetsch turned Phillips into one of the strongest teams in the southwest. Maulbetsch landed his first big recruit before leaving Ann Arbor. While playing at Michigan, Maulbetsch became friends with Doug Roby, a football player at the Michigan Military Academy, and one of the state's top recruits. Roby followed Maulbetsch to Phillips and later went on to become a member of the International Olympic Committee in the 1950s and 1960s and president of the United States Olympic Committee from 1965 to 1968. Maulbetsch's next find was future Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Owen, who later spent 23 years with the New York Giants. Maulbetsch saw Owen watching football practice from under a tree and told him: \\"A fellow your size ought to be out for the squad.\\" Owen showed up the next day and, when Maulbetsch used him to illustrate blocking fundamentals, Owen threw a block into Maulbetsch that threw him five yards through the air. Maulbetsch was satisfied, and Owen had a spot on the team. Because Phillips was not part of a conference, it was not subject to any eligibility limitations, an advantage Maulbetsch was accused of exploiting. A third key player recruited by Maulbetsch was a Native American halfback named Levi, and dubbed \\"Big Chief\\" by Phillips fans. Having recruited top talent to Enid, Maulbetsch's teams lost only one game in 1918 and 1919, including a 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 record in 1919. In 1917 and 1918, Phillips came into the limelight when they beat the Oklahoma Sooners and the Henry Kendricks College team that had swept the west without allowing another team to score. Maulbetsch arranged a game against the Texas Longhorns in 1919, the first meeting between the schools. When the game was announced The San Antonio Light reported: \\"Phillips University has one of the strongest teams in the Southwest. The only team to beat them in the past two years is Oklahoma and last year Phillips beat the Sooners 13‚Äì7.\\" The report credited Maulbetsch for securing success at an institution little known in athletics before he arrived. The University of Texas had not lost a game since 1917 when the Phillips \\"Haymakers\\" arrived in Austin, Texas on October 11, 1919. Maulbetsch's team shocked the Longhorns, holding them scoreless and winning the contest, 10‚Äì0. One Texas newspaper reported that Phillips had \\"whitewashed the Longhorns in their own corral.\\" Others in Texas concluded that Phillips‚Äô success was the result of lax or non-existent eligibility policies. The lack of eligibility rules almost certainly did play a part in Phillips‚Äô success. When Phillips joined the Southwest Conference in 1920, it became bound by the conference's eligibility rules, and the team was outscored 97‚Äì0 in conference play against Texas A&M; (47‚Äì0), Texas (27‚Äì0), Arkansas (20‚Äì0), and Texas Christian (3‚Äì0). The Galveston Daily News noted that Maulbetsch's 1920 team could not \\"compare with the strong team\\" he surprised Texas with in 1919. At the end of the 1920 season, Phillips withdrew from the Southwest Conference, and Maulbetsch accepted a new position at Oklahoma A&M.; Head coach at Oklahoma A&M; (1921‚Äì1928) In January 1921, Maulbetsch was hired as the head coach at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Oklahoma State) in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He served as the coach at Oklahoma A&M; from 1921 to 1928, where his teams posted a 28‚Äì37‚Äì6 (.437) record. In 1924, his team went 6‚Äì1‚Äì2 and shut out Oklahoma (6‚Äì0), Arkansas (20‚Äì0) and Kansas (3‚Äì0). Maulbetsch's Aggies also shut out Phillips that year, 13‚Äì0. After the season, attempts were made to lure him to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, but Maulbetsch said he was satisfied with his position in Stillwater. Maulbetsch arranged a game in Ann Arbor against his alma mater to start the 1926 season. Michigan beat the Aggies, 42‚Äì3. Despite an overall record of 3‚Äì4‚Äì1, Oklahoma A&M; won its first conference football championship by going 3‚Äì0‚Äì1 in games against Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. Maulbetsch also drew attention in 1926 for his disciplinary methods. When the team lost two games due to fumbles, he ordered eight of his backfield players to carry footballs with them to classes throughout the week and instructed other team members to try knocking the balls from under their arms. The penalty for losing a ball was \\"a hard run around the stadium.\\" He also ordered one of his ends to wear boxing gloves after he poked an opposing player in the eye. The Aggies won only one game against seven defeats in 1928. In late November, the day after a 46‚Äì0 loss to Oklahoma, newspapers reported that \\"reliable sources\\" had said Maulbetsch intended to resign. Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: \\"I have not resigned. I am aware that a faction here is trying to get me out, but I do not intend to throw up the sponge.\\" In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: \\"Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game.\\" Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A&M;'s coach in football, baseball, and basketball. It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay. Head coach at Marshall College (1929‚Äì1930) In July 1929, Maulbetsch was hired by Marshall College in Huntington, West Virginia to become head coach in charge of football and track. When Marshall's \\"Thundering Herd\\" got off to a 4‚Äì1 start, Maulbetsch won praise in the West Virginia press, but Marshall finished the season 1‚Äì2‚Äì1 in the second half. And in 1930, the Marshall team went 3‚Äì5‚Äì1, including a 65‚Äì0 loss to Penn State. Maulbetsch resigned as Marshall's coach in January 1931; his only comment at the time was that he had \\"other plans.\\" Later years and legacy Maulbetsch Ave. street sign After retiring from football, Maulbetsch bought a drug store in Huntington, West Virginia. During World War II, Maulbetsch took a job building B-24 Liberator bombers at Ford Motor Company's famed Willow Run Plant near Ypsilanti, Michigan. From 1946 until his death, he owned an automobile sales company in Adrian, Michigan. Maulbetsch died of cancer in 1950 at his home in Ann Arbor. He was survived by his widow, Ida, a son John Maulbetsch, and a daughter Barbara. Maulbetsch had been married to Ida (maiden name Ida Elizabeth Cappon) since May 27, 1917. Maulbetsch was inducted posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973. Since 1956, the John F. Maulbetsch Award has been given at the University of Michigan after spring practice to a freshman football candidate on the basis of desire, character, capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the football field. The award was established by Frederick C. Matthaei ‚Äì a former classmate of Maulbetsch who went on to become a Regent of the University. The award has been a good indicator of future success, as past recipients include Jim Mandich (1967), Rick Leach (1976), Charles Woodson (1996), Marlin Jackson (2002), and Jake Long (2004). Maulbetsch Avenue in Ypsilanti Township is presumably named after Maulbetsch.

Retrieved February 17, 2007 The next year, XM pulled the PCR's from the market, reportedly due to music piracy.CNet News.com (August 30, 2004) XM Radio pulls PC hardware amid piracy concerns. Retrieved February 17, 2007. However, that didn't stop demand: Some units were reportedly selling for more than US$300 on eBay. As of February 2007, prices settled down to around US$30‚Äì50.  Enhancements  Several enhancements have been created for the PCR, both software and hardware. In the software arena, PCR Replacement programs have been sprouting up on Internet forums and web sites. These are software packages that replace the interface included with the PCR, XMMT. Several features have been added to these new programs, including the ability to rip songs and build an MP3 library, time shift shows so that the user can listen at a more convenient time, control the radio via a web browser, and stream audio to other computers. Some web sites also offer a playlist log, which allows a user to browse a list of all the recently played songs or shows. A hardware modification has also been discovered that allows the addition of a TOSLINK optical output, allowing users to connect the PCR to the optical digital input on a home theater receiver.  Replacements  XM Direct Receiver with homemade Smart Cable The XM Direct receiver, also marketed as the XM Commander, can now serve the same purpose as the PCR. While the XM Direct is intended for automotive use, the unit itself is controlled by RS-232 command signals, and so is easily adapted to PC control. When combined with a \\"smart cable\\", which is really just a USB to Serial cable and a wiring adapter to connect to the XM Direct's control port, the XM Direct supports some features not found on the original PCR.

It is also known as Mokmer Airport.Aviation Safety Network: Biak - Mokmer Airport (BIK / WABB) The airport is named after Frans Kaisiepo, the fourth Governor of Papua. The airport has seven aircraft parking slots, of which two are capable of handling wide-body aircraft, and a small terminal without jet bridges. The airport's only runway is 3,571m long, designated as 11/29. History As World War II started in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan started occupying New Guinea in 1942. In an effort to win the war, some naval bases and military airbases were built there. This also happened in Biak, particularly at Ambroben county, where Mokmer Airfield was built. It had a 2,000 X 40 m runway and was built by Romusha workers. Japan then attempted to build a second military airfield in Samao county. However, the airfield was never completed and abandoned when Allied troops attacked Japan's military and defense bases. Meanwhile, Mokmer Airfield was completed and was now capable of supporting Japan's military aircraft, either single- engine or twin-engine. The allied troops landed at Biak on 16 November 1944. With the most complex equipment of that time, they built many military facilities, including air services for troop mobility, logistic hub, and defense base. Numerous airfields were built at Biak, including Boroku Manuhua Airfield in Boroku County and Sorido Airfield in Samau town. Mokmer Airfield's runway was extended to 3,000 X 40 m. This airfield was used by the Royal Australian Air Force . The allied troops ended their presence in Biak in 1945. World War II Mokmer Airfield was part of a complex of airfields built on Biak Island by the Japanese (Mokmer, Borokoe and Sorido), of which Mokmer was the main USAAF facility after the island was taken by the United States after fierce fighting in late May and June 1944. The Battle of Biak Island came about after a succession of Japanese defeats in 1943 and 1944 along the northern coast of New Guinea. Biak became a Japanese stronghold, which they were determined to hold to the last man. Unknown to the advancing Allies, the Japanese began fortifying the island and when the Allies invaded on 27 May 1944, the Japanese put up a fierce defense. The only tank vs. tank battle in New Guinea occurred on Biak, where Japanese Ha-Go light tanks were knocked out by American Sherman tanks. Japanese soldiers were well entrenched in the interior of the island in limestone caves and fortifications, a trend that would be seen again in islands like Palau. These entrenched troops fought an excellent defense and the casualties at Biak were high - for the American Army, 435 KIA and 2,360 WIA. The Japanese lost an estimated 6,125 KIA, with 460 POWs, and 360 Formosan POWs.

Mokmer Airfield is located to the west of Mokmer village on Biak, parallel to the coastline and the Japen Strait and is the only one of the three currently used as an airport and is now called Frans Kaisiepo International Airport. Mokmer Airfield also became a major refueling point for airline flights from the United States to destinations in Indonesia, prior to non-stop cross Pacific flights. On 16 July 1957, KLM Flight 844 crashed into Cenderawasih Bay shortly after takeoff. 58 out of 68 passengers on board the Lockheed 1049E Super Constellation propliner perished. Sorido Airfield has been disused since 1962 and is located to the northwest of Mokmer, and is clearly visible on aerial photography. After the war the airfield was used by the Dutch who had kept it as a military airfield, flying P2V Neptunes and later Hawker Hunters from the base until the withdrawal of Dutch forces in 1962. Borokoe Airfield is due west of Mokmer, along the beach. Not used as an airfield after the American liberation, it became a Fifth Air Force Air Depot area; however, the old runways are evident in aerial photography The government of Netherlands soon took over the airfield. After Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, commercial flights started to operate to and from Biak, using Boroku Airfield which had a 2,000 m runway. Mokmer airfield wasn't in use that time and this continued into 1951. Because of a letter from Nieuw Guinea's governor (number 38/a.2/1935,dated 17 September 1953), Boroku Airfield was closed. Since then, the government started to search for another airport site. The choice was then finalized to the former RAAF and Allied troop airbase, Mokmer Airfield. At first phase, the airport was revamped to accommodate piston airliners such as the Douglas DC-3. This phase was completed in 1954. With the advent of jet airliners such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, the airport went through another modernization to start accommodating them. This modernization was completed in 1959. Sorido Airfield was closed to civilian traffic and is now a base for the Indonesian Navy in Biak. From August 1962 to 30 April 1963, Western Papua was administered by UNTEA. As a result, Mr. A.A. Widodo was pointed to be the first executive manager for the airport. In November 1962, Mokmer Airport was given over to Mr. A.A. Widodo from the government of Netherlands via a person named J.C.Smith. On 1 May 1963, the airport was given over once again from UNTEA to the government of Indonesia. Shortly afterwards, an administration improvement regarding organization and airport operation was carried out. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Garuda Indonesia airlines ran a flight from Jakarta to Los Angeles in the US, via Bali, Biak, and Honolulu; Biak was designated as a refueling stopover before flying the Trans-Pacific leg. In 1993, Garuda flew four times a week to Honolulu and Los Angeles with their Boeing 747-200 Combi and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jetliners.October 1993 Official Airline Guide (OAG) Desktop Flight Guide, Worldwide Edition, Biak flight schedules In 1990, the airport's management and operation was handed over to Angkasa Pura I. In December 2017, two Tu-95 strategic bombers belonging to the Russian Air Force exercised at the airbase, prompting RAAF Base Darwin in Australia to raise its alert level.

Tornadic winds have been measured in excess of 300 mph (480 km/h). Tornadoes are a serious hazard to life and limb. As such, people in tornado-prone areas often adopt plans of action in case a tornado approaches.  Tornadoes in society  1894 United States elections; the farm woman taking shelter is labeled 'Democratic Party'. Puck magazine (1894) Storm cellars are often used as a means of shelter in case of tornadoes or tropical cyclones. Common in tornado-prone areas, they have been around for more than 100 years--even referenced in the famous 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Consisting either of a simple underground room, or an elaborate above-ground bunker, they are usually small rooms, designed to keep debris from entering and causing injury. When properly constructed, they can survive an EF5 tornado. While it is unknown how many lives have been saved by storm cellars, the number is undoubtedly high. Some individuals and hobbyists, known as storm chasers, enjoy pursuing thunderstorms and tornadoes to explore their many visual and scientific aspects. Attempts have been made by some storm chasers from educational and scientific institutions to drop probes in the path of oncoming tornadoes in an effort to analyze the interior of the storms, but only about five drops have been successful since around 1990. Due to the relative rarity and large scale of destructive power that tornadoes possess, their occurrence or the possibility that they may occur can often create what could be considered sensationalism in their reporting. This results in so- called weather wars, in which competing local media outlets, particularly TV news stations, engage in continually escalating technological one-upsmanship and drama in order to increase their market share. This is especially evident in tornado-prone markets, such as those in the Great Plains. According to Environment Canada, the chances of being killed by a tornado are 12 million to 1 (12,000,000:1). One may revise this yearly and/or regionally, but the probability may be factually stated to be low. Regardless, tornadoes cause millions of dollars in damage, both economic and physical, many deaths, and hundreds of injuries every year.Data from the Storm Prediction Center archives, which are accessible through SeverePlot, free software created and maintained by John Hart, lead forecaster for the SPC. The tornado has been used by cartoonists for over 100 years as a metaphor for political upheaval. The storm cellar has also been used as a metaphor for seeking safety, as shown in the cartoon from 1894 at right. According to political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the tornado takes Dorothy to a utopia, the Land of Oz, and kills the Wicked Witch of the East, who had oppressed \\"the little people\\", the Munchkins. A 1960s advertising campaign for the household cleaner, Ajax, claimed the product \\"Cleans like a white tornado\\". Numerous athletic teams across the United States employ a tornado for their mascot. There are 124 high schools, colleges, and professional sports teams that use \\"Tornadoes,\\" or a variant, as their team nicknames.

The fifteen member team played mostly against amateur teams and was more successful than the tourists of 1886. The tour The second Parsee team played 31 matches, winning 8 and losing 11, a considerable improvement upon the performance of the 1886 team which won only one out of 28. As in the previous tour, none of the matches are deemed first class. The tour was arranged by Pestonji Kanga, D.C. Pandole and J.M. Divecha. The outstanding success of the tour was Mehellasha Pavri who some consider as the first great Indian cricketer.See for instance, Raiji, p. 92 : \\"If the word 'great' is used a bit generously, Dr ME Pavri could be described as India's first great cricketer\\" and Bose, p.25 : \\"He was without doubt the first great Indian cricketer\\". But this is by no means a unanimous opinion A fast round-arm bowler, he took 170 wickets at an average of 11.66. At Eastbourne, he is said to have sent a bail flying nearly 50 yards, and at Norfolk when he uprooted a stump, it flew nine yards and pitched itself the right way up. Cooper who scored 952 runs at 18.30 topped the run aggregate. The tour saw the first appearance of players like Dinshaw Writer and Nasarvanji Bapasola who were to earn prominence in the 1890s. Against the Gentlemen of Eastbourne, Parsees were made to follow-on and led by 122 in the second innings. But Pavri claimed six wickets and Eastbourne was bowled out for 56. At Scarborough, the opponents who needed four runs to win in the last half-hour were restricted to just three. The tour started on 7 June and ended on 13 September. The team * P.D. Kanga * S.H.

He was responsible for leading Standard Oil to the forefront of the oil industry and significantly expanding the company's presence in the petrochemical field. In 1923, Cornell University announced that Teagle was their highest salaried alumnus. He served as vice president of the Cornell Club of New York and on a variety of committees. Biography He was born in Cleveland, Ohio on May 1, 1878 into a wealthy oil family. Teagle was the grandson of Maurice B. Clark, one of John D. Rockefeller's former partners in Standard Oil. Teagle's father, John Teagle, headed Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, Standard Oil's competitor in Cleveland. Teagle entered Cornell University with the class of 1900, but graduated early in 1899 with a B.S. in chemistry. As a student, Teagle was said to have \\"managed everything,\\" serving as manager for two publications, the football team, class politics, and as chair of the committees for class promenades and cotillions. He was a member of the Quill and Dagger society and Alpha Delta Phi. In 1901, Standard Oil bought out the Teagle family refinery, and placed Teagle in charge. Two years later, he joined the export committee of Standard Oil of New Jersey, traveling around the world for the next seven and a half years. He became a director of Standard Oil in 1910, and a vice president shortly thereafter. During this time, he acquired operations in Venezuela and Iran. At the age of 39, Teagle became the youngest president of Standard Oil of New Jersey, then known as Esso, for Standard Oil of New Jersey, and since 1972, known as Exxon. Under his leadership, Standard Oil became the world's largest oil producer, increasing market share from 2% to 11.5%.20th Century American Leaders Database He helped pioneer worker representation on refinery councils and the eight-hour workday. Teagle married twice, to Edith Murray on October 3, 1903, and after her death, to Rowena Lee in 1910.Witzel, Morgen. Encyclopedia Of The History Of American Management. New York: Thoemmes Continuum, 2005. Print Pp 494 Following Standard Oil house counsel Virgil Kline, who had earlier won cases against Standard for his father's firm,Yergin, Daniel (1991). \\"The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power\\" New York: Simon & Schuster. Teagle built a summer house in Blue Hill, Maine. He served as a trustee for Cornell University from 1924 to 1954 and donating funds for the Teagle Hall athletic building. Teagle has been accused of contributing to Nazi Germany during World War II through his involvement with German chemical company IG Farben. As a director of IG Farben's American subsidiary, he allied Standard Oil with the German company and conducted research jointly. Standard Oil supplied information to IG Farben on how to manufacture tetraethyl lead and synthetic rubber, both critical resources to the war effort. In 1938, under Teagle's leadership, Standard Oil and its British subsidiaries supplied five hundred tons of tetraethyl lead to Germany's Luftwaffe. Germany had very few industrial resources of its own, and without this octane booster for its aviation gas, the Luftwaffe would have been practically grounded. At the time tetraethyl lead was a rare and highly controlled commodity and it is unlikely Germany would have been able to find another source for it. Had Teagle not arranged such a massive transfer of the substance to the Luftwaffe, it is likely that the second World War would have been postponed for several years. Standard Oil, under Teagle, also supplied Japan with large quantities of this critical aviation gas component. When America entered the war a few years later, it was desperately short of rubber because Standard Oil, again under Teagle's leadership, refused to produce any synthetic rubber for the American military, because Teagle had transferred the patent rights for synthetic rubber to IG Farben, a German company. Because of the patents it had sold to Germany, Standard Oil also interfered with America's production of synthetic ammonia (for use in explosives), acetic acid (another crucial war material), and methanol (another fuel additive). Standard and Teagle, again protecting IG Farben's patents, had also worked to prevent the US military from obtaining paraflow, a crucial high-altitude lubricant used in fighters and bombers. Though Teagle himself had two sons in the Army Air Force, Standard Oil, through its subsidiaries, continued to supply Germany with oil. Faced with a United States Department of Justice investigation, Teagle convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that a suit would hurt the war effort, instead choosing to pay an out-of-court fine. The result was a fall in public favor for Standard Oil and the resignation of Teagle in 1942, one year short of the mandatory retirement age. He was replaced by Ralph W. Gallagher. Despite the settlement, for the duration of the Second World War, Standard Oil, under deals Teagle had overseen, continued to supply Nazi Germany with oil. The shipments went through Spain, Vichy France's colonies in the West Indies, and Switzerland. Standard's oil shipments from the United States to Spain were briefly halted in January 1944 due to American public pressure, then began again in May 1944. Spain, meanwhile, was shipping 48,000 tons a month of American oil to Germany. In 1962, Teagle died at the age of 83 in Byram, Connecticut after a long illness, He was entombed in the Teagle Mausoleum at Putnam Cemetery, Greenwich Connecticut. Honors Teagle was selected as one of 20th Century Great American Business Leaders by Harvard Business School and was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1974 for his work at Standard Oil in expanding research and development of petroleum-based products, leading to fuel refinements and diverse petrochemical uses such as in cosmetics and food preservatives.Automotive Hall of Fame He appears on the cover of the December 9, 1929 issue of Time Magazine.Time Magazine archive He was also selected as one of the 100 Most Notable Cornellians and inducted into the Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame.Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame Other positions Teagle was very active in labor, business, and trade organizations and councils. He served as head of President Hoover's job sharing movement and on the National Labor Board during its brief tenure from 1933 to 1934, helping handle labor disputes. He was appointed to President Roosevelt's National Defense Mediation Board and National War Labor Board. He was also on the national Business Advisory Council and a director of the National Foreign Trade Council and Federal Reserve Bank.

Tam) and the surrounding areas in Marin County, California are recognized as the birthplace of modern mountain biking. In the 1970s, mountain biking pioneers such as Gary Fisher, Otis Guy, Charlie Kelly and Joe Breeze were active. The 2006 film Klunkers chronicled their story, solidifying Mount Tamalpais' status as a mountain biking destination, as did Frank J. Berto's book The Birth of Dirt. The area is used by mountain bikers due to Mount Tamalpais‚Äô proximity to a highly populated geographic region, ease of access, varied terrain, and views. A number of trailheads surround the mountain, and the paved and dirt fire roads that cross Mount Tamalpais and adjacent foothills provide options for people of all fitness levels. Most offroad cyclists reach Mount Tamalpais through the towns of Ross, Fairfax or Mill Valley, and the less used access points that exist through the towns of Larkspur and Kentfield. The Old Railroad Grade fire road that begins in Mill Valley, once the right-of-way of the Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railroad, is the easiest route to traverse up the mountain to its peak of 2,571 feet (784 m) at East Peak. Like some other mountain biking areas, there has been controversy around trail access on Mount Tamalpais for mountain bikes, both in terms of environmental impact and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles are generally restricted from narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are allowed on most fire roads. However, through the growing connections of trails established by the Bay Area Ridge Trail, mountain bikers have access to multi-use trails such as the Dias Ridge Trail. In addition, the non-profit Marin County Bicycle Coalition is playing a growing role to improve access for mountain bikers to singletrack and multi-use trails by working collaboratively with the Marin Municipal Water District, which manages 18,500 acres in the Mt. Tamalpais Watershed, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and other organizations.

Liu Ye plays a young scientist whose rising star must confront the dark forces of politics, ego, and cultural insensitivity. The film is loosely based on the University of Iowa shooting. The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize.https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/sundance-tuesday-24-1-07/16/ Plot The film is inspired by the true story of Gang Lu, a former graduate student who killed four faculty members and one student at the University of Iowa. However, the story has substantial differences in plot and character motivation. Liu Xing (Liu Ye) is a humble but brilliant Chinese student who arrives at Valley State University and makes a bumpy transition into American life with the help of Joanna Silver (Meryl Streep). Silver is a wealthy university patron who has a fascination with Chinese culture and takes a liking to Liu Xing. Xing joins a select cosmology group under the direction of his hero, the famous cosmologist Professor Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn). The group is working to create a model of the origins of the universe, based on Reiser's theory. Xing's enormous talent leads him quickly to become Reiser's prot√©g√©, and it seems that only hard work stands between him and a bright future in science. Xing is obsessed with the study of dark matter, an unseen substance that he believes shapes the universe, and a theory that conflicts with the Reiser model. Xing makes scientific breakthroughs of his own which improve the Reiser model. Without Professor Reiser's approval, Liu Xing proposes to research dark matter for his doctoral dissertation. Reiser explains to Xing that this type of research is too complicated and suggests that he should pick a simpler dissertation topic. Refusing to work with Xing, Reiser finds a new prot√©g√© in Feng Gang (Lloyd Suh), another Chinese student who was Xing's rival in undergraduate school in Beijing. Professor Reiser approves of Feng's dissertation proposal as it sticks to the Reiser model. Feng's English skills are far superior to his fellow Chinese students', and he refuses to speak in Mandarin with them. Feng changes his name to Laurence so that Americans would be more comfortable pronouncing his name. Without the permission of Professor Reiser, Xing publishes an article in an astronomy journal. Reiser is enraged by this and refuses to accept Xing's doctoral dissertation. At a graduation party for the Chinese students it is announced that Laurence Feng has won the university's Gell-Mann honorary doctorate prize for that year. Joanna Silver urges Professor Reiser to do something to help Liu Xing. Reiser informs her that he has written a \\"very fine\\" recommendation for him. Professor Reiser also attempts to belittle Xing by telling Silver that Xing is not a \\"team player.\\" Xing does not graduate and finds his dream of winning the Nobel Prize shattered. He goes on to sell beauty products to try to make money. His roommate offers to find him a job in China, but Xing refuses to leave. A few months pass and Xing mails all of his money (a check for ten thousand dollars) to his parents in China. One day, Xing returns to campus. He heads into an auditorium where Laurence Feng is giving a presentation to the cosmology department. Unable to cope with his emotions, Xing pulls a revolver out of his coat and begins firing, shooting Laurence and Reiser before making his way to Reiser's office and shooting himself in the head.

The airport check-in space is able to accommodate as many as 3-6 airline, 80 sets of new seats, air-conditioning means 15 units as well as the capacity of the reception area. The waiting room was originally only able to carry 40-50 people. But this time can accommodate 180-200 people. The airport is surrounded by sea and mountains, and is probably one of the most extreme airports in Indonesia. Pilots have to turn 90 degrees plane shortly after takeoff or before landing. Not without reason, because there is a mountain a few kilometers from the end of the runway. Therefore, only the most experienced pilots are allowed to pilot aircraft that is going to or from the airport. Improvement The current apron can accommodate three planes. When more than three planes need to use the apron any additional plane(s) must wait. Wait times for the use of the apron by a fourth or fifth plane have been up to 20 minutes.

J. Prins (1921, Harderwijk, Gelderland - 11 February 2000) was a Dutch Africanist and maritime anthropologist. He was a recipient of many research grants and fellowships (UNESCO, Ford Foundation, the Netherlands Organization for Pure Research, etc.), Prins was frequently consulted by the Dutch government and royal court, who valued his wealth of knowledge about the peoples and cultures of Africa and the Middle East. In addition to scores of encyclopedia entries and dozens of scholarly articles in a wide range of international journals such as Anthropos, Man, Human Organization, and The Mariner‚Äôs Mirror, Prins regularly published in Dutch newspapers and magazines. Moreover, he illustrated many of his books and articles with his own ethnographic photographs, sketches, and pen drawings. Early life and education Prins studied social geography and ethnology at the University of Utrecht under Prof. Dr. Henri Th. Fischer. In 1943, the German occupying forces ordered Dutch students and faculty to sign a \\"loyalty declaration\\". Like many others, Prins refused and joined the resistance movement, ultimately becoming chief of intelligence in the VIth Brigade (Veluwe). He was known as \\"Peter\\", his nom de guerre. Following the 1944 Battle of Arnhem, he was incorporated into the British Intelligence Section (MI9), a department of the War Office tasked with aiding resistance fighters in enemy occupied territories. Given the rank of first lieutenant, he served in the Intelligence Branch of the General Staff of the 21st Army Group, commanded by Montgomery. After demobilization in 1945, he resumed graduate studies at Utrecht. A year later, having acquired his doctoraal degree, he became a research assistant at Utrecht's Institute of Ethnology under Fischer. In 1947, he received a fellowship at the London School of Economics for social anthropology training under Raymond Firth, Siegfried Nadel, and Audrey Richards. Then, equipped with language training in Swahili, he travelled to Kenya as a British Colonial Fellow for ethnographic research in the Teita Hills. Guided by Senior District Commissioner Harold E. Lambert, a Cambridge University-trained anthropologist and linguist specialized in the Swahili and Kikuyu languages, Prins began his fieldwork. Later, he dedicated one of his books to Lambert.A Swahili Nautical Dictionary Although Prins focused initially on British anthropological topics, such as kinship and social structure, his enduring interest concerned the maritime history and cultural ecology of seafaring peoples. Career In 1951, two years before earning his PhD from Utrecht U, Prins was hired as the first anthropologist at the University of Groningen, where he later became the founding director of the Institute of Cultural Anthropology. Although he lectured at many institutions in Europe, East Africa, and the Middle East, he remained there until his retirement in 1984. Fieldwork A committed fieldworker, Prins made numerous journeys abroad during and after his tenure in Groningen. In 1957, he began studying dhows, the lateen-rigged sailing ships of the Indian Ocean and the way in which they operate, first in the Persian Gulf, then on the coast of Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika (1957, 1965‚Äì66, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971). Other projects involved research in Ethiopia (1954‚Äì55), Iraq (1957), Iran (1959), the Persian Gulf (1970, 1973), Syria and Turkey (1961‚Äì62, 1970), South Arabia (1970, 1973), Zambia (1972, 1974). One of the founders of the Arctic Centre at Groningen University, he made annual research trips to northern Scandinavia from 1968‚Äì92, and beginning in 1970 traveled to Greece and made frequent journeys to the Mediterranean island of Malta. Retirement After his retirement in 1984, the Dutch government restructured higher education and terminated the anthropological institute at Groningen University. As an Emeritus Professor, Prins continued various maritime and cultural historical research projects. He died on 11 February 2000, after five years of illness, the result of a debilitating stroke. Buried in Noordlaren near \\"Huis ter Aa,\\" his family home in the old rural village of Glimmen south of Groningen City, he was survived by his wife Ita (P.A.C. Prins-Poorter, 1921-2016), nine children,among his sons is fellow anthropologist Harald E.L. Prins, and sixteen grandchildren.

Birkhead v. Marshall, centered on a child born September 7, 2006 to Vickie Lynn Marshall (better known as Anna Nicole Smith). The child was named Dannielynn, and was registered on her birth certificate as the daughter of Vickie Lynn Marshall (Smith) and her live-in partner Howard K. Stern. Larry Birkhead, Smith's former love interest and photographer, steadfastly maintained his contention that he was the baby's father and filed a lawsuit to challenge paternity after Smith had given birth. Besides Birkhead and Stern, bodyguard/actor Alexander Denk, Mark Hatten and Fr√©d√©ric Prinz von Anhalt, among others, claimed to be the father of Smith's daughter, Dannielynn. Although Stern was listed on her birth certificate, it was not certain that he was the father. At issue in a California court was who fathered the child, who could potentially inherit millions of dollars from Smith's estate. On September 26, 2006, Stern claimed in an interview from the Bahamas with Larry King on CNN that he was the father of Smith's newborn daughter. After much media attention, on April 10, 2007, Michael Baird, who analyzed the results of a March 21 DNA test, announced the results that confirmed Birkhead to be the father of the baby.  Name changes  A little over a month after the birth, a copy of the baby's disputed second birth certificate dated October 11, 2006 was made public showing she was renamed and registered as Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern on October 9, 2006.Birth Certificate for Anna Nicole's Baby, TMZ.com, October 16, 2006 From September 7, 2006 to October 11, 2006 the baby was in the records as Hannah Rose Marshall Stern. After the birth of her daughter, according to G. Ben Thompson, a former boyfriend of hers who is a real-estate developer in South Carolina, Smith wanted to put him down as the father on the birth certificate, but he refused. Thompson also was not convinced the baby was his because he had a vasectomy. Although Stern is named as the father on the earlier certificate, Bahamian attorney signed his name where Stern's signature should have been. This discrepancy made the birth certificate invalid so that it could be possible for a new birth certificate to be asked for and a DNA test sought to determine the father's identity.Anna Nicole Baby's Certificate Invalid?: Bahamian Lawyer Says Wrong Signature Could Force DNA Test Request , The Showbuzz, March 6, 2007 In April 2007 following the official results of the paternity test, Birkhead changed his daughter's surname to his last name, renaming her Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead.  Paternity case and burial proceedings  On February 21, 2007 hearings commenced in Broward County Circuit court in Florida over the disposition of Anna Nicole Smith's remains. Larry Birkhead petitioned the court to ask Howard K. Stern to submit to a DNA test on February 20, 2007, but at the time Howard K. Stern stated he was not willing to do so in a closed conference with Judge Larry Seidlin. The judge had put off the paternity question until after the issue of the location of Anna‚Äôs burial was decided. Judge Seidlin awarded custody of Smith's body to lawyer, the guardian ad litem for Dannielynn. Judge Seidlin declared that Smith should be buried in the Bahamas next to her late son. At the request of Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, a Bahamian judge issued a temporary injunction preventing Stern from taking Smith's daughter out of the Bahamas. A Florida Appeals court had suspended a lower court ruling that would have allowed the Smith's burial in the Bahamas. The Fourth District Court of Appeals in Florida, granted an emergency petition by Smith's mother to stop a court appointed guardian for Smith's daughter from taking the body to the Bahamas. \\"Another delay to Anna Nicole's burial\\". The Sydney Morning Herald, February 27, 2007. In March 2007, Smith was buried in the Bahamas next to her late son Daniel Wayne Smith after Virgie Arthur lost an appeal against judge Seidlin's ruling. \\"Anna Nicole buried next to 20-year-old son in Bahamas\\".

When the question came up, Birkhead denied receiving money for media interviews, though he has received royalties for archived pictures he took of Smith. According to Birkhead's testimony on February 21, 2007 while on the stand, he and Smith dated on and off from August 2005 to February 2006. = Howard K. Stern = Stern was Smith's attorney who was named executor of her will which was drafted in 2001 by Eric James Lund, Esq. During the case, Stern denied that he had received money from media interviews he has conducted since Smith's death, though he admitted that he gave an interview to Entertainment Tonight on a flight that the show chartered immediately after her death.

Following the death of the baby's half-brother Daniel Wayne Smith, Smith put his name on the disputed second birth certificate issued for the baby then known as Hannah Rose.More On The Battle Over Anna Nicole Smith's Body; The Bodyguard Speaks Out, CNN.com Larry King Live, February 23, 2007 Stern's sister, Bonnie, says Smith told her months before the birth that Birkhead could be the father. \\"When I spoke to (Smith) in March, when she found out she was pregnant, I took her shopping, and she told me the baby was due in mid-October, and that one other person could have been the father and that was Larry Birkhead, but nobody else.\\"Howard Stern's sister: Smith unsure of paternity, USA Today, February 14, 2007 = Fr√©d√©ric Prinz von Anhalt = Fr√©d√©ric Prinz von Anhalt, the husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor at the time, claimed that he had Smith as a mistress for 10 years. He was quoted as saying that he could potentially be the father of Smith's daughter and said he would file a lawsuit if Dannielynn was turned over to Stern or Birkhead by the courts.Gabor Husband may be Smith's baby's dad , Associated Press, February 9, 2007 According to the Associated Press, on February 12, 2007 Prinz von Anhalt announced that he would file a paternity claim and that his marriage likely would be over if his claims of parentage prevailed.Gabor's Husband to File Claim for Baby On February 15, 2007, he filed legal documents at a courthouse in Santa Monica, California seeking a DNA test to determine if he was the father of the baby.Frederic von Anhalt Santa Monica courthouse photo , Daylife, February 15, 2007 On February 20, 2007, he took a lie detector test in his attorney's office in Los Angeles. Prinz von Anhalt passed three lie detector tests that week, according to his attorney. The tests included questions about whether he had an affair with Smith and whether he could possibly be the child's father.Frederic von Anhalt lie detector test photo , Daylife, February 20, 2007 On March 23, 2007, he submitted a DNA sample to a Los Angeles clinic even though he was not involved in the paternity suit between Stern and Birkhead. He did not have a sample of the baby's DNA to analyze against, nor did he have a court order to submit to testing, but had stated that he wanted to be prepared if his paternity case had continued.Frederic Von Anhalt Offers DNA Sample , The Insider, March 23, 2007 On April 10, 2007 after the paternity test results were made public, representatives of Prinz von Anhalt released this statement wishing Birkhead well with raising the baby: \\"We never intended to take Dannielynn from anyone, we were just here in case Prinz von Anhalt was the father. We wish Larry luck in raising Dannielynn and we wish him the best.\\"Prince to Birkhead: Good Luck With the Baby, TMZ.com, April 10, 2007  Potential paternity  Alexander Denk = Denk is an Austrian-American film actor and was the personal bodyguard of Anna Nicole Smith until her death on February 8, 2007. Denk, according to his attorney in a joint television interview, also said that he was Smith's confidant, worked for her as her personal trainer, and also was her bodyguard and chef. Denk is also friends with Stern. In the interview with Julie Banderas, Denk said he and Smith were in a relationship and that he knew her for five and a half years. He added that they were intimate on and off for five years.Anna Nicole's Bodyguard: I Could Be Dad, FoxNews.com The Big Story w/ John Gibson, February 16, 2007 He reportedly told the entertainment news show Extra that he had an affair with his former employer and that it was possible he could be the baby's father. On the show he claimed he and Smith had a passionate love affair that lasted for two years and that Smith suffered from life-threatening seizures, for which she was on medication. When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, \\"She always told me she wanted to have her kids with me.\\" Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith \\"always told me I want you to be there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because I took care of Anna with her health and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy. And also this thing about the dieting and stuff, she doesn't want her baby to be overweight and obese. She wants to make sure she is healthy.\\" = J. Howard Marshall = J. Howard Marshall II, also deceased, was Smith's second husband. In February 2007, the New York Daily News claimed to have seen an unpublished manuscript by Donna Hogan, Smith's younger half-sister, saying that Smith had become pregnant by Marshall: \\"To her family, she hinted that she had used the old man's frozen sperm, and would be giving birth to Marshall's child\\". However, the publisher of Hogan's book, Train Wreck, described the newspaper's claims as a hoax.  Paternity case results  On April 10, 2007, Dr. Michael Baird, who analyzed the results of a March 21 DNA test, announced the results outside the Bahamian courthouse that Birkhead is confirmed at 99.99% to be the father of the baby. Although DNA tests revealed Birkhead is the father, final custody of the baby remains unresolved. \\"I hate to be the one to say this but...I told you so,\\" Birkhead told reporters and tourists waiting outside the courthouse in Nassau after a judge ruled behind closed doors that he was the biological father of Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, who was born on the island September 7.

Although the class has only existed for about 130 years, the boats are a continuance of a tradition of boat and ship design in Bermuda that stretches back to the earliest decades of the 17th century. Bermuda rig Bermudian work boats racing. They feature the Bermuda rig, also used on the larger Bermuda sloop ships. These workboats, effectively scaled-down models of the seagoing sloops, were themselves scaled-down to produce the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy. The Bermuda rig, also known as a Marconi rig, refers to a configuration of mast and rigging with a triangular sail set aft of the mast with its headsail raised to the top of the mast. Its luff runs down the mast and is normally attached to the mast for its entire length. The sail's tack is attached at the base of the mast; its foot controlled by a boom; and its clew attached to the aft end of the boom, which is controlled by its sheet. In many early Bermudian vessels there were no booms, or only the outward corner of the mainsail might be attached to the boom, as is the case with Bermuda Fitted Dinghies. On traditional Bermudian designs, the mast was raked, and a long bowsprit was fitted, to which more than one jib might be fastened. This rig evolved on boats and small ships built in Bermuda throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, and had matured into its more or less modern form by the early 19th century. Although the rig became almost universally used on yachts and small boats during the 20th century, the traditional designs used in Bermuda were too demanding to sail for small or inexperienced crews, and there are few vessels outside of museums that have a traditional Bermudian rig ‚Äì other than Bermuda Fitted Dinghies.  History  The development of the rig is thought to have begun with fore-and-aft rigged boats built by a Dutch-born Bermudian in the 17th century. The Dutch were influenced by Moorish lateen rigs introduced during Spain's rule of the Netherlands. The Dutch eventually modified the design by omitting the masts, with the yard arms of the lateens being stepped in thwarts. By this process, the yards became raked masts. Lateen sails mounted this way were known as leg-of-mutton sails in English. The Dutch called a vessel rigged in this manner a bezaanjacht (nl). Captain John Smith reported that Captain Nathaniel Butler, governor of Bermuda from 1619 to 1622, employed the Dutch boat builder, who quickly established a leading position among Bermuda's boat makers obliging his competitors to emulate his designs. A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda's boats in the following way: \\"With tripple corner'd Sayls they always float, About the Islands, in the world there are, None in all points that may with them compare\\". Advent of sail racing in Bermuda With the buildup of the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island, at the West End, and of the Army garrison, at first in the East End, at St. George's, though the military headquarters eventually moved to Prospect Camp at the centre of the colony, the idle navy and army officers, most ex-Public School boys, introduced a number of team sports to the colony. The best known of these were football, cricket, and rugby. At English schools and colleges many had also competed in rowing, and an attempt was made to introduce this sport to Bermuda, also. The rough, wind-driven Atlantic Ocean proved unsuitable, however, and the officers soon took to employing the local work boats for sail racing. These large sloops, with their crews, were hired for weekends, and sloop racing became very popular in Bermuda throughout the century. In time, sloops were designed and built specifically for racing, though they still relied on large, hired crews. The military officers were the driving force behind the creation of the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club (RBYC), in 1844, and, as with cricket, the sport developed an East End versus West End dynamic, resulting from the polar locations of the two headquarters. Introduction of dinghy racing By 1880 there was great concern that the need for professional crews in sloop racing was making the sport too expensive, and that its development was stagnating, as a direct result. Dinghy racing was developed as a cheaper alternative. When the Bermuda Dinghy first appeared is uncertain, but the design is scaled down from the earlier sloops, rather than appearing to be an evolution of the dinghies and small boats previously used for more mundane purposes. The first race was held on 26 August 1880. A number of types of smaller boats were raced in different classes. The dinghies were restricted to amateur crews. In 1882, the Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Association was formed, holding its first races on 28 July. This association ultimately became the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club. In 1883, Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria, visited Bermuda, and she donated a trophy which was awarded to the winner of a dinghy race held on 8 March, which was restricted to boats both owned and steered by club members. A purse race was held after, which was open to all amateurs. Dinghies for this race were restricted to hulls of of keel, and , 1 inch overall. Bermuda Fitted Dinghy The dimensions of the boats from the 1883 race have remained the standard ever since. Despite the small hulls, the dinghies carried substantial rigging. Although square topsails were reportedly in use in the 1880s, the form used today soon developed, basically scaled down from the larger sloops. One early example, the Reckless, was fitted with a mast, boom, bowsprit, and spinnaker boom. She carried 70 square yards of canvas going upwind, while the spinnaker increased this to 92 square yards running downwind. Original Bermuda Dinghies were roundbottomed and fitted with long, shallow keels so they would be easy to beach or could run over reefs without damage. During the first recorded race, held in St. George's Harbour in 1853, the existing boats were fitted with deep keel extensions fastened in place temporarily to give them the bite to sail better to windward. These metal keels (called fans) differentiated these racing boats from the \\"unfitted\\" working dinghies and gave the class its name. Racing Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda. The dinghy racing, today, is an inter-club activity, fought between the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club (RBYC), the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club (RHADC), the St. George's Dinghy and Sports Club and Sandys Boat Club. Whereas most of the professional crews of the earlier sloop racing, which has since died-out, were probably Black, the restriction of dinghy racing to these clubs, with their membership historically restricted to white people, means that Bermuda Fitted Dinghy racing has maintained an exclusive, all-white reputation in Bermuda. Although it is true that mounting a dinghy campaign requires significant financial and personnel resource, new entries are welcomed regardless of race, and many of Bermuda's best-known fitted sailors are black, including Stevie Dickinson and Glenn Astwood. The racing is carried out on set dates in a variety of locations including Hamilton or St. George's Harbours, Granaway Deep, and Mangrove Bay. The dinghies sail windward leeward courses and the number of legs is decided based on the conditions at race time. Boats always finish to windward. The boats, despite their small sizes, are each normally crewed by six people, necessary to handle the large areas of sail, and also to continually bail the dinghies, which have very little freeboard, and which are often capsized by powerful gusts. A unique rule to racing states that the number of crew to finish a race can be less than the number that started. This can encourage boats to have crew dive off the transom during a race to push the boat forward, help lighten the boat and increase performance. Boats As of 2011, 4 boats will be raced regularly during the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy season, although there have been rumours of other boats returning to the race course.

Throughout the years, Alfa Corse has competed in various forms of motorsport, from Grand Prix motor racing to touring car racing. Alfa Corse was officially formed in the beginning of 1938, after the racing department was moved back from unofficial factory team Scuderia Ferrari to \\"il Portello\\". Enzo Ferrari was still in charge of department, but left one year later to build his own cars under the name Auto-Avio Costruzioni. From 1961 Alfa Romeo factory racing team was run by Autodelta. Alfa Romeo was purchased by the Fiat Group in 1986, and in 1987, Giorgio Pianta was moved from the management of Abarth to restart Alfa Corse. After aborted attempts at producing the 164 Procar with Brabham and moving into the World Sports Prototype Championship, Alfa Corse settled on a return to touring car racing, starting with the Italian CIVT series, in 1992, with the 155 GTA. In 1993, Alfa Corse entered the DTM with the AWD V6-powered 155 TI, and created a Supertouring model, that would go on to win the Italian Superturismo, the BTCC and the Spanish Touring Car Championship. Alfa Romeo withdrew from the DTM (renamed \\"International Touring Car Championship\\") at the end of 1996, and Pianta was replaced by Francesco Galletto. When the 156 replaced the 155, it was developed for Supertouring and Superproduction classes, racing in the European Touring Car Championship. In 2001, Alfa Corse merged with Mauro Sipsz's independent firm, Nordauto Engineering, to form N.Technology.

However, in 1917, he would have been 20. Whatever his reason, he went to Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he joined the Royal Flying Corps. He had to renounce his American citizenship on May 25, 1917: > I was born in the town of Manitowoc in the state of Wisconsin, one of the > United States of America ...

After completing his training in England, he joined 79 Squadron in France. Flying a Sopwith Dolphin, Lord became an ace along with four other pilots in the squadron: Francis W. Gillet, Ronald Bannerman, John McNeaney, and Edgar Taylor. On June 27, 1918, Lord shot down an Albatros D.V as his third kill. On his return to the airfield, he saw an allied formation engaged with several Pfalz scouts. He joined in and shot down a Fokker Dr.I, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.Distinguished Flying Cross citation; Supplement to the London Gazette, 2 November 1918 He rose to the position of flight commander before being wounded in October.

Lord was keen to write, and penned several articles on his experiences during the many wars in which he participated. There is no evidence any of these pieces were ever published. This manuscript, entitled So I'm a Military Prostitute, chronicles his experiences as a so-called soldier for hire (but actually a dedicated sympathizer) fighting alongside the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War.

Ludwig Thiersch ( Munich, April 12, 1825 ‚Äì id. May 10, 1909\\"Thiersch\\", Meyers Konversations-Lexikon) was a German painter, primarily of mythological and religious subjects and especially of ecclesiastical art, also influential in Greece. Early life Thiersch was born in Munich, the son of classicist and philhellene Friedrich Thiersch, and brother of surgeon Karl Thiersch and theologian H. W. J. Thiersch. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich to study sculpture, but after a few years turned to painting, in which he became a student of Heinrich Maria von Hess, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, and Karl Schorn. After the Academy, he painted a depiction of Sakuntala (1848) and a scene of Camisards, and then traveled to Rome, where he sketched scenes from daily Italian life and painted Hiob unter seinen Freunden. In Athens, 1852‚Äì1855 Alaric I in Athens by Ludwig Thiersch, 1894 In 1852, he traveled with his father to Athens, where he replaced Rafaello Ceccoli at the Athens School of Fine Arts and became interested in Byzantine art.Pollali He painted several frescoes in Greek churches, and was at the forefront of a movement to \\"modernize\\" Byzantine art by introducing elements from Western art such as naturalistic perspective and anatomy.Danos, p. 79 In this, he is sometimes credited with discovering Byzantine art for the world of modern art,Lydakis, p. 86; as cited by Pollali but such reform was controversial in Greece, finding fierce opposition from those opposed to what they saw as attempts to replace longstanding Greek traditions with foreign ones. Several newspaper editorials opposed Thiersch's appointment as Professor, and continued to oppose his receipt of commissions to paint church frescoes. However, Westernizing reforms were favored by the Bavarian monarchy of King Otto, as well as by Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, a prominent architect and head of the Athens Polytechnic, and so his opponents were largely unsuccessful. Among Thiersch's pupils during his years in Athens was Kleoniki Gennadiou and most notably Nikolaos Gyzis,Lydakis, p. 186; as cited by Pollali who would become one of the best-known Greek painters of the 19th century, and who would manage to engage Western traditions while still producing art seen as authentically Greek.Danos, pp. 90‚Äì93 Thiersch's most notable fresco in Athens is in the Church of Saint Nikodimos.Kyriakos, pp. 87‚Äì88 Vienna, Rome, Saint Petersburg, Bavaria, and London Through the rest of his life, Thiersch traveled from city to city, being employed alternately to paint church frescoes and to produce oil paintings for private patrons. His church art is particularly notable, and together with Ludwig Seitz and Jean- Hippolyte Flandrin, he is considered to have led a revival in western European ecclesiastical art. In 1856, Thiersch was appointed to a position in Vienna, where he continued to paint church frescoes. During this period Theophil Freiherr von Hansen, a Danish-Austrian architect who had also spent time in Greece and taken up an interest in Byzantine art, was rebuilding Vienna's Fleischmarkt Greek Church in a neo-Byzantine style, and Thiersch was commissioned along with Karl Rahl to supply frescoes for the interior.\\"Wien (Kirchen, Profanbauten)\\", Meyers Konversations-Lexikon Following the position in Vienna, Thiersch was employed in Rome by Simon Sinas, a Greek philanthropist, for whom he produced a number of works on mythological and religious subjects, including Charon als Seelenf√ºhrer, Bakchos' Einzug in den Hain von Kolonos, and Thetis' Klage um Achilleus. In 1860, he went to Saint Petersburg, where he painted frescoes and icons in the chapels of Grand Duke Nicholas and Grand Duke Michael, and in the Protestant Church of Saint Catherine. After his return to Germany, Thiersch painted Auferweckung der Tochter des Jairus und Christus in Gethsemane (1866) for the Stiftskirche in Kempten, as well as Predigt des Paulus auf dem Areopag, and in the following years a number of other works, including Christus am Teich Bethesda, Ceres, die ihre Tochter sucht, Christus in der W√ºste, Alarich in Athen als Sieger gefeiert, and Kreuztragung Christi. St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Paris Some years later, Thiersch painted the icons in the iconostasis of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sophia in London (consecrated 1882),Bianco and of St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Church in Paris (consecrated 1895).

The Egyptian Kingdom) was the Egyptian state established under the Muhammad Ali dynasty in 1922 following the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence by the United Kingdom. Until the Anglo- Egyptian treaty of 1936, the Kingdom was only nominally independent, since the British retained control of foreign relations, communications, the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Between 1936 and 1952, the British continued to maintain military presence and political advisers, at a reduced level. The legal status of Egypt had been highly convoluted, due to its de facto breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in 1805, its occupation by Britain in 1882, and its transformation into a sultanate and British protectorate in 1914. In line with the change in status from sultanate to kingdom, the Sultan of Egypt, Fuad I, saw his title changed to King of Egypt. The kingdom's sovereignty was subject to severe limitations imposed by the British, who retained enormous control over Egyptian affairs, and whose military continued to occupy the country. Throughout the kingdom's existence, the Sudan was formally united with Egypt. However, actual Egyptian authority in the Sudan was largely nominal due to Britain's role as the dominant power in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. During the reign of King Fuad, the monarchy struggled with the Wafd Party, a broadly based nationalist political organization strongly opposed to British domination, and with the British themselves, who were determined to maintain control over the Suez Canal. Other political forces emerging in this period included the Communist Party (1925), and the Muslim Brotherhood (1928), which eventually became a potent political and religious force. King Fuad died in 1936 and Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the Kingdom of Italy's recent invasion of Abyssinia, he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt, except in the Suez Canal Zone (agreed to be evacuated by 1949). The kingdom was plagued by corruption, and its citizens saw it as a puppet of the British. This, coupled with the defeat in the 1948‚Äì1949 Palestine War, led to the Egyptian coup of 1952 by the Free Officers Movement. Farouk abdicated in favour of his infant son Fuad II. In 1953 the monarchy was formally abolished and the Republic of Egypt was established. The legal status of Sudan was only resolved in 1954, when Egypt and Britain agreed that it should be granted independence in 1956. Sultanate and Kingdom In 1914, Khedive Abbas II sided with the Ottoman Empire and the Central Powers in the First World War, and was promptly deposed by the British in favour of his uncle Hussein Kamel. Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt, which had been hardly more than a legal fiction since 1805, now was officially terminated. Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt, and the country became a British Protectorate.  Aftermath of World War I  A group known as the Wafd (meaning \\"Delegation\\") attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 to demand Egypt's independence. Included in the group was political leader, Saad Zaghlul, who would later become Prime Minister. When the group was arrested and deported to the island of Malta, a huge uprising occurred in Egypt. From March to April 1919, there were mass demonstrations that turned into uprisings. This is known in Egypt as the First Revolution. British repression of the anti-occupation riots led to the death of some 800 people. In November 1919, the Milner Commission was sent to Egypt by the British to attempt to resolve the situation. In 1920, Lord Milner submitted his report to Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, recommending that the protectorate should be replaced by a treaty of alliance. As a result, Curzon agreed to receive an Egyptian mission headed by Zaghlul and Adli Pasha to discuss the proposals. The mission arrived in London in June 1920 and the agreement was concluded in August 1920. In February 1921, the British Parliament approved the agreement and Egypt was asked to send another mission to London with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty. Adli Pasha led this mission, which arrived in June 1921. However, the Dominion delegates at the 1921 Imperial Conference had stressed the importance of maintaining control over the Suez Canal Zone and Curzon could not persuade his Cabinet colleagues to agree to any terms that Adli Pasha was prepared to accept. The mission returned to Egypt in disgust. In December 1921, the British authorities in Cairo imposed martial law and once again deported Zaghlul. Demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, the UK recognized Egyptian independence in 1922, abolishing the protectorate, and converting the Sultanate of Egypt into the Kingdom of Egypt. Sarwat Pasha became prime minister. British influence, however, continued to dominate Egypt's political life and fostered fiscal, administrative, and governmental reforms. Britain retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan, and Egypt's external protection' the police, army, the railways and communications' the protection of foreign interests, minorities and the Sudan pending a final agreement. Representing the Wafd Party, Zaghlul was elected Prime Minister in 1924. He demanded that Britain recognize the Egyptian sovereignty in Sudan and the unity of the Nile Valley. On November 19, 1924, the British Governor-General of Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated in Cairo and pro-Egyptian riots broke out in Sudan. The British demanded that Egypt pay an apology fee and withdraw troops from Sudan. Zaghlul agreed to the first but not the second and resigned.  Recognition  King Farouk I, 1936-1952. With nationalist sentiment rising, Britain formally recognized Egyptian independence in 1922, and Hussein Kamel's successor, Sultan Fuad I, substituted the title of King for Sultan. However, British occupation and interference in Egyptian affairs persisted. Of particular concern to Egypt was Britain's continual efforts to divest Egypt of all control in Sudan. To both the King and the nationalist movement, this was intolerable, and the Egyptian Government made a point of stressing that Fuad and his son King Farouk I were \\"King of Egypt and Sudan\\".Michael T. Thornhill, \\"Informal Empire, Independent Egypt and the Accession of King Farouk.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 38#2 (2010): 279-302.  World War II  Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region, especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany. Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean, especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia.Steve Morewood, The British Defence of Egypt, 1935-40: Conflict and Crisis in the Eastern Mediterranean (2008). The government of Egypt, and the Egyptian population, played a minor role in the Second World War. When the war began in September 1939, Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. It did not declare war on Germany, but the Prime Minister associated Egypt with the British war effort. It broke off diplomatic relations with Italy in 1940, but never declared war, even when the Italian army invaded Egypt. King Farouk practically took a neutral position, which accorded with elite opinion among the Egyptians. The Egyptian army did no fighting. It was apathetic about the war, with the leading officers looking on the British as occupiers and sometimes holding some private sympathy with the Axis.S. K. Rothwell, \\"Military Ally or Liability? The Egyptian Army 1936‚Äì1942.\\" Army Quarterly & Defence Review 128#2 (1998): 180-7. In June 1940, the King dismissed Prime Minister Aly Maher, who got on poorly with the British. A new coalition government was formed with the Independent Hassan Pasha Sabri as Prime Minister.John Marlowe, A History of Modern Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Relations, 1800-1953 (1954) pp. 313‚Äì15. Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942, the ambassador Sir Miles Lampson, pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafd-coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha's government. On the night of 4 February 1942, British troops and tanks surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum. Farouk capitulated, Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter. However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk, and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the Egyptian military.Marlowe, A History of Modern Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Relations, 1800-1953 (1954) pp. 315‚Äì19.  Post War Period  Most British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947 (although the British army maintained a military base in the area), but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the War. Anti-monarchy sentiments further increased following the disastrous performance of the Kingdom in the First Arab-Israeli War. The 1950 election saw a landslide victory of the nationalist Wafd Party and the King was forced to appoint Mostafa El-Nahas as the new Prime Minister. In 1951 Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal. As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base, announced a boycott of British goods, forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks. The situation turned the area around the Suez Canal into a low level war zone. On 24 January 1952, Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal, during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas. In response, on 25 January, General George Erskine sent British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia and gave the policemen an hour to surrender their arms in the grounds. The police were arming the guerrillas. The police commander called the Interior Minister, Fouad Serageddin, Nahas's right-hand man, who was smoking cigars in his bath at the time, to ask if he should surrender or fight. Serageddin ordered the police to fight \\"to the last man and the last bullet\\". The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed together with 3 British soldiers. The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt. The next day, 26 January 1952, was \\"Black Saturday\\", as the anti-British riot was known. It saw much of downtown Cairo which the Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris, burned down. Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot, and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day and replaced by Aly Maher Pasha.  Dissolution  On July 22 ‚Äì July 23, 1952, the Free Officers Movement, led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, launched a coup d'√©tat (Egyptian Revolution of 1952) against the king. Farouk I abdicated the throne to his son Fouad II, who was, at the time, a seven months old baby; the Royal Family left Egypt some days later and Council of Regency, led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was formed. The Council, however, held only nominal authority and the real power was actually into the hands of the Revolutionary Command Council, led by Naguib and Nasser. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers' riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953. Naguib was proclaimed as President, while Nasser was appointed as new Prime Minister.

The group released six albums before their breakup in 2002, attributed to the feud between Seo and fellow female member Lee Ji-hye. Seo Ji-young bullied fellow member Lee Ji-hye until the company was forced to disband S#arp. S#ARP was a group that was created by member Seo Jiyoung's family, who at the time was one of the wealthiest families in the industry. It was also revealed that Seo Jiyoung wasn't happy when Lee Jihye was added to the group. During their time together in S#ARP, Seo Jiyoung would bully Lee Jihye daily, and would even invite family members to torment her as well. The group ended up disbanding in 2002 due to all of this, and Seo Jiyoung tried to pay off their manager to lie about the bullying. However, the manager refused the offer and exposed Seo Jiyoung for her actions. As a solo artist, she has released two albums, with her last one released in January 2007. Her singles include \\"Stay in Me\\" and \\"Hey Boy\\". Seo is married to financier Kim Kyung-gu, who is five years her senior.

It is located at a three-way intersection at the northern end of Sejongno. As a landmark and symbol of Seoul's long history as the capital city during the Joseon Dynasty, the gate has gone through multiple periods of destruction and disrepair. The most recent large-scale restoration work on the gate was finished and it was opened to the public on August 15, 2010.\\"Restored royal gate Gwanghwamun unveiled,\\" Korea Times. August 15, 2010. History Gwanghwamun was first constructed in 1395 as the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, the main and most important royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty. During the 1592 Japanese invasion, it was destroyed by fire and left in ruins for over 250 years. \\"Introduction,\\" Gyeongbokgung, the Main Palace of the Joseon Dynasty. \\"Gyeongbok Palace,\\" Life in Korea. Concrete Gwanghwamun with the Japanese Governor General Building, which stood until 1996. Gwanghwamun was reconstructed in 1867 along with the rest of Gyeongbokgung Palace by the order of regent Daewongun during the reign of Emperor Gojong. The gate stood until 1926, when the Japanese government had it deconstructed and moved it just to the southeast of the current location of the National Folk Museum of Korea to make way for the massive Japanese Governor General Building. The Korean War completely destroyed the wooden structure of Gwanghwamun, and its stone base lay in complete disrepair and neglect. In 1968, during Park Chung-hee's administration, the stone base was again relocated in front of the Japanese Governor General Building. The destroyed wooden structure was rebuilt in concrete, while the sign on Gwanghwamun was written in hangul by Park himself. Gwanghwamun remained as a concrete gate until late 2006. Restoration Gwanghwamun underwent a major restoration project since December 2006 and was finished in August 2010. The gate was disassembled and moved back to its original location 14.5 meters to the south, and its wooden structure was again reconstructed in wood. It was rotated in order to accurately place the gate to its original location, which perfectly aligns it with the main north-south axis of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The restoration was commenced by the South Korean government because an earlier restoration employed concrete instead of traditional materials and wrongly aligned the gate to the entrance of the Governor General Building, now destroyed. The aim of the latest renovation was to restore Gwanghwamun to its original wooden construction while paying meticulous attention to historical accuracy. The name plate of Gwanghwamun was recreated by analyzing its century-old glass plate photographs, while its wooden structure was devised from a blueprint created in 1925 by the Japanese Colonial Government. Pine wood used in the construction was painstakingly selected in Korea as the use of foreign imported wood for recreating Korea's historic buildings was strictly forbidden. Gwanghwamun wooden name plate in Hanja in 2012 Gwanghwamun was opened to the public on August 15, 2010, to commemorate Gwangbokjeol, or Liberation Day of Korea. The project cost . A new name plate on the restored Gwanghwamun was unveiled on the same day. The name on the plate was based on Hanja lettering by Im Tae-young, the general in charge of the rebuilding programme by King Gojong of Joseon, written against a white backdrop framed by Dancheong traditional coloring painted by master Yang Yong-ho. The lettering was done by master Oh Ok-jin, using the gakjajang method of calligraphic engraving, a technique designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property no 106. However, cracks in the wooden plate were showing by early November, where a long vertical crack is visible on the left side of Hanja character \\"ÂÖâ\\" and beneath \\"ÈñÄ\\" in the middle. The Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) blamed the dry autumn weather for the contraction of the wood, but experts differs on that an immature pine board was used to meet the deadline for completion and that the wood had not dried properly. After many debates, a repair to the cracks was made, and the panel at CHA concluded in December 2010 that it should be replaced, hence the Government commissioned a new name plate. 13 wooden boards for the new signboard were cut in September 2011 and have since undergone a natural drying process in Gangwon Province. However, in a survey of 5,000 people conducted by the Cultural Heritage Administration, 58.7 percent responded that the inscription should be in Hangul while 41.3 percent opted Hanja. The long-lost 1395 original was written in Hanja. A majority of experts consulted thought the sign should be carved as the original had been. Tourism Gwanghwamun royal guard in 2018 The area in front of Gwanghwamun, known as the Gwanghwamun Plaza, was opened as a public open space on 1 August 2009. It is part of the Seoul Metropolitan Government's plans for environmentally friendly renovation projects such as the Cheonggye Stream and Seoul Plaza. In a poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, visitors stated that watching the changing of the guards at the main gate as their third favorite activity in Seoul. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held in front of the main gate every hour from 10:00 to 15:00. On 23 September 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts to the Sejong-ro intersection.

In the United States, the Okanogan Country is the western, lowland core of Okanogan County, which like its Canadian counterpart has a history and economy based on ranching, gold, fruit orcharding and vineyards, but the basin includes Lake Chelan and other flanking valleys. Communities in Washington's Okanogan Basin include Pateros, Omak, Okanogan, Oroville and Brewster. Almost 200 km long and 8000 km2 in area, the Canadian portion of the Okanagan watershed is approximately 2/3 the size of Vancouver Island. Okanagan Lake dominates the basin which contains many small lakes and watercourses. The Okanagan Valley was carved out by glaciers, and when the ice retreated approximately 10,000 years ago, the Canadian portion of the basin was filled with one huge waterbody, Lake Penticton. The Valley was scoured to something like its current state when an ice dam at the southern end of Lake Penticton melted, emptying most of the valley. The Canadian Environmental Grantmakers‚Äô Network considers the Okanagan Basin to be the most arid watershed in Canada, with an urgent need for effective water management.

He was elected Minister General of the Order. Life Born in Acquasparta, Umbria, he was a member of the Bentivenghi family, to which belonged his fellow Franciscan, Cardinal Bentivenga de' Bentivenghi, bishop of Albano (died 1290). Matthew entered the Franciscan Order at Todi, took the degree of Master of Theology at Paris, and taught also for a time at Bologna. Friar John Peckham having become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279, Matteo was in 1280 made Peckham's successor as Lector sacri Palatii apostolici, i.e. he was appointed reader (teacher) of theology to the papal Curia. In 1287 the General Chapter of the Order held at Montpellier elected him Minister General in succession to Arlotto of Prato. When Girolamo Masci of Ascoli, who had previously been Minister General of the Franciscan Order, became pope as Nicholas IV, 15 February 1288, he created Matthew cardinal with the titulus of San Lorenzo in Damaso that May. After this Matteo was made Cardinal Bishop of Porto, and penitentiarius major (Grand Penitentiary). He still, however, retained the direction of the Order until the chapter of 1289. Matthew had summoned this chapter to meet at Assisi, but Nicholas IV caused it to be held in his presence at Rieti; here Raymond Gaufredi, a native of Provence, was elected Minister General. As Minister General of the Order, Matthew maintained a moderate, middle course; among other things he reorganized the studies pursued in the order. In the quarrel between Pope Boniface VIII and the Colonna family, from 1297 onwards, he strongly supported the pope, both in official memorials and in public sermons. Pope Boniface appointed him, both in 1297 and 1300, to important embassies to Lombardy, the Romagna, and to Guelph Florence, where the Neri and Bianchi Guelph factions were violently at issue with each other. In 1301 Matthew returned to Florence, following Charles of Valois, but neither peace nor reconciliation was brought about. The Blacks finally obtained the upper hand, and the chief Whites were obliged to go into exile; among these was the poet Dante. In a famous passage of the Divina Commedia (Paradiso, XII, 124-26), Dante certainly speaks as a partisan of the Bianchi against Matthew of Aquasparta, calling Cardinal Matthew a sodomite. Matthew, however, had died before this, on 28 October, 1302. He was buried in Rome, in the Franciscan church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, where his monument is still to be seen.Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie de' Cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa (Rome 1793), p. 30. Works Matteo was a learned philosopher and theologian and a personal pupil of St. Bonaventure, whose teaching, in general, he followed, or rather developed. In this respect he was one of what is known as the older Franciscan school, who preferred Augustinianism to the more pronounced Aristoteleanism of Thomas Aquinas. His principal work is the acute Qu√¶stiones disputat√¶, which treats of various subjects. Of this one book appeared at Quaracchi in 1903, namely: \\"Qu√¶stiones disputat√¶ select√¶\\", in \\"Bibliotheca Franciscana scholastica medii √¶vi\\", I; the \\"Qu√¶stiones\\" are preceded by a \\"Tractatus de excellentia S. Scriptur√¶\\" (pp. 1‚Äì22), also by a \\"Sermo de studio S. Scriptur√¶\\" (pp. 22‚Äì36); it is followed by \\"De processione Spiritus Sancti\\" (pp. 429‚Äì53). Five \\"Qu√¶stiones de Cognitione\\" had already been edited in the collection called \\"De human√¶ cognitionis ratione anecdota qu√¶dam\\" (Quaracchi, 1883), 87-182.

She regularly appeared on the American version of the television series That Was the Week That Was. The TW3 Girl, as she was known, sang the show theme and special material.. Nancy is the founder and creative director of the Houston, TX based event and production company, Ward & Ames, which she founded in 1982. Personal life She was born in Washington, D.C., the granddaughter of Ricardo Joaqu√≠n Alfaro (1882‚Äì1971), who served as President of Panama from 1931-32. The daughter of a physician, she grew up in Washington. She attended Holton Arms School (https://www.holton- arms.edu/) and Bennett College, both of them for girls. By 1964 she was married to Romanian hypnotist Triaian Boyer. By 1968, they had divorced. After the divorce, she married Jay Riviere, a golf course designer. They had one child, a daughter, Nancy, but ultimately divorced. Ames has resided in Houston, Texas since 1972. She and her third husband Danny Ward are the co- founders of Ward and Ames Special Events. Career A folk singer with a partially Latin repertoire, she was signed to Liberty Records; her first album was entitled Cu Cu Rru Cu Cu La Paloma. She broke the top 100 twice in 1966; \\"He Wore the Green Beret,\\" her answer song to Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler's \\"Ballad of the Green Berets,\\" hit number 89, and later in the year \\"Cry Softly\\" also placed in the charts. She had a TV show which aired on KPRC-TV Channel 2 (the Houston area NBC affiliate) from 1972-77. She is listed as the co-writer of the theme song to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour with Mason Williams per Williams' own 1969 LP entitled Music by Mason Williams. Ames and Williams also co-wrote \\"Cinderella Rockefella,\\" an international pop hit in 1968.

Lord was born in Bingley. He studied piano with Ladislas Gorski in Montreux, Switzerland and the organ with Arthur Eaglefield Hull in England. A child prodigy, he started giving organ recitals at the age of 10 and began working as a church organist at the age of 11. He was organist at Barnoldswick, Lancashire, and at Settle, Yorkshire before moving to Brantford, Ontario in Canada in 1923. From 1923 until his death in 1945 he served as the organist and choirmaster at the First Baptist Church in Brantford and as the music director of the Ontario School for the Blind. In 1928 he founded the Canadian Choir of Brantford which he conducted until his death. The choir drew praise from critics both at home and abroad, making several tours to the United States and Europe. The choir notably gave performances at Albert Hall in London and at Carnegie Hall in New York City. The choir included in its repertoire several works written by Lord. In addition to his choral compositions, Lord also wrote several works for the organ and the piano, one symphony, the cantata The Battle of Morgarten, and a setting of Psalm 90 for baritone solo, choir, and orchestra. Lord was also a voice teacher. His most notable pupil was baritone George Lambert. He died at the age of 58 in Brantford. The National Library of Canada holds several of his papers.

It was released in 2000 in North America and in 2001 in Europe. Gameplay Looney Tunes Racing features different power-ups that are slightly unusual for the genre‚Äîinstead of random pickups as in most racing games, racers collect tokens of various colors which are used to charge various power-ups. Six power-ups are available, and only the current level power-up may be activated. Also available are environmental hazards, triggered by driving through an 'ACME gag-activation arch', generally aimed further ahead on the track. Looney Tunes Racing features nineteen characters (six default characters and thirteen unlockable characters). Looney Tunes Racing also features a unique soundtrack where the in-game music is randomly arranged using separate, randomized parts of each song in a three- segment pattern: A-A-B (segment A played twice and segment B played once, although some tracks like Desert Dash play the A segment once). Special segments are also played whenever the player goes uphill or downhill, runs over a boost pad, takes or loses the lead, and wins or loses a race. Championship The game features a season ('Championship') mode with three different levels, each with four (Rascal), five (Stinker), or six (Despicable) races. All tracks are unique. Each race features six racers, and awards ten points for finishing in first place, six points for second place, and four points for third place. Finishing in fourth place or lower requires the player to use a continue (of which he or she has three) to retry the race. Winning a championship unlocks a bonus level and a character. Winning the Despicable championship also leads to either a specific ending movie (for one of the starting characters) or a generic showing of the trophy (for the hidden ones). The ending movie shows the results of your character's wish, awarded by Smokey the genie (although he always congratulates them for winning 'the race', not the series). Single Race One can race on individual tracks, unlocked once they are won in 'Championship' mode. Also found here are three bonus levels won in 'Championship' mode. Acme Challenge These are fifteen special races divided into three 'floors' of five events each. The last event for each floor is a race on a short track against a secret character (Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, or Gossamer). The other four events range from collecting icons (gather a certain number of icons around an arena) to racing with specific conditions (no brakes, for example) to time trials. Winning each event recovers an artifact from the museum. Each event can end with failure or a medal for success: bronze (minimum win), silver (slightly tougher), or gold (toughest). Winning a medal on each event unlocks the next floor; winning a medal on all events on the third floor unlocks the 'Challenge' ending movie, where the Acme museum is (temporarily) reopened. Multiplayer Two players can either race, battle, or try 'Wacky', which brings up random events for the two to try. Note that in battle mode, the two most powerful powerups are deactivated for battle events. For race events, the bonus levels are replaced by the short speedways used in the challenge events.

It was the fifth and final iteration of the fifth generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (EL)‚Äîthe luxury-oriented version of the Falcon. The EL series served as the final chapter of the fifth generation \\"E-series\\" architecture, which began with the EA of 1988. Ford discontinued the car in 1998, and replaced it with the AU. Like its predecessors, the EL Falcon was widely favoured by Australian police and taxi operators. The EL remains one of the most popular Falcons produced.  Development  The EL served as a facelift of its predecessor, the EF Falcon, which began production in 1994. The \\"E-series\\" architecture can trace its roots back to 1988 with the EA. Ford spent million for the development of the EL. Ford introduced a number of improvements aimed at extending the life of the \\"E-series\\" body while the AU Falcon was being developed. Most of the handling and steering problems with the EF were rectified in the EL. Critics at the time stated the EF Falcon was hard to handle and it felt as if the front suspension of the vehicle was not optimally setup to work with the geometry of the live-axle rear end (the AU would be the first Falcon to offer an independent rear end). Ford addressed these concerns making the EL far more responsive than the EF (see below). At launch, it was the only Australian-built car equipped with a driver's airbag standard across the board, with a passenger airbag available as an extra cost option.  Facelift and upgrades  Compared to the EF, the most obvious visual change was the return of the front grille for GLi and Futura models. The grille itself was now elliptical in shape, a trait shared by other Ford models available at the time. The overall effect was to give the front of the car a rounded visual theme, continuing a shift away from the angular aero style of the early \\"E-series\\" models. From the rear, amber indicators were fitted on the base sedan models, with white lenses reserved for the luxury and station wagons. The performance models (XR6 and XR8) saw revised quad headlights. Ford Fairmont wagon. Compared to EB‚ÄìEF station wagons, ELs are differentiated by white as opposed to amber rear turn signals. Interior upgrades came in the form of reshaped seats and headrests, new colour schemes and switches. Third- row seating, a cargo barrier, and preinstalled wiring to accommodate mobile phone usage were made available as options for the station wagon variants. Additionally, all models were fitted with an advanced window film known as Smart Tint, which claimed to provide equivalent protection levels of SPF15 sunscreen. For improved vehicle refinement, thicker glass was installed to lessen wind noise and a further insulation was added in the dashboard to produce a quieter ride.  Engine  The EL introduced only minor running changes to the Falcon's base model straight-six engine, when compared to the radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air induction pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157 kilowatts (211 hp) and 357 newton metres (263 ft¬∑lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170 kilowatts (228 hp) to 185 (248 hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398 newton metres (294 ft¬∑lbf) to 402 (296 ft¬∑lbf). Ford Falcon Futura sedan. Amber rear turn signals on GLi and Futura sedans replaced the white EF lenses.  Handling and braking  The EL brought with it improvements to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With the introduction of the new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20 millimetres (0.8 in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain. Model range Interior, Falcon GLi Ten variants of the EL were produced, six-cylinder variants came standard with a five-speed manual, with the option of a four-speed automatic transmission. With the exception of the XR8, which could be purchased with the five-speed manual, all V8s were fitted with the four-speed automatic. ;Base models The GLi was the most basic model Falcon, selling well with fleets. Its features list was identical to that of the previous model, which included Ford's straight-six engine, with an option of upgrading to the Windsor V8. The slightly more equipped Futura features ABS brakes, front power windows, cruise control and a number of luxury features, like back seat headrests and an enhanced sound system. To distinguish it from the GLi, body-coloured components replaced the black plastic type. Regardless of the model chosen, an optional dual fuel tank could be fitted to run on both autogas and petrol, with the transmission limited to the four-speed automatic. ;Limited editions Falcon GLi Sapphire II sedan Ford introduced the Sapphire shortly after Holden debuted the VT Commodore in September 1997, in a bid to make the EL more competitive. The name was reused from the Ford Sierra Sapphire sedan sold in Europe and New Zealand. It was a limited edition model and had two variants based on either the GLi or the Futura, fitted with additional features, however the list differed depending on the base model chosen. All Sapphires had alloy wheels and metallic paint as standard. Other responses to the VT Commodore were the Classic and Falcon S models. Similarly to the Sapphire, they too were limited edition variants based on either the GLi or Futura. Standard for the Falcon S included a six-stack CD player, air conditioning, and alloy wheels which were identical to those fitted to the XR6 and XR8 models of the earlier ED Falcon range. Later, in March 1998, just before the launch of the AU Falcon, a Sapphire II was introduced. Falcon XR8 sedan Falcon GT sedan ;Sports models The biggest difference between the so-called \\"XR series\\" performance versions and standard models were the engines; the XR6 and XR8 boasted a six-cylinder and a V8 respectively. The V8 was later upgraded to output 185 kilowatts (248 hp) in October 1997. The upgraded transmission and exhaust system were unique to the XR range, as was the exterior styling with an XR exclusive quad headlamp assembly giving the vehicle a higher degree of aggression when compared to the look possessed by the other variants. Both models came standard with limited slip differential and specially tuned suspension. Body kits were also installed to improve the aesthetics and the aerodynamics. The first series of 824 XR8 models had the engine and 3.23:1 diff ratio with 15 inch alloy wheels. The second and last of the series numbered 784 examples and was equipped with a engine, shorter 3.45:1 diff ratio, 16 inch alloy wheels, big bore exhaust headers and the late model Explorer inlet manifold as standard. ;GT The GT had a Tickford Vehicle Engineering Ford SVO GT40 5.0 litre V8, producing 200 kilowatts (268 hp) of power due to the special SVO GT40 cylinder heads, a high compression ratio of 9.0:1, large valves, heavy- duty valve springs, roller cam followers, fuel injection with a large throttle body and exhaust extractors. The manual version had a heavy-duty clutch, strengthened gears and a short-throw gearshift as standard. Handling was improved with a larger anti-roll bar, urethane bushes, higher-rate springs and retuned front shock absorbers. The EL GT had a 3.45 ratio differential with a live axle and its top speed was around . Unlike what was first anticipated, the 30th anniversary EL Falcon GT was based loosely on the Fairmont Ghia rather than the XR models, with only 250 built for Australia - 135 were (4 Speed) automatic and 115 were (5 speed) manual. 15 extra EL GT Falcons were built for New Zealand and 2 of those went to South Africa. ;Luxury models Fairmont sedan Along with the base and sports models, Ford also marketed two luxury-oriented variants. The first of the two, known as the Fairmont employed the same six-cylinder engine as the Futura and GLi. Building on the equipment level of the Futura, the Fairmont gained, automatic climate control air conditioning, trip computer, power rear windows, oil pressure and battery level gauges, front and rear illuminated footwells, electric aerial and full velour interior. Exterior wise, a more prominent chrome front grille, a larger bonnet bulge, and differently shaped headlamps distinguished the Fairmont from other EL models, as did 15-inch, 12-spoke alloy wheels. The Fairmont was also fitted with chrome insert side body mouldings and carried over the tail light lenses from the previous EF model. The Fairmont Ghia offered a combination of luxury and performance, which was emphasised most effectively by making use of the six-cylinder engine fitted to the XR6, with the V8 remaining optional. Due to the implementation of a quieter exhaust, the Ghia suffered from a slight loss in output compared to the XR6. Limited slip differential provided better handling than the Fairmont, as did improved variable ratio power steering. Equipment wise, the Fairmont Ghia gained a more powerful, nine-speaker stereo system, a passenger airbag, thicker side glass for better sound absorption, wood-grain trim, chrome door handles and accents as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel, handbrake handle and leather upholstery. Externally, to differentiate the Fairmont from the Fairmont Ghia, the centre bar of the chrome front grille was colour-coded to the exterior paint, and 15-inch eight- spoke alloy wheels were fitted.  Motorsport  Glenn Seton's 1997 Falcon Stone Brothers Racing took first place in the 1998 Bathurst 1000 classic (the first held after the organisational split the previous year into Australian based V8 Supercars and European based Super Touring Cars) racing an EL Falcon driven by Jason Bright and co-driven by Steven Richards. This 1998 EL Falcon holds a significant place in Ford Australia's racing history as it was the only Falcon to take victory at the Bathurst 1000 in the decade between 1995 and 2005. Glenn Seton also won the 1997 Australian Touring Car Championship driving a Ford Credit sponsored EL Falcon.

Yerevan is defined as the state's capital. Power is vested in its citizens, who exercise it directly through the election of government representatives. Decisions related to changes in constitutional status or to an alteration of borders are subject to a vote of the citizens of Armenia exercised in a referendum. There are 117 articles in the 1995 constitution. On November 27, 2005, a nationwide constitutional referendum was held and an amended constitution was adopted.The Constitution of Armenia (27 November 2005) The constitution was amended again in a national referendum on December 6, 2015 that changed the political structure from a semi-presidential system to a parliamentary republic. According to the November 2005 Constitution, the President of the Republic appoints the Prime Minister based on the distribution of the seats in the National Assembly and consultations with the parliamentary factions. The President also appoints (or dismisses from office) the members of the Government upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister.The Constitution of Armenia (27 November 2005), Chapter 3: The President of the Republic, Article 55 . Given the constitutional powers of the president, Armenia can be regarded as a semi-presidential republic. Early constitutional history and drafting of the 1995 constitution Immediately after independence, the 1978 constitution, a replica of the Soviet Union's 1977 document, remained in effect except in cases where specific legislation superseded it. At the end of 1992, the president and the APM parliamentary delegates presented a draft constitution. They put forward a revised version in March 1993. Then, after nearly a year's work, a bloc of six opposition parties led by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) presented an alternative constitution in January 1994 that would expand the parliament's power, limit that of the president, expand the authority of local government, allow Armenians everywhere to participate in governing the republic, and seek international recognition of the 1915 Genocide. As 1994 began, observers expected a long struggle before parliament adopted a final version.  Structure of the constitution  The Constitution of Armenia consists of a preamble (preface) and 9 chapters. The Preamble sets out the general principles and aims of the constitution (the Armenian people, based on the fundamental principles and national goals of Armenian statehood enshrined in the Declaration of Independence of Armenia, carrying out the sacred aspiration of the restoration of its sovereign state, dedicated to the strengthening of the homeland, prosperity, civic solidarity, affirming adherence to universal values, adopts the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia).

Chapter 8. Adoption, Amendment and Referendum of the Constitution.  States that the Constitution shall be adopted and amended only by referendum, which shall be set by the President of the Republic upon the recommendation or consent of the National Assembly. Laws may also be adopted by referendum, which are subject to later amendment by referendum. Also defines the bases for a referendum.  Chapter 9. Concluding and Transitional Provisions.

Movement of the head causes the corks to swing, discouraging insects such as blow-flies from swarming around the wearer's head, or entering the nose or mouth of the wearer.

It has generated both attention and controversy. Publisher It was published worldwide except in China by Random House imprints (Crown Publishers in English, Random House Kodansha in Japanese, Random House JoongAng in Korean). In China, it was published under the title Ta Gai Bian Le Zhong Guo: Jiang Zemin Zhuan (, literal translation \\"He Changed China: The Biography of Jiang Zemin\\") by Shanghai Century Publishing Group, one of China‚Äôs largest publishing groups.The Man Who Changed China Reaction in China Virtually overnight, the Chinese edition became the number one bestselling book in China with sales of over one million and substantial publicity across the country including front-page features and magazine cover stories. The book is recognized as the first time that a biography of a living Chinese leader has been published on the Chinese mainland, and stories of its success and influence in China have run in the international press. The Wall Street Journal wrote: ‚ÄúHis [Kuhn‚Äôs] new book is a blockbuster in China, selling more copies here in a single month than any book since the last installment of ‚ÄòHarry Potter.‚Äô‚Äù The Washington Post reported that the ‚Äúwarm official embrace of Kuhn's book is unusual,‚Äù adding ‚Äúthe work represented his [Kuhn‚Äôs] own best effort to write a ‚Äòpersonal story as told by Jiang's family, friends and colleagues‚Äô that conveys Jiang's ‚Äòway of thinking‚Äô in the context of Chinese history and culture‚Äù. The Post described public reaction in China as ‚Äúmixed‚Äù, stating, ‚ÄúSome readers have praised the book for breaking a taboo against discussing the personal lives of high officials and for presenting details of Jiang's life that were new to them. Others refused to buy it, dismissing it as propaganda‚Äù. Reception to the English Edition The English edition was generally labeled political propaganda, an officially sanctioned portrait of Jiang, perhaps commissioned by Jiang himself, a book that was flattering or fawning and more autobiography than biography. Reviewing it in the September/October issue of Foreign Affairs, Sinologist Bruce Gilley drew an analogy: > \\"To write his biography, Mao Zedong chose Edgar Snow, a member of the U.S. > Communist Party; Jiang chose Kuhn, a member of the U.S. business elite. An > investment banker with a zeal for science, high culture, and business, Kuhn > personifies the new ideology that has swept through China since 1989.\\" Gilley added that > \\"Nothing better symbolizes Jiang and his cohort's transition to a right-wing > developmental dictatorship; every year, they carefully chip away at their > socialist heritage.\\" Writing in the January/February 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs, Kuhn responded to the charge that \\"Jiang chose Kuhn:\\" > \\"‚Ä¶The truth is almost the reverse. Jiang didn‚Äôt choose me; I chose Jiang. > The book was my idea; I planned it, financed it, and wrote it to trace > China‚Äôs story through eight tumultuous decades of trauma and transformation. > I had help‚Äîtranslators, researchers, editors‚Äîbut I maintained absolute > editorial control and made every editorial decision, and no one in China > ever thought otherwise‚Ä¶.\\" Kuhn stated that his \\"rendition of events, such as the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, differs markedly from that of the official Chinese media\\", stressing that it was his intention to \\"move beyond all the hype and bias about China so as to understand how Chinese leaders think.\\" Even though the Chinese edition was censored in that sentences or sections (largely of an internal political nature) were cut (but nothing of substance was added), the Chinese publisher still felt compelled to warn readers, in an upfront \\"Publisher's Note,\\" that \\"Certain viewpoints and opinions of the author, as a Westerner, bear a definite distance from those of our own. Hopefully the reader will understand.\\" Jiang's reaction When asked his own opinion of Kuhn's biography, Jiang Zemin told his close friend, Shen Yongyan (a primary source in the book), who then told the Chinese media that Jiang said: ‚ÄúHe [Kuhn] wrote objectively; he didn‚Äôt try to beautify me. But he got my wedding date wrong.‚Äù References Jiang Zemin 2005 non-fiction books American biographies Biographies about politicians Books about the People's Republic of China Propaganda ","title":"The Man Who Changed China"},{"id":"9555607","text":"Ruardean is a village in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, to the west of Cinderford. It is situated on a hillside with views west towards the mountains of South Wales. Little now remains of the village's industrial history, but once it was a centre for iron ore smelting furnaces, forges and coal mines. The Norman castle, now little more than a mound, commanded the shortest route from Gloucester Castle to the Welsh Marches and the Wye Valley. History The village has been, in times past, an important centre of iron and coal mining, though little evidence remains of this aspect of the village's history. The main historical landmark of the village is Ruardyn Castle, near to the parish church. In the past the village was spelt as Ruardyn and was part of Herefordshire. Nowadays the village lies inside Gloucestershire and is part of the Forest of Dean district. Like much of the surrounding area, Ruardean has historically been relatively poor; the 1831 census records 127 families, with half the population employed in agriculture and 160 people on poor relief. Today, St. John the Baptist's Church, dating from 1111 AD, is the village's centrepiece and main landmark, including a nave, chancel, tower and spire added in the 14th century and a chapel added in 1798. A manor house which once stood in the field behind the church was crenellated in 1310 to become Ruardyn Castle but this was largely destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's troops in the English Civil War. Ruardean's Congregationalist minister in the early 19th century was Reverend John Horlick. His relatives, James and William, were born in Ruardean and are today known worldwide for their hot malt drink Horlicks.Andrew Gardiner, The development of Horlick Malted Milk and Infant Food, The New Regard (Journal of the Forest of Dean Local History Society), no.27, 2013, pp.39-45 The shed in which they first developed the technique of producing dried milk with malt, in the 1860s, still stands behind the Malt Shovel public house on the high street.Ruardean - Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire \\"Who killed the bears?\\" A notable event in the town's history occurred on 26 April 1889. Four Frenchmen and their two bears were making their way to Ruardean, having performed in Cinderford. They were attacked by an angry mob, enraged by claims that the bears had killed a child and injured a woman. The bears were killed and the Frenchmen badly beaten. It soon became clear that the bears had not attacked anyone. Police proceedings followed and a week later 13 colliers and labourers appeared before magistrates at Littledean, charged with ill-treating and killing the bears and assaulting the Frenchmen. All but two were found guilty on one or more charges, with another convicted a week later. A total of ¬£85 () was paid in fines. A subscription was also launched which generously compensated the Frenchmen. The question \\"Who killed the bears?\\" was used for many years as an insult, directed particularly towards the people of Ruardean, despite the fact that all those convicted were from Cinderford. This caused a long-term feud between the inhabitants of the two towns.Information taken from 'Who Killed The Bears?', by Leonard Clark. Published by Forest of Dean Newspapers Ltd, 1981.Ruardean - Who killed the bears Education Ruardean's first school was established in 1774, providing 43 places in 1833.

Location  It lies near the middle of the Royal Forest, about three miles from Cinderford, and about two miles from Mitcheldean.  Population In the 2001 census, Drybrook had a population of 2,855. This includes 1,391 men and 1,464 women. There are 1,146 households in the village. By the 2011 census the population had increased to 3,052.  Amenities  The village has a range of amenities, including a butcher, chemist, general stores, hairdresser, post office, fish and chips shop, builder's merchant, doctor's surgery, nursery school, primary school, two garages, public house, off-licence, and a bus service to Gloucester and surrounding areas. The nearest secondary school is Dene Magna School, which is in Mitcheldean. Drybrook is also renowned for its rugby club, which is at the top of the High Street, and it also has a football club on Harrow Hill. Among the villages in the Forest of Dean, Drybrook has been voted one of the best villages to live in, for its scenery and leisure.  Education  Drybrook School, which is the village's only school, is a primary school for students of ages 4 years through 11 years. The nearest secondary school is Dene Magna Community School, which is in Abenhall, by Mitcheldean. Dene Magna Community School is about 1 mile from Drybrook.  Royal Forest  Drybrook is also known as a royal hunting ground, where the white deer, and, according to legend a black panther roamed. Unfortunately, the white deer was killed after being hit down and then trophy hunters cut off its head, but the police have not caught the person responsible. Drybrook also had a good supply of coal and stone. As Drybrook grew, so did its boundary, and it grew to include a small village called Harrow Hill (or as most locals call it, Harry Hill). The village's first modern church, The Holy Trinity Church, was built on Harrow Hill in 1817. The church's location is on the way to Mitcheldean.  Mechanical Organ Museum  The Mechanical Organ Museum is situated at the north end of the village, on the road to Lea and Ross-on-Wye. It has been called \\"a unique collection of mechanical music spanning the last 150 years, hidden away on the edge of the Forest of Dean. Mechanical organs, polyphons, pianola, automatic piano, electronic organs & musical boxes\\".  Climate  The Forest of Dean has been known for warm summers and cold winters. Some of the extremes that have been recorded in Drybrook are 36.6 ¬∞C in August 2003 European heat wave and -16 ¬∞C in January 2010. Snow and rain have also been a problem in the village: for example, in the winter of 2005, six inches of snow fell in a few hours, causing horrific traffic problems. And the Gloucestershire Floods of 2007 were also a major problem for the village. The averages are pretty much normal for Drybrook as they would be for most of the south of England, but in the winter it may change as Drybrook is on higher ground than other towns and cities in the surrounding area. For example, in January, the average high temperature in Drybrook is 3 ¬∞C while in Gloucester the average low temperature is 7 ¬∞C. Drybrook experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb). The information below is Gloucester's climate.

Brownell and Son, Publisher, p. 81 These are the m/94 (Model 1894) carbine, m/96 (Model 1896) long rifle, m/38 (Model 1938) short rifle and m/41 (Model 1941) sniper rifle.Jones, D: Crown Jewels: The Mauser in Sweden, pp. 37, 59, 81, 93. Collector Grade Publications, 2003. In 1898 production began at Carl Gustafs stads Gev√§rsfaktori in Eskilstuna, Sweden. All Swedish Mausers were chambered for the 6.5√ó55mm cartridge, and all Swedish-made actions were proof-tested with a single 6.5√ó55mm proof round developing approximately piezo pressure (55,000 CUP).de Haas, Frank, Bolt Action Rifles, Northfield, Illinois: DBI Books, Inc. (1984), , p. 31 Swedish Mausers were manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser AG in Oberndorf a/N in Germany and in Sweden by Carl Gustafs stads Gev√§rsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. All Swedish Mausers, whether built in Germany or Sweden, were fabricated using a Swedish-supplied high grade tool steel alloyed with nickel, copper, and vanadium, a product then noted for its strength and corrosion resistance. These rifles, like other pre-M 98 system Mauser rifles, lack the third safety locking lug at the rear of the bolt and feature \\"cock-on-closing\\" (similar to the contemporary Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle) instead of the \\"cock-on-opening\\" style found on the German Gewehr 98 and most subsequent bolt-action rifles. The rear sight was graduated for 6.5√ó55mm service cartridges from in increments. m/1892 Rifle and Carbine Submitted for Swedish trials were the M/1892 rifle and carbine based on elements of the m/1889 Belgian, m/1890 Turkish, and m/1891 Argentine Mauser rifles. One rifle is chambered in 8√ó58mmR Danish Krag caliber. One example exists in the Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland, US. m/1894 Carbine 6,5 mm Karbin m/1894 (m/1894-14 with bayonet mount)The m/1894 carbine was adopted in 1894 with the first 12,000 carbines being manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser in Oberndorf am Neckar, Germany. This series of carbines were all manufactured in 1895, and a very few spare receivers dated 1895 were received from Mauser Oberndorf's manufacturers \\"Ludwig Loewe & Company\\". Some of these spare receivers have been found built as complete m/1896 rifles with serial numbers falling into the regular m/1896 rifle ranges. It is speculated that these were replacement receivers that were later given the same serial number as the replaced receivers, though this is not yet confirmed due to the extremely small number discovered so far. Production in Sweden under license commenced in 1898. (The preparatory production development at Carl Gustafs stads Gev√§rsfaktori found a place in history by being the event that caused Carl Edvard Johansson to invent gauge blocks.) Swedish production continued sporadically until 1918. Very limited numbers were later produced with receiver dates of 1929 and more so 1932. The highest 1918 serial number noted is 111,002. The m/94 carbines have a unique serial number sequence beginning with 1. The highest number so far noted is 113,150 dated 1932. There have been no carbines noted with receiver dates of 1902, 1905, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912 and 1913. It may be surmised that carbines produced from the end of regular production in 1918 until 1932 numbered about 2,150. Mauser produced 12,000 m/1894 carbines between 1894 and 1896 and Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori 115,000 m/1894 carbines between 1895 and 1933, giving a total of 127,000 m/1894 carbines. Some carbines were lost from regular use by conversion to sub-caliber targeting & practice devices for artillery pieces. Sub variants m/1894-14 carbines have a steel nose piece, not dissimilar to the No.1 Mk3 Lee‚ÄìEnfield, with a protruding stud under the muzzle for the bayonet ring. There were two bayonets intended for the 94-14 carbine. The most prevalent was the m/1914 long bayonet. The second minor bayonet was the very long bladed m/1915 navy bayonet with the edge facing upwards. m/1894-67: This was an 1894 carbine modified to accept the m/1867 Yataghan blade saber bayonet. The modification involved a slot machined on the nose cap and a stud sleeve attached to the barrel. Numbers modified are unknown. Possibly only 100 or less. Several have shown up in the United States and one is known in the Netherlands. Skolskjutningskarbin, (literally \\"school shooting carbine\\"): This carbine was manufactured for Swedish civilian schools for student training. All of these school carbines carry the receiver date of 1901. This model deviates from the standard m/1894 carbine in several ways. The serial number is prefixed with S and runs S.1 to S.1161 and possibly a few more. The serial number appears as S.500 on the left side-rail of the receiver. The bolt handle is the same straight handle of the m/1896 rifle. The sling swivels are on the bottom of the stock just as on the m/1896 rifle. There is no bayonet attachment. Many of these carbines have been found rebuilt as standard m/1894-14 carbines and in one case as a Carl Gustaf m/63 target rifle (CG63). Kammarkarbin: also known as \\"gallery carbine\\". Unique serial numbers prefixed by K. Total number produced is unknown, with the highest reported serial number being K.193 currently in a private collection in the United States. One has been reported in Switzerland. Carbine K.91 is in the Carl Gustaf factory museum in Sweden. Other differences from the standard m/1894 carbine include the stock being dyed black. The rifling rate of twist is about 4 times faster than the m/1894 carbine due to the unique bullet and much slower velocity of the special cartridge intended for this carbine. The only two receiver dates noted so far are 1898 and 1901. 1894/96 Fortress Carbine: Another variant produced in unknown numbers and unknown years of production. This carbine is very similar to the standard m/1894 except in the manner of sling attachment. This carbine uses a sling attachment identical to the skolskjutningskarbin as the sling swivels are on the bottom of the stock instead of the side. The lower sling swivel is placed much further up the buttstock nearer the triggerguard than the m/1896 rifle. Weapons Officers Carbines: These standard m/1894 carbines were hand-built by weapons officers as part of their training. Instead of having serial numbers, the name of the weapons officer is the identifying \\"serial\\" mark. Most of the parts are marked with the two letters of the officer's name and in some cases with a + sign. These carbines are among the most valuable of collectible m/1894 carbines. The m/1894 carbine is still used today by the Royal Guards at Stockholm Palace. m/1896 Long Rifle Carl Gustav M96 rifle, bayonet, 2 different bayonet frogs and Swedish Cartridge Belt. The Model 1896 rifle in 6.5√ó55mm (6,5 mm Gev√§r m/96) was adopted in 1896 for infantry use, replacing the Model 1867‚Äì1889 Remington rolling block rifle in 8√ó58mmR Danish Krag. Swedish production (under license) started in 1898 at Carl Gustafs, but additional rifles were produced by Mauser during 1899 and 1900 because of delays in shipping additional production machinery from Germany to Sweden.Jones, p. 66 Standard production at Carl Gustafs continued until 1925, but approximately 18,000 m/96 rifles were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB during World War II for civilian marksmanship training.Jones, p. 76 Mauser produced 40,000 m/1896 long rifles between 1899 and 1900, Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori 475,000 m/1896 between 1896 and 1932 and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB 20,000 m/1896 between 1942 and 1944. Giving a total of 535,000 m/96 long rifles. m/1938 Short Rifle 6,5 mm Gev√§r m/1938. Shortened rifle m/1896, rebuilt in 1938‚Äì1940. The Model 1938 rifle (6,5 mm Gev√§r m/38) was adopted in 1938 as part of a worldwide trend (which began just before World War I) towards service rifles that were shorter in overall length than a standard infantry rifle, but longer than a cavalry carbine. Contemporary examples such as the Mauser Karabiner 98k, Short Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield No I Mk III, MAS-36, and M1903 Springfield were all noticeably shorter than a standard late 19th century infantry rifle, and with another war on the horizon the Swedes felt it would be expedient to adopt a shorter rifle for use by mechanized troops and the Navy. The original m/1938 rifles (Type I) were converted m/1896 rifles with barrels cut down by 5.5\\" (139mm) and almost always with the original straight bolt handles. These rifles are often referred to by collectors as \\"m/96-38\\" rifles, but there was never an official designation for this conversion.Jones, p. 82 The majority of purpose-built m/1938s (Type II) had turned-down bolt handles and were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB, with production ending in 1944. However, the Swedish military made no distinction in service between the two types.Jones, p. 83 Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori converted 55,080 m/1896 long rifles to m/1938 short rifles in 1938‚Äì1940. In addition to that Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB produced 88,150 new m/38 short rifles between 1942 and 1944. Giving a total of 143,230 m/1938 short rifles. m/1941 and m/1941B Sniper Rifles 6,5 mm Gev√§r m/1941 sniper rifle.The m/1941 and m/1941B sniper rifles were m/1896 rifles selected for accuracy and fitted with a telescopic sight, initially with the German AJACK 4√ó m/41 scope. Because of the deteriorating war situation Germany however stopped selling rifle scopes to Sweden, resulting in Swedish made AGA 3√ó m/42 and 3√ó m/44 rifle scopes (made by Svenska Ackumulatorfabriken Jungner) being used instead.Jones, pp. 95, 97 Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori converted 5,300 specially selected m/1896 long rifles to m/1941 sniper rifles in 1941‚Äì1943. The bolt handle of all m/1941 rifles was turned-down in order to provide clearance for unimpaired operation of the bolt handle or three-position safety catch lever with a telescopic sight mounted. Model 1896 Swedish Mauser in Finnish service during WW II Swedish volunteers by a destroyed Soviet tank in Finland during the Winter War. The soldier in the foreground carries a slung m/94 carbine. In 1940, Finland bought 77,000 M1896 Mausers from Sweden in 6.5√ó55mm. They were mainly used by second line units. Model 1896 rifles used by Finland in WW II can be recognized by a stamp with the letters SA (Suomen Armeija = Finnish Army) surrounded by a square with rounded corners. Most of the rifles were returned to Sweden after WW II but some remained in Finland.Schinke, Carsten - Die leichten schwedischen Infanteriegewehre Armee und Heimwehr - Journal-Verlag Schwendt Gmbh (1990) - page 59 End of service The m/1894 carbine and the m/1896 and m/1938 rifles were gradually phased out of Swedish service starting in the 1950s, although the sniper variants continued in service until the early 1980s. They were succeeded by the Ag m/42 semi-automatic rifle beginning in the late 1940s, followed by the Ak 4 battle rifle starting in the 1960s. However, some rear echelon logistic units were still equipped with m/1896 as late as 1983. The last unit to use m/1941(B) sniper rifles were the Hemv√§rnet (Home Guard) that replaced their m/1941(B) sniper rifles in 1995 by Ak 4OR rifles with Hensoldt 4√ó24 telescopic sights. The m/1894 carbine is still used for ceremonial and guard purposes by the Royal Guards. Civilian use Both the m/1896 and m/1938 rifles are highly sought after by military rifle shooters and hunters. The 6.5√ó55mm is an ideal all-round hunting rifle cartridge, as it has a flat trajectory, low recoil, and high accuracy. Many rifles in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Africa have been sporterized to make deer (or similar game) hunting rifles, and many firearms manufacturers, including SAKO, Ruger and Winchester, produce new hunting rifles chambered in this cartridge. Civilian rifles built on the Swedish Mauser action CG 63 competition/target rifle When surplus Swedish Mausers became available after World War II many m/1896 and m/1938 rifles were successfully converted by Carl Gustafs and Norma into the CG 63 Competition/Target Rifle chambered in 6.5√ó55mm and 7.62√ó51mm NATO. A number of CG 63 match rifles were acquired by the Swedish Army, with their rifles colloquially known as Gev√§r 6 if in 6.5√ó55mm and Gev√§r 7 if in 7.62√ó51mm. These competition/target rifles were used by members of the Swedish Volunteer Sharpshooting Movement Frivilliga Skytter√∂relsen (FSR) and are known to be very accurate for their price. The FSR strived to keep the costs of participating in their shooting events reasonable, so the FSR rulings restricted the unchecked use of very expensive highly specialized target rifles, ammunition and other gear. The CG 63 rifle was built on a Swedish Mauser receiver, to which a new heavy, non-stepped free-floating target barrel was fitted. The vertical thumb piece was removed from the bolt to improve lock time. The triggers were adjusted and smoothed to match quality and the rifles got diopter and globe sighting lines (from several Swedish manufacturers) and target stocks. The CG 63 was further developed into the CG 73 / CG 74, also called m/74, and finally the CG 80 competition/target rifle. The CG competition/target rifles complied and evolved with the technical and dimensional FSR rulings then imposed for FSR shooting events. Starting at the end of the 20th century the FSR allowed the use of competition/target rifles that are not based on the Swedish Mauser receiver. Husqvarna also made commercial m/1894 and m/1896 versions available as sporting rifles called Model 46 and its variants (Models 46A, 46AN and 46B) in 6.5√ó55mm, 9.3√ó57mm and 9.3√ó62mm. After World War II they used m/96 and m/38 actions without thumb notch to create the Model 640 series (646 in 6.5√ó55mm, 648 in 8√ó57mm, 649 in 9.3√ó62mm). These are not to be confused with the late-production Model 640 using FN Herstal M98 actions. Stiga also made sporterized versions in popular calibers, which are very well finished and balanced.

A recent survey indicated that the population of Clearwell is approximately 350. There are mines locally that date back over 7,000 years to the mining of ochre and are known as Clearwell Caves. Later, the Romans mined iron at Clearwell Meend. Iron production expanded in medieval times and peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, leaving a legacy of fine stone built buildings. Clearwell Castle, a 'mock' castle of Gothic architecture built in 1728, is located in Clearwell. History of the village The village of Clearwell began as a group of hamlets which coalesced to form the village. It formed around three roads which run down shallow valleys to a central junction. The hamlets on the three roads were Clearwell, Peak, and Platwell, with a fourth hamlet, Wainlete, to the north-west of Clearwell. Clearwell and Platwell had dwellings by around 1300. In 1462 fourteen houses were mentioned at Clearwell and Wainlete, thirteen at Platwell, and sixteen at Peak. Most of the houses that formed Clearwell village were replaced by stone cottages in the late 18th century and the 19th, although several older buildings survive, including the Wyndham Arms which is a substantial 17th-century house. In 1830 a chapel was built for Clearwell village at the east end, on the road leading to the Forest. It was replaced in 1866 by a new church built by the countess of Dunraven, owner of the Clearwell estate. The countess also built a village school in 1859 and opened a cottage hospital in 1869. Industry There were several iron ore mines at Clearwell Meend in the 19th century. These included Old Sling, New Dun, and Old Ham.Victoria County History, 1996, pp. 326-354 From the late 1960s Old Ham ore mine was developed, under the name Clearwell Caves, as a mining museum. Descent of the manor=Greyndour \\"Clower-Wall the seat of Francis Wyndham Esq.\\" Clearwell Court in 1712, as drawn by Johannes Kip. The building was rebuilt in 1728 by Thomas Wyndham and survives today with its name having been changed in 1908 to Clearwell Castlecrosses crosslet gules 2 and 3, as depicted on the 19th-century monument to Thomas Baynham (d. 1500) in the same church The first manor house at Clearwell was probably built by Robert Greyndour (d.1443), and probably consisted of a great hall, chapel and 12 chambers. Robert died without male issue and his daughter Elizabeth Greyndour (d.1452) became his heiress. His widow and Elizabeth's mother Johanna Rigge(d.1485) (or Rugge), daughter of Thomas Rigge of Charlcombe, Somerset by Katherine de Bitton, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Bitton of Bitton, Glos., under customary usage, retained until her death 1/3 of his lands as her dower, and married secondly Sir John Barre. She founded a chantry in nearby Newland Church called the \\"Chantry of Robert Greyndour\\" and left many charitable bequests in her will. She was buried with her first husband in the chantry chapel she had founded in Newland Church. Elizabeth had earlier married Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr (d.1450/1),Leaving a daughter Mary West. She married secondly, as his first wife, John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, KG, (d.1470), whom she predeceased giving birth to a son, who did not survive one day. Walwyn The manor thereupon passed to the descendants of Robert Greyndour's sister Johanna, who had married as her first husband William Walwyn. Their son was William Walwyn, whose daughter and sole heiress was Alice Walwyn (d. 1518), the second wife of Thomas Baynham (d. 1500), Constable of St Briavel's Castle. Baynham escutcheon on the 19th- century mural monument erected in Mitcheldean Church, Gloucestershire Alice survived her first husband, by whom she had a son Sir Christopher Baynham (d.1557), and married secondly, as his 4th wife, Sir Walter Denys (d.1505) of Alveston, Glos., Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1481 & 1492, who apparently came to live at Clearwell as his will was dated at Newland.Will of Sir Walter Denys, National Archives, PROB 11/15: Ego Walterus Denys miles de Alston nuper de Newlands in foresta de dene... (\\"I Walter Denys, knight, of Alveston, lately of Newland, Forest of Dean\\") Christopher's son was Sir George Baynham (d.1546), who married as his second wife Cecilia Gage, daughter of Sir John Gage. Sir George dated his will at Clearwell, 9 June 1546, and was buried at Newland. Throckmorton Clearwell was held by the Baynham family until the death of Thomas Baynham in 1611. His daughter Cicely, by his wife Mary Winter, daughter of Sir William Winter of Lydney, had married Sir William Throckmorton, 1st Baronet, (d.1628), of Tortworth, Gloucestershire, and Clearwell descended to their son Sir Baynham Throckmorton, 2nd Baronet (1606‚Äì1664), who married Margaret Hopton (d.1635), one of the daughters of Robert Hopton of Witham and sister of Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton, possibly through which connection the manor was purchased by a member of the Wyndham family. Wyndham In 1684 the manor was purchased by Francis Wyndham (d.1716) of Uffords Manor, Norfolk.English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic InterestKingsley, Nicholas, The Country Houses of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham, 1989, pp.78-9, Clearwell Castle Francis's grandfather Sir George Wyndham (6th son of Sir John Wyndham (d.1645) of Orchard Wyndham, Williton, Somerset) was an adherent to the Commonwealth during the Civil War and had served as a commissioner for raising the assessment under Thomas Fairfax, in 1644. Sir John's eldest surviving son had married Catherine Hopton, one of the daughters of Robert Hopton of Witham, and the sister of the wife of Sir Baynham Throckmorton, 2nd Baronet. George married after 1631 Ann, the widow of James Underwood (d.1631) of Uffords Manor (alias Egmers), Cromer, Norfolk, from whom he inherited Uffords. He married secondly Frances Davy. His son by Anne was Francis Wyndham, whose son by his wife Frances Davell was Francis Wyndham (d.1716).Rye, Walter, Cromer Past and Present, or An Attempt to describe the Parishes of Shipden and Cromer, and to narrate their History, London, 1889, pp.30-31 Clearwell passed to Francis's eldest son John (d.1725), then to John's brother Thomas Wyndham (d.1752). Thomas Wyndham demolished the house depicted in 1712 by Johannes Kip and built in its place the present neo-Gothic mock-castle, Clearwell Castle, designed by Roger Morris (d.1749). In the mid-19th century, the interior of the Court was refurbished by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven (d. 1870), wife of Windham Quin, 2nd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl (d. 1850) and daughter of another Thomas Wyndham, who held Clearwell from 1814 to her death in 1870, to the designs of John Middleton. The terracing of the gardens was probably also carried out at this time. Collins, Gardner, Vereker, Yeates In 1893 Clearwell was sold to Henry Collins, whose mortgagees sold it in 1907 to its then tenant Col. Alan Gardner. In 1908 the house was renamed Clearwell Castle. In 1911, it was sold to Charles Vereker (d.1947) (later Colonel), under whose ownership it suffered a major fire in 1929 but was restored. Following Col. Vereker's death in 1947, the property was purchased by Gloucestershire County Council which sold it on to a demolition contractor who removed the lead roof, floors and fittings.Kingsley 1992; Colvin and Harris 1970, quoted by Parks & Gardens The Castle was destined for demolition when in about 1952 it was bought by Frank Yeates, the son of a former gardener on the estate, who restored it. The Castle was again sold in the early 1980s and was turned into a hotel. From about 2000 it has returned to private ownership.

Early life Plakas was born November 9, 1960 in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents immigrated independently from Greece and later met in Chicago. Plakas has a younger sister. She learned to play the drums while in high school. Career=Early bands In the late 1970s, Plakas joined a punk band called Problem Dogs. Although she had never played drums before, she purchased a set and learned to play as the band practiced in the basement of bass player Algis Kizys's house. In the thriving Chicago punk scene, the band played sporadic gigs at places like Space Place and O'Banion's, opening for The Bangles at The Metro. They also released a single, \\"City Hall/ You Are The Knife\\", following the departure of Kizys in 1982. Plakas moved to the greater Los Angeles metro area in 1985. The band went through several personnel changes, with original bandmates Plakas, Rick Radtke and John Connors reforming as Pirate Radio after arriving in Los Angeles. L7 After witnessing her playing drums with Pirate Radio in 1987, a contact from LA Weekly informed Plakas that the punk rock group L7 was looking for a drummer. Two months later, after Donita Sparks contacted her, Plakas agreed to join L7. Once Plakas joined the band, L7 gelled and gained in momentum. Sparks stated ‚Äúwe found that sweet spot with Dee. That was a huge break for us. Because she was what we had been missing. She had the same sensibility as us: we‚Äôre punks but we‚Äôre doing hard rock.‚Äù She was given the name \\"The Goddess of Thunder\\" by her band mates. Plakas played drums on six of the seven L7 studio albums, including on the band's hit single Pretend We're Dead from 1992's Bricks Are Heavy. The band appeared on the main stage of Lollapalooza in 1994. In 1994, Plakas and her L7 bandmate Jennifer Finch performed with the Japanese musician Hide, also appearing on the original video for his song \\"Doubt\\".As seen on Hide's home video release, A Souvenir. Plakas appeared in the John Waters film Serial Mom as a musician and performer in the fictitious band \\"Camel Lips\\" in 1994. Plakas and L7 were the subject of a 1998 pseudo-documentary film by Krist Novoselic entitled L7: The Beauty Process. L7 disbanded in 2001 but was reunited again in 2014. Other projects During the hiatus when L7 was dormant, Plakas went on to play drums in solo projects by both herself and former L7 member Donita Sparks. In 2007-2008, Plakas toured with Donita Sparks and the Stellar Moments in support of the release of Transmiticate. Ken Tucker, then editor at large for Entertainment Weekly, stated that Dee Plakas \\"continues to drum with a fluid power\\" and \\"propells much of the music\\" on the album. Dee Plakas (left) performing with L7 in Vancouver, BC in 2019  L7 reunion  Original footage and interviews with Plakas can be viewed in the documentary film L7: Pretend We're Dead directed by Sarah Price, released November 2016. The film was nominated for a VO5 NME Award for Best Music Film. L7 released their latest full-length album Scatter the Rats on May 3, 2019 through Joan Jett's Blackheart Records. The album received generally favorable reviews. Plakas and L7 announced a six-week nationwide tour with a start date of May 10, 2019. In April 2019, Plakas reported that she was endorsed by Drum Workshop and had been using their Black Velvet kit on tour. Notable Stage Moments Plakas is perhaps most infamous for a contest held during a live show in London in 2000 in which L7 raffled off a one-night stand with her. The winner got to spend the night on the tour bus. Personal life In 1989, Plakas married musician and creative director Kirk Canning, who had previously played cello on Nirvana's Nevermind. She resides in Santa Monica, California.

Activism Mahmood Al-Yousif has adopted a series of socio- political causes including the \\"JUST BAHRAINI\\" campaign launched in 2006 which is aimed at desegregating the Sunni and Shiite population of Bahrain. Awareness of the cause is raised through the distribution of wristbands and badges with the campaign slogan \\"Not Shi'i, Not Sunni, JUST BAHRAINI\\". Amongst several other causes adopted by Al-Yousif is the promotion of freedom of speech in Bahrain and on the internet. In an entry entitled \\"It's Over\\" posted on his blog on October 8, 2008, Al-Yousif explained that he had decided to stop blogging and \\"move on\\". Legal Conflict Due to the Bahraini government, opposing some of his subject material, Mahmood Al-Yousif has found himself preparing for a legal battle after charges of libel were raised against him by the Bahraini Minister of Municipalities and Agriculture, Mansoor bin Rajab. In an article on his blog, Al-Yousif referred to the minister as \\"an insignificant member of the previous Shura Council\\" and criticized the way in which the minister and his ministry chose to deal with the flooding throughout the country brought about by heavy rains in December, 2006.Gulf Daily News, Blogger Gears Up for Court Battle, by Geoffrey Bew (February 14th, 2007) Mahmood Al-Yousif was interrogated by the police for three hours in February and was released on bail. He was told that the Minister would drop the charge against him if his article was edited; however, after the changes were made to the article, Mr. Mansoor bin Rajab refused to drop the charge. Al Yousif will be tried under the Press and Publications Law or the Penal Code, thus, he faces a maximum penalty of two years in jail and/or a fine. He has been summoned to attend the hearing for the Libel charges brought against him on April 17, 2007. The legitimacy of the charges brought against Al-Yousif has been called into questions by several Human Rights organizations in Bahrain and abroad, local and international media sources and several notable figures in Bahraini society. Bahraini police arrested Al-Yousif (along with others) after 3:00 am on March 30, 2011. The charges against him are unknown at this time Criticism of Government Officials Mahmood Al-Yousif has openly criticized several government employees in the past.

Yuri began her career as a teenage singer in her native country. In 1978 she released her first album titled T√∫ Iluminas mi Vida. She gained recognition as a result of her participation in the Oti Festival in 1980. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Yuri established herself as one of the most popular pop music singers in Mexico and Latin America. Her vocal quality and versatility allow her to be incorporated into other musical genres, ranging from pop to dance, ranchera and tropical music genres. Thanks to her success and influence, she came to be considered the \\"Queen of Latin Pop\\". In the mid-1990s, Yuri put a pause on her musical career and during some years she dedicated herself to the interpretation and preaching of Christian music and gospel. In 2002, she returns to commercial music with much greater impact than her first season as a pop singer. Since the mid-2000s and during this decade, Yuri has established herself as one of the most successful interpreters of Spanish music. She has released a total of 29 studio albums and has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Parallel to her role as a singer, Yuri has also ventured into acting. She has participated in some telenovelas and films and has served as a host in some television shows in her native country. In 2018, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences honored Yuri with a Grammy for musical excellence. Biography=Early life Yuridia Valenzuela Canseco was born on January 6, 1964 in Veracruz. She is the daughter of doctor Carlos Humberto Valenzuela and Dulce Canseco. She had two brothers, Carlos (deceased) and Yamily. During her childhood and in parallel with her training at the school in her native Veracruz, Yuri studied classical dance and won, in a competition at the age of 11, a scholarship to the Bolshoi Ballet of Russia, which did not take advantage because her parents prevented her. In compensation, her mother decided to promote her as a singer. Dulce decided to create a musical concept called La Manzana El√©ctrica. Yuri took singing classes in different spaces and the group debuted in 1976, performing in various local venues in Veracruz, where they performed covers of artists such as Michael Jackson and Janis Joplin. Given the local success and thanks to the charisma and popularity of Yuri, the group was renamed Yuri y La Manzana El√©ctrica. It was at this stage that Yuri became friend with the popular singer Celia Cruz, since Yuri and her band used to act as support band for Cruz's performances in Veracruz. During a presentation of the group, the director of art and repertoire, and arranger Julio Jaramillo Arenas, of the record label GAMMA, discovered the potential of the singer and proposed to record her first album. Her mother accepted the proposal, and from that moment on she became her manager. They moved to Mexico City, but without the financial support of the family. Julio Jaramillo produced her first album titled T√∫ Iluminas mi Vida, which included the Spanish version of You Light Up My Life, by the American singer Debby Boone, which was her first national single. However, the album did not achieve the desired success. However, Yuri gave the opportunity to perform her first acting work in the movie Milagro en el circo (1979), starring Mexican comedian Cepill√≠n and collaborated in the program En familia con Chabelo on the Televisa network. In 1979, Yuri participated in the OTI Festival, in the Mexican eliminatory, and was disqualified because the theme \\"Siempre habr√° un ma√±ana\\" was an alleged plagiarism of the song \\"MacArthur Park\\" of the American singer Donna Summer. However, the jury awarded her, by unanimous vote, the prize for the \\"Female revelation of the festival\\", in addition to being the youngest interpreter to participate in the festival. 1980s In 1980, and also under the production of Jaramillo Arenas, Yuri recorded her second album, Esperanzas, with which she achieved her first great commercial success with the theme Esperanzas. In that same year, she debuted as a television actress in the popular Mexican telenovela Colorina, starring Luc√≠a M√©ndez, for the Televisa network. Eventually she also acts in the telenovela Veronica, with Christian Bach. Heralbum was also released in Central America, South America, the Caribbean and the United States. The singles Primer amor, Goma de mascar and Regresar√© be placed in the first places of popularity in all Latin America. In 1981, she competed for the second time at the OTI Festival and won the third place in Mexico and the Award for the best female performer with the theme Deja, composed by the singer Jos√© Mar√≠a Napole√≥n. The following year, Yuri launches her third album titled Llena de dulzura. The album was described as a Gold Record in all Latin America, thanks to the songs \\"Mi timidez\\", \\"Llena de dulzura\\", \\"Tu y yo\\", \\"Este amor no se toca\\" and Maldita Primavera (Spanish version of the song \\"Maledetta primavera\\", by Italian singer Loretta Goggi). She also became the first Latin American singer to obtain a Gold Record in Spain. In that same year she recorded the single \\"El panda de Chapultepec\\", dedicated to the first panda bear born in captivity outside of China, whose single sold over a million units and was later included in a re- issue of the album. In 1983 the success continued with her fourth album, titled Yuri: S√≠, soy as√≠, which includes one of her greatest hits: \\"Yo te amo, te amo\\". She also filmed her second movie: Secuestro in Acapulco, alongside the Venezuelan boyband Los Chamos. In 1984, Yuri released her fifth album entitled Karma Kamale√≥n. This production contains the Spanish version of the song \\"Karma Chameleon\\", from the British group Culture Club. Yuri participates for the third time in the Oti Festival with the song \\"Tiempos mejores\\", by Sergio Andrade. She triumphed in the national competition and represented Mexico in the international stage, where he obtained the third place and the \\"Prize for the best performer of the festival\\". The same year she was invited to the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival in Chile, and obtained the longed for Silver Torch, with which she became the first Mexican singer to obtain this award. In 1985 she signed a contract with EMI music and recorded the album Yo te pido amor, with which she won a Grammy Award nomination. The singer placed on the radio throughout Latin America with the successes songs, \\"Yo te pido amor\\", \\"D√©jala\\" and \\"Dame un beso\\". Months later, Yuri appeared in Playboy magazine, in a study conducted under the lens of Pompeo Posar. The magazine's sales skyrocketed, even though Yuri never appeared nude. In 1986, Yuri released the album Un coraz√≥n herido. The sigles released were \\"Es ella m√°s que yo\\", \\"Hoy me he vuelto a enamorar\\" and \\"Un coraz√≥n herido\\". The following year she would participate for the last time in the OTI Festival with the songs \\"La locura de vivir\\". This is perhaps the biggest failure of her artistic career because she only obtained a vote of the jury and she was eliminated because her presentation is crossed of very bold. In 1987 the successful album Aire was released. The singles \\"Cuando baja la marea\\", \\"Qu√© te pasa\\" and \\"Amores clandestinos\\", they manage to conquer the first places of popularity in the whole American continent. \\"Qu√© te pasa\\" got the record in Billboard Hot Latin Tracks as the song that was the longest in number one in the whole decade of the 1980s, position in which he would remain for 16 consecutive weeks, and for a total of 33 weeks in the list.Lista Billboard Billboard.com In the face of such success, Marcos Maynard and Manuel Calder√≥n of CBS (now Sony Music) hired her for their ranks. From there came the album Isla del Sol, which included rhythms such as dance, rap, pop, rock and ballad and successfully placed singles such as \\"Hombres al Borde de un Ataque de Celos\\" (with which he returned to number one on Billboard Hot Latin Tracks ), \\"Imposible amarte como yo\\", \\"No puedo m√°s\\" and \\"Hola\\". \\"Hola\\" was nominated as best video to the Grammy Awards. She was awarded the Premios Lo Nuestro Award for Latin music. Even years later, the album enters the Brazilian market. In parallel, Yuri recorded a duet with Don Johnson, the Spanish version of \\"A Better Place\\". Taking advantage of the great success of Yuri, her old record label, EMI, launches the album Algo de mi vida, which included songs already recorded by Yuri, but which were not published in Mexico. In September 1989 Yuri released the album Sui Generis from which came the single releases, \\"Embrujada\\" and \\"Me tienes que querer\\". 1990s After divorcing her first husband, Yuri gave a turn to her career, and recorded under the direction of producer Mariano P√©rez the album Soy Libre, same that three months after going on the market had sold more than half a million copies and which are the singles: \\"Qui√©n eres Tu\\", \\"Todo mi coraz√≥n\\" and \\"El apag√≥n\\". For the second time, Yuri appears in Playboy and presented a show entitled Sin l√≠mites, which receives the recognition of the public and critics for its outstanding quality, which led the press and her fans to compare it with the singer Madonna: the nickname \\"the Mexican Madonna\\", which sparked such controversy that even important American programs, such as Hard Copy, took time to talk about this similarity. In 1991, Yuri resumed her role as an actress and filmed the movie Soy libre, directed by Juan Antonio de la Riva and where she alternates with Omar Fierro and Christian Bach. In 1992, Yuri released her twelfth album, titled Obsesiones, which is again produced by Mariano P√©rez. The album includes the song \\"Decir adi√≥s\\", Spanish version of the song \\"As Time Goes By\\". The album also includes the song \\"Qu√≠mica perfecta\\", a duet with the Salsa singer Luis Enrique, as well as \\"As√≠ es la vida\\" and \\"Poligamia\\". In 1993, Yuri released the album Nueva era with the producer Alejandro Zepeda, which contains the songs \\"Detr√°s de Mi Ventana\\" (written by Ricardo Arjona), \\"Amiga m√≠a\\" and \\"Si falta el amor\\". Also they sound in some countries the \\"Celia Mix\\" a medley of some hits of Celia Cruz. In 1994, Yuri returned to television but now as host of the comic-musical show ¬°No te muevas!. In that same year, she agreed to star in the Mexican telenovela Volver a empezar, starring alongside the Puerto Rican singer Chayanne for the Televisa network. In 1995, she performed again at Vi√±a del Mar Festival. The pace of work devastated her health and a tumors were detected in her the vocal cords, which led her to fall into depression. In that year she released the album Espejos del Alma, which would obtain regular success on the radio due to the few presentations by Yuri for her health problems. In this same year, Yuri causes a stir by embracing the Christian faith and adhering to the Evangelical church. As an actress, she starred in the Christian film Altos instintos'. Yuri participates in the album Boleros por amor y desamor, under the label of Fonovisa and in which he interprets the theme \\"El espejo\\". In 1996, Yuri recorded the Ranchera album M√°s Fuerte que la Vida, a disc that included some of her hits in the ranchera version and the Christian song that gave the album its name. During 1997 Yuri filmed the autobiographical film, Yuri, mi verdadera historia. In the film she reflects her unhappiness despite her triumphs, fame and money. Also, lets see the frivolity of the middle of the stardom, which caused controversy at the time of release. She began to witness her conversion in countless forums. Also recorded the audio-cassette entitled Mi testimonio, which is distributed only in Protestant bookstores throughout Latin America, to tell their approach to God. Following this logic, the following year she is invited by Manolo Calder√≥n to be part of the Polygram label and records the Gospel album Huellas. Yuri leaves behind her public image of sex symbol and writes the song \\"Mar√≠a Magdalena\\". The single \\"Hoy que estamos juntos\\", a duet with her second husband Rodrigo, is quickly removed from the top ten by the version of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony with a very different letter on the lack of love, as Yuri spoke of God in her version. Yuri's successful record career began to decline and, due to these changes, and Yuri's indifference to continue in secular music, she would lose fans and contracts. She began to dedicate herself solely to her Christian audience, and she performed concerts with songs of praise and testimony of faith. When the single \\"Ven y t√≥came\\" was distributed, Yuri considered retiring from the stage. 2000s Yuri decides to return to secular music in mid-2001 convinced by her fans and makes some television appearances with new arrangements of her former successes. It was not until 2002 that Yuri returns formally with the release of her album Enamorada, where she leaves religious themes aside and takes up the themes of love. From this album there is a single success, the bachata \\"Ya no vives en m√≠\\". She also performs a special performance in the children's telenovela Vivan los ni√±os. In 2003, Yuri would sign again with Sony Music and record a ranchera music album, called Yuri/A lo Mexicano, at the request of the label, which includes duets with renowned artists such as Vicente Fern√°ndez, Ana B√°rbara, Mijares and Pandora. In 2005, and for three consecutive seasons, Yuri became the host of the reality show Objetivo Fama, recorded in Puerto Rico, and in 2006 a cover album was released with Mijares, entitled Acomp√°√±ame, whose first single \\"Callados\\", manages to be placed in the public's taste. The album obtained platinum disc, although in the radio it does not achieve the desired success. At the same time, she started the Cantar por cantar Tour, together with Mijares and Ricardo Montaner. In addition, she participated as part of the jury of the reality show Cantando por un sue√±o, from the Televisa network with Montaner, Adri√°n Posse and Susana Zabaleta for three seasons. Yuri leaves Sony Music and in 2007 she presented a concert of successes at the Teatro de la Ciudad in Mexico City, which is recorded for a DVD and CD, published at the beginning of September of the same year with the title Vive la Historia, in which it includes the unreleased song \\"Y llegaste t√∫\\", of the album Acomp√°√±ame, which is quickly placed in the first places, and won recognition for its high sales. In January 2008, Manolo Calder√≥n invited her to be part of the Televisa EMI Music label. Televisa also invites her to animate the late night show Noche de estrellas, in which the duets in which Yuri participated with her guest artists were popularized, of which the ones she performed with Lupita D'Alessio, Enrique Iglesias and Juanes. In December of the same year her new Latin pop album Mi Hijita Linda was released, where she recorded, at the request of the label, old-style cumbanchero themes that pretended to continue with the concept of \\"El Apag√≥n\\", as well as including a duet with DJ Flex: \\"La mucura\\". In 2009, Yuri is presented with great success in the Auditorio Nacional of Mexico City. She signed with Warner Music and on October 20 a CD- DVD of her concerts in the Auditorio Nacional, called El concierto, was released. 2010s (present) In 2010, under the production of Scott Erickson, Yuri releases the album Inusual, who got a gold record just two days after it was released. This record achieves success in countries like Chile and Mexico and from it comes the single \\"Arrepentida\\" and \\"Estoy Cansada\\", as well as some covers by Argentine singer Valeria Lynch. She also recorded the central theme of the Chilean TV series Infiltradas, entitled \\"Por el amor de un hombre\\", and was present at the Vi√±a del Mar Festival in 2011 as a jury. On September 27, 2011, she released the album, Mi tributo al Festival, where she pays homage to the late OTI Festival. In this album, Yuri interprets in a masterful way the winning songs of this festival. The first single is \\"Ay amor\\", by singer-songwriter Ana Gabriel. Yuri released the second part of this album in 2012 using the song \\"El triste\\", popularized by Jos√© Jos√©, as a single. In the same year she was the host of a late night show aired on Saturdays of every month, called Una noche con Yuri for Televisa. In August 2014, Yuri announced her participation as coach of the fourth season of the Mexican version of The Voice alongside Ricky Martin, Laura Pausini and Juli√≥n √Ålvarez. In September of the same year, a second single titled \\"Duele\\" was released, playing alongside the Mexican band Reik. The same name album went on sale on April 14, 2015 in physical and digital record stores. In 2016, Yuri signs a new contract with Sony Music and starts working on her new album Yuri en Primera Fila, a record recorded live with her hits and new songs. In February 2017, the first unpublished single of the disc is released, entitled \\"Perd√≥n\\". In 2017, Yuri became the host of the Mexican edition of The Voice Kids, and in the middle of the same year she repeated as coach in the sixth season of Mexican version of The Voice alongside Carlos Vives, Maluma and Laura Pausini . In 2018, she served as coach in The Voice Kids in Colombia. In 2018, Yuri ventured into musical theatre for the first time with the musical Cats in its Mexican version playing the character Grizabella. In the same year, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences awarded Yuri the Latin Grammy Award to musical excellence in a ceremony held in Las Vegas. In 2019, Yuri joins forces with the Mexican group Pandora to perform a musical tour. Image, voice and influence Yuri has always shown her admiration for artists like Roc√≠o D√∫rcal, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Cher and Celia Cruz, among others. Likewise, she has managed to influence musically on many artists in the Hispanic market, such as: Yuridia, Mar√≠a Jos√©, Alejandra Guzm√°n and Shakira, among others, and has become an important part of the musical culture of Mexico and Latin America. Several of her songs are part of the successful musical Mentiras, based on Latin musical successes of the 1980s, similarly there is a character named Yuri in her honor. Yuri has one of the most prodigious voices in Latin music in history, and has a wide vocal record. She is known for being one of the few Latin singers of the 1980s who are still active in the market, due to her capacity for evolution and skills as an artist. Yuri is a professional dancer, so she easily includes dances and choreographies in her concerts, which include costume changes, visual screens, dancers and set design, elements that are rare in Latin artists and much less in her generation. She has been known for including the genre pop and ballad on her albums, but throughout her career she has included various rhythms, such as rock, bolero, salsa, Ranchero, gospel and many more. Personal life In 1985, Yuri married the publicist Fernando Iriarte, (son of Mexican journalist Maxine Woodside). The marriage ended in divorce in 1989. From 1995 to date, Yuri is married to Chilean singer Rodrigo Espinoza. In 2009, she announced her motherhood with the adoption of a 7-month-old girl named Camila.

Her book, The Pit and the Pendulum, is based on this research. She holds an MSc in advanced social research methods from the Open University. Academic career After working for the Oxford University Press from 1987 to 1998, Scott Cato tutored at Aberystwyth University in 2000, then, from 2001 to 2012, was Senior lecturer and Reader in green economics at Cardiff Metropolitan University (known for most of that period as the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, or UWIC for short). In 2007 she was appointed Director of the Cardiff Institute for Co-operative Studies. In 2012 she became Professor of Strategy and Sustainability at the University of Roehampton. Scott Cato's academic work covers three main areas: firstly the green economy, that is, one which recognises planetary limits and achieves social justice; secondly the economics of co-operatives and social enterprises, and finally critical analysis of the existing monetary system, and alternatives which might replace it.  Publications  She has published widely on green economics, localism and anti-capitalism. She wrote Seven Myths About Work in 1996, updating it in 2002 under the title Arbeit Macht Frei and Other Lies about Work. She co- edited Green Economics: Beyond Supply and Demand to Meeting People's Needs in 1999 with Miriam Kennet. Her report, co-authored with Christopher Busby and Richard Bramhall, on the structure of government specialist science advice committees, I Don't Know Much About Science, apparently \\"influenced the structure of the government's new committee examining the effects of low-level radiation\\". In 2009 she published Green Economics: An Introduction to Theory, Policy and Practice, where she argues that society should be embedded within the ecosystem, and that markets and economies are social structures that should respond to social and environmental priorities. She includes examples of effective green policies that are already being implemented across the world policy prescriptions for issues including climate change, localization, citizens' income, economic measurement, ecotaxes and trade. In his review of the book in the Journal of Economic Geography Danny Dorling called it \\"a serious book written by the grown-up version of the kinds of people who are currently invading airports, chaining themselves to those coal trucks on the way to power stations and populating climate camps\\". Her 2011 book Environment and Economy describes the main academic responses to the need to resolve the tension between economy and environment: environmental economics, ecological economics, green economics, and anti-capitalist economics. It covers topics including an introduction to economic instruments such as taxes and regulation; pollution and resource depletion; growth; globalization vs. localization and climate change. Political career Scott Cato campaigning to contest the alt= Scott Cato joined the UK Green Party in 1988, before it became three separate parties for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1990. She has been Co-Chair of the Green Party Regional Council and served on the Green Party Executive as Campaigns Co-ordinator. She wrote Seven Myths About Work as part of a Green Party campaign, Why Work?. She speaks for the Green Party on finance and the EU  Candidate for the UK Parliament  Scott Cato stood as the Green Party candidate for the Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency at the 1997 and 2005 general elections, coming sixth. For 2017, Scott Cato was selected by the party to stand for the constituency which saw its greatest-swing result in 2015, Bristol West, where the party had been placed second ‚Äì a seat with a high student and academic contingent to its electorate. She was endorsed by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. She finished in third place in the 2017 election, with the Green share of the vote dropping from 26.8% to 12.9%. In the 2019 election, she stood in Stroud, with the Liberal Democrats standing down in the constituency and endorsing her as the Unite to Remain candidate.'Lib Dems stand aside in Stroud as part of Unite to Remain pact with Greens', Stroud News and Journal (7 November 2019). She came third, with 4,954 votes, 7.5% of the total and up 5.3% from 2017.  Local council  In May 2011, Scott Cato was elected to represent Valley Ward on Stroud District Council. In May 2012, she became leader of the Green Group on the council and made an agreement with the Labour and Liberal Democrat groups to take overall control of the council, calling for \\"constructive co- operation\\" and rejecting the \\"tribalism of party politics\\" in favour of a \\"more inclusive\\" approach. She said, \\"We believe that no one party has a monopoly on good ideas and we will seek co-operation to achieve advances of our policy platform on an issue-by-issue basis.\\" She became chairman of the council's Audit and Standards Committee in May 2013. At the council's AGM in June 2014, Scott Cato announced her resignation, to take effect from 1 July, the start of her mandate in the European Parliament. European Parliament Scott Cato questioning Jean-Claude Juncker at an open hearing hosted by the Green-EFA group on 9 July 2014 In the May 2014 elections for the European Parliament, she was elected as an MEP in South West England for the Green Party, being the lead candidate on the party's list. The Green Party's share of the vote in her region was, at 11.1%, the highest of any electoral region. She had stood for the European Parliament on the Green Party list for the South West region at the previous election in 2009; in 1999 and 2004 she had been on the Green Party list in Wales. She stated, after her election, that her priorities as an MEP would be finance and farming: \\"I'm from the South West ‚Äì it's vital to our region, and I hope to get farming working in a more socially and environmentally friendly way\\". On 1 July 2014, the start of her mandate, she was appointed a full member of the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and a substitute member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. In her first speech, also on 1 July, she expressed her opposition to the UK government's attempt to take away from her region control of ¬£450 million EU convergence funding, saying: \\"Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have a long history of using these funds efficiently and effectively\\". In May 2019, Scott Cato was re-elected in the 2019 European elections. She was the only Green MEP in the South West England constituency and was elected on a vote share of 18.1% (up 7% from 2014).  Localism and community involvement  In addition to her work on Stroud District Council, Molly Scott Cato has, since 2007, been a director of Stroud Common Wealth, a not-for-profit private company, limited by guarantee, which owns and develops property \\"for community benefit and to enable social enterprise development.\\" She was a director from 2009 to 2012 of Transition Stroud, which aims to strengthen the community's local economy, to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and to prepare for climate change. Transition Stroud is part of the Transition Towns network. Shortly after she moved to Stroud in 2006, she joined Stroud Community Agriculture (SCA), and was elected to its \\"core group\\" of members. SCA is a community-supported agriculture project, organised as a co-operative, which provides locally produced organic food for its members. In 2009, Scott Cato was one of the founders of the Stroud pound. In 2012, she had an article about local currency published in the International Journal of Community Currency Research.  Other activities  Molly Scott Cato was a member of the Management Committee of the Association for Heterodox Economics from 2010 to 2014 and is on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Co-operative Studies, published by the UK Society for Co-operative Studies. She formerly served as a member of the Advisory Group of the Equality Trust. She was, from November 2010 to September 2013, a director and trustee of Meadow Prospect, the charitable branch of RCT Homes, a large social housing provider based in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), and itself an Industrial and provident society with charitable rules. She is a Distinguished Fellow of the Schumacher Institute. Together with Patrick Adams and her then partner, Christopher Busby, she founded Green Audit, an environmental consultancy and publishing organisation, in 1992, but later left the organisation, which continues to be run under Busby's direction. Scott Cato supports the EU boycott of goods from illegal Israeli settlements beyond the Green Line, thinks that this boycott should be widened, and supports measures to ensure that the illegal settlements should be excluded from EU relations with Israel. Her sympathy for the Palestinians dates back to time spent teaching in the West Bank when she was a student. In October 2018, she signed the call to action supporting Extinction Rebellion. Personal life Scott Cato is a Quaker. She has three children and lives in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

In the wake of the joshi puroresu boom of the early 1990s, several different groups opened with distinct approaches. The Jd'Star promotion, with its subtitle, \\"Beauty Athlete,\\" summed up the company's approach. History Jaguar Yokota came out of retirement and announced the formation of her promotion, JDStar, in a press conference, in 1995. In the beginning, she was the focal point of most of their shows. She left the promotion in 1998, seeing that the promotion was going nowhere and worked freelance, which she still does today. After her departure, JDStar was bought by Kiyu Uji, and much like Yokota before him, the promotion got nowhere, even with the help of established stars Lioness Asuka, Aja Kong, and Chigusa Nagayo. The company had a nice roster, but none with the ability or personalities to attract much attention. In 2001, Hidenobu Ichimaru bought JDStar from Kiyu Uji, and establish a new gimmick to promote JDStar's talent: the \\"athtress\\" (athlete-actress), which used girls with model good looks to market them for their athleticism in the pro wrestling ring, and hopefully establish them as actresses. Coming mainly from an acting background, the first run of girls had few skills, and the fanfare dropped slightly. The \\"athtress\\" gimmick however, created more controversy than anything and the attempt to create an idol never quite caught on. Also dropping was the wrestlers' respect for Ichimaru, as several of the established wrestlers in joshi puroresu thought that the \\"athtresses\\" should not be in the same ring as them. JDStar continued to flounder before ultimately folding in the summer of 2007. Roster JD' moulded the careers of several new wrestlers with Uji in charge, including The Bloody, Fang Suzuki, and Sumie Sakai, who is also well known for wrestling for several independent promotions on the American east coast. The second run of Athtresses was the most famous group, featuring Emi Tojo, Yumi Ohka, Kei Akiyama and Asami Kawasaki. JDStar also moved into its home building, Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, later that year, and sold it out on their first show. The biggest surprise came in May of that year when Jaguar Yokota came back to the promotion, teaming with Lioness Asuka against Yumi Ohka and Emi Tojo, and picking up the win over Ohka. The third run of the Athtress program was its last, and Fuka and Shuu Shibutani were the last two girls to run through the program. Both have seen much fanfare and success, with Shu becoming a popular wrestler through her training with Mariko Yoshida's Ibuki group, which showcases the best young talents that Japan has to offer. Early in 2007, another rookie, Misaki Ohata, debuted with the promotion. She was trained by Yoshida throughout 2006.

Life After his father's death in 1902, Jabbarli's mother moved to Baku with her four children. In 1915, Jabbarli graduated from high school and studied electromechanics at Baku Polytechnicum for the next 5 years. In 1920 he was admitted to Azerbaijan State University to study applied medicine but due to his lack of interest soon switched to Oriental studies. In 1923, he started attending lectures at a local theatre to fulfill his interest in drama.Jafar Jabbarli: Life and First Years of Education (archived) Jafar Jabbarli died at the age of 35 of heart failure and was buried at the Alley of Honor. The national film studio, Azerbaijanfilm, a street and a subway station in Baku are named after him. On 22 May 1985 the museum \\"Jafar Jabbarli memorial house\\" was opened. It is located in the house on I. Gutgashinli steet 44 (former G.

In the following years, he wrote more than 20 plays, as well as poems, essays, short stories, and articles. His works were very much influenced by the 1920s propaganda of Communist glory and celebrated appropriate themes such as equality, labour, education, cosmopolitanism, emancipation of women, cultural shifts, etc. Jabbarli's major accomplishment in introducing European plays to average Azerbaijanis was translating William Shakespeare's Hamlet into Azeri in 1925 and directing it at the Azerbaijan Drama Theatre a year later.Jafar Jabbarli: Translations (archived) Jafar Jabbarli is considered the founder of screenwriting in Azerbaijan. Two of his plays, Sevil and Almaz, both written in 1928, were made into films in 1929 and 1936 respectively. Both focused on the theme of the role of women, their oppression, struggle, and ultimately, victory over dated patriarchal traditions.Jafar Jabbarly: Third period of the writer's creative activity (1928-1934) (archived)Jafar Jabbarly: Film Activity (archived)] See also * House-Museum of Jafar Jabbarly (Baku) * Statue of a Liberated Woman ReferencesExternal links * Cafarcabbarli.com (archived) * Short Stories and Dramas by Jafar Jabbarly Online at Azeri.org Azerbaijani-language writers Azerbaijani-language poets 1899 births 1934 deaths People from Khizi District Azerbaijani dramatists and playwrights Azerbaijani male poets Soviet screenwriters Male screenwriters Translators to Azerbaijani Azerbaijani atheists Burials at Alley of Honor Baku State University alumni People from Khizi 20th-century Azerbaijani poets 20th-century Azerbaijani dramatists and playwrights 20th- century male writers 20th-century translators 20th-century screenwriters Writers from Baku ","title":"Jafar Jabbarly"},{"id":"9555888","title":"Athletics at the 1962 Asian Games"},{"id":"9555907","text":"Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design (DJCAD) is part of the University of Dundee in Dundee, Scotland. It is ranked as one of the top schools of art and design in the United Kingdom and has an outstanding reputation in teaching, practice and research. History Attempts were made to establish an art school in Dundee from the 1850s, and evening classes in art were taught at the High School and the YMCA with great success. A full- time art school only became a possibility following the creation of the Dundee Technical Institute in 1888. The Institute was based in Small's Wynd, now part of the University of Dundee's main campus, and shared facilities with what was then University College, Dundee. From the start, art classes were taught at the Institute in the evenings by George Malcolm, but in 1892 Thomas Delgaty Dunn was appointed as the first full-time art master, and this is now regarded as the date of the present college's foundation. The Technical Institute's main building, designed by J Murray Robertson, soon became inadequate, particularly when the High School and YMCA art classes were amalgamated with those of the Institute. A fund-raising campaign was launched in 1907 and in 1911 the Institute moved to new and much grander premises on Bell Street, designed by Robert Gibson and James Langlands, where it re-opened as Dundee Technical College & School of Art. A further incentive to the development of the school had come in 1909 with the bequest of ¬£60,000 by James Duncan of Jordanstone to establish an independent art school in the city. A lengthy legal battle ensued as to whether the existing college could spend the money, and it was not until the 1930s that an agreement was reached whereby the College was reorganised as Dundee Institute of Art & Technology, the College of Art to be autonomously run on a separate site away from the Technical College. A site was chosen and plans drawn up by architect James Wallace in 1937, but due to delays largely caused by the war construction did not begin until 1953. Classes began in what is now called the Crawford Building in 1955, though it would not be completed until 1964. The College did not become entirely independent of the Institute of Technology (now the University of Abertay) until 1975, when it was officially renamed Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art (though it had been known as such unofficially for many years). By that time it has expanded into a new building next door (now called the Matthew Building, designed by Baxter Clark & Paul). The College remained independent until 1994, when it became part of the University of Dundee.The Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art (Closure) (Scotland) Order 1994 Over time Duncan of Jordanstone has built up strong academic links with other disciplines in the University, manifested in joint programmes such as Digital Interaction Design and Product Design. Structure DJCAD is a school within the University of Dundee and is led by current Dean, Professor Anita Taylor. DJCAD is structured around Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Research portfolios rather than the more traditional disciplinary departmental approach. The school is located within the Crawford and Matthew buildings, with part of the Matthew building shared with the separate Architecture department.

The Impact element of DJCAD Research was graded 60% at 4-star and 40% at 3-star. The REF judged DJCAD‚Äôs research environment, including underlying support and infrastructure, external income, and PhD performance, 100% at either 3 or 4-star levels.http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/BySubmission/2183 The college was commended for its established research culture and interdisciplinary and collaborative research, with a PhD community which in 2014 numbers around 45 with 25 Post Doctoral Research Assistants. Research projects and students are either clustered around the facilities within the college buildings including the campus based Research Studio. Exhibitions: sites and galleries Temporary exhibitions are held in various galleries within the College. Since January 2008, 72 exhibitions, 68 events, 11 performances, 27 talks, 11 seminars/workshops and 3 symposia have been staged. There are four galleries: Cooper Gallery (215 sq. metres); Cooper Gallery Project Space (100 sq. metres); Bradshaw Art Space (90 sq. metres); Matthew Gallery (300 sq. metres). Aside from the galleries it runs, the College also maintains an art collection of work by its students, usually acquired from the annual Degree Shows. The collection is now managed as a public museum collection by the University of Dundee Museum Services. Works from the collection are regularly exhibited within the University, as well being loaned to other museums and galleries throughout the country. Work by College staff is regularly exhibited in sites owned by the City of Dundee, the University generally or the DCA as well as in events throughout the world. abcD  artists‚Äô books collection Dundee The DJCAD Library houses a large collection of Artists' books (artists‚Äô books collection Dundee -abcD)- originally established in 1999 as the Centre for Artists Books by Alec Finlay, now with 1,450 books, multiples and ephemera from 600 artists represented in the collection.

Alternatively, it may refer to a comedian or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act. Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers. The word \\"hack\\" is derived from the British term \\"hackneyed\\" meaning, \\"over used and thus cheapened, or trite\\".\\"http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy\\" One proposed amelioration to hackneyed material is an essay by George Orwell called, Politics and the English Language: The Six Rules. Occasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess. This renders the topic \\"hack\\" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material. Reusing humor can also be joke thievery if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian. History From the Catskill and Vaudeville beginnings of stand-up comedy, hacking was common as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. In the late fifties and early sixties, Will Jordan perfected a caricature performance of Ed Sullivan (incorporating mispronouncing the word \\"show\\" as \\"shoe\\") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed. Soon after, Jackie Mason, Rich Little and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue. John Byner, in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that George Carlin cited as being set up with the words, \\"Now you know!\\" In the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer. In the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke. For many years, Denis Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album No Cure For Cancer, he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result. At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude. As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer, an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; \\"Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer\\"). Also in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of Bill Cosby, the style of which was first unveiled by Eddie Murphy in his concert Raw. More recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. Louis CK has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with Dane Cook over three bits on Cook's album, Retaliation that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album Live in Houston. This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble \\"My Real Name\\", a bit from Steve Martin's album, A Wild and Crazy Guy. Joe Rogan, by contrast has been very open in accusing Carlos Mencia of hacking. In France, many famous stand-up comedians (Gad Elmaleh, Jamel Debbouze, Tomer Sisley, Didier Bourdon, Malik Bentalha, Mickael Quiroga, Yacine Belhousse, , Michel Leeb, , R√©mi Gaillard, Roland Magdane, Michael Youn, Mathieu Mad√©nian, Olivier de Benoist) have been accused of plagiarism by the Facebook/Twitter/YouTube account CopyComic. In 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program Australia's Got Talent was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals.Waters, G 2011, 'Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed', Brisbane Times 26 May 2011 However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians Lee Mack and Geoff Keith. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - \\"I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste\\" - had been done in 2009 by comedian Jeffrey Ross, about Brad Garrett, at a roast of Joan Rivers. Ross had said, \\"This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste.\\"Nancarrow, D 2011, 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism', Brisbane Times, 29 June 2010, In January 2012, Blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the social networking site Facebook for stealing jokes and stories from comedian Doug Stanhope and posting them to his Blog from 2010, claiming them as his own work, including Stanhope's \\"Fuck someone uglier than you\\" routine, which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg. Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details, causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the \\"Occupy Troy Holm\\" Movement. Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that \\"To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that isn't mine?\\" Hacking in the media Hacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media. Dick Cavett and Woody Allen often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful television show, Laugh In. This proved extremely painful to Allen. Several episodes of The Simpsons, including \\"Missionary: Impossible\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XIII\\", and \\"The Italian Bob\\" have poked fun at Family Guy, implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from The Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows. Recourse and consequences There is, historically, very little legal recourse taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. W. C. Fields reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken. Typically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, Ari Shaffir, as a comedian who opens for \\"Carlos Men-steal-ia\\". Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he \\"take a break\\" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan. The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, JoeShow. It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's. Joe Rogan said, \\"People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'\\" The internet, however, has opened up a new medium for \\"outing\\" a hack. Websites like YouTube allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum. In January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from Doug Stanhope and posted them to his blog under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down. Steven Rosenthal and Steve Silberberg have published a Guide to Hack to help new comics avoid hacking, which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by Andy Kindler called, The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit.NATIONAL LAMPOON February 1991 pp. 34-36 Transcreation In 2014, an academic paper called transcreation a literary technique used by Italian comedian Daniele Luttazzi, one of the most corrosive and influential Italian stand-up comedians (in 2002 he was among the targets of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Editto Bulgaro): Luttazzi adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. For example, in March 2012 Luttazzi won a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \\"Decameron\\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation. He calls this ruse \\"the Lenny Bruce trick\\" (named for the comic of same name). In 2010, a smear campaign accused him of plagiarism, but, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a \\"nugget\\" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a \\"treasure hunt\\". Luttazzi also calls the charges \\"naive\\", explaining why those jokes are not \\"plagiarized\\", but \\"calqued\\", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context. Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.

For his performance, Wisdom won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. Although it was shown at a West End venue, the film broke box office records at 51 out of the 67 London cinemas in which it played. Plot Norman (Norman Wisdom), a lowly stock clerk at Burridge's department store, is in love with another employee, Sally Wilson (Lana Morris), though he has been unable to muster the courage to let her know how he feels. After he antagonizes the new head of the store, Augustus Freeman (Jerry Desmonde), he is promptly fired. On his way out, Norman helps Miss Bacon (Margaret Rutherford) carry her bulging suitcases, unaware that she is an audacious shoplifter. Freeman sees Norman assisting a \\"customer\\" and rehires him. Meanwhile, Peggy Drew (Moira Lister), the store's personnel manager, flirts with Mr. Freeman, while plotting with her boyfriend Gerald (Derek Bond) to rob the place. Norman is fired and rehired again and again, as his escapades somehow manage to benefit the store. He also finally becomes acquainted with Sally, chasing her down through the city streets to return her handbag. His antics make her laugh. After his latest firing, Norman is alarmed to find the handsome, suave Gerald trying to get to know Sally better. When he goes to the man's apartment to warn him to stay away from her, Norman inadvertently uncovers the robbery plot, scheduled to coincide with a big sale the next day. But, he is unable to get Sally or anyone else to take him seriously. Sally eventually decides to bring Norman's story to the attention of the management, but tells the wrong person, Miss Drew, and is tied up for her efforts. Norman finds her and together, they foil the thieves. Freeman takes Norman back into his employ...but not for long.

A release dove, also called a white pigeon, is a domestic rock dove (Columba livia domestica) bred for small size and white coloration that is released during events, such as public ceremonies, weddings and funerals. Most white doves are domesticated barbary doves (Streptopelia risoria). Albinism or other genetic anomalies that produce an entirely white dove occur very rarely in the wild since an all-white coloration would make these birds stand out in their natural habitats, leaving them highly vulnerable to predators. Although dove release businesses advertise that their birds will be able to safely return home, released doves are frequently killed in accidents or by predators before they can return home. Trained white homing pigeons, also known as rock doves, properly released by a trained release coordinator can fly back to their homes if within a distance of 600 miles. Ring neck doves that are released into the wild and survive will likely starve to death. The pigeons bred for dove release services are bred for their color and small size, not for their homing abilities or flight speed, as a result, some birds are attacked by predators moments after they are released. Some released birds become confused and are found injured or dead nearby their original release site. Since these are domesticated birds, they do not possess the instincts or skills to survive in the wild. Increased public awareness about animal cruelty, and the influx of injured or lost release doves in animal shelters is decreasing the demand for release dove services.  Symbolism  The release of doves is associated with the Genesis flood narrative; where a dove is sent out three times as the flood waters are receding. In The Epic of Gilgamesh, a similar flood narrative is present, where Utnapishtim sends out a dove that returns to his ship. The ritual of releasing doves in the Olympics originated in 1896. The doves in the 1896 Olympics were released as part of the closing ceremony; the ritual became an official part of the opening ceremony in the 1920 Antwerp games. The ritual was altered to be purely symbolic after the doves released in the 1988 Seoul Olympics landed on the Olympic Torch and were burnt alive when it was lit.  Dove release incidents  The Vatican no longer engages in the releasing of doves after multiple occasions where released doves were attacked by predatory birds as onlookers watched. The notoriety of this event generated a public outcry for the Vatican to halt this practice. The last occasion where doves were released by the Vatican occurred in 2014. Pope Francis released two birds that would not fly out of the window of the papal apartment and required several attempts to get the birds to fly out over a crowd of spectators. Immediately, the two birds were attacked by a seagull and crow as spectators watched. A similar incident occurred just the year prior at an event where Pope Benedict XVI released doves during a Holocaust remembrance event. The doves were attacked by a gull, with one dove being singled out and injured.

The bole was usually situated at or near the top of a hill where the wind was strong. Totley Bole Hill on the western fringes of Sheffield consisted of a long low wall with two shorter walls at right angles to it at each end. At the base of a bole long were laid great trees called blocks. On these were laid blackwork, partly smelted ore about half a yard thick. Then came ten or twelve trees called shankards. On top of these three or four courses of fire trees were laid with fresh ore. This was ignited and burnt for about 48 hours. This smelted lead, which ran down channels provided for the purpose and was cast into sows of about 11 hundredweight. A single firing produced 16 fothers of lead (about 18 tons) from 160 loads of ore (about 40 tons) and 30 tons of wood. Much of the ore was left incompletely smelted having become blackwork. Some of this was smelted in a foot-pump blown furnace, but some was left to be used when the bole was next fired. Bole smelting was replaced by smelting in smeltmills in the late 16th century. That was in turn replaced by smelting in cupolas, a variety of reverberatory furnace in the 18th century. Further reading *D. Kiernan and Robert van de Noort, 'Bole smelting in Derbyshire' in L.

Pantao () is also a Chinese name for a flat, small peach, reputed to be food for Taoist fairies. Early life Renard was raised and educated in the Netherlands. She is the daughter of Annie Garda Van Unen (born 1931), a former senior accountant of the Breda Candy Company FAAM, and Wilhelmus (Wim) Gerardus Renard (1931‚Äì2009), a businessman who founded the REACS Company in 1956. Renard is a descendant of the German composer/conductor Paul Albin Stenz who was awarded the Gold Medal of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. One year prior to his death in 1918 he was naturalized as a Dutch citizen. Renard's grandfather, Johannes (Paul) Renard was a cityscape painter in Rotterdam. Renard speaks (in order of fluency) Dutch, English, German, French, Thai and Tibetan. Gender reassignment In 1982, at the age of 17, Renard transitioned to being a woman with the support of her family, friends and people in her hometown. Renard's mother renamed her V√©ronique. In 1983, Renard was granted permission by a court in Utrecht to change her legal name, she added her second name Fran√ßoise (after her best friend), and third name Caroline (after Caroline Cossey, a British model who appeared in the 1981 James Bond-film For Your Eyes Only with Roger Moore). Initially unaware of the phenomenon of transsexualism and gender reassignment surgery (GRS), Renard conveyed in her 2007 memoir that the international media attention around Cossey in 1982 regarding her transition helped Renard to self-diagnose her own gender dysphoria. The day after reading about Cossey in a Dutch tabloid, Renard consulted her doctor and shortly after, the Amsterdam Gender Team. Renard was diagnosed with Klinefelter's syndrome, having 47 chromosomes (XXY). Females have an XX chromosomal makeup, and males an XY. Renard started hormone replacement therapy soon after. She completed her physical transition 18 months later in 1984. Renard was one of the first 150 persons to receive contemporary GRS in the Netherlands. Louis Gooren,Prof. Louis Gooren a professor of endocrinology at the special chair of transsexology at the Free University Amsterdam, guided her through the process. The medical team involved in her GRS included plastic surgeons Auke de Boer and J. Joris Hage as well as gynecologists C. Jager and A. Drogendijk. In 1984, at age 18, Renard learned from the Amsterdam Gender Team that she was most likely the youngest person in the world to receive complete contemporary GRS. In October 1984, the Dutch Government granted Renard permission to have her gender corrected on her birth certificate. Renard is most likely the first post-operative trans woman in the world to be legally recognized as a female., August, 2012. In the early 1980s, Louis Gooren, a professor, put pressure on the Dutch parliament to discuss the option of legal recognition of post- operative transsexuals in the Netherlands. The Netherlands became the first country in the world to legally and fully recognise post-operative transsexuals by accepting a new law in 1985.Volkskrant europeants.org Fearing rejection and discrimination, Renard never volunteered to mention her gender reassignment to friends, colleagues and lovers. Career=1982‚Äì1999 Renard started her career in 1982 working for a local travel agency. Thereafter she was employed as a management assistant with Philips Electronics and Mercedes Benz. As from 1984 she held various functions with the University of Utrecht. In 1987 she moved to working as the personal assistant of the vice president of Amdahl Netherlands. In 1989 Renard was hired by Amdahl‚Äôs main competitor IBM. As she felt dissatisfied with IBM‚Äôs corporate atmosphere, she found new employment with TNT-XP. Renard left the company after 6 months. In 1990, while working as a temp for ExpoConsult, she was contacted by a business partner of ExpoConsult, the US-based publisher Conway Data Inc. The president asked her to set up a European branch office, launch a European edition of their business magazine Site Selection, and represent the organisation at international events. She also functioned as the administrator of Industrial Development Research Council (IDRC) Europe. In 1994 Renard left the company in order to concentrate on her academic studies. She attained a Ph.D. in Dutch Literature in 1997. In 1997 Renard started working as an office manager for Lucent Technologies. Five months later, Renard was informed by one of her colleagues that there were rumours within the organisation regarding Renard‚Äôs alleged transsexualism and upcoming lay-off. Renard threatened Lucent to take them to court, accusing them of discrimination. The dispute was settled out of court. Renard‚Äôs last employment started in January 1999 as an office and relocation manager with Davilex, a fast-growing computer game company which was in the process of building a new head office. Days after Renard successfully completed the company‚Äôs relocation project, the president asked her to leave the company. Renard received word that the board of directors found out about her transsexualism. Renard threatened Davilex to take them to court and make a major media hype out of her dismissal.

Journal of the C J La Trobe Society 8: 21‚Äì25 This difficult country of rocky soils and steep slopes discouraged the settlers from building there, so instead the land was grazed until the 1930s when wild dogs became destructive. Soon after grazing in the Cathedral Range area ended, logging and milling occurred in the 1930s to the 1970s in the Little River and Storm Creek catchments. In 1938 the Cathedral Mill, now known as Cooks Mill, was established near the junction of Little River and Storm Creek. The mill ceased operating in 1955, however logging continued until late 1971.Evans, P. (1995). Rails to Rubicon.

The existence of some communities has been recognized as being significant in the State Park, as well as the occurrence of some rare species. Flora The park contains a broad range of vegetation communities, with the Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs) of the area including herb-rich foothill forest, grassy dry forest, damp forest and riparian forest.Nelson, J. and Jemison, M. (2012). Surveys and management guidelines for dunnarts in Cathedral Range State Park and Big River Catchment. Victorian Government, Department of Sustainability and Environment. The vegetation ranges from Manna Gum Tall Open Forest found along the banks of Little River to Myrtle Beech Closed Forest found above 900 m. The dry rocky slopes are covered with open forest, with the main species being red stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), broad-leaved peppermint (Eucalyptus dives) and long-leaved box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx). The moist river valleys contain candlebark gum (Eucalyptus rubida) and narrow-leaved peppermint (Eucalyptus radiata). The summit of Sugarloaf Peak contains a community of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) and just below this is a community of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) extending down to the Sugarloaf Saddle. A community noted to be significant found in the State Park is the existence of myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii) with the woolly tea-tree (Leptospermum lanigerum). This community is marked as significant as it is known to occur in only one other location‚ÄîBaw Baw National Park. The park is home to a variety of native orchids, appearing in spring and summer each year. These orchids are the alpine greenhood (Pterostylis alpina), pink fingers (Caladenia carnea), wax lips (Glossodia major) and the bird orchid.Parks Victoria. (2015).

Sightings have been made at Tweed Spur, only 3 km south from the Range. The community of Alpine Ash found in the park is suitable habitat for the possum. Brush-tailed Phascogale The brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa) is a small carnivores nocturnal marsupial.Department of Sustainability and Environment. (1997). Action statement: Brush-tailed Phascogale Phascogale tapoatafa. www.depi.vic.gov.au. Retrieved 20-05-15 It is classified as near threatened under the IUCN guidelines and as rare in Victoria. The reasons for its decline in Victoria are unknown, however the destruction of its preferred habitat is thought to have contributed to its decline. There are no official records of this species in the Cathedral Range, however suitable habitat exists in the park and its occurrence in the park is suspected. Powerful owl Powerful Owl The powerful owl (Ninox strenua) is Australia's largest owl and is listed as threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.Newton, I., Kavanagh, R., Olsen, J. and Taylor, I. (2002). Ecology and Conservation of Owls. CSIRO Publishing They have been observed roosting along the Little River and it is suspected that one, if not more, pairs of Powerful Owls are residents in the park. Sambar Deer The sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) are a large deer native to South-East Asia.Bilney, R.J. (2013). Antler rubbing of yellow-wood by Sambar in East Gippsland, Victoria. The Victorian Naturalist 130: 68‚Äì74 They were introduced to Victoria in the 1860s for recreational hunting. There is concern on the ecological impacts this introduced species are creating, however in Victoria they are listed as wildlife under the Wildlife Act 1975. They are found in low numbers in the Cathedral Range State Park, however their population need to be monitored to minimize the risk they pose to the biodiversity of the park. Environmental threats The Cathedral Range State Park's biodiversity is threatened by introduced flora and fauna and pathogens. Flora The park is home to a number of introduced plants that have become a pest. There are four main plants that are recognised as major threats to the Cathedral Range environment. These pests plants are blackberry, tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata). Blackberry is a highly invasive plant that is listed as a weed of national significance.Amor, R.L. (1974). Ecology and control of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L. agg.). Weed Research 14: 231‚Äì238 The Japanese honeysuckle has been recorded in the riparian zones of the park. Monterey pine has been invading the park from pine plantations located on the outskirts and in the inner block of the park. Fauna Introduced fauna that prey on the local wildlife include foxes and feral cats and dogs. Surveys have found that a large number of Australian animals are killed each year as a result of introduced predators.Dickman, C.R. (1996). Overview of the impacts of feral cats on Australian native fauna. Australian Nature Conservation Agency Feral goats have been observed near the state park. Feral goats are destructive to the environment by overgrazing the vegetation and by disturbing the soil with their hooves.Parkes, J., Henzell R. and Pickles, G. (1996). Managing vertebrate pests: feral goats. Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra Pathogens Investigations into the pathogens found at the park have not yet been conducted.

Plant Ecology 137: 55‚Äì70 has not yet been recorded as occurring in the park. Myrtle wilt is suspected as occurring in the park. It is caused by a fungus, Chalara australia, that infects myrtle beech trees and results in their gradual death.Kile, G. A., Packham, J. M., Elliot, H. J. and Griffith, J. A. (1989). Myrtle wilt and its possible management in association with human disturbance of rainforest in Tasmania. New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science 19: 256‚Äì264 The pathogen has been suggested for listing as a potentially threatening process under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act. Management Cathedral Range State Park is managed by Parks Victoria. Management of the park concentrates on the conserving the natural, cultural and scenic features while still providing for a range of recreational activities for visitors. Parks Victoria list six main management directions for the park. * To provide significant flora and fauna with special protection * Management strategies for pest plant and animals will be implemented with the aim of eradicating or controlling these species * Cooks Mill will have ongoing protection and interpretation * Campsite facilities will be rationalized and enhanced * Climbing sites will be monitored for erosion and other impacts * Promotion of the park as a conservation reserve with outstanding scenery, natural history and recreational opportunities The ongoing management of Cathedral Range State Park is vital. It preserves the cultural heritage and natural ecosystems of the area and provides protection for some rare communities and species while allowing the public to enjoy the spectacular landscape.

The operation was launched by Ahmad Shah Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani's Islamic State of Afghanistan government and the allied Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami paramilitary forces against Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezbe Islami and Abdul Ali Mazari's Hezbe Wahdat militias in the densely populated Afshar district in west Kabul. The Hazara-Hezbe Wahdat together with the Pashtun-Hezbe Islami of Hekmatyar had been shelling densely populated areas in northern Kabul from their positions in Afshar, killing thousands. To counter the shelling, government forces attacked Afshar in order to capture the positions of Wahdat and its leader Mazari, and to consolidate parts of the city controlled by the government. The operation became an urban war zone and escalated into what is called the Afshar massacre when Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami forces and Massoud's Jamaat-e-Islami forces committed \\"repeated human butchery\\" turning against the Shia Muslims. Reports emerged that Sayyaf's Sunni Wahhabist forces backed by Saudi Arabia rampaged through Afshar, murdering and burning homes. Both the Hezb-e Wahdat and the Ittihad-i Islami had been involved in systematic abduction campaigns against civilians of the \\"opposite side\\", a pattern Ittihad continued in Afshar. Besides Ittihad commanders, two of the nine government commanders on the ground, Anwar Dangar (who later defected to the Taliban) and Mullah Izzat, were also named as leading troops that carried out abuses. Reports describe looting, indiscriminate shelling by Sayyaf's men and massacring of thousands of civilians from Hazara ethnic group. In one instance fleeing civilians in the streets were hit by fire from government soldiers. At the same time it was reported that in another incidence government troops carried a wounded Afshar civilian to safety and that some commanders on the ground tried to stop abuses from taking place. The Islamic State's Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud ordered an immediate halt to the crimes on the second day of the operation, but especially looting and the destruction of houses continued to take place for a second day. Massoud then appointed a Shia commander, Hussain Anwari, to ensure the safety of the Shia civilian population in Afshar. However Anwari himself became infamous for terrorizing Pashtun civilians, who were also raped and assaulted. He also ordered the withdrawal of all offensive troops and persuaded Sayyaf to do the same. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission paid ransoms for approximately 80 to 200 people held by several Ittihad commanders. But 700-750 people abducted by Ittihad during the campaign were never returned however were later found to be alive and let go off randomly. About 20 were killed. The same commission received information that many women were abducted during the operation, but said that few families would report it. The Afshar operation proceeded with Massoud's approval, although he disapproved of Sayyaf's methods. The Afshar operation, which saw hundreds of Sunni Pashtuns and Shia Hazaras systemically targeted and depopulated from villages in the area, was the first such sectarian oriented incident in Afghanistan's modern history. It is also considered to have been one of the worst single events in Afghanistan's wars.http://worldhazaracouncil.org/en/home1/ Background and Objectives On April 26, 1992, the mujahedin leaders announced a new peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accords. During the period discussed in this article, the sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the \\"Islamic State of Afghanistan,\\" an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet- backed Najibu lah government through the Peshawar Accords. The legitimate representatives of the government were President Burhanuddin Rabbani and minister of defense Ahmad Shah Massoud. With the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami which to a very large extent was controlled by the regime in Pakistan, all parties were ostensibly unified under this government in 1993. Hekmatyar shelled Kabul with tens of thousands of rockets in 1992 to gain power for himself. Hekmatyar repeatedly was offered the position of prime minister but he did not want to share power. After failed attempts for negotiations a brutal war broke out between the Saudi-backed Ittihad-e-Islami of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the Jamiat-e-Islami of Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Hezb-i Wahdat of Abdul Ali Mazari. According to Human Rights Watch numerous Iranian agents were assisting Wahdat forces, as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence in the new government. Saudi agents, private or governmental, were trying to strengthen Sayyaf and his Ittihad faction to the same end. Rare ceasefires commonly collapsed within days. In December 1992 Abdul Ali Mazari's Wahdat entered in an alliance with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. With his newly created alliance with Hezb-i Wahdat, Hekmatyar increased his rockets and shell attacks on the city. Human Rights Watch concludes: The Afghanistan Justice Project gives the following objectives for the military operation: Timeline=Preparation According to a Human Rights Watch report, \\"credible and consistent\\" accounts from several officials who worked in Shura-e-Nazar (the informal politico- military organization headed by Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud) and the Rabbani interim government reveal that a military campaign against Hezb-i Wahdat was planned and approved by officials at the \\"highest levels\\" of the Rabbani government. According to Afghanistan Justice Project although individual commanders cannot be identified, brigade and battalion leaders can be listed. For Jamiat, these include Qasim Fahim, Anwar Dangar, Mullah Ezat, Mohammad Ishaq Pashiri, Haji Bahlol Panshiri, Baba Jalandar Panjshiri, Khanjar Akhund Panshiri, Musdoq Lalai, and Baz Mohammad Ahmadi Badakhshani. From Ittihad these included Haji Shir Alam, Amir Anwar Oryakhail, Zulmai Tufan, Dr. Abdullah, Jaglan Naeem, Mullah Taj Mohammad, Abdullah Shah, Khinjar, Abdul Manan Diwana, Amanullah Kochi, Shirin, Mushtaq Lalai, and Mullah Kachkol. By February 1993, Massoud had conducted negotiations with dissident Wahdat commanders who signed secret protocols with Massoud in order to avoid a long fight promising to cooperate during the conflict and to capture Mazari and his cabinet. The Operation The men of Mohammad Fahim, who was in charge of special operations, contacted a number of the Shia commanders and obtained their co-operation. This allowed the artillery to be pre-positioned in advance of the battle, with a ZU-23 gun and 30 men being positioned on Aliabad hill, with the purpose of targeting the Central Silo, Afshar, Kart-iSeh, Kart-iChar and Kart-I Sakhi. The forces allied with the government began to bomb the area around Afshar before troops began to move in around 4:00 am on February 11. Troops moved from Badambagh to the top of Radar hill, which was part of the Afshar ridge. According to Afghanistan Justice Project: A large contingent of both Ittihad and Jamiat forces advanced towards Afshar from the west. The closest point of the front line to the main target of the operation was the Kabul Polytechnic. A Jamiat force advanced along the main Afshar Road, from Kart-iParwan and the Intercontinental Hotel, towards the Social Science Institute, entering Afshar from the east. The ISA forces did not advance along other sections of the front line marking the west Kabul enclave, although they maintained an intense bombardment and had ample forces deployed to maintain a threat of advance. According to this, by 13:00 the main defense line of Hezb-I Wahdat had failed and the forces, including Mazari and his top commanders, began to flee on foot. By 14:00 the Social Science Institute was captured and troops were in control of Khushal Mina and Afshar. Mazari re-established a defense line near the Central Silo and Kart-iSakhi, at the edge of Khushhal Mina, keeping control over most of West Kabul. Following this many of the residence fled to Taimani, an Ismali area of the city. The objectives of the military operation were largely attained during the operation. Wahdat's headquarters and many of their positions were captured so that they were not able to shell Kabul from those positions anymore. Crimes Against Civilians Numerous abuses were reported and large information was collected through interviews by two separate reports ‚Äì one by Afghanistan Justice Project and another by Human Rights Watch. The abuses largely took place after the military operation itself when forces started to establish posts and to search homes. The vast majority of testimony regarding the Afshar operation suggests that the abuses were carried out by the Ittihad forces of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and not the Jamiat forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Ittihad forces played a major role in the assault, working directly under Sayyaf and receiving pay from him. The Ittihad forces were not absorbed into the ministry of defense. Sayyaf acted as the de facto general commander of Ittihad forces during the operation and was directly in touch with senior commanders by radio. According to reports, Wahdat soldiers as well as male Hazara citizens were being arrested and executed mostly by Ittihad forces. Unarmed civilians as well were being killed, with men in particular being targeted. Other men were abducted and taken to the base of Sayyaf's Ittihad in Paghman and made to dig trenches and bury the dead. Those who survived stated they saw on the bodies evidence of torture and mutilations. Human Rights Watch suggests that 70-80 people were killed in the streets fighting, while 700-750 people disappeared. It states that between 80-200 people were later released after ransoms were paid to Sayyaf's Ittihad commanders. Controversy John Jennings, a journalist with the AP present in Afshar during the operation around Massoud's troops, went into considerable detail to debunk allegations of a systematic massacre of civilians. Although he did leave open the possibility that some captured Wahdat fighters were summarily executed rather than being treated as POWs by troops furious at Wahdat atrocities against Kabul civilians during the preceding months. Jennings recounts entering a nearby basement where Wahdat fighters had tied up non-Hazara hostages with wire, shot them and tried to burn the bodies, before fleeing the scene ahead of Massoud's advancing troops. Jennings also describes Ahmad Shah Massoud's followers rescuing a wounded Hazara civilian caught in the crossfire during the height of the battle. Despite these written reference ‚Äî and although Jennings is quoted as a reliable source on other topics in the Human Rights Watch reports ‚Äî any account of what he witnessed during and after the Afshar battle was left out by Human Rights Watch editors. Islamabad Accord (March 1993) The Afshar campaign and the surrounding violence were ended by the Islamabad Accord between the Islamic State and Hekmatyar's alliance (including Hezb-i Wahdat) fashioned in late February 1993 and signed on March 7, 1993. There were a few weeks of relative calm. Hezb-i Wahdat ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar took the long-offered position of prime minister in the Rabbani government. The Islamabad Accord among other things stated: Pulitzer Prize- winning Roy Gutman of the United States Institute of Peace wrote in How We Missed the Story: Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan: Hekmatyar turned out afraid to enter the city (he had shelled for one year) more than once to take up his post. He attended one cabinet meeting but by late March, unwilling to compromise with other cabinet members not belonging to his faction and while his aides were still in the prime minister's palace, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami forces were again shelling Kabul.

It is part of the Texas A&M; University System. The university was established on May 23, 2009, and held its first classes as a stand-alone university on August 20, 2009. It currently enrolls approximately 6,546 students and offers undergraduate and graduate-level classes, as well as a graduate alternative teacher certification program. Texas A&M-San; Antonio has 161 full and part-time faculty. Texas A&M-San; Antonio is the first Texas A&M; University System institution to be established in a major urban center. History=Kingsville System Center Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio opened under the name Texas A&M; University‚ÄìKingsville System Center after SB 629, authored by Senator Frank Madla, was passed in 2006. The Texas Legislature authorized $40 million in tuition revenue bonds for this new campus in 2006 under HB 153, contingent on full-time enrollment reaching 1,500 by January 1, 2010. Krista Torralva of the San Antonio Express News described TAMU alumnus Greg Garcia (died October 4, 2019 at age 79), a friend of Madla, as the spiritus movens of the concept of TAMU San Antonio. Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio was created to address an educational need in the South Side of San Antonio. The Texas Legislature asked the Texas A&M; University System to establish a center that would offer junior- and senior-level courses in South San Antonio, an area that has been historically underserved in terms of higher education. Such a center was approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board in January 2000. Texas A&M; University‚ÄìKingsville was named the lead institution to create and operate the System Center, which first operated on nearby Palo Alto College, a community college in the Alamo Colleges system. The Center used surveys and research to determine the types of programs most in demand in the area. Texas A&M; University-San Antonio Construction on the university's permanent campus began after the Texas A&M; University System Board of Regents approved final design plans in March 2010, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for May 7, 2010. The first building, Senator Frank L. Madla Building, finished construction in Summer 2011 and faculty and staff from the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education moved in time for the Fall 2011 enrollment. Now an independent institution, Texas A&M-San; Antonio offers 26 undergraduate degrees and 13 graduate degrees. As the Texas A&M; University System's second newest institution (after Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCentral Texas) and San Antonio's second public university, Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio complements the crosstown University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in bringing public education to the San Antonio metropolitan area. Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio as of 2016 is a 4-year institution, with freshmen being admitted for the Fall semester. Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio plans to reach an enrollment of 25,000 students by 2025. The campus is being built in part due to a plan by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to enroll 630,000 students in college by 2015. Texas A&M; San Antonio opened their doors to college freshman in 2016 with 557 freshman that fall semester. Campus Central Academic Building The campus is off of Interstate 410 (\\"Loop 410\\"), from Downtown San Antonio. The university's main campus was constructed on a site on the south side of San Antonio, near Loop 410 and Zarzamora. The developer of the land is Verano Land Group LP, who donated the lot and one million dollars for scholarships. Initially surrounded by rural land, plans for the main campus included it to be constructed alongside a planned community with mixed-use commercial and residential development by Verano to create a vibrant living-and-learning, modern college town community. Despite continued development on the university property, work on the surrounding areas owned by Verano Land Group stalled when the company got entangled in a litigation matter over land developer rights with a group of former company partners. Following the settlement, Verano left the project and sold land surrounding the campus property to other developers with similar plans for the land to the original Verano project. In November 2019, SouthStar Communities announced the acquisition of 600 acres of the original 1,800 owned by Verano Land Group along with plans for a planned community on property adjacent to University Way, the long entry boulevard to the campus from Loop 410. The development will include 2,500 multi-family units, 2,400 single-family homes, and 750 condos, office space, retail space, industrial space, and recreational sport facilities, trails, and parks. Like the initial plans, the VIDA planned community is intended to complement the growing Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio campus. The architectural firm responsible for the campus plans are Kell Munoz and the Construction Manager at Risk is Bartlett Cocke. The campus buildings are designed with buff-colored sand-faced brick and San Saba, TX- sourced sandstone, articulated arches and accents that reflect the Architecture of San Antonio and South Texas. Elements of Old World and New World Spanish styles are also incorporated along with elements of Modern architecture such as glass, steel and reinforced concrete. The campus facilities are designed to LEED Silver standards and Energy Star rated roof materials. Academic facilities Construction of the permanent main campus began in early 2012 after formal approval of a $75 million university development fund from the Texas A&M; System Board of Regents. The development outlined six phases from 2012 to 2025. In the first phases of development, the university constructed a large plaza, known as Main Quad, bracketed by the Central Academic Building (CAB), Patriots' Casa, Auditorium, and the Senator Frank L. Madla Building. Following completion of the initial phase, the university consolidated operations to the newly opened main campus. The Brooks City-Base campus was consolidated into Main Campus and held the final classes in December 2016. Texas A&M-San; Antonio classes at The Alamo Colleges' Alamo University Center were consolidated into Main Campus and held the final classes in May 2017. A&M-San; Antonio Aerial Photo - Fall 2017 Positioned central in the development, the Central Academic Building is the landmark building of the campus. The four-story, building opened in 2011 and was designed with elements inspired by a cathedral in Granada, Spain. The structure features a four-story arch, embossed copper-clad main entry doors, decorative tile mosaic accents, and covered terraces. The building houses multiple student service offices, classroom and lecture hall space, library and quiet study areas, food court/cafe and campus book store. Attached to the CAB, the 420-seat Auditorium features space for performances, concerts, presentations and events. Announced in 2012, the Patriots' Casa became the second building constructed on the campus. Designed in Mission Style and heavily inspired by Mission San Juan and Mission Espada, the facility features veteran support service offices and behavioral health services, as well as lab space, ceremony space, and ROTC office. The Senator Frank L. Madla Building, originally constructed as the Multi-purpose Building, includes classroom and lab space, dining hall, permanent location of the university bookstore faculty offices, and the university police center. The building is named in honor of Senator Frank L. Madla for his legislative and public push efforts in the 1990s and early 2000s to establish a general academic teaching institution on the South Side of San Antonio. A&M-SA; opened the Science & Technology Building with the Grand Opening held on September 25, 2018. The state-of-the- art STEM focused facility houses two dozen classrooms and a dozen laboratories. It also houses the Mays Center for Experiential Learning and Community Engagement, supported by a $5 million gift from the Mays Family Foundation.  Residence Life  The university established its first residence hall, Esperanza Hall, with a capacity of 382, in fall 2017. At that point students with credit hours below 30 and those in their first years must live in the building. After reaching 50% capacity in the first year of operation, the hall reached max capacity by Fall 2018. Some residential students criticized the university for the lack of after-hours dining options. all three university dining halls closed after 8:00 pm combined with the estimated thirty minutes round-trip to fast food restaurants. According to President Teniente-Matson \\"Nearly all students at Texas A&M; University-San Antonio are working full-time while pursuing their educations.\\"  Academics = Enrollment  Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio experienced steady growth since its founding, as the fastest-growing university in Texas at a growth rate over 200% in the period from 2008 to 2013. After starting upper division and graduate exclusive curriculum, the university welcomed its first freshmen class for the 2016-2017. it had 6,671 students. In 2018, A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio enrolled 6,557 students, of which 854 were graduate level. The majority of the students are first-generation from within Bexar County. As of Fall 2018, Texas residents account for 98.00% of the student population. Members of ethnic minority groups make up 84.00% of the student population. The student body consists of 61.00% women and 39.00% men.  Colleges and schools  Tower at University Way Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio offers 30 majors in diverse areas of study and confers degrees from four colleges and schools. The university is classified as a Master's college and university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The university has full accreditation to award baccalaureate and master‚Äôs degrees from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and received its ten-year renewal in 2019-2020 academic year. The university has an 18-to-1 student-faculty ration and offers bachelor's degrees and master's degrees through its four colleges and schools: * College of Arts and Sciences * College of Business * College of Education and Human Development * Office of Research and Graduate Studies  Center for Information Technology and Cyber Security  Texas A&M; University‚ÄìSan Antonio‚Äôs Center for Information Technology and Cyber Security offers students educational programs that will prepare them for careers in information technology and cyber security. Their educational programs consist of Computer Science and Computer Information Systems with available concentrations in Information Assurance, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, and Project Management. A Cyber Defense Program Certificate is available as long as students complete the required coursework. A Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences degree is offered to students that have completed technical or vocational credits outside of the university and wish to transfer them towards obtaining this degree with concentrations in Business Information Technology, Information Assurance and Security, Project Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning. Texas A&M; University is designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense by the National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Texas A&M; University is the only university in Texas to partner with Facebook in instituting a cyber security program for addressing shortages in the career field. Athletics The university will begin intercollegiate athletic competition in the 2020-21 academic year as a member of the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) level. In August 2019, the university announced plans to add intercollegiate athletics programs for the following academic year. The decision was announced after the Texas A&M; System board of regents approved TAMU-SA adding a student fee to support athletics. The measure was first passed by an overwhelming student body vote to add a $10 per credit hour fee, up to a maximum of $120 per semester, to create and fund the department. Simultaneously to working with the student government, A&M-San; Antonio conducted a feasibility of adding athletics that recommended the university join the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) level. The university plans to initially field teams in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs soccer, women‚Äôs softball, and men‚Äôs golf. Men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball and women‚Äôs volleyball are planned to begin in 2022 once the university finishes construction of on-campus recreation center featuring a competition court with 1,200 seats Student organizations Texas A&M-San; Antonio offers many opportunities for students to join a student organization or create their own organization that fits their needs.

He also used the pen-name Araebisu for his music criticism. He is famous for his creation of the fictional detective Zenigata Heiji. Early life Nomura was born in the rural district of Shiwa county, Iwate prefecture in northern Japan, the younger son of a farmer. As a youth, he loved to read, and one of his favorite works was the Chinese classic Outlaws of the Marsh. He was sent to boarding school in Morioka, where he met Kindaichi Kyosuke, later a noted linguist and Namura's lifelong friend. One year behind him in the same school was future poet Ishikawa Takuboku. He attended Tokyo Imperial University, but left to work as a journalist for the Hochi Shimbun, a newspaper based in Tokyo. He continued to work as a journalist for the paper until it merged with the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1942. Literary career While working as a journalist, Nomura began to write popular fiction, notably historical novels, which appeared in serialized form in the literary journal Bungei Shunju. His most famous work was a series of detective stories set in the Edo period called Zenigata Heiji torimono hikae (\\"The Casebook of Detective Zenigata Heiji\\", 1931‚Äì1958). The first episode appeared in Bungei Shunju in 1931, and (with a hiatus during World War II, the story continued for 383 episodes over the next 26 years. The main characters in the story were modeled after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective pair, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. The popularity of the story led to a movie adaptation in the year the novel was first published. Between 1931 and 1967, a total of 30 movies and an extremely long-running and popular television series (1966‚Äì84), were made. The story won the Kikuchi Kan Prize in 1958. Nomura wrote other novels, including another detective series, Ikeda Daisuke torimono hikae (\\"The Casebook of Ikeda Daisuke\\"), but none were as popular as Zenigata Heiji. Nomura died of acute pneumonia in 1963. His personal fortune (over 100 million yen) was set into a scholarship fund for aspiring writers. He had previously (in 1956) donated his entire library to his home town of Shiwa in Iwate prefecture, where it now resides in a memorial museum erected in his honor. Nomura's daughter was the novelist Matsuda Keiko (1916‚Äì1940).  External links  *Kodo Memorial Museum in Iwate References and further reading * Fujikura Shiro.

In Massimo Moratti's first season as owner of Inter, he signed many Italians such as Benito Carbone, Salvatore Fresi, and Maurizio Ganz, along with Centofanti himself. Despite being a defender, Centofanti chose the number 9 jersey, when in 1995, the league introduced the selection of personal numbers. During Centofanti's tour of duty with Inter, he debuted in his first UEFA Cup game. Centofanti also explored the midfield position as he saw his knack for goal scoring increase. When playing for Inter, he saw his role in the defence decrease as Alessandro Pistone began to overthrow him for the left-back position. Manager Roy Hodgson also preferred Brazilian Roberto Carlos over Centofanti. In 2004 he concluded his career and became the director of Ancona Calcio. In 2009 he returned to football, as director of San Marino Calcio. Television In 2005, he left the football world for the television, when he was invited to join the hit Italian show Striscia la notizia. Centofanti gained fame for his antics on the television screen, rather than his work on the pitch. He appears on the popular Italian television show Striscia la Notizia, where he makes skits and jokes with football players.

Early life Vitruk was born July 7, 1902, in Andrushki near Zhytomir, then in Russian Empire, to a Ukrainian peasant family. He graduated from a local school and became a worker in a sugar factory. Following the Russian Civil War, in 1924 he joined the Red Army and graduated from a school of artillery. In 1934 he received further training at the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School. As a pilot of fighter-bombers he took part in the Khalkhyn-Gol battles against Japan and in the German and Soviet Invasion of Poland in 1939. Until 1940 he also served on the Finnish front during the Winter War. Career In 1941 he received officer's training in the Military Aviation Academy and became the commanding officer of the Soviet 65th Air Regiment of the Leningrad Military District.See http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/41_oob/leningrad/air.html for the LVO's air forces in June 1941 On that post he remained until the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union.

He commanded his regiment during the transfer of equipment from the outdated Polikarpov I-15bis to the new Ilyushin Il-2. Following the transfer and training of the crews the regiment was divided and Vitruk continued to command one of its parts. In October 1941 it was transferred to the Western Front near Moscow. By early 1942 he accomplished his 21st sortie, without any successes. However, for his superb command of the regiment on February 24, 1942, he was awarded with the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union. In July 1942 Vitruk became the commanding officer of the 291st Division, later transformed into the 10th Guards Division of the VVS.

It is an adaptation of the 1929 play The Danton Case by Stanis≈Çawa Przybyszewska. The film stars G√©rard Depardieu in the title role, with Wojciech Pszoniak as Maximilien Robespierre, and Patrice Ch√©reau as Camille Desmoulins. It was directed by the Polish director Andrzej Wajda and was an international co-production between companies in France, Poland and West Germany. All supporters of Danton (with the exception of Bourdon, who would later betray him) are played by French actors, while Robespierre's allies are played by Poles. Not always rigidly historical, the film draws continual parallels between the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution and the situation in contemporary Poland, in which the Solidarity movement was struggling against the oppression of the Soviet-backed Polish government.Liner notes on the Criterion Collection DVD of the film. WAJDA'S 'DANTON,' INSIDE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION By VINCENT CANBY, The New York Times, September 28, 1983 :\\"In an interview in Le Monde, Mr. Wajda denies all associations between 18th-century France and 20th-century Poland\\" The film had 1,392,779 admissions in France.  Plot  The film begins in Paris in the cold spring of 1794 when the Reign of Terror is in full swing, with vehicles entering the city being searched and long lines of citizens grumbling in the rain as they wait to buy scarce bread. Ill in his flat, Robespierre sees Danton in the street, just returned from the country and being acclaimed by the hungry and dispirited people as their hero. When H√©ron, head of the secret police, calls round, Robespierre instructs him to destroy the print shop of Desmoulins, who is publishing pro-Danton circulars. While Robespierre is being tended by his barber, his friend Saint-Just comes in and urges him to have Danton guillotined. He ignores him and goes to a meeting of the Committee of Public Safety, the effective government of France, where other members also push for the elimination of Danton. Robespierre resists, because Danton is so popular with the ordinary people and is his friend. Before that day's sitting of the National Convention, the legislative assembly of the country, General Westermann discusses with Danton a coup to overthrow the tyranny of Robespierre and the Committee. Danton disapproves, even though friends warn him that Robespierre is planning to have him jailed and he should strike first. Danton is positive that the influence of his newspaper, Le Vieux Cordelier, and the support of the people will keep him safe. However, he asks his supporter Bourdon to denounce H√©ron and his secret police in the Convention, which leads to H√©ron's arrest. That night, Danton asks Robespierre to an elaborate dinner in a private room of a restaurant, fortifying himself in advance with copious wine. Robespierre refuses to eat and insists on a serious talk. He asks Danton to join his cause and stop fighting him, because he does not want to be forced to have Danton executed. Danton simply carries on drinking and refuses all Robespierre‚Äôs advances. After Robespierre has left in disgust, in the street Danton meets a group of armed men who turn out to be part of Westermann's preparations for a coup. Once again, Danton refuses to join their illegal venture. Robespierre, having failed with Danton, then goes to the house of Desmoulins, who is furious that his printing business has been destroyed and refuses to talk to him. Robespierre tries to convince him that Danton is exploiting him, but is ignored. Desmoulins' wife begs Robespierre to stay and talk sense into her husband, because she wants him to live, but Robespierre can achieve nothing. He goes to the Committee of Public Safety and orders a warrant for the arrest that night of Danton, Desmoulins, Westermann and several of their associates. Though Danton could still rally support, he does not want to cause more bloodshed and accepts arrest, claiming that his oratory and the affection of the people will protect him. At the National Convention in the morning, members are outraged at the arrests, but Robespierre simply justifies his action by stating that Danton is an enemy of the Republic and must be tried regardless of his popularity. Having escaped arrest, Bourdon hastily changes sides and backs Robespierre. When the trial opens before the Revolutionary Tribunal, only seven jurors can be found who will agree to vote Danton guilty but it continues regardless. Danton keeps breaking order to address the spectators, and the prosecutor Fouquier is unhappy because he has insufficient grounds for a conviction. Back in prison that night, Danton's confidence is shaken when another prisoner tells him how overjoyed he is to hear that Danton, the first president of the Committee and the creator of the Revolutionary Tribunal, is to be executed. Next day, while visiting the studio of the painter Jacques-Louis David, Robespierre is told by Fouquier that Danton's constant interruptions are making a farce of the trial, which lacks validity anyhow. Robespierre gets the Committee to issue a decree that anyone who speaks out of turn will be removed from court. Within minutes, all the accused have been bundled out and the verdict of guilty is read. On the day before their execution Danton is depressed, not because of his death but because he feels that he has failed the people. Once the condemned men have been taken through the silent crowds to the scaffold and guillotined, Robespierre's long-maintained tension breaks and he relapses into shock. The noble ideals of the Revolution in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, recited to him by a child forced to learn it by heart, are fatally compromised.

Before its release, a private showing to the President of the Republic, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, and the Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, evoked a frosty reaction. They had not expected such a cynical tale of power politics, show trials and cold-blooded judicial murder, familiar though it all was in Eastern Europe under Soviet control.

The album utilises different combinations of band members in duos and trios with the entire band performing together on only one track \\"Fire and Ice\\". According to the Knitting Factory, \\"Heretic is an experimental narrative in the form of an extended trailer. A very funny take on psychotherapy starring Karen Finley.\\" Reception The Allmusic review by Caleb Deupree awarded the album 4¬Ω stars stating \\"Although this album is credited as a soundtrack for a porn movie (scenes from which decorate the sleeve art), its music will appeal to many improv-oriented listeners who have a hard time with the thrash/hardcore atmosphere that is so characteristic of the band's first album and the Torture Garden pieces.\\"Deupree, C.

While many of these views are religious in origin, some of the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production. Advocates support the development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging. Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to technology. Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe, and that it could be prone to abuse, either in the form of clones raised as slaves, or leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested. Opponents have also raised concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large. Religious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits. Cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while meat of cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by some other groups concerned about food safety. Philosophical debate The various forms of cloning, particularly human cloning, are controversial. There have been numerous demands for all progress in the human cloning field to be halted. Most scientific, governmental and religious organizations oppose reproductive cloning. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and other scientific organizations have made public statements suggesting that human reproductive cloning be banned until safety issues are resolved. Serious ethical concerns have been raised by the future possibility of harvesting organs from clones. Advocates of human therapeutic cloning believe the practice could provide genetically identical cells for regenerative medicine, and tissues and organs for transplantation. Such cells, tissues, and organs would neither trigger an immune response nor require the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Both basic research and therapeutic development for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as improvements in burn treatment and reconstructive and cosmetic surgery, are areas that might benefit from such new technology. One bioethicist, Jacob M. Appel of New York University, has gone so far as to argue that \\"children cloned for therapeutic purposes\\" such as \\"to donate bone marrow to a sibling with leukemia\\" may someday be viewed as heroes. Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits to couples who cannot otherwise procreate. In the early 2000s Severino Antinori and Panos Zavos stirred controversy when they publicly stated plans to create a fertility treatment that allows parents who are both infertile to have children with at least some of their DNA in their offspring.Staff, Times Higher Education. August 10, 2001 In the news: Antinori and Zavos In Aubrey de Grey's proposed SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence), one of the considered options to repair the cell depletion related to cellular senescence is to grow replacement tissues from stem cells harvested from a cloned embryo.de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007). Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime. New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 416 pp. . There are also ethical objections. Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity, that a potential life represented by the embryo is destroyed when embryonic cells are used, and there is a significant likelihood that cloned individuals would be biologically damaged, due to the inherent unreliability of cloning technology. Ethicists have speculated on difficulties that might arise in a world where human clones exist. For example, human cloning might change the shape of family structure by complicating the role of parenting within a family of convoluted kinship relations. For example, a female DNA donor would be the clone's genetic twin, rather than mother, complicating the genetic and social relationships between mother and child as well as the relationships between other family members and the clone. In another example, there may be expectations that the cloned individuals would act identically to the human from which they were cloned, which could infringe on the right to self- determination. Proponents of animal rights argue that non-human animals possess certain moral rights as living entities and should therefore be afforded the same ethical considerations as human beings. This would negate the exploitation of animals in scientific research on cloning, cloning used in food production, or as other resources for human use or consumption.Staff, Humane Society Cloning Religious views Religious views of cloning are mixed.Bob Sullivan, Technology correspondent for NBC News. November 262003 Religions reveal little consensus on cloning - Health - Special Reports - Beyond Dolly: Human Cloning Jainism and Hinduism Hinduism views on cloning are very diverse. While some Hindu people view therapeutic cloning as necessary to fix childlessness, others believe it is immoral to tamper with nature. The Sanatan Dharm (meaning the eternal set of duties for humans, which is what many people refer to Hinduism as) approves therapeutic cloning but does not approve human cloning. In Hinduism, one view has the creator, or the Brahman not as insecure to lay restrictions on scientific endeavours. Another view restricts human cloning. In Jainism, the birth of Mahavira is depicted as an operation of embryo transfer. In modern-day India, there have been clones of livestock species. Examples include Garima from the National Dairy Research Institute located in Karnal, where many other clones have been developed in Bovine species. Judaism Jewish view on cloning is unclear, but some orthodox rabbis allows cloning as a method of reproduction if no other method is available. Also Jewish religion treats all life equally even if it was formed by cloning. Liberal Jewish groups oppose the cloning of humans. Christianity Most of the Christian churches, including World council of Churches and United Methodist Church, oppose the research of cloning of either human embryos or whole human. The Roman Catholic Church, under the papacy of Benedict XVI, condemned the practice of human cloning, in the magisterial instruction Dignitas Personae, stating that it represents a \\"grave offense to the dignity of that person as well as to the fundamental equality of all people.\\" Many conservative Christian groups have opposed human cloning and the cloning of human embryos, since they believe that life begins at the moment of conception. Other Christian denominations such as the United Church of Christ do not believe a fertilized egg constitutes a living being, but still they oppose the cloning of embryonic cells. Islam According to the fatwa issued by Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi in the topic of cloning, Islam is opposed to human cloning. According to Islam, cloning of the entire human body is forbidden because of the following reasons: * It contradicts the diversity of creation. * The relationship between donor and clone can not be determined. * Cloning only requires one gender for genetic information which opposes the natural pattern of creating life by the pairing of a male and a female. Islam allows and recommends cloning of a specific part of human body for purpose of treatment. Animal cloning is allowed in Islam only if it bring benefits to all people and no harm is caused to the animal used in the cloning process. Use of cloned animals Cloned animals are used in medical research, pet cloning or for food.  Medical research  Cloned animals are used in scientific and medical research such as therapeutic cloning, stem cell research and human antibody production. One of the main ethical issues about this research procedure is it can be painful for the animal and often result in mental and physical damage. Another ethical problem is that clones created for medical purpose have very poor quality of life as tests are constantly being conducted on them.  Pet cloning  In 2005, an article in The Hastings Center Report said: > Critics of pet cloning typically offer three objections: (1) the cloning > process causes animals to suffer; (2) widely available pet cloning could > have bad consequences for the overwhelming numbers of unwanted companion > animals; and, (3) companies that offer pet cloning are deceiving and > exploiting grieving pet owners.  Cloning animals for food  On December 28, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the consumption of meat and other products from cloned animals. Cloned-animal products were said to be indistinguishable from the non-cloned animals. Furthermore, companies would not be required to provide labels informing the consumer that the meat comes from a cloned animal. In 2007, some meat and dairy producers did propose a system to track all cloned animals as they move through the food chain, suggesting that a national database system integrated into the National Animal Identification System could eventually allow food labeling. However, as of 2013 no tracking system exists, and products from cloned animals are sold for human consumption in the United States. Critics have raised objections to the FDA's approval of cloned-animal products for human consumption, arguing that the FDA's research was inadequate, inappropriately limited, and of questionable scientific validity. Several consumer-advocate groups are working to encourage a tracking program that would allow consumers to become more aware of cloned-animal products within their food. A 2013 review noted that there is widespread misunderstanding about cloned and cattle, and found that cloned cattle that reached adulthood and entered the food supply were substantially equivalent to conventional cattle with respect to the quality of meat and milk, and with respect to their reproductive capability.

The village of Castelnou takes its name from the castle. The Latin castellum novum became in Catalan castell nou, the \\"new castle\\". History From 990, the castle served as the administrative and military capital of the Viscount of Vallespir. Its irregular pentagonal plan follows the rocky outcrop on which it was built, this elevated position providing defence against enemy attacks. The castle was taken by the troops of James II of Majorca en 1286, and again in 1483. Largely demolished in 1559, it was no longer restored or inhabited and deteriorated throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. At the time of the French Revolution it became the property of the commune. It was sold to Viscount Satg√© in 1875 and, by 1900, had become again an elegant and habitable fortress. It was acquired in 1946 by Charles-Emmanuel Brousse who was married to Amy Elizabeth Thorpe, a famed spy who worked for Britain's MI6 during World War II. Having been ravaged by a terrible fire, in 1987 it was sold and has since been restored.

He served as MP in the UK House of Commons as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, representing Galway Borough from 1901 to 1902, and later West Clare from 1909 to 1918. Lynch fought on the Boer side during the Boer War in South Africa, for which he was sentenced to death but later pardoned. He supported the British war effort in the First World War, raising his own Irish battalion in Munster towards the end of the war. Arthur Alfred Lynch in 1915 Australian years Lynch was born at Smythesdale near Ballarat, Victoria, the fourth of 14 children. His father, John Lynch, was an Irish Catholic surveyor and civil engineer and his mother Isabella (n√©e MacGregor) was Scottish.Geoffrey Serle, 'Lynch, Arthur Alfred (1861 - 1934) ', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10, MUP, 1986, pp 176‚Äì177. Retrieved 23 September 2009 John Lynch was a founder and first president of the Ballarat School of Mines, and a captain of Peter Lalor at the Eureka Stockade rebellion (1854) and John Lynch wrote a book, Austral Light (1893‚Äì94), about it ‚Äì later republished as The Story of the Eureka Stockade. Arthur Lynch was educated at Grenville College, Ballarat, (where he was \\"entranced\\" by differential calculus) and the University of Melbourne, where he took the degrees of BA in 1885 and MA in 1887. Lynch qualified as a civil engineer and practised this profession for a short period in Melbourne. Europe and Ireland Lynch left Australia and went to Berlin, where he studied physics, physiology and psychology at the University of Berlin in 1888‚Äì89. He had a particular respect for Hermann von Helmholtz. Moving to London, Lynch took up journalism. In 1892, he contested Galway as a Parnellite candidate, but was defeated. Lynch met Annie Powell (daughter of the Rev. John D. Powell) in Berlin and they were married in 1895. They were to have no children. In Lynch's words, the marriage \\"never lost its happiness\\" (My Life Story, p. 85). In 1898, he was Paris correspondent for the London Daily Mail. Boer brigade When the Second Boer War broke out, Lynch was sympathetic to the Boers and decided to go to South Africa as a war correspondent. In Pretoria, he met General Louis Botha, and decided to join the Boer side. Lynch raised the Second Irish Brigade, which consisted of Irishmen, Cape colonists and others opposed to the British. He was given the rank of Colonel and saw limited active service. In his comprehensive history on the Australia's Boer War, Wilcox said,Wilcox, Craig. (2002) Chapter 13, 'Interloper Arthur Lynch, Irish-Australian Boer', in Australia's Boer War: The War in South Africa, 1899-1902 Oxford,pp. 262-268) it was misleading to call the seventy or so men in the Irish unit raised by Lynch \\"a brigade\\", rather he suggested that \\"the publicity that comes from spectacular gestures...\\" made Lynch appear \\"a romantic warrior\\" and that his actions \\"flattered many Irishmen and women...\\".Wilcox cited a source describing the Second Irish brigade's uitlanders as, \\" fifty or sixty soreheads, greasers, halfbreeds and dagos...the laughing stock and contempt of every commando in the neighbourhood\\" In contrast, O'Brien's fictional Bye-Bye Dolly Gray, is kinder to Lynch's showy South African exploits and his uitlanders. Michael Davitt who travelled to South Africa has photos of Lynch with his brigade on the veldt, in, The Boer Fight for Freedom. Conviction and pardon From South Africa, Lynch went to the United States, and then returned to Paris, from where he again stood for Galway Borough in November 1901 and was elected in his absence as MP. On going to London, Lynch was arrested because of his pro-Boer activities and remanded for eight months. Lynch was tried for treason, before three judges, and on 23 January 1903 was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. This sentence was immediately commuted to a life sentence, and a year later Lynch was released \\"on licence\\" by the Balfour government. In July 1907, Lynch was pardoned, and in 1909 he was again elected Member of Parliament, this time for West Clare, in Ireland. Munster battalion During World War I, Lynch volunteered for the New British Army. He raised a private 10th Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers and was given the rank of Colonel, although he and his unit never saw active front service. At the end of the war, Lynch chose to stand as a Labour candidate in newly created Battersea South for the 1918 General election. He finished second to the Unionist. He had qualified as a physician many years earlier, and began to practise medicine in London, at Haverstock Hill. He died in London on 25 March 1934.  Publications  Lynch wrote and published a large number of books ranging from poetry, to a sophisticated attempt to refute Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. His verse was clever and satirically Byronic, and his essays and studies show much reading and acuteness of mind. E. Morris Miller, himself a professor of philosophy, mentions Lynch's \\"high reputation as a critical and philosophical writer especially for his contributions to psychology and ethics\\" (Australian Literature, p. 273). His publications include: *Modern Authors (1891) *Approaches the Poor Scholar's Quest of a Mecca (1892) *A Koran of Love (1894) *Our Poets (1894) *Religio Athletae (1895)This is considered one of the sources for the ideology of modern Olympism, see Arnd Kr√ºger: The Origins of Pierre de Coubertin's Religio Athletae.

A brief history The title Sau Mai Kedekede originates from the Tongan word ‚ÄúHau‚Äù, denoting the divine nature of the Tu'i Tonga suggesting the frequent intercourse amongst the chiefly houses of Lakeba and Tonga in pre- Christian times. The title of Sau is considered much older and is independent of the title Tui Nayau, now held in tandem by the Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, as its original holders were from the island of Lakeba (pre-Vuanirewa dynasty). The first recorded holder of the title was Qilaiso and through him and his three descendants and successors, all of the southern Lau Islands(Moce, Kabara, Fulaga, Ono-i- Lau and their dependencies) was brought into Lakeba‚Äôs control and suzerainty. The Sau title eventually merged in time with the title Tui Nayau, and its dual usage commenced in the person of Rasolo. Both titles Sau Mai Kedekede and Tui Nayau are now inextricably linked, and heirs succeeding to the title Tui Nayau cannot do so unless recognised and installed as Sau Ni Vanua. The installation The investment ceremony for the Sau Ni Vanua takes place in Tubou on Lakeba. Once the elders of the Vuanirewa have endorsed the successor to the previous Tui Nayau, the Ramasi or chief makers and Vakavanua being chief herald are summoned to undertake the ceremony. The Ramasi consists of the Tui Tubou and the Tui Nasaqalau and the vanua represented by the Vakavanua of Ceiekena and Tui Soso (from Nukunuku village). During the ceremony the recipient will have a piece of bark cloth tied on his arms by each of the Ramasi and the coronation turban or salasiga placed upon his head by the Vakavanua. He also receives the coronation cup containing kava from the vakavanua, which he must drink to affirm his becoming Sau Ni Vanua O Lau. This is then followed by a general kava ceremony where principal chiefs of rank in Lau drink in turn, ceremonial titles are conferred by the Sau and gifts are presented by his people. The Sau's installation concludes with the removal of the arm bands and ritual bath after four days.

It was the fourth significantly updated iteration of the fifth generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (EF)‚Äîthe luxury-oriented version of the Falcon.  Introduction and changes  The Ford EF Falcon was introduced in August 1994. It was a significant facelift of the Ford Falcon (ED),Ford Falcon EF at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au. Retrieved 15 April 2011 which it replaced. All exterior panels other than the doors were new for the EF, while Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia now had unique frontal styling differentiating them from the Falcon models. An upgraded EF Series II range was introduced in October 1995. The EF Series also saw the first use of polycarbonate headlight lenses instead of glass, saving weight and gaining shatter resistance.  Model range  The EF range was offered in six, four-door sedan and four, five-door wagon models, marketed as follows: * Ford Falcon GLi sedan and wagon * Ford Falcon Futura sedan and wagon * Ford Falcon XR6 sedan and wagon * Ford Falcon XR8 sedan * Ford Fairmont sedan and wagon * Ford Fairmont Ghia sedan  Trim levels  Interior ;Base models The EF range started with the GLi and Futura. GLi models were available in sedan and wagon, appealing most to fleet buyers and family buyers respectively. GLi models offered 15-inch wheels, body-coloured front and rear bumpers except insert mouldings, drivers airbag as standard, and the 5-speed manual was standard with 4.0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder, while a 5.0-litre V8 and four-speed automatic was optional.EF Falcon GLi Specifications, ‚Äì True Blue Ford. The Futura shared the overall styling of the GLi and had the same engine and transmission options. While the Futura benefited from exterior differences such as body-coloured mirrors, bumpers and different wheel covers. The Futura was feature-rich, having front power windows, cruise control, ABS, rear headrests, interior map pockets standard, map lights, six-speaker audio system (six-stacker optional), a digital clock, variable intermittent wipers, fold-out rear-seat armrest and interior grab handles.EF Falcon Futura Specifications, ‚Äì True Blue Ford.

Both XR6 and XR8 had bold exterior styling similar to previous XR Falcons, featuring twin headlamps and red or black bumper strips (depending on the body colour) and unique 15-inch alloy wheels.EF Falcon XR6 and XR8 Specifications, ‚Äì True Blue Ford. All XR models had the features of the Futura plus their own features, including Tickford reprogrammed gear changes for the electronically controlled four-speed auto, Tickford developed sports suspension which included lower springs and upgraded swaybars, rear spoiler with built-in brake light standard on both wagons and sedans (rear-window- mounted stop light still present but disabled), limited slip differential standard with a lower ratio for increased acceleration, adjustable see-through sports front and rear headrests, 'Sports' front bucket seats with side bolsters, oil pressure and battery voltage gauges, 'Charcoal' leather-wrapped steering wheel, low oil pressure and washer fluid low warning lights, dual horn note. The XR6 had the same 4.0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder as the base models but with Tickford alloy cylinder heads, a Tickford spec cam along with higher pressure valve springs and unique EEC programming to make the most of the changes made to the engine. A press bent 2.5-inch exhaust was also added, a minor upgrade over the standard 2.25-inch system. The XR6 delivers at 5000 rpm up from in the ED Falcon. The XR8 has a 5.0-litre OHV (over head valve) V8 delivering at 4500 rpm up from the . LPG was not offered as a factory option on the XR6 and XR8 models.

The Fairmont Ghia added a nine-speaker audio system, boot mounted 6 CD stacker, subwoofer and Ghia badging. Both the Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia models had chrome accents, differently designed headlights, bonnets and front bar, and were the only model in the EF Falcon range to have a grille (albeit non-functional). four- speed automatic transmission was standard across the Fairmont lineup and had the option of the 4.0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder or a 5.0-litre OHV (over head valve) V8. The six-cylinder Ghia version received the motor out of the XR6.

Life His name appears in medieval manuscripts as Geraldus slightly more frequently than Gerardus. This form is also closer to the vernacular form Guiral Ot found in a poem by the Toulouse troubadour Raimon de Cornet.This poem, dated 1300, is addressed to Geraldus : \\"Al bo relegios,/ On grans devocios/ Par assels que l'an vist,/ Al bo senhor en Crist,/ A frayre Guiral Ot,/ Al prelat mot devot/ Ministre general/ E senhor principal/ De tot frayre menor...\\", ed. J.-B. Noulet and C. Chabaneau, Deux manuscrits proven√ßaux du XIVe si√®cle, Montpellier-Paris, 1888, 17‚Äì22. He is certainly born in Camboulit, into a family to which also belonged Bertrand de la Tour, another important Franciscan closely connected to John XXII, and made cardinal in 1320. Geraldus joined the Franciscan order at Figeac. He is first seen active as a teacher at the Toulouse studium in 1316, and probably remained there up until he was sent as a baccalaureus in Paris, in 1326, incepting as a Master in theology some time before 10 June 1329, when he was elected minister general of the order at the general chapter held in Paris. The presiding officer of this chapter was Cardinal Bertrand de la Tour, whom Pope John XXII had appointed vicar-general of the order. The previous minister general, Michael of Cesena, had been deposed by John XXII on 6 June 1328. The general chapter held at Paris (1329) took a position, in the name of the entire order, on the side of the pope and formally expelled the small party made up of Michael of Cesena's adherents. At the general chapter of Perpignan (1331), Odonis and fourteen provincial ministers presented a petition to John XXII on the issue of poverty which the pope rejected in the consistory of 1 August 1331. Owing to his views concerning poverty Geraldus also became entangled in a dispute with King Robert and Queen Sanzia of Naples and Sicily. These rulers were protectors of the rigid adherents to the rule of poverty as well as of the followers of Michael of Cesena and of the Fraticelli. Notwithstanding the papal letters of admonition and the fact that John XXII sent Geraldus Odonis as his representative to the Court of Naples in 1331 and the following year, Geraldus had new statutes drawn up. These regulations were confirmed, 28 November 1336, by Pope Benedict XII(1334‚Äì42); consequently Geraldus was able at the chapter held at Cahors, 7 June 1337, to obtain, in spite of strong opposition, the enactment of the so-called \\"Constitutiones Benedictinae\\". Nevertheless, he was in danger of being removed from his position, nor did the statutes remain in force longer that the lifetime of Benedict XII and the period during which Gerardus was general. The general chapter of Assisi abrogated, 1 June 1343, the \\"Constitutiones Benedictinae\\" and re-enacted, with some additions, the constitutions of Narbonne (1260). In union with the pope, Geraldus Odonis promoted Franciscan missions, constantly sending fresh missionaries to Persia, Georgia, Armenia (1329); Malabar (1330), China and Tatary (1331); Bosnia (1340). In 1329 John XXII sent him to King Charles I of Hungary and to Ban Stephen II of Bosnia for the purpose of bringing about the extermination of the heretics, largely Patarenes, in these countries. On 5 September 1333, Gerardus and the Dominican Arnauld de Saint-Michel (Arnauldus de S. Michaele) were appointed papal legates to make peace between the Kings of England and Scotland. The procurator of the Scottish king in Paris having reported, however, that his master was not to be found in Scotland, John recalled the commission of the legates, 31 October 1333. Geraldus remained in Paris and defended before a large number of professors of the university, on 18 December 1333, the opinion of John XXII concerning the Visio beatifica, namely, that the saints do not enjoy the complete Beatific Vision until after the Last Judgment. The University of Paris was greatly agitated by the controversy, and the next day, 19 December, Philip VI of France called together twenty-nine professors at Vincennes to discuss the question. This assembly dissented from the opinion of the pope, as did also a second assembly which met 2 Jan., 1334. John XXII withdrew his opinion, 3 December 1334. Geraldus Odonis was also one of the commission of sixteen masters of theology which met by command of Benedict XII from 4 July to 4 Sept., 1334, at Pont-Sorgues near Avignon, to discuss, under the pope's presidency, the question of the Visio beatifica. On 27 Nov., 1342, Benedict XII appointed him Patriarch of Antioch and at the same time Bishop of Catania in Sicily. Black Death In October 1347 the Black Death arrived in the nearby Sicilian port of Messina. The Messinese asked Gerardus Odonis for the relics of St Agatha to be moved from Catania to Messina. He agreed to this, but the citizens of Catania did not. As a compromise Gerardus dipped the relics in water and personally took the water to Messina. After his return from Messina Gerardus himself died of the black death. He was buried in the cathedral at Catania. Works Apart from the \\"Constitutiones Benedictinae\\" and the \\"Officium de stigmatibus S. Francisci\\", still recited in the Franciscan Order and commonly attributed to Gerardus, the best known of his writings is his \\"Commentarius [Expositio] in Aristotelis Ethicam\\" (Brescia, 1482, Venice, 1500). This work brought him the honour later of being called Doctor Moralis. He also wrote on logic and a treatise entitled \\"Philosophia Naturalis\\", in which he is said to have apparently taught Atomism; another work was a \\"Commentarius in IV libros Sententiarum\\". Among his exegetical works are: \\"De figuris Bibliorum\\", and treatises on the Psalter, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and the Epistle to the Galatians, besides \\"Sermones\\". In addition to taking severe measures against the adherents of the deposed Michael of Cesena, Gerardus addressed to the latter the writing \\"Quid niteris\\", to which, however, Cesena soon made a rejoinder beginning \\"Teste Salomone\\".

He is one of a small group of scholars, including J√ºrgen Paul, Adeeb Khalid, Robert D. McChesney, Jo-Ann Gross, Ashirbek Muminov, Maria Subtelny, Beatrice Forbes Manz, and St√©phane A. Dudoignon, who have worked seriously to debunk prevailing essentialist and ahistorical stereotypes about Sufism, Islam, and politics in the history of Central Asia. Like a very few Central Asian scholars before them, these experts work with equal facility on Arabic, Persian and Turkic, but have also developed working methods that understand concepts and practices of Islam and Islamic communities on the believers' own terms, rather than through biased and invariant concepts.Devin Deweese.

Called \\"a truly groundbreaking work\\" and \\"an epic book\\" that has \\"opened up whole new vistas onto the religious landscape of the Mongol empire and post- Chingizid Inner Asia\\", the book examines a narrative of Uzbeg Khan's conversion to Islam in the 14th century. It also examines pre-Islamic religious life in Inner Asia, the use of narratives as foundational myths, and the role of Islam and conversion in identity formation. The work won the Albert Hourani Book Award in 1995, and has received praise from many scholars.

Islam is the most widely practiced religion in Central Asia. The Hanafi school of thought of Sunnism is the most popular, with Shiism of Imami and Ismaili denominations predominating in the Pamir plateau and the western Tian Shan mountains (almost exclusively Ismailis), while boasting to a large minority population in the Zarafshan river valley, from Samarkand to Bukhara (almost exclusively Imamis).Naumkin, 38. Islam came to Central Asia in the early part of the 8th century as part of the Muslim conquest of the region. Many well- known Islamic scientists and philosophers came from Central Asia, and several major Muslim empires, including the Timurid Empire and the Mughal Empire, originated in Central Asia. In the 20th century, severe restrictions on religious practice were enacted by the Soviet Union in Soviet Central Asia and the People's Republic of China in Xinjiang. Concerns about Islamic radicalism and religious freedom in the region persist to this day. History=Arrival of Islam and Medieval period Age of the Caliphs The Battle of Talas in 751 between the Abbasid Caliphate and the Chinese Tang dynasty for control of Central Asia was the turning point, initiating mass conversion into Islam in the region. Most of the Turkic khanates were converted to Islam in the 10th century. The arrival in Volga Bulgaria of Ahmad ibn Fadlan, ambassador of the caliph of Baghdad, on 12 May 922 is celebrated as a holiday in modern-day Tatarstan. Islamisation of the region has had a profound impact on the native cultures in the region molding them as a part of Islamic civilization. Islamisation in the region has also had the effect of blending Islam into native cultures, creating new forms of Islamic practices, known as folk Islam, the most prominent proponent of which was Khoja Akhmet Yassawi whose Sufi Yeseviye sect appealed greatly to local nomads. Some have proclaimed that Yassawi was a Khwajagan, however, some scholars insist that his influence on the Shi'a Alevi and Bektashi cannot be underestimated. Until the Mongol invasion of Central Asia in the 13th century, Samarkand, Bukhara, and Urgench flourished as centers of Islamic learning, culture and art in the region. Mongol invasion halted the process for a half-century. Other areas such as Turkistan became more strongly influenced by Shamanist elements which can still be found today. Central Asian Islamic scientists and philosophers, including Al-Khwarzimi, Abu Rayhan Biruni, Farabi, and Avicenna made an important impact on the development of European science in the ensuing centuries. Turko-Mongolian tribes almost as whole were slow to accept certain Islamic tenets, such as giving up the consumption of alcohol or bathing before prayer. This is, however, believed to relate more directly to their nomadic lifestyle and local tradition than their faith in God and devotion to Islamic law and text. Russian Empire After conquests in the region by the Russian Empire in the 1860s and 1870s, western Central Asia came under Russian control and was incorporated into the empire as a Governor-Generalship led by Konstantin von Kaufman. Russian authorities debated what position they should take on Islam in the newly conquered territories. Some advocated a policy of religious repression, citing the ongoing Dungan Revolt in the neighboring Qing Empire as proof of the potential \\"threat\\" of Islam. Others, such as General Kaufman and his superior Dmitry Milyutin, preferred a policy of mild religious tolerance. Kaufman was nevertheless concerned about pan-Islam movements that would cause the Muslims of Russian Turkistan to view anyone other than the czar as their ruler.Brower, 116. Soviet Union While the practice of Islam was broadly tolerated by the Russian Empire during its rule over Central Asia from the mid-1860s to 1917, the advent of Soviet rule following the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and the subsequent civil war brought with it Marxist opposition to religion. During the first few years of Bolshevik rule in the early 1920s, Soviet officials took a pragmatic approach by prioritizing other goals (attempting to modernize culture, building schools, improving the position of women) in order to solidify their hold on Central Asia. During this time, the Bolsheviks cooperated with the Jadids (Muslims working towards social and cultural reforms such as improved education) to accomplish their goals. In the process, the Bolsheviks created a new political elite favorable towards Marxist ideology by using propaganda and appointing officials favorable towards their policies during the division of Central Asia into separate republics along ethnic lines in the 1920s and 1930s.Khalid, 65-71. In 1926, the Soviet government decided it had consolidated control over Central Asia sufficiently to shift official policy from toleration of Islam to condemnation. The government closed private religious schools in favor of state-run public ones. Between 1927 and 1929, the state ran a campaign to shut down mosques in Central Asia. This operation was not well documented, but existing accounts indicate that it was often violent and poorly controlled, often carried out by self-appointed officials who arrested imams and destroyed buildings, denouncing Islam as an enemy of communism.Khalid, 71-73. Despite these assaults, Islam in Central Asia survived Soviet rule in the following decades. However, it was transformed in the process: instead of part of the public sphere, Islam became family-oriented, \\"localized and rendered synonymous with custom and tradition.\\" Khalid, 82. This led to a homogenization of practice; as religious authorities could not publish treatises or often even communicate with one another, the store of religious knowledge available vastly decreased. Additionally, Islam was largely removed from the public discourse, especially in terms of its influence on morals and ethical values.Khalid, 83. What religious practice that was permitted by the Soviet government was regulated by the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. 1980s, 1990s, and Islamic Revival Muslim family in Tajikistan celebrating Eid-i Fatr The policy of glasnost put into practice by Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid-1980s meant that by 1988 the Soviet government relaxed its controls on Islam. As a result, there was a rapid religious revival, including new mosques, literature, and the return of private religious schooling. Many Central Asians were interested in the ethical and spiritual values that Islam could offer.Schwab, Wendell (Summer 2011). \\"Establishing an Islamic niche in Kazakhstan: Musylman Publishing House and its publications.\\" Central Asian Survey, 30 (2): 227-242.Khalid, 120-121. The revival accelerated further following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. For many, Islam constituted a national heritage that had been repressed during the Soviet era. Additionally, relaxed travel restrictions under Gorbachev enabled cultural exchange with other Muslim countries; Saudi Arabia, for example, sent copies of the Qur'an into the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. Islam, as practiced in Central Asia, became much more varied in this short time.Khalid, 121-123. Furthermore, Islam was attractive because it offered alternatives and solutions to the myriad political and economic problems facing the republics in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse.Karagiannis, 20 However, the governments of the Central Asian republics were wary of Islam in the political sphere. Their fears of undue influence were soon justified by the outbreak of the Tajik Civil War in 1992, between the Tajik government and a coalition of opponents led by a radical Islamist group called the Islamic Renaissance Party.Rashid, Jihad, 102. The civil war, which lasted until 1997, demonstrated to the other former Soviet republics the dangers posed by Islamic opposition groups. The takeover in 1996 of Afghanistan by the Taliban further emphasized that threat.Khalid, 123. The Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP) was one of several similar Islamic opposition groups, including the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which also fought against the Tajik government in the civil war.Karagiannis, 3 The IRP had its origins in underground Islamic groups in the Soviet Union. It was formed in 1990 in Astrakhan by a group consisting mostly of Tatar intellectuals, with separate branches for each Soviet republic. It was in fact registered as an official political party in Russia, but was banned by the Central Asian communist governments.Rashid, Jihad 98. Partly as a result of this oppression, political opposition erupted into the violence of the civil war in Tajikistan, in which over 50,000 people were killed out of a population of 6 million and another 250,000 fled the country to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan or elsewhere.Rashid, Fires, 50-52. Following the civil war, the Tajik government incorporated Islamic groups into the government in order to prevent future tensions. However, the other Central Asian republics did not follow this example, continuing instead to repress and persecute Islamic groups rather than allow them to participate in the political process.Rashid, Fires, 53-55. Not all Islamic movements were violent like the IRP; the most popular radical Islamic movement in Central Asia during the 1990s was the non-violent Hizb ut- Tahrir. Though it does not espouse the same violent methods as groups such as the IRP and IMU, its stated goal is to unite all Muslim countries through peaceful methods and replace them with a restored caliphate. For this reason, governments in Central Asia consider it a threat and have outlawed it as a subversive group in the Central Asian republics. 21st century Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign powers took a much greater interest in preventing the spread of radical Islamic terrorist organizations such as the IMU. The Central Asian republics offered their territory and airspace for use by the US and its allies in operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the international community recognized the importance of ensuring stability in Central Asia in order to combat terrorism.Van Wie Davies, 1-5. Powers such as the United States, Russia, and China were not only interested in fighting terrorism; they used the war on terror in order to advance their political and economic agendas in the region, particularly over the exploitation of Central Asian energy resources. In Tajikistan, the government took advantage of this shift in international attitude in order to erode the position of Islam in politics, taking steps such as forbidding the hijab (which is not traditional in Tajikistan, due to Soviet rule) in public schools and reducing the legal rights of Islamic groups. Since 2001, ethnic and religious tensions in the Central Asian republics combined with endemic poverty and poor economic performance have made them increasingly volatile. However, governments as often use Islamic groups as a justification for repression and crackdowns as those groups are the cause of violence, if not more often. For example, in May 2005 the Uzbek government massacred over 700 of its own civilians demonstrating following a trial of 23 suspected Islamic radicals, saying that they were terrorists. Though the events of the massacre were complex, this simplistic account appears to be false; instead, it was a case of the Uzbek government repressing peaceful protesters, perhaps attempting to prevent the sort of popular revolt that had occurred two months earlier in Kyrgyzstan, toppling President Askar Akaev.Khalid, 199. Overall, Islamic militancy in Central Asia is not a major threat to regional stability compared to the myriad social and economic problems‚Äîsuch environmental devastation around the Aral Sea, endemic poverty, poor education‚Äîthat plague the region.Khalid, 202. Central Asian expert Adeeb Khalid, writes that the situation in Central Asia demonstrates most of all that Islam is a complex phenomenon that rejects easy categorization into \\"good\\" and \\"bad,\\" \\"moderate\\" and \\"extremist,\\" and that the form Islam takes in Central Asia is not the same as the form it takes elsewhere. \\"For observers,\\" he writes, \\"it is critical to have perspective, to discern clearly the political stakes at issue...and to separate the disinformation dished out by the regimes from the actual conduct of Muslims.\\"Khalid, 203.

The film was based on an original story by Robert Pirosh. It was bought by MGM who were attracted by a project similar to their highly successful adaptation of King Solomon's Mines (1950). They announced it in 1952 with Eleanor Parker attached from the beginning. There were a number of Egyptian themed projects in development in Hollywood at the time, others being The Egyptian and Serpent of the Nile. Sam Zimbalist was meant to produce and Vittorio Gassmann was to co-star with Parker. Filming ended up being postponed a number of months. Gassman dropped out; Howard Keel was named as a possible replacement. Eventually the male lead was given to Robert Taylor, who had successfully teamed with Parker in Above and Beyond. Carlos Thompson played the second male lead. Charles Schnee was the supervising producer. MGM bought the rights to the archaeology text Gods, Graves and Scholars for \\"protection purposes\\", as it contained a chapter titled \\"Robbers in the Valley of the Kings\\", which might have been seen as having influenced the film's script. They paid a reported $25,000. Filming started in November 1953. The film was shot on location in Egypt over six weeks in Cairo, Luxor, Faiyum, Suez, the Western Desert and at the Pyramids of Giza. Additional filming took place over the next five weeks in El Segundo, California and at MGM's studios. Eleanor Parker recalled the film as the most difficult experience she ever had making a movie: > [It] was simply a dreadful nightmare. We had a terrible producer who made no > accommodations for the company or crew on location. We were in Egypt, out in > the desert filming, with no sanitary facilities, no dressing rooms to speak > of, it was unbelievable. Robert Taylor and I had to use the bathrooms with > the locals, hiding behind coats. Additionally, the director (Robert Pirosh) > had no idea what he was doing; the head cameraman (Robert Surtees) was > directing the film. Then the crew wasn't getting paid and our great > cameraman told them that we were all going out on strike until everyone got > paid. Believe me, the money showed up. The film's world premiere took place simultaneously on 21 July 1954 in Cairo and Alexandria (as well as New York City). It marked the first time an American film had a world premiere in Egypt. The film shows the Abu Simbel temples as they had existed for 3000 years, before they were relocated due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Reception=Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,591,000 in the US and Canada and $1,714,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $204,000.

Vaassen is situated between Apeldoorn and Zwolle, on the eastern edge of the Veluwe in the province of Gelderland and has 12,719 inhabitants (2008). Vaassen was an independent municipality up to 1 January 1818, when it merged with Epe. History The earliest signs of residents in this area are the burial mounds and \\"Celtic Fields\\" (square fields surrounded by small earthen walls, dating from the Iron Age) northwest of Vaassen in the Veluwe, between the Elburgerweg and Gortelseweg. There is a large complex (about 76 acres) of these fields in Vaassen, around Gortelseweg. The German inhabitants were farmers and lived there during the Roman era. They inhabited wooden huts and lived from agriculture, livestock, cultivation of herbs, and hunting deer and boar. The town was mentioned for the first time in a certificate from the Codex Laureshamnensis of the monastery of Lorschin in the year 891 or 892, when someone called Brunhilde gave a farmhouse and the church to Lorsch. The name Vaassen derives from \\"Fasna\\", an old word for a specific rough type of grass. From 2 September 1887 up to 8 October 1950 there was a railway station in Vaassen. The station was part of the so-called Baron line between Apeldoorn and Zwolle. In 1950 the station was closed because the line was discontinued. The former railway station is still in existence, but is now used as a dwelling. Vaassen is characterized by a centuries-long coexistence of Protestant and Roman Catholic populations. In the 1950s, groups of Moluccans were housed in Vaassen. Berkenoord Camp was used for housing. On October 14, 1976, friction with the government regarding housing led to the evacuation of the Moluccans from this dwelling place. Today there is still a considerable Moluccan community in Vaassen. Architecture Vaassen's most remarkable historical building is the 16th century Cannenburgh Castle, once home to the knight Maarten van Rossum.

Both can be used on the same system although this use case is unlikely. Both products, the High Availability Add-On and Load Balancer Add-On, are based on open-source community projects. Red Hat Cluster developers contribute code upstream for the community. Computational clustering is not part of cluster suite, but instead provided by Red Hat MRG. High-Availability Add-On The High Availability Add-On is Red Hat's implementation of Linux-HA. It attempts to ensure service availability by monitoring other nodes of the cluster. All nodes of the cluster must agree on their configuration and shared services state before the cluster is considered to have a quorum and services are able to be started. The primary form of communicating node status is via a network device (commonly Ethernet), although in the case of possible network failure, quorum can be decided through secondary methods such as shared storage or multicast. Software services, filesystems and network status can be monitored and controlled by the cluster suite, services and resources can be failed over to other network nodes in case of failure. The Cluster forcibly terminates a cluster node's access to services or resources, via fencing, to ensure the node and data is in a known state. The node is terminated by removing power (known as STONITH) or access to the shared storage. More recent versions of Red Hat use a distributed lock manager, to allow fine grained locking and no single point of failure. Earlier versions of the cluster suite relied on a \\"grand unified lock manager\\" (GULM) which could be clustered, but still presented a point of failure if the nodes acting as GULM servers were to fail. GULM was last available in Red Hat Cluster Suite 4.

It opened in 1913 as a heavy rail station and closed for conversion to light rail in 1991, opening with the new Metrolink system in 1992. Woodlands Road was the closest station to the Manchester Museum of Transport on Boyle Street. Two new stations opened nearby, ( and ), which led to the closure of the stop on 16 December 2013. History The original railway line was opened in 1879 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Manchester Victoria and Bury. Woodlands Road, and stations were added to the line in 1913, in an attempt to fend off growing electric tramway competition in the Cheetham Hill area. The original halt had wooden platforms. The site is near the vanished junction of a former branch line to the chemical works in Blackley. Closure Map showing the developments to the Metrolink network; two new tram stops opened at Abraham Moss and Queens Road while Woodlands Road closed The UK Government announced that ¬£4 million from the Community Infrastructure Fund was awarded to two new stops on the Bury Metrolink line. This was part of ¬£30 million allocated to transport projects to support thousands of extra homes being built across the country over the coming months. The Chairman of the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority, Councillor Keith Whitmore, stated that the funding would help realise a long-held ambition to open new Metrolink stops in the area. The two new stops were: * (opened 2011), situated close to the Abraham Moss Centre, the library and leisure centre and the City College Manchester; it is located approximately from Woodlands Road station. * (opened 2013), providing a closer stop to the Museum of Transport. The site is close to the Queens Road tram depot and there was a small tram halt there for Metrolink staff only, which was replaced by a full passenger station. The station opened on 16 December 2013. These two new tram stops replaced Woodlands Road station, which was closed on 16 December 2013; the decision provoked some opposition from local residents who campaigned to retain the station. Services Woodlands Road was located on the Bury Line with trams towards Bury stopping every 6 minutes between 9:59am and 4pm, Mondays to Fridays. with no weekend or evening service. This was due to the opening of the nearby Abraham Moss Metrolink station further north along the Bury line. Connecting bus routes Woodlands Road was a Metrolink station that was not served by any bus service. The nearest bus services were the 151, 156 and 165 on Hazelbottom Road or Smedley Road and the 88, 89 and 135 on Cheetham Hill Road.

The match took place from 29 January to 2 February 1988 and was drawn. It did not count as part of The Ashes series, in the same way as the Centenary Tests in 1977 and 1980 also were excluded from the Ashes lists. The match was played in the middle of an England tour to New Zealand, where the team later played three Test matches, all of them also drawn. Previously the same winter, the England team had toured Pakistan, and Australia had hosted Tests and One Day Internationals against New Zealand and Sri Lanka (the single Test against Sri Lanka came after the Bicentennial Test, but all other matches were before it). The teams Sydney's reputation for favouring spin bowling led both sides to pick two specialist spin bowlers and to favour medium-pace or fast-medium bowling over out-and-out speed. England were captained by Mike Gatting, fresh from his finger-wagging confrontation with umpire Shakoor Rana, and lacked several of the big name players of recent years, such as Graham Gooch, David Gower, Allan Lamb, and Ian Botham. The team was, in batting order: * Chris Broad * Martyn Moxon * Tim Robinson * Mike Gatting (captain) * Bill Athey * David Capel * John Emburey * Bruce French (wicketkeeper) * Neil Foster * Eddie Hemmings * Graham Dilley. Australia were captained by Allan Border. The team, in batting order, was: * Geoff Marsh * David Boon * Dean Jones * Allan Border (captain) * Mike Veletta * Steve Waugh * Peter Sleep * Greg Dyer (wicketkeeper) * Peter Taylor * Tony Dodemaide * Craig McDermott. The match England won the toss and batted. Broad shared stands of 93 with Moxon, who made 40, and 99 with Robinson, who made 43, on his way to a century on the first day. Wickets fell more steadily across the second day, including Broad for 139. Broad reacted angrily to his dismissal, and flattened the leg stump with his bat as he departed: he was fined the maximum permitted (¬£500) by the tour manager. England's final total of 425 contained no other scores of more than 50: the next highest after Broad was French with 47. On the third day, Australia batted poorly and lost wickets regularly to shots more suited to one-day cricket. Jones made 56, but when bad light ended play two hours early, the side was 164 for seven wickets, 62 runs short of the follow-on. In tense cricket on the fourth morning, they failed to reach that figure by 12 runs, and Gatting enforced the follow-on. With the pitch getting slower and easier, Marsh and Boon put up a first-wicket partnership of 162 and after Marsh went for 56, Boon batted on and on across the final day, eventually reaching 184 not out, his then-highest Test score, as Australia got to 328 for two to save the match. They were helped by the loss of more play to bad light (when Gatting recalled fast bowler Dilley to the attack), injuries to both Dilley and Foster and lack of penetration among the other England bowlers. The match was watched by 103,831 people, well below the forecast figure.

The station installed Falco cycle lockers in July 2011. Services Crumpsall serves as a Metrolink stop for both Altrincham to Bury services, and Bury to Piccadilly services. Services mostly run every 12 minutes on these two routes, resulting in a 6-minute service between Bury and Manchester at peak times.

This also saw the construction of a new foot crossing at the bottom of the platforms, completed on 7 February 2018. The footbridge was then demolished two days later, meaning currently, the Manchester-bound platform is only accessible via the foot-crossing at the bottom of the Bury-bound platform, although the station's accessibility has not been compromised. In the April 2019 Bank Holiday, a section of track was replaced with points south of the station, these points currently allow trams to cross from the north-bound line to the south-bound line and then across onto the track that will eventually lead into Platform 3. Over the 2019 May Bank Holiday weekend (4 - 6 May), the Manchester bound platform was resurfaced, and the disabled access ‚Äòtiles‚Äô were added to the newly installed third platform at the stop. Two new waiting shelters were also installed on the south-end of platforms 2 & 3 with a new passenger information display and seating.

It is served by route S1 of the Berlin S-Bahn, with trains in both directions stopping every 20 min during the hours of operation. Location The station is situated centrally in the former municitality of Lehnitz which in 2003 was incorporated into Oranienburg, from the former Nordbahnhof on the line of Berliner Nordbahn and from Oranienburg station. It is in fare zone Berlin C of Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg. History The passenger-only station was opened on 10 April 1878. On 4 October 1925 an electric S-Bahn train reached the station for the first time. While south of Birkenwerder station the tracks for suburban and long-distance traffic were separate, both services shared the tracks north of it, and thus also in Lehnitz station. One track of the line was lifted after 1945 for war reparations. After it was relaid, suburban and long-distance traffic each used a separate track. Since only S-Bahn trains stopped in Lehnitz, the eastern platform was therefore not used from 1964. Work started in 1977 to upgrade the line to four tracks. A new bridge across the Oder Havel Canal was built north of Lehnitz station which was completely renewed.The tracks were moved west, and the new station, southwest of the old one, was opened in March 1980. The S-Bahn trains originally used only the western track, and the long-distance trains passed the eastern side of the platform without stopping. The new long- distance tracks east of the platform were taken into service in April 1989, and S-Bahn trains have used both sides of the platform since then. Buildings and engineering works The original station was situated at ground level and had two side platforms and a small station building. The new station was built on an embankment and has an island platform which is accessed at its northern end by stairs from a foot tunnel, and at its southern end by a barrier-free ramp. The latter access route crossed the western S-Bahn track and is protected by crossing gates. The old station building was dismantled in 1981/1982, and no traces remain of it and the former gated level crossing.

It carries the Botley Road (A420) from Botley into Oxford. The Thames Path crosses the river on this bridge, just above Osney Lock. The original bridge was probably built by the monks of Osney Abbey, to carry the main road across the millstream of Osney Mill west from the island then known as Osney. By the early 17th century it was a three arch stone construction. In 1790 the millstream became the main navigation channel of the river, and the bridge became a serious obstruction to navigation by the mid 19th century. In 1885 the central arch collapsed leaving massive piers Osney Bridge has the lowest headroom (less than 7' 6\\") of any across the navigable Thames, and as such limits the size of boats that can travel past it without having to be removed from the water and placed upstream of the bridge. Whereas some\\"WHERE THAMES SMOOTH WATERS GLIDE\\" are happy with the restriction: \\"I would be sorry to see it changed. The river above here is special and I would not want to see boats any larger than those currently using it\\", others argue that the bridge should be raised to accommodate taller boats. Since the upper reaches of the River Thames will in due course link again with the Gloucester & Sharpness Ship Canal via the Stroudwater Canal and the Thames & Severn Canal (the latter two currently incomplete in need of restoration), Canal system map the Osney Bridge would seem an unacceptable obstacle to the growing popularity of canal and river navigation.

X. translucens). It has been known as a disease since the late 19th century. It has a worldwide distribution.  Symptoms  The disease is characterized by small, pale green spots or streaks which soon appear water-soaked. The lesions expand and then appear as dry dead spots. The lesions elongate into linear streaks which may eventually extend the full length of the leaf. Lesions rarely occur on the leaf sheath or culm. In severe infections, a milky gray exudate may be squeezed from the cut end of leaf exhibiting symptoms. Brown spots on the margin of the cotyledon characterized plants  Disease cycle  This disease is caused by a common bacterium that persists in soil and water and is spread by wind-driven rains. The bacteria overwinters on crop residue, seed, fall- sown cereals, and perennial grasses. Spring infection may result from any of these sources. Subsequent infections are spread by splashing of bacterial ooze by rain drops, plant to plant contact and insects. Bacterial blight develops on the upper leaves of during periods of cool, wet weather, after the plants have reached the boot stage. Leaf blight is associated with high relative humidity, wet weather, and cool spring temperatures (15-25 degrees C or 60-75 degrees F). Warm, dry weather stops the disease and new emerging leaves may be relatively free of bacterial infection.  Crop loss  Although detailed studies have not been conducted, damage to the flag often occurs suggesting that yield losses may reach 10-15%.  Management  Disease incidence and severity is reducing by rotating to non-grain crops, burying crop residue and using disease free seed. No resistant cultivars are known, some are more susceptible than others.

Biography Mundell was born the fourth child and only boy to Theresa and Alvin Mundell. Alvin Mundell was a successful lawyer.Campbell, Howard (2012) \\"Hugh Mundell freedom fighter\\", Jamaica Observer, 15 June 2012, retrieved 17 June 2012 Hugh attended St. Margaret's Preparatory School, Kingsway Preparatory School and the Ardenne High School before pursuing a career in music. Most thought that Mundell would become an athlete because he was known to be a competitive runner and routinely participated in street running races with other neighbourhood youth. Mundell grew up just houses away from three other youth who would also go on to become reggae singers: Winston McAnuff, Earl Sixteen Daley, and Yabby You protog√© Wayne Wade. Mundell was introduced to reggae by reggae performer and producer Boris Gardiner who was a friend of the family. Mundell was at Joe Gibbs' studio the day that Winston McAnuff recorded the song \\"Malcolm X.\\" Joe Gibbs offers Mundell the opportunity to record and they lay down a track titled \\"Where Is Natty Dread?\\" The track is never pressed to vinyl. It is at Gibbs' studio that he meets dub maestro Augustus Pablo. Mundell explains in his November 1980 interview with Sounds magazine's Edwin Pouncey: ‚ÄúI did one recording for Joe Gibbs for Errol Thompson Records which was not released called 'Where Is Natty Dread' and one day I was at the studio and Augustus Pablo saw me at the Joe Gibbs session 'cos he used to run around and check it out y'know. And he asked me to come and do some recordings for him so I said 'Yeah!' So I went by his house and started rehearsing and he create the rhythms. The following Saturday we went to the studio where we recorded my first two songs for release called 'Africa Must Be Free' and 'My, My.'\\" Between 1976 and 1978 Mundell and Pablo lay the tracks for what would ultimately become Mundell's debut LP Africa Must Be Free By 1983. Produced by Augustus Pablo, Mundell wrote every song on the record. It included two Black Ark-recorded titles: \\"Let's All Unite\\" and \\"Why Do Black Man Fuss & Fight\\", both supervised and mixed by Lee Perry. The album received five stars from Rolling Stone magazineRolling Stone 5 Star Album Lists ‚Äì 1983 and was included in Tom Moon's 2008 book, 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. He was a major influence on Junior Reid, who was three years younger, and Mundell was the first to record Reid. He also kept a close friendship with Reid's friend Lacksley Castell, who like Reid, hailed from Waterhouse. Mundell recorded several 12\\" singles under the alias Jah Levi.Craig Harris: Hugh Mundell (Allmusic) Hugh Mundell only performed publicly several times throughout his career. While he may have performed a number of shows in Jamaica and the UK, only the following shows have been confirmed: * Mundell performs at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) 14th anniversary show on Wednesday, 25 May 1977 at the Queens Theatre in Kingston. Also on the bill are the Twelve Tribes of Israel Players composed of Junior Dan on bass, Sangie Davis on guitar, Albert Malawi on drums, and Pablo Black on keys; and Generation Gap, which includes a very young Wycliffe \\"Steely\\" Johnson on keys and Dalton Brownie on guitar. Many of the players at this event are the very same musicians who play on Mundell's Africa Must Be Free By 1983. They were also part of the Rockers All-Stars, who play on Augustus Pablo's productions. 29 October 1979, Ward Theatre, Kingston, JA w/Augustus Pablo, Junior Delgado, Dave Robinson, Tallawah Dancers, Tivoli High School Dancers, Horace Andy, Little Junior, Jaba Tate, Shaolin Kid.

July 1981, The Stone, San Francisco. 4 October 1981, Reggae Sunblast Festival, Greek Theatre, Berkeley, California. Also on the bill are Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, Joe Higgs, The Wailers Band, and Wailing Souls. Mundell appeared in the Bay area in December 1981 where he played a reggae roots festival along with Wailing Souls, Raskidus, Joe Higgs & Unity, and Uprising at the Oakland Auditorium on 11 December and the Japan Center Theater on 12 December. 30 May 1982, Keystone, Berkeley, California, backed by I-DREN, an all-Jamaican band hailing from the bay-area. In reviewing Mundell's performance in the local city paper, music journalist Bruce Dancis wrote the following: ‚ÄúNineteen year old Jamaican singer Hugh Mundell, backed by Ras Kidus Roots Connection, contributed a brief set that was marred by the fact that he was obviously feeling the effects of a cold. This was a disappointment, because the angelically voiced singer possesses one of the purest voices in popular music. Ironically, in Mundell‚Äôs prior Berkeley appearance this past July, his glorious vocals were impeded by poor communication with his support band; this time around, Mundell and the band were more connected, but the singer‚Äôs illness prevented him from launching into the spirited performance of which he is capable.‚Äù In addition to performing live as a reggae artist, Mundell also performed live as Jah Levi throughout Jamaica on the island sound system circuit with the likes of Barrington Levy, Burro Banton, Ranking Toyan, Junior Reid, and Elfigo Barker (Volcano Hi-Fi). He also performed for Noel Harper's Killamanjaro Sound System with artists like Super Cat, John Wayne, Dirty Harry, Junior Reid, Madoo, Hopeton James, Puddy Roots, and Major Manzie. There is existing audio of Mundell performing on the sound system circuit on two occasions. In August 1983, Mundell, along with Junior Reid, represented Killamanjaro at Whitehall Avenue, Kingston. With selector Ainsley on the turntable, Mundell and Reid did several numbers, Mundell versioning \\"Reasons\\" and Reid voicing the \\"Some Guys\\" standard. On 7 September 1983 Mundell and Junior Reid represented Volcano Sound at Cassava Piece, Constant Spring, Kingston 8. With Volcano's selector Danny Dread at the controls, Mundell and Reid spar over the \\"Diseases\\" riddim before they perform the \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" standard. Mundell also performs his song \\"Great Tribulation.\\" Mundell was shot to death on 14 October 1983 while sitting in his vehicle on Grant's Pen Avenue, Kingston, Jamaica. Also in the car were Mundell's wife in the passenger seat and Junior Reid, who was sitting in the back seat. Reid survived the assault and spoke in great detail about it in a 1985 interview with The Beat's Roger Steffens. At the time of his death, Mundell had recorded five LPs and numerous singles. Trial and Conviction of Rodrigo Codrington for the murder of Hugh Christopher Mundell On Friday, 22 November 1985, Mr. Justice Downer sentenced 25-year-old Ricardo Codrington, labourer of Above Rocks, St. Andrew, to ten years imprisonment at hard labour for the murder of Hugh Mundell. The sentencing occurred after a Home Circuit Court found Codrigan guilty of manslaughter arising out of the fatal shooting of Mundell on 13 October 1983. Codrington was charged with murder, but the jury convicted him of the lesser offense. The Judge said Codrington had already served two years and that was taken into account when sentencing him.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by several local buses. History The station building with the low-level railway platform was also built by the railway management in Berlin from 1908 to 1910, according to a design by Gustav Hart and Alfred Lesser (Hart & Lesser). The Berlin Terrain-Centrale, which at that time opened up Frohnau as a new settlement area, paid a construction cost of 30,000 Marks and took over the operating costs for four years. Long before the establishment of Frohnaus, the Nordbahn between Berlin and Stralsund had been operating here since 1877. From 1891 it was developed two-fold. On the place of today's station Frohnau stood a train station house. The next stations were Hermsdorf in the south and Stolpe in the north (Stolpe station was just north of today's disability settlement and closed in 1924). When the Frohnauer Bridge was laid out in 1909, the railroad tracks were lowered, the surrounding area was laid, and the road bridge was built as a link between the districts built by the railway. On 1 May 1910 the new station Frohnau was inaugurated; 1640 visitors were counted. On April 1, 1925, the electric train took the place of the steam trains to Oranienburg. Frohnau was the northern terminus of the S-Bahn S1 from 1961 to 1992 due to the construction of Berlin Wall. Despite the shrinking passenger numbers as a result of the S-Bahn boycott used after 1961, the operation along the Nordbahn was maintained and even continued after the Berlin S-Bahn strike 1980. It was only when the BVG was taken over by the BVG on 9 January 1984 that the company ceased operations. After the takeover of the company, the passengers were offered massive protests for a company, and they were resumed on 1 October 1984. However, this only lasted until May 1986, the route was then extensively rehabilitated and the second route was rebuilt. On 22 December 1986 the work had been completed. Between 1984 and 1986, the railway station's travel facilities were renovated.

The disease is found everywhere that barley is grown, but only causes significant yield losses in warm, humid climates.  Symptoms  Infections appear as dark, chocolate-colored blotches. The spots merge, eventually forming irregular necrotic patches on the leaves. Leaf spots may be surrounded by a zone of yellow leaf tissue of varying width. Spot may also appear on the leaf sheaths, necks and heads of the plant. Heavily infected leaves dry up completely, and infections on the flag leaf during kernel filling are the most serious.  Disease cycle  The fungus overwinters in barley straw and stubble, in the soil, or on the seed. Spores are produced on barley debris in the spring and are dispersed by wind and rain. Barley seedlings may become infected from inoculum on the seed or in the soil. Temperatures above 20¬∞C and moist humid conditions within the crop canopy favour spot blotch development. Conducive weather conditions may favour successive production of new spores and lesions leading to rapid disease development during the growing season.  Yield loss  The disease may be particularly damaging in the Upper Midwest of the United States. Yield losses of 10-30% may be occur when weather conditions are conducive to disease development.  Management  The disease is managed by using resistant varieties, clean seed, seed treatments, foliar fungicide and rotation to non-cereal crops.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by several local buses. History The station was opened on July 10, 1877 under the name Hermsdorf (Mark) as a ground-level station of the northern railway. First, only long-distance trains drove the route, a first suburban traffic with steam trains developed around the year 1900. Since in Hermsdorf at that time developed extensive residential district and the place developed into one of the largest along the route, the long-distance service remained nonetheless. However, the mixed operation between the two classes of trains proved to be a permanent problem, which is why in 1908 the four-track extension of the line to Hermsdorf was decided. Between 1909 and 1910, work was carried out to build the track; Most stations were completed by 1912. Since the station in Hermsdorf should be moved further north in order to be able to open up the villa area better, first the old platform had to be used. While the work was still under way, it was decided to continue the suburban railroad to Frohnau, where another villa settlement was built. Under these circumstances, the work dragged on until April 1913. The new station had two middle platforms for suburban traffic, connected to a three-track sweeper and a small freight yard. At the end of the 1910s, the Prussian government decided to electrify the three northern sections of Berlin - the Stettiner, Kremmener and Nordbahn - the latter to Hermsdorf. First, the AC operation over overhead line was given preference. In 1922, however, the Free State decided in favor of the DC operation via lateral busbar. In addition, the electrical operation should be extended to Oranienburg. After initially the Szczecin Railway on August 8, 1924 electrical operation - the today's S -Bahn - took up, followed the Northern Railway on the section Gesundbrunnen-Hermsdorf-Birkenwerder on June 5, 1925. The remaining piece to Oranienburg followed on 3 October the same year. As the suburban trains operated on schedule at least to Birkenwerder, the long-distance transport was omitted, the platform was demolished in 1933. Since the Berlin city limits on October 1, 1920 extended as a result of the Greater Berlin Act to behind Frohnau, followed in 1937/1938 renaming the still valid name Berlin-Hermsdorf. After 1945, the section Wilhelmsruh-Birkenwerder was reduced to one track each for long-distance and commuter rail. Since there were no deviations along the route, the trains could only run at hourly intervals. Only in 1948 was the clock by two dodges in Waidmannslust and Frohnau compressed to 20 minutes, Hermsdorf, however, remained single-tracked. After 1952, in addition, the long-distance traffic in the Berlin area, since the route was now in the western part of the city, abandoned, the tracks were not used for the expansion of the S -Bahn line. Despite the shrinking passenger numbers as a result of the S-Bahn boycott, which began after 1961, operations along the northern runway were maintained and continued even after the Reichsbahn strike in 1980. Only with the assumption of the operating rights by the BVG on 9 January 1984 was the short-term decommissioning. Since the passengers after the takeover with massive protests for an operation pronounced, was already on 1 October 1984 the traffic resumed until Frohnau. However, this only lasted until May 1986, the route was then shut down, removed and rebuilt double track. The also decommissioned freight yard was not put back into operation after completion of the work. On December 22, 1986, the work was completed. After German reunification, traffic was resumed via the West Berlin city border as far as Oranienburg. Since December 2014, the train driver takes place by means of the driver's cab monitor (ZAT-FM), previously the station was occupied by a local supervision.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by several local buses. History On May 20, 1884, the former colony Waidmannslust received its own demand point at the Berlin Nordbahn. This was financed by the forester and innkeeper Ernst Bondick, who in this time the development and settlement of his lands promoted. Bondick took a particularly clever approach here: on the day on which a count of the departing passengers was on a trial basis, he invited all acquaintances to his restaurant, so that the railway administration was impressed by the rush and set up a permanent operation. Since long ago, the northern runway between Berlin and Stralsund had been operating here since 1877. From 1891 the line was double-railed and raised in the years 1908-1912 on their current level, here were built by the long-distance tracks separate suburban tracks between Gesundbrunnen and Frohnau. The station building and the bridges over the Waidmannsluster Damm date from this time and are now a listed building. On June 5, 1925, the electric train took the place of the steam trains, first to Birkenwerder, then later to Oranienburg. On May 2, 1929, the extension of the tram line along the Wittenauer Cyclopstra√üe (now partially Jean-Jaur√®s-Stra√üe) to the station Waidmannslust was opened with the line 68. With the increased wartime adjustment of bus lines came on 16 October 1939 the amplifier line 274 added. Both lines then operated until 1 July 1942 to the station Waidmannslust. After 1945, the section Wilhelmsruh-Birkenwerder was reduced to one track each for long-distance and commuter rail. Since there were no evasive routes along the route, the trains could only run at hourly intervals. Only in 1948 was the clock by two dodges in Waidmannslust and Frohnau compressed to 20 minutes. After 1952, in addition, the long-distance traffic in the Berlin area, since the route was now in the western part of the city, abandoned, the tracks were not used for the expansion of the S -Bahn line. During the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the S-Bahn between the stations Frohnau and Hohen Neuendorf was interrupted. In the same year the southern entrance was bricked up. Despite the shrinking passenger numbers as a result of the S-Bahn boycott, which began after 1961, operations along the northern runway were maintained and continued even after the Reichsbahn strike in 1980. Only with the assumption of the operating rights by the BVG on 9 January 1984 was the short-term decommissioning. Since the passengers after the takeover with massive protests for an operation pronounced, was already on 1 October 1984 the traffic resumed until Frohnau. However, this only lasted until May 5, 1986, the route was then extensively renovated and the second track completely restored. On December 22, 1986, the work was completed. In 2004, S85 had been introduced from this station to Gr√ºnau. In 2017, the S26 to Teltow Stadt replaced S85 service. After German reunification, the gap was closed on the West Berlin city boundary between Frohnau and Hohen Neuendorf, so that since 31 May 1992 again continuous S-Bahn operation on the Northern Railway to Oranienburg is possible. A planned backfilling of the southern pedestrian tunnel prevented the district Reinickendorf, by taking over this in their own responsibility. In 2001, the access structure was renovated and restored to its original state. On January 29, 2007, an elevator was put into operation. Since October 2011, the electronic interlocking Waidmannslust controls the section between Sch√∂nholz (a) and Hohen Neuendorf (a). This is the first section that has been converted to the new train control system of S-Bahn Berlin (ZBS). However, the building of the control computer is not at Waidmannslust station, but at Hermsdorf station. After several years of delays in March 2012 began the reconstruction of the previously closed southern platform access, in this course, the staircase and its roof were rebuilt. At the end of the same year, access was released. 900,000 euros were invested for this purpose.

Tony Rodriguez Lt. Tony Rodriguez is a fictional character in the television series NYPD Blue. He was played by Esai Morales for 66 episodes from 2001-2004. Rodriguez was assigned as 15th squad commander after the detectives all but rebelled against Lt. Arthur Fancy's unpopular replacement, Lt. Susan Dalto. Fancy called in one last favor from Captain Bass and had Dalto transferred out - and Rodriguez transferred in. Rodriguez had previously been a part of the narcotics squad where he had been a successful undercover officer; the squad (except for Andy) became excited that their new boss was a \\"living legend\\". Andy was initially scornful, with their differences coming largely from the fact that Rodriguez was far more hands on than any of the other leaders the squad had experienced. When Rodriguez overrode Andy and intervened in a case, Andy reminded him that being a boss was different than being a detective, which Rodriguez accepted as fair criticism. Andy's disputes with Rodriguez were generally addressed very quickly and it was clear there was a lot of mutual respect between the two men. Tony's past in Narcotics came back to haunt him when a vengeful dealer he'd put in jail got out and attacked Tony's mom. Tony steamrolled the other cops working the case and eventually forced the criminal to confess to his new crime at gunpoint - a fact he lied about at the criminal's trial. In Season 10, Tony reconnected with his ex-wife, who had left him when she was addicted to drugs. Though she initially claimed to be clean and Tony adamantly ignored reality to defend her, he discovered she was using again and demanded she seek treatment. She ended up fleeing again and was later found dead of an overdose. Tony initially demanded a homicide investigation, and angrily accused a man who was also an ex-husband of being involved in the death. The facts eventually became clear, and Tony faced the reality of her self-inflicted demise. Tony had a professional problem with Captain Fraker, an Internal Affairs investigator who carried a grudge against Tony and tried to have him fired. Fraker's machinations nearly cost Tony his command in season 9, but Andy shut down Fraker's vendetta by threatening to reveal that Fraker was having an affair with one of his female subordinates. Word of Fraker's corruption eventually got out. After his dirty dealings were exposed and his career and marriage were ruined, he blamed Tony. After a late night confrontation in Tony's office, Fraker suddenly shot him; Fraker moved to fire again, but Det. Rita Ortiz shot Fraker and prevented him from killing Tony. Fraker was acquitted of attempted murder thanks to an underhanded defense by lawyer James Sinclair. Tony was subsequently passed over for promotion to captain and decided to retire from the police and take a lucrative job as head of site security for a real estate development company.

These standards include the parameters of radial force variation, lateral force variation, conicity, ply steer, radial run-out, lateral run-out, and sidewall bulge. Tire makers worldwide employ tire uniformity measurement as a way to identify poorly performing tires so they are not sold to the marketplace. Both tire and vehicle manufacturers seek to improve tire uniformity in order to improve vehicle ride comfort. Force variation background The circumference of the tire can be modeled as a series of very small spring elements whose spring constants vary according to manufacturing conditions. These spring elements are compressed as they enter the road contact area, and recover as they exit the footprint. Variation in the spring constants in both radial and lateral directions cause variations in the compressive and restorative forces as the tire rotates. Given a perfect tire, running on a perfectly smooth roadway, the force exerted between the car and the tire will be constant. However, a normally manufactured tire running on a perfectly smooth roadway will exert a varying force into the vehicle that will repeat every rotation of the tire. This variation is the source of various ride disturbances. Both tire and car makers seek to reduce such disturbances in order to improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle. Tire uniformity parameters=Axes of measurement Force Variation Axes Tire forces are divided into three axes: radial, lateral, and tangential (or fore-aft). The radial axis runs from the tire center toward the tread, and is the vertical axis running from the roadway through the tire center toward the vehicle. This axis supports the vehicle's weight. The lateral axis runs sideways across the tread. This axis is parallel to the tire mounting axle on the vehicle. The tangential axis is the one in the direction of the tire travel. Radial Force Variation In so far as the radial force is the one acting upward to support the vehicle, radial force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the force will change. Consider a tire supporting a 1,000 pound load running on a perfectly smooth roadway. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 995 pounds and 1003 pounds would be characterized as an 8-pound radial force variation (RFV). RFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described below. Some tire manufactures mark the sidewall with a red dot to indicate the location of maximal radial force and runout, the high spot. A yellow dot indicates the point of least weight. Use of the dots is specified in Technology Maintenance Council's performance standard RP243. To compensate for this variation, tires are supposed to be installed with the red dot near the valve stem, assuming the valve stem is at the low point, or with the yellow dot near the valve stem, assuming the valve stem is at the heavy point. Harmonic analysis Harmonic Waveform Analysis RFV, as well as all other force variation measurements, can be shown as a complex waveform. This waveform can be expressed according to its harmonics by applying Fourier Transform (FT). FT permits one to parameterize various aspects of the tire dynamic behavior. The first harmonic, expressed as RF1H (radial force first harmonic) describes the force variation magnitude that exerts a pulse into the vehicle one time for each rotation. RF2H expresses the magnitude of the radial force that exerts a pulse twice per revolution, and so on. Often, these harmonics have known causes, and can be used to diagnose production problems. For example, a tire mold installed with 8 segments may thermally deform as to induce an eighth harmonic, so the presence of a high RF8H would point to a mold sector parting problem. RF1H is the primary source of ride disturbances, followed by RF2H. High harmonics are less problematic because the rotating speed of the tire at highway speeds times the harmonic value makes disturbances at such high frequencies that they are damped or overcome by other vehicle dynamic conditions. Lateral Force Variation Insofar as the lateral force is the one acting side-to-side along the tire axle, lateral force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the lateral force will change. As the tire rotates it may exert a lateral force on the order of 25 pounds, causing steering pull in one direction. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 22 pounds and 26 pounds would be characterized as a 4-pound lateral force variation, or LFV. LFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described above. Lateral force is signed, such that when mounted on the vehicle, the lateral force may be positive, making the vehicle pull to the left, or negative, pulling to the right. Tangential force variation Insofar as the tangential force is the one acting in the direction of travel, tangential force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the tangential force will change. As the tire rotates it exerts a high traction force to accelerate the vehicle and maintain its speed under constant velocity. Under steady-state conditions it would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. This variation would be characterized as TFV. In a constant velocity test condition, TFV would be manifested as a small speed fluctuation occurring every rotation due to the change in rolling radius of the tire. Conicity Conicity is a parameter based on lateral force behavior. It is the characteristic that describes the tire's tendency to roll like a cone. This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle. In order to determine Conicity, lateral force must be measured in both clockwise (LFCW) and counterclockwise direction (LFCCW). Conicity is calculated as one- half the difference of the values, keeping in mind that CW and CCW values have opposite signs. Conicity is an important parameter in production testing. In many high-performance cars, tires with equal conicity are mounted on left and right sides of the car in order that their conicity effects will cancel each other and generate a smoother ride performance, with little steering effect. This necessitates the tire maker measuring conicity and sorting tires into groups of like-values. Ply steer Ply steer describes the lateral force a tire generates due to asymmetries in its carcass as is rolls forward with zero slip angle and may be called pseudo side slip. It is the characteristic that is usually described as the tire's tendency to ‚Äúcrab walk‚Äù, or move sideways while maintaining a straight-line orientation. This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle. In order to determine ply steer, the lateral force generated is measured as the tire rolls both forward and back, and ply steer is then calculated as one-half the sum of the values, keeping in mind that values have opposite signs. Radial run-out Radial run-out (RRO) describes the deviation of the tire's roundness from a perfect circle. RRO can be expressed as the peak-to-peak value as well as harmonic values. RRO imparts an excitation into the vehicle in a manner similar to radial force variation. RRO is most often measured near the tire's centerline, although some tire makers have adopted measurement of RRO at three positions: left shoulder, center, and right shoulder. Some tire manufactures mark the sidewall with a red dot to indicate the location of maximal radial force and runout. Lateral run-out Lateral run-out (LRO) describes the deviation of the tire's sidewall from a perfect plane. LRO can be expressed as the peak-to-peak value as well as harmonic values. LRO imparts an excitation into the vehicle in a manner similar to lateral force variation. LRO is most often measured in the upper sidewall, near the tread shoulder. Sidewall bulge and depression Given that the tire is an assembly of multiple components that are cured in a mold, there are many process variations that cause cured tires to be classified as rejects. Bulges and depressions in the sidewall are such defects. A bulge is a weak spot in the sidewall that expands when the tire is inflated. A depression is a strong spot that does not expand in equal measure as the surrounding area. Both are deemed visual defects. Tires are measured in production to identify those with excessive visual defects. Bulges may also indicate defective construction conditions such as missing cords, which pose a safety hazard. As a result, tire makers impose stringent inspection standards to identify tires with bulges. Sidewall Bulge and Depression is also referred to as bulge and dent, and bumpy sidewall. Tire uniformity measurement machines Tire Uniformity Machines are special-purpose machines that automatically inspect tires for the tire uniformity parameters described above. They consist of several subsystems, including tire handling, chucking, measurement rims, bead lubrication, inflation, load wheel, spindle drive, force measurement, and geometry measurement. The tire is first centered, and the bead areas are lubricated to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. The tire is indexed into the test station and placed on the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers to make contact with the upper bead. The tire is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact the tire and apply the set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates the tire to the test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by the tire. The force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract the measurement parameters. Tires are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude. Other types of uniformity machines There are numerous variations and innovations among several tire uniformity machine makers. The standard test speed for tire uniformity machines is 60 rpm of a standard load wheel that approximates 5 miles per hour. High speed uniformity machines are used in research and development environments that reach 250 km/h and higher. High speed uniformity machines have also been introduced for production testing. Machines that combine force variation measurement with dynamic balance measurement are also in use. Tire uniformity correction Radial and Lateral Force Variation can be reduced at the Tire Uniformity Machine via grinding operations. In the Center Grind operation, a grinder is applied to the tread center to remove rubber at the high point of RFV. On the top and bottom tread shoulder grinders are applied to reduce the size of the road contact area, or footprint, and the resulting force variation. Top and bottom grinders can be controlled independently to reduce conicity values. Grinders are also employed to correct excessive radial run-out. Effects of tire variations can also be reduced by mounting the tire in such a way that unbalanced rims and valve stems helps compensate for imperfect tires. Geometry measurement systems Radial run-out, Lateral run-out, Conicity, and Bulge measurements are also performed on the tire uniformity machine. There are several generations of measurement technologies in use. These include Contact Stylus, Capacitive Sensors, Fixed-Point Laser Sensors, and Sheet-of-Light Laser Sensors. Contact stylus Contact Stylus technology utilizes a touch-probe to ride along the tire surface as it rotates. Analog instrumentation senses the movement of the probe, and records the run-out waveform. When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning sidewall bulges and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall. Capacitive sensors Capacitive Sensors generate a dielectric field between the tire and sensor. As the distance between the tire and the sensor varies, the voltage and/or current properties of the dielectric field change. Analog circuitry is employed to measure the field changes and record the run-out waveform. Capacitive sensors have a larger area-of-interest, on the order of 10mm compared to the very narrow contact stylus method. The capacitive sensor method is one of the earliest technologies, and has proven highly reliable; however, the sensor must be positioned very close to the tire surface during measurement, so collisions between tire and sensor have led to long-term maintenance problems. In addition, some sensors are very sensitive to moisture/humidity and ended with erroneous readings. The 10mm area-of-interest also means that bulge measurement is limited to a small portion of the tire. Capacitive sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial runout measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall. Fixed-point laser sensors Fixed-Point Laser Sensors were developed as an alternative to the above methods. Lasers combine the narrow-track area-of-interest with a large stand off distance from the tire. In order to cover a larger area-of-interest, mechanical positioning systems have been employed to take readings at multiple positions in the sidewall. Fixed-Point Laser sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial run-out measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall. Sheet-of-light laser systems Sheet-of- Light Laser Sensor Sheet-of-Light Laser (SL) Systems were introduced in 2003, and have emerged as the most capable and reliable run-out, bulge and depression measurement methods. SL sensors project a laser line instead of a laser point, and thereby create a very large area-of-interest. Sidewall sensors can easily span an area from the bead area to the tread shoulder, and inspect the complete sidewall for bulge and depression defects. Large radial sensors can span 300mm or more to cover the entire tread width. This enables characterization of RRO in multiple tracks. SL sensors also feature stand off distances large enough to assure no collisions with the tire. Two-dimensional tread void filtering and sidewall letter filtering are also employed to eliminate these characteristics from the runout measurements.

The company was founded in 2001, headquartered in Moscow with regional offices in the regions. The full official name is Joint-Stock Company Siberian Coal Energy Company (SUEK JSC). The head of the company is CEO (General Director) Stepan Solzhenitsyn, son of novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. History Founded in 2001. SUEK was based on the idea of Russian entrepreneurs Andrey Melnichenko and Sergey Popov to consolidate disparate coal enterprises throughout Russia and create a large industrial holding. The formation began on the basis of coal mining enterprises in the Chita region, Buryatia and the Irkutsk region. In 2002, SUEK included enterprises in Khakassia and the Krasnoyarsk Territory, in 2003 in the Khabarovsk and Primorsky Territories and in the Kemerovo Region. The company is becoming number one in Russia in terms of coal production. The first years of SUEK focused on the withdrawal of enterprises from the crisis, the repayment of billions of dollars of debt, the technical re-equipment of enterprises, the optimization of the distribution system. In 2004, coal and a number of Siberian energy companies were merged on the basis of SUEK. In 2006, SUEK became the largest coal exporter in Russia; The company is actively reforming its management system: an independent Board of Directors has been created, a Management Board has been formed, and a corporate code has been adopted. In 2007, the company created the SUEK-REGIONS Fund to implement social and charity projects. In 2007, the merger of SUEK and energy enterprises of Gazprom was announced. It was assumed that during the first half of 2007, these companies will create a joint venture in which they will bring electricity and coal assets. It was expected that Gazprom would receive 50% plus one share in the new enterprise, and SUEK - 50% minus one share. It was most likely that the Siberian Coal Energy Company would give away all major energy and coal assets (with the exception of the networks) as a contribution to the joint venture, while the gas concern would give a stake in regional energy companies These plans alarmed a number of senior officials. The head of RAO \\"UES of Russia\\" Anatoly Chubais called them \\"a big mistake of the state\\", and the head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, Igor Artemyev, said that his department would not approve this deal. On June 9, 2008, a refusal to consolidate assets was announced. In 2008, the Vanino Bulk Terminal in the Khabarovsk Territory, one of the largest coal ports in Russia, began operation. The terminal was built by SUEK from scratch. In 2008, the first in Russia methane-fired power plant in Russia was launched at the SUEK \\"Named S. M. Kirov\\" mine. In 2011, SUEK began development of a new Apsatskoye field in the Trans-Baikal Territory. In March 2011, it was announced that an agreement was reached between the main shareholders, according to which Popov should sell most of his package of Melnichenko; the transaction was estimated at up to $ 2 billion, in September 2011 this transaction was completed. The transaction was completed in the summer of 2011. In 2011, energy assets were removed from SUEK to the Siberian Generating Company (SGK). In 2012, SUEK became a major shareholder of Murmansk Commercial Sea Port JSC.  Owners and management  The majority owner of the company is Russian entrepreneur Andrey Melnichenko, who owns 92.2% of SUEK. Chairman of the Board of Directors - Aleksandr Landia. CEO (General Director) - Stepan Solzhenitsyn, son of novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The CEO (General Director) from 2004 to 2020 was Vladimir Rashevsky. Operations SUEK unites 15 mines and 12 open pits in Siberia and in the Far East, which produce about 28% of coal in Russia. In particular, the company owns Nazarovsky section, Berezovsky section coal mines in Krasnoyarsk Territory, coal-mining enterprises in [ [Kuzbass e, Khakassia, Buryatia, Primorye, Transbaikalia, Khabarovsk Territory. SUEK also includes repair, service, transport enterprises, sales and research companies, Vaninsky bulk terminal. SUEK owns a stake Murmansk Commercial Sea Port. SUEK supplies approximately 27% of Russian coal exports. SUEK's share in world coal exports is 5%. SUEK is the sixth largest company in the world in terms of proven coal reserves - 5.5 billion tons. The annual investment in development is more than 20 billion rubles. The company is one of the largest philanthropists and social investors in Russia.

He is a former professional wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played eight years in the league, five for the Jacksonville Jaguars and two for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and spent one year with the Oakland Raiders. He was used as a secondary wide receiver and punt returner. In 1997, he led the NFL in punt return yards with 555 yards on 43 returns. College career A record-breaking receiver and kick returner, Barlow was recruited to Alabama State University by coach Houston Markham. During his senior year at Alabama State, Barlow caught 58 passes for 1,267 yards. The Montgomery, Alabama native and Sidney Lanier High School standout finished his collegiate career with 133 catches and 2,536 yards. Professional career Barlow was selected in the fourth round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 1998, Barlow led the NFL in punt return yardage, with 43 returns for 555 yards and a touchdown and was named a Pro Bowl alternate. He still ranks among the Jaguars' career leaders for most punt returns (79), most punt return yards (967), and average per return (12.2), as well as among the all-time single-season leaders in punt return yardage (555 in 1998, tied for 37th best all-time as of 2014).https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/B/BarlRe00.htm After five years in Jacksonville, Barlow joined the Oakland Raiders. In 2002, Barlow began his two-year tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he won a championship ring in Super Bowl XXXVII. Barlow ended his NFL career with 39 receptions for 522 yards and 1 touchdown. His largest statistical contributions were made on kickoff and punt returns. Barlow returned 80 career kickoffs for 1,855 yards and 1 touchdown, and 158 punts for 1,639 yards and 2 touchdowns. Coaching career Barlow joined the Alabama State Hornets football staff as quarterbacks coach in 2005. In his first season, Barlow served as mentor and tutor to future NFL second-round draftee Tarvaris Jackson. In 2006, Barlow worked with a trio of quarterbacks without a single snap of college football experience between them. Under Barlow's tutelage, Alex Engram earned a Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) Newcomer of the Week award and finished eighth in the conference in total offense. After that season, Barlow was named interim head coach. A few weeks later, the interim title was removed. Barlow took over as head coach in 2007 and has compiled an overall record of 48‚Äì42. In 2010, the Hornets went 7‚Äì5, claimed their fourth outright SWAC Eastern Divisional title and made their third trip to the league's championship game in eight seasons. In 2011, the Hornets improved to 8‚Äì3 winning the Turkey Day Classic over Tuskegee. Barlow has coached a few current and former NFL players, including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Tarvaris Jackson, who was a member of the Super Bowl XLVIII Championship team, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell, and Washington Redskins offensive tackle Terren Jones, as well as former Oakland Raiders receiver Greg Jenkins and former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Nigel Carr (American football). In 2014, after the completion of the school's football season, the Alabama State University Board of Trustees voted not to renew Barlow's contract. The move was seen as controversial because Barlow had signed a contract-extension and salary increase months prior and had already begun getting paid at the higher rate. Litigation is pending in the contract dispute. The Hornets football team finished 7‚Äì5 on the season.

It was the first major battle of the Pacific War,: \\"The first major battle of the Pacific War was under way more than two hours before Japan's carrier planes descended on Hawaii.\\" and was fought between ground forces of the British Indian Army and the Empire of Japan. Kota Bharu, capital of Kelantan State on Malaysia's northeast coast, was, in 1941, the Royal Air Force's (RAF) and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF) base of operations in Northern Malaya. There was an airstrip at Kota Bharu and two more at Gong Kedak and Machang. Japanese losses were significant because of sporadic Australian air attacks, Indian coastal defences, and artillery fire. Preparations The Japanese invasion plan involved landing troops from the 5th Division at Pattani and Songkhla on Thailand's east coast, and troops from the 18th Division at Kota Bharu on Malaya's northeast coast. The forces landing in Thailand were to push across to the west coast and invade Malaya through the northwestern state of Kedah, while the eastern landing force would attack down the east coast from Kota Bharu and into the interior of Malaya. The British plan for defending against an attack from Thailand into northwestern Malaya was a pre-emptive strike into southern Thailand, known as Operation Krohcol, to take strategically vital positions and delay the enemy attack. The British plan for the defence of the east coast of Malaya consisted of fixed beach defences by the Indian 9th Infantry Division along the northern stretch of coastline and two-thirds of the Australian 8th Division defending the southern stretch of coastline (the other third was deployed to Ambon, West Timor, and Rabaul) The Japanese attack force was drawn from Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita's 25th Army. It sailed from Samah Harbour on Hainan Island on 4 December 1941. Additional ships carrying more troops joined the convoy from Saigon in southern Vietnam, French Indochina. An RAAF reconnaissance Lockheed Hudson discovered the Japanese convoy. Admiral Sir Thomas Phillips, the British naval commander, Far East ordered the battlecruiser to cancel its trip to Darwin, Australia, and return to Singapore as quickly as possible. The invasion force was spotted again on 7 December by a Catalina flying boat of No. 205 Squadron RAF, but the Catalina was shot down by five Nakajima Ki-27 fighters before it could radio its report to air headquarters in Singapore. Flying Officer Patrick Bedell, commanding the Catalina, and his seven crew members became the first Allied casualties in the war with Japan. Prior to the invasion the Japanese had recruited a small number of disaffected Malays into a fifth column organization called the \\"Tortoise Society\\". The Malayan police were aware of the society's existence and had arrested a number of its leaders just prior to the Japanese landings. At Kota Bharu members of the society provided assistance to the invasion army and acted as guides.Jap fifth column in Malaya was small, Allington Kennard, The Straits Times, 24 August 1947, Page 6 Landings at Kota Bharu A decoy Lockheed Hudson at Kota Bharu Airfield, c. 1941. Air Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, commanding officer of the British Forces in the Far East, fearing that the Japanese Fleet was trying to provoke a British attack and thus provide an excuse to go to war, hesitated to launch Operation Matador on 7 December. Matador was the British plan to destroy the invasion force before or during the landing. He decided to delay the operation, at least for the night. Shortly after midnight on 7/8 December, Indian soldiers patrolling the beaches at Kota Bharu spotted three large shadows: the transport ships Awazisan Maru, Ayatosan Maru, and Sakura Maru, dropping anchor approximately off the coast. The ships were carrying approximately 5,200 troops of the Takumi Detachment (Major-General Hiroshi Takumi, aboard Awazisan Maru). Most of these troops were veterans of the war in China. The Japanese invasion force consisted of units from the 18th Division, the assault troops came from the 56th Infantry Regiment (Colonel Yoshio Nasu, aboard Sakura Maru), supported by one mountain artillery battery of the 18th Mountain Artillery Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel Katsutoshi Takasu), the 12th Engineer Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel Ichie Fujii), the 18th Division Signal Unit, one company of the 12th Transport Regiment, one company of the 18th Division Medical Unit and No. 2 Field Hospital of the 18th Division Medical Unit. They were escorted by a fleet (Kota Bharu Invasion Force) under the command of Rear-Admiral Shintaro Hashimoto, consisting of the light cruiser , destroyers , , , and , minesweepers No. 2 and No. 3, and submarine chaser No. 9. The invasion began with a bombardment at around 00:30 local time on 8 December. (The Japanese carrier planes flying toward Pearl Harbor were about 50 minutes away; the attack on Pearl started at 01:18 local time, although it is usually referred to as the 7 December attack as it occurred in the morning of 7 December US time). The loading of landing craft began almost as soon as the transports dropped anchor. Rough seas and strong winds hampered the operation and a number of smaller craft capsized. Several Japanese soldiers drowned. Despite these difficulties, by 00:45 the first wave of landing craft was heading for the beach in four lines. Mitsubishi A6M Zeros of 22nd Air Flotilla at RAF Kota Bharu after its capture from Allied forces, c. 1942. The defending force was the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier B. W. Key) of Indian 9th Infantry Division (Major General A. E. Barstow), supported by four 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers of the 21st Mountain Battery (IA) (Major J. B. Soper). The 3/17th Bn, Dogra Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel G.A. Preston, had responsibility for the stretch of coast which was the chosen landing site. The British fortified the narrow beaches and islands with land mines, barbed wire, and pillboxes. They were supported by the 73rd Field Battery of the 5th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, deployed adjacent to the nearby airfield. The area defended by the 3/17th Dogras consisted of the narrow beaches of Badang and Sabak at Kota Bharu. The beaches were split by two estuaries that led to the mouth of the Pengkalan Chepa River through a maze of creeks, lagoons and swampy islands, behind which was the Kota Bharu airfield and the main road inland. The Dogras immediately opened intense fire on the invasion force with artillery and machine guns. By midnight, the first waves of Japanese troops were heading toward the beach front in landing craft. Colonel Masanobu Tsuji wrote in his book about the Malaya Campaign: The first and second waves of Japanese soldiers were pinned down by the intense fire from the Dogra's pillboxes and trenches but after vicious hand-to-hand fighting a breach was made in the defences on the south bank of the estuary. On the northern bank the Japanese were pinned down on an island where dawn found them trapped in the open. Allied aircraft from the nearby airfields began attacking the invasion fleet and the soldiers trapped on the island. Japanese casualties in the first and second waves were heavy. The Japanese managed to get off the beach only after the two pill box positions and supporting trenches were destroyed. Despite their heavy resistance, the Dogras were forced to retreat to their defences in front of the airfield. Brigadier Key brought forward his reserves; the 2/12th Frontier Force Regiment and the 1/13th Frontier Force Rifles to support the Dogras. At 10:30, Key ordered an attempt to retake the lost beaches with the 2/12th Frontier Force Regiment attacking from the south and the 1/13th Frontier Force Rifles attacking from the north. The fighting on the beaches was heavy with both sides suffering more casualties. The British forces made some progress but were unable to close the breach. In the afternoon, a second attack went in but failed again to close the breach. The airfield at Kota Bharu had been evacuated and by dusk on 8 December, with very low visibility, and Japanese troops were now able to infiltrate between the British units and with possible threats of landings further south, Brigadier Key asked for permission from Major-General Barstow (9th Division commander) and Lieutenant General Heath (III Corps commander) to withdraw if it became necessary. Air attacks RAAF Station Richmond. The Hudson in the right foreground was flown by Flt Lt John Lockwood, who led the first Allied attack against the Japanese. He and his wingmen heavily damaged the Japanese freighter, Awazisan Maru, causing its abandonment. No. 1 Squadron RAAF based at RAF Kota Bharu launched 10 Lockheed Hudson bombers to attack the Japanese transports, each loaded with four bombs. In the 17 sorties flown, they lost two Hudsons shot down and three badly damaged. One Hudson, flown by Flight Lieutenant John Graham Leighton Jones, crashed into a fully laden landing craft after being hit while strafing the beachhead, killing some 60 Japanese soldiers on board. Only five Hudson bombers remained airworthy at the end of the battle. All three Japanese troopships were significantly damaged, but while the Ayatosan Maru and Sakura Maru were still able to sail, the Awazisan Maru was left burning and abandoned. The attacks by No. 1 Squadron RAAF killed or wounded at least 110 of its crew. The wreck later sunk on its own or was torpedoed by the Dutch submarine on 12 December. Despite the strong defence, Takumi had three full infantry battalions ashore by mid morning of 8 December. Counter attacks launched by Brigadier Key failed and the Japanese took Kota Bharu town on the 9th. After fierce fighting during the night, threatening the airfield, Lt Col Arthur Cumming's 2/12th Frontier Force Regiment attempted to hold the airfield and put up a brilliant rearguard action. Cumming would later receive the Victoria Cross during the fighting at Kuantan. Key asked for and was given permission to withdraw from Kota Bharu. The Japanese claim that the landings at Kota Bharu were some of the most violent of the whole Malayan Campaign. It is estimated that they suffered an estimated 300 killed and 500 wounded.

Until the 1938 administrative border shift the station happened to be within the boundaries of Wilhelmsruh. It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and a local bus. The reconnection of the station with the Berlin‚ÄìGro√ü Sch√∂nebeck Railway is planned. History The station was opened on July 10, 1877 under the name Rosenthal Station and served to develop the town Rosenthal. Initially it was a demand stop point for the suburban traffic between Gesundbrunnen and Oranienburg. This was then called \\"bus traffic\\". As a result of the increase in suburban traffic, the single-track northern runway in the soft image of Berlin has increasingly become a bottleneck. Between 1887 and 1888 \\"the KED [Royal Railway Directorate] Berlin set up new, only operational purposes [!] Serving intersection stations: at [!] Reinickendorf (Rosenthaler road) ...\\" To change the timetable on June 1, 1891, the northern run between Gesundbrunnen and Oranienburg has been double-tracked. At this time, the station is called Reinickendorf (Rosenthaler road). However, from the time before the year 1883, other names handed down: Reinickendorf-Rosenthalerstra√üe and road to Rosenthal. In the Official Journal of the Royal Railway Directorate Berlin from 1883, the following stations are called: \\"... Pankow 4.70 km, Sch√∂nholz 5.90 km, Reinickendorf 7.40 km, Dalldorf 10.25 km ...\\" (Distances from Szczecin Railway Station) - presumably there is only a confusion here. The \\"Timetable of the Berlin Northern Railway\\" of 10 July 1877 indicates the order of the stations with Prinzen-Allee, Reinickendorf, Rosenthal and Dalldorf. Since October 1, 1891, the breakpoint has become a regular stop, after it was previously conducted only as a demand stop. After an order of the Royal Railway Directorate Berlin of 18 March 1893, the station was renamed Reinickendorf-Rosenthal. On April 30, 1899, the so-called road to Rosenthal at the station was named Kopenhagener Strasse. The continued increase in passenger numbers of suburban trains, 1907 there were 7.05 million travelers, made the four-track extension of the northern railway, separated for long- distance and suburban traffic, also north of the station Sch√∂nholz- Reinickendorf required. The track was laid on a dam to allow a level-crossing of the road traffic. The work between Reinickendorf-Rosenthal and Wittenau began in 1908. \\"The completely new suburban stations in Reinickendorf- Rosenthal, ... were put into operation on December 20, 1910 .... Their platforms had now the usual height of 76 cm above the rails on the suburban railways ... Special reception buildings were not built on these stations, but again arranged under well-established pattern under and between the tracks reception halls, which received all necessary facilities for the handling of suburban travelers \\" .[1] This gave the station its classic Berlin S-Bahn face, which it retains until the 21st century. An access building was only erected on the southern platform, towards Copenhagen Street. The two entrances point parallel to the road towards Wilhelmsruh and towards Reinickendorf. From 1924 to 1960, the station had a connection to the Berlin tram, which joined Reinickendorf with Wilhelmsruh. On June 5, 1925, the suburban line from Gesundbrunnen to Birkenwerder was electrified and recorded the electric train operation with initially three \\"electric train pairs\\". The term rapid-transit railway was introduced only some years later. In 1929, the number of departing travelers increased from 1,180,000 to 1,682,000 compared to the years 1912/13. On October 3, 1937, the station received its present name: Berlin-Wilhelmsruh. At this time, the district Wilhelmsruh belonged to the district of Berlin Reinickendorf. This changed only in 1938 by a territorial exchange between Pankow and Reinickendorf. The railway station also represented the junction of two abandoned branches of the Prussian Northern Railway and the Heidekraut Railway. Due to its position outside the Wall (in Reinickendorf), from 1961 to 1989 the S-Bahn station was usable only for West Berlin,Berliner rail network map after 1961 at the southern entrance.Historical notes and picture of Wilhelmsruh station The Heidekraut rail terminal was instead moved to Rosenthal station, now abandoned. While in the context of dismantling after the end of the Second World War in the summer of 1945, the second mainline railway track of the Northern Railway was removed, kept the S-Bahn station both tracks of the suburban line. The second S-Bahn track was located north of the station to Borgsdorf. The interrupted at the end of the war suburban traffic on the northern railway was resumed between June 6 and June 11, 1945, first with two train pairs pulled back. From 18 August 1945 could then again electric S-Bahn trains via Berlin-Wilhelmsruh every hour, first to Berlin- Hermsdorf, run. From 19 November 1945, the S-Bahn operation to Wilhelmsruh was again double-railed, but due to lack of crossing possibilities of the northern section of track only in 30-minute intervals. Only from 9 May 1946 was again offered a 20-minute cycle. Long-distance and freight traffic on the northern runway at Wilhelmsruh station became more difficult as a result of the politically increasingly pronounced border. When the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the operation of the Niederbarnimer railway on 1 July 1950, it passed its trains via the (private) Wilhelmsruh station and the siding to the Sch√∂nholz freight depot on the Nordbahn railway to the station in Szczecin, which initially relieved the pressure on the S-Bahn. Railways trains led. For timetable change on May 18, 1952, the passenger traffic was set on the Berlin part of the Northern Railway, since the Szczecin station was closed. The heather path ended again in Wilhelmsruh. From September 1950, the northern freight yard Hermsdorf was no longer allowed to be served (as before) from Oranienburg, but only from Sch√∂nholz. While in this time the (at station Wilhelmsruh passing) long-distance traffic fell away, the use of the S-Bahn increased massively. Since 1953 also run on the northern railway on weekdays so-called run-through trains of the S-Bahn, which did not stop at the stations of the western sectors. For various members of state enterprises the exit and later the passage of the Western sectors was forbidden \\"for security reasons\\". On the northern railway, two trains every morning from Oranienburg travel back in the city and in the evening. The runners reversed until May 3, 1958. Thereafter, they were replaced by locomotive-drawn trains between Oranienburg and the station Lichtenberg or Ostbahnhof (the S-Bahn connection Hohen Neuendorf - Blankenburg on the Berlin outer ring (BAR) was only on 9 November Put into operation in 1961). Since 1948, a train sequence in the 20-minute intervals was offered during the day, the mid-1950s no longer met the requirements. The German Reichsbahn therefore tried to establish a 10-minute cycle by extending the amplifier trains that ended in Sch√∂nholz to Hermsdorf. Due to the single track north of Wilhelmsruh the travel times had to be shortened for this. While on the S-Bahn routes at this time a maximum of 60 km / h were allowed, the maximum speed was increased from Sch√∂nholz to 70 km / h, between Wilhelmsruh and Waidmannslust to 80 km / h. Neither vehicles nor power supply allowed such a power increase, so that the German Reichsbahn had to cancel this \\"experiment\\" on 26 May 1955 - after only four days. There followed announcements to build the track again with two tracks (first to Borgsdorf, then to Frohnau or Hermsdorf) - but nothing was realized. Previously, in April 1955, the long-distance railway line to Oranienburg in front of Birkenwerder was already interrupted. Here the curve from Birkenwerder to the Berlin outer ring was built. The timetable change on 28 May 1961 was a 10-minute cycle to Berlin-Wilhelmsruh introduced. In 1960, the two were - last only from Reinickendorf forth to the sector border at the train station - tram lines set. After the construction of the Berlin Wall, the S-Bahn trains (to Frohnau) continue as a train group 1 in 20-minute intervals. The location of the S-Bahn station directly on the sector border now shows significant effects, the eponymous district is out of reach to the east. For West Berlin, the station is rather uninteresting, because the nearest residential houses just under a kilometer south, and even behind the Kremmener Bahn (S-Bahn station Reinickendorf, today Alt-Reinickendorf) are. At the end of the 1960s, a construction project by the state of Berlin (West) for the development of the M√§rkisches Viertel led to a change of ownership. When building a new bridge over the Schorfheidestra√üe (connection to the street Am Nordgraben) Although the abutments were designed for four tracks, but only two superstructures installed. Bley reports on p. 86: \\"Since the construction of this new bridge at the latest, the freight trains between Sch√∂nholz and Hermsdorf used to run on the S-Bahn track\\" - that means that a bridge superstructure was available for the mainline track but was not tracked. The remaining long-distance railway track in the area of Wilhelmsruh station was no longer used. Another bridge construction around 1975 at Wilhelmsruher dam, so at the S-Bahn station Wittenau (Northern Railway), brought no change for the described station. Train BVG at the exit direction Gesundbrunnen During the strike of the West Berlin Reichsbahner the traffic rested between 17 and 28 September 1980. However, the S-Bahn traffic over Wilhelmsruh was resumed thereafter. Nearly three years later, with the takeover of the \\"western\\" S-Bahn by the BVG on January 9, 1984, the route to Frohnau and thus also the Wilhelmsruh station was shut down. The Berlin Senate had the intention to take the line to Frohnau long-term operation again. The pressure of the population led to a quick restart, so that the track and the station Wilhelmsruh on October 1, 1984 went back into operation. The line north of the station initially remained a single track and was expanded in 1986 double track to allow a 10-minute cycle. The station itself was not affected by this expansion because it was already double-tracked. From 18 August 1986 then the 10 -minute clock was introduced, first to Wittenau (Northern Railway), towards the end of the year to Frohnau. The fall of the Berlin Wall initially had no effect on the station. On April 7, 1990, the Kopenhagener Stra√üe border crossing was opened, but the station access remained possible only from the south. On May 31, 1992, the gap was closed on the West Berlin city boundary between Frohnau and Hohen Neuendorf, for the station Wilhelmsruh it remained at a 10-minute intervals. End of May 1995, an additional train group (in 20-minute intervals) was introduced, which travels from / to Waidmannslust. Along with a shortening of the trains to Oranienburg a situation similar to that of 1955 was created, only that one did not stop the \\"experiment\\", but tried to get a grip on it by changing the timetable. The station was renovated in 2000 and 2001, since 2001, the northern entrance is accessible again. The S-Bahn station has a lift, so it is barrier-free. The further expansion of the station and the route depend on when the planned in the Federal Transport Plan rebuilding the long-distance railway tracks, but there is still a date for this. Heidekrautbahn At the beginning of the 20th century, the railroad station was at the same level as the S-Bahn stop. was opened in 1901 and then steadily expanded. While between 1905 and 1906 the northern railway was laid on a dam, the station of the Heidekrautbahn remained on level ground. The transfer of passengers took place via Kopenhagener Strasse. The actual station had two platform tracks for passenger traffic and several parking and Rangiergleise. The Rangiergleise and a siding were also usable for the goods traffic, which in turn allowed a direct connection to the Nordbahn, after its raising over a 1.57 km long ramp. Further equipment of the station included a goods shed, a loading lane with head and side ramps, two independent engine sheds as well as a coal yard and a water crane. On November 14, 1907, the track connection went to Sch√∂nholz in operation. It had become necessary due to the dam construction of the Northern Railway and replaced the direct siding with a long ramp to the elevated freight yard Sch√∂nholz-Reinickendorf (at the later station Berlin-Sch√∂nholz). After the construction of Bergmann Elektrizit√§tswerke in 1907, the station also received a siding for this factory. On October 3, 1937, the station was renamed Berlin-Wilhelmsruh (Niederbarnimer railway) (or shortened Berlin- Wilhelmsruh (NBE)). On several occasions he was also called Berlin-Wilhelmsruh (Klbf). On March 21, 1939, the small station received its own reception building. By 1950, the station had two platform tracks, two siding to the S-Bahn embankment, six through siding east of the platform and a loading road with head and side ramp. Furthermore, two (or only one) engine shed at the northern end of the station. From July 1, 1950 to May 18, 1952, the trains of the NBE drove to the station of Szczecin and the North Station as terminus. After the closure of the North Station, the trains ended again in Berlin- Wilhelmsruh (NBE). In May 1953, a separate works station on the Lessingstrasse was opened for the power stations in the vicinity of the Heidekraut station. After the closure of West Berlin, the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961, the station was shut down on 9 November 1961 and 1962 relatively quickly razed to the ground, as he was in the border strip. The travel and goods traffic between Wilhelmsruh and Rosenthal was discontinued, the siding to Sch√∂nholz interrupted.Kuhlmann 2000, S. 108. On March 24, 1962 informed the Deutsche Reichsbahn the Niederbarnimer railway A.G. (based in Berlin-Wilhelmsruh, Fontanestr. 31) on the clearing of railway facilities \\"a) of the reception building and b) of the dike\\" and supplemented \\"The implementation of a) has already taken place. The object to b) is still in progress \\".Opravil, 1999, S. 96, Faksimile des Schreibens. On a dated 7 July 1962 photo, the platform is still recognizable, at this time, so only the reception building on Copenhagen Street was demolished. At the same time, the photo documents the borderline: While the railway station on the embankment is already on the Pankow area, the Kopenhagener Stra√üe, which runs at right angles, still belongs to Reinickendorf for a few meters. Until the construction of a rail connection for the VEB Bergmann-Borsig from the north around 1970 transfer trains with freight cars on the station Wilhelmsruh were led to the factory. As a result of the later expansion of the border fortifications in this area, the tracks and remaining facilities of the station were cleared away, but even today remains of the station can be found among wild vegetation, such as low platform surrounds and short track rests. The connecting track to the south to the goods station Sch√∂nholz was located immediately before the border in the French sector and therefore remained (unused). On 12 August 2011, a commemorative stele was inaugurated by the NEB at the Wilhelmsruh S-Bahn station, informing about the history and future of the Heidekrautbahn. The Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn is planning the re- establishment of the route from the M√§rkisches Viertel to the station Berlin- Wilhelmsruh. Contrary to the original course, however, the station is not to be built at ground level, but in dam position at the height of the northern runway and in the form of a side platform, accessible via a ramp from the northern station forecourt and via a staircase from the Mauerweg. The trains of the Heidekrautbahn can then be led back to the station Berlin-Wilhelmsruh, with a transfer to the S-Bahn. The state of Berlin supports this project, the rebuilding is included in the urban development plan traffic. The related planning approval decision was published in early 2011. In particular, the financing of the construction work as well as an order for the associated public transport services by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg are open. After reconstruction of the long-distance railway tracks of the Nordbahn a transition to the railway lines of the Deutsche Bahn is provided via a switch connection south of the platform. This would allow the continuation of the passenger traffic of the Heidekrautbahn to the long-distance station Berlin- Gesundbrunnen.

The Ch√¢teau de Durban The Ch√¢teau de Durban is a ruined castle in the village of Durban-Corbi√®res in the Aude d√©partement of southwestern France. History The castle was built on Roman remains in the 11th century for the lords of Durban, first mentioned in a document of 1018. The Lords of Durban were vassals of the viscounts of Narbonne. In the 12th century the powerful Durban family owned Leucate and Fabrezan as well as lands and rights over Fontjoncouse and Villes√®que. The castle was the property of Bernard de Durban in the 12th century. In 1229, Guillaume de Durban swore allegiance to the king of France and thus kept his lands, despite his ancestors' earlier links, though not adherence, with the Cathars. In the 16th century, influenced by Renaissance architecture, the north and west walls were pierced and decorated with magnificent windows, with marble columns and sculpted lintels, which were restored in 1972. The last direct descendant of the Durbans to own the castle was Joseph de Gl√©on, Baron of Durban, who died aged 82 without heirs in 1787. The last inheritor of the castle sold it in 1873 to Paul Combes, who intended to use the stone as building material and had destroyed large parts of the structure by the end of the 19th century. It was abandoned and then occupied by a Spanish soldier, who lived in the one room remaining. The castle subsequently became public property and continued to be used as a source of stone. The only remains today are the north face of the main building, a round staircase tower and a square tower. In 1967, archaeological excavations were carried out. In 1980, efforts were made to preserve the remains and in 1989 the castle was acquired by the commune. The castle today Today, the castle belongs to the commune and is cared for by the Comit√© de Sauvegarde du Vieux Durban (Committee for the Safeguarding of Old Durban). It has been listed since 1926 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

It is located on the Berlin Northern Railway line in the Reinickendorf locality, though it is named after the adjacent Sch√∂nholz quarter of the neighbouring Niedersch√∂nhausen district. From there, the western Kremmen Railway branch line leads to Hennigsdorf and Kremmen. The station is served by S-Bahn trains and several local bus lines. History The station was opened on July 10, 1877 under the name Reinickendorf. Originally, it only had one outdoor platform. In 1878, the station was renamed Sch√∂nholz (Reinickendorf). In 1884, the station was renamed again to Sch√∂nholz-Reinickendorf. In 1893, the outer platform was replaced by a central platform. At the same time, the Kremmen Railway was opened, making the station an interchange station. In 1896, a reception building was added to the station. Between 1901 and 1903, the station was rebuilt to make way for a new road, and the old reception building was demolished. At the same time as Northern Railway got its own track pair, the Kremmen Railway was also separated, so the station was then served only by suburban trains. From 6 June 1925, the first electric trains operated on this route. As a result, the station became an S-Bahn station. With the electrification of the Kremmen Railway two years later, mixed operation with steam locomotives was ended. In May 1938, the station was renamed Berlin- Sch√∂nholz. In 1945, there was no traffic for several weeks due to the ongoing war. On January 9, 1984, management of the West Berlin S-Bahn was transferred from the German Reichsbahn to the BVG. Both routes using the station were shut down and the station was closed. It was soon reopened on October 1, 1984 to serve the route to Frohnau. In 1995, the Kremmen Railway was also reopened, initially only to Tegel, and since 1998 to Hennigsdorf.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and several local buses. History Berlin Wollankstra√üe station in November 1986 with the Berlin Wall at the right. The station opened as Bahnhof Prinzenallee on 10 July 1877 at the Nordbahn (Berlin‚ÄìStralsund Northern railway) from Berlin to Neubrandenburg. In 1893 it received the name Pankow (Nordbahn), while the former Pankow railway station was called Pankow-Sch√∂nhausen. The Nordbahn line was connected to the S-Bahn system on 5 June 1925 and the station was renamed Wollankstra√üe on 3 October 1937. After World War II traffic restarted first with steam on 11 June 1945. On 19 July 1945 the electric train service resumed. From 1945 the station was situated next to the border between East and West Berlin, on the east side, in Berlin's Pankow district. In 1961 the Berlin Wall was built just to the east of the station. The station remained in service within the West Berlin S-Bahn system, and could only be reached by passengers from the adjacent West Berlin locality of Gesundbrunnen (then part of Wedding borough). The entrances to the east remained bricked up until 1989. Nevertheless, during this period, the station was staffed and controlled by East German railway officials, and while the West Berlin S-Bahn trains were passing between Wollankstra√üe station and Friedrichstra√üe station, they were driven by an East German State railway driver who returned home to East Berlin every day. This was at a time when only the select few were allowed to exit East Germany. Friedrichstra√üe station was situated inside East Berlin, but the West Berlin S-Bahn service operating from that station was not accessible to East Berliners. In popular culture The station features prominently in the 2011 thriller The Debt as a location along the border where an attempt is made to smuggle a Nazi war criminal from East Berlin to West Berlin. The film suggests that it would be possible to access a train stopped at the station from an adjacent property. In reality, the scenes depicted in the film could not have taken place, since the station is built on a viaduct and trains are elevated above street level.

It is also the first release of the famous bootleg record label Trademark of Quality (or TMOQ). Several of the tracks presented here were recorded with The Band in the summer of 1967 in West Saugerties, New York, during the informal sessions that were later released in a more complete form in Dylan's 1975 album The Basement Tapes. Much of the other material consists of a recording made in December 1961 in a Minnesota hotel room (referred to as the \\"Minnesota hotel tape\\"), studio outtakes from several of Dylan's albums, and a live performance on The Johnny Cash Show. It was the first time that these previously unreleased recordings came to the market; many more would be released in similar formats over the coming years, though most were single albums, not double albums like this record. The album was nicknamed the \\"great white wonder\\" due to the original pressing's plain white gatefold cover; newer pressings contain the name stamped on. This name‚Äîor variations, such as \\"white wonder\\", \\"little white wonder\\"‚Äîwould surface in later bootleg releases or in the initials \\"G.W.W.\\" that were printed on record labels or covers. Content Released by the infant Trademark of Quality label, created by two Los Angeles-based men, Ken and Dub, Great White Wonder was compiled from multiple sources. Sides one and three of Great White Wonder were entirely given over to songs from an informal ninety-minute tape that Dylan recorded in the apartment of Bonnie Beecher in Minneapolis in December 1961. Side two was a miscellany of studio outtakes. However, it was the seven \\"basement-tape\\" cuts that filled up the end of side two and all of side four that aroused the greatest interest. Radio broadcasts \\"The west coast radio stations were first to pick up on Great White Wonder. Five radio stations‚ÄîKCSB-FM in Santa Barbara, KNAC in Long Beach, KRLA in Pasadena and KMET-FM and KPPC-FM in Los Angeles‚Äîimmediately began playing the album. KRLA was the first. Unconcerned with legal niceties, these LA radio stations were quite willing to fuel demand for both Great White Wonder and the spate of bootlegs that soon followed its metal-stamped heels.\\" Said Dub, quoted in Clinton Heylin's Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry, \\"Great White Wonder was just this phenomenon. All of a sudden we just started having fistfuls of money. We didn't realize what we had gotten into.\\" The success of this first bootleg may have prompted others to create illicit albums as well, including The Beatles' Kum Back, released later in 1969, and copies of the original album, released by different labels. However, each time the content was copied, there was a reduction in sound quality.Williamson, N. \\"The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan\\", p. 301-03 Cover and label Originally, the cover was a simple white sleeve, until the nickname \\"Great White Wonder\\" began to take effect. Later 1970s pressings included a poorly hand-stamped title, or a picture of Dylan playing at the Isle of Wight Festival. Others gave the false artist name \\"Dupre and his Miracle Sound\\" (cf. genuine group Simon Dupree and the Big Sound), along with false track titles. Hoax follow-up The Great White Wonder sparked a fake bootleg recording that began as a gag by editors at Rolling Stone magazine. The album, The Masked Marauders, was supposedly recorded during a jam session between Dylan, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney. A review of the non-existent album ran in Rolling Stone on October 18, 1969. The write-up sparked enough inquiries from readers that a band was hired to record first some singles, then a full album..

It was designed using the Build engine. Plot The game's narrative takes place using cutscenes at the beginning and end of each level, featuring Shatner himself (in character as Walter Bascom) as the narrator. Cutscenes vary depending on the player's performance during missions: if the player does not shoot any innocent non-player characters (NPCs), kills the TekLord in the mission, and does not raise any tension (i.e. walking with his gun drawn), Bascom delivers praise. On the other hand, shooting innocent characters or aborting the mission causes him to threaten to have you put back into cryo-storage. The premise details an ex-cop who acts as a rogue agent under the direct guidance of Walter Bascom, exterminating drug dealers (\\"TekLords\\") who peddle \\"Tek\\", a highly addictive neurological drug. Bascom sends the player through several missions to kill TekLords. Killing each TekLord gives players a symbol to be taken into the Matrix, a virtual computer world where players must decipher the meanings of the symbols. Killing all seven TekLords has players return to the Matrix one final time to stop a Tek distribution system that is wired into the Matrix. Upon successfully halting the Tek distribution system, Bascom praises the player for their deeds, and promises them a permanent spot in his agency and a guarantee that their original sentencing will be dismissed. Gameplay The two most distinguishable features are the hub-based level system (all the levels are interconnected by a subway station), and the fact that all of the NPCs in the game (enemies, policemen and civilians) are shootable. If the player draws his gun, the policemen will attack. When a policeman or enemy is killed, their ammo can be picked up. Civilians react to having the player's gun pointed at them. Missions are completed when the TekLord of that mission is defeated in combat. Reception Maximum praised the game's combination of action with puzzles and strategy, impressive graphics, vast free-roaming game world, and networked multiplayer. Saying that the only problem with the game is that enemies can start firing on the player character when they're too far away to make out, they concluded that \\"at first glance it may look like another pretty Doom clone, but look closer and you'll see TekWar has enough new angles and ideas to make it stand as a cool game in its own right.\\" They gave it 3 out of 5 stars. A reviewer for Next Generation agreed that Tekwar stands out from other first-person shooters, but felt that the game's nonsensical mechanics outweigh its freshness. He particularly complained that though the police will fire upon the player character if he has his gun drawn in public, they show no reaction if an enemy fires upon the player character, and will actually help gang up on the player character if he tries to defend himself. Concluding that \\"Only fanatical fans of 'TekWar' or Bill Shatner should get this one, and even they probably won't like it\\", he gave it 1 out of 5 stars.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and the M13 and 50 lines of the Berlin Stra√üenbahn. History Bornholmer Stra√üe station and B√∂sebr√ºcke November 9, 1989 memorial plaque The station opened on 1 October 1935 at the junction of the Nordbahn line from Berlin to Stralsund with the railway line to Szczecin (at that time part of Germany and called Stettin) where the eponymous street named after Bornholm Island crossed the tracks. As Bornholmer Stra√üe station lay right at the border of West and East Berlin, a temporary connection was built on 25 December 1952 as a warning. It was closed on 13 August 1961 with the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the section to Pankow on the middle track was cut and locked with a gate, turning it into one of Berlin's ghost stations, passed by the western S-Bahn trains from Frohnau and Helligensee all the way to the Nord-S√ºd Tunnel. The eastern parts remained unused at that time, and train transport were extended from Sch√∂nhauser Allee to Bornholmer Stra√üe, which was opened on 10 December 1961. It was also connected to Hohen Neuendorf from Blankenburg, where it was only a short connection from Hohen Neuendorf to Oranienburg, to provide connections from Oranienburg and Bernau to the East Berlin. After the German reunification, Bornholmer Stra√üe was reopened on 22 December 1990; the platforms for the former East Berlin site were opened on 5 August 1991. Since 1 December 1997 the connecting platforms in Bornholmer Stra√üe were reopened. Though the station was closed the bridge (B√∂sebr√ºcke) spanning over the tracks was the site of the Bornholmer Stra√üe border crossing between Prenzlauer Berg and the West Berlin borough of Wedding established in 1961. In the evening of 9 November 1989 thousands of East Berliners and GDR citizens assembled at the bridge demanding entry to West Berlin. At 9:20 pm local guards were the first to open a checkpoint and allow people passing through freely to West Berlin, where they were greeted enthusiastically. The event marked the commencement of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Station layout The station is spanned by the B√∂sebr√ºcke. The station building is located on the street level as a rider station at street level. The bungalow building has a pentagonal superstructure and a small tower adorned with the suburban train symbol. The station is located near Baumschulenweg. The train station is close to the city center. Today, the platform systems consist of two island platforms with four tracks, which are in directional operation. The western platform is located near the Szczecin railway near the ring road, in the opposite direction. East of the S-Bahn track run the tracks of the mainline. There is no platform for the long-distance train in Bornholmer Stra√üe. The facilities built by Richard Brademann reception (reception building and stair access) are now a listed building.

He was the second of the Chamberlain baronets, as the eldest son and heir of Sir Henry Chamberlain, 1st Baronet, a British diplomat in Brazil, and his first wife Elizabeth Harrod. While a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery, he visited his father in Brazil in 1819‚Äì20. While there, he painted a series of views and costumes of the city and neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The University of Oxford Centre for Brazilian Studies has an album of drawings by him, done during the years 1819 and 1820, with descriptive explanations. His watercolours formed the basis of a famous album of 36 lithographs, each accompanied by a detailed explanation of the particular subject, entitled Views and Costumes of the City and Neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. He tried to illustrate the entire range of Rio de Janeiro society, including slaves working on the streets. Art critics have noted a remarkable accuracy in his depictions of cityscapes, which have allowed a reconstruction of the layout of certain places, but the people that populate them appear rather flat. Chamberlain's art has been described as showing the humour typical of 18th-century English artists like William Hogarth. He reached the rank of captain, and served in New Zealand and Bermuda, where he died in 1843. Chamberlain married on 11 May 1826, Harriet (died 30 April 1866), daughter of R.

The front four of Keating, Dan Birdwell, Ike Lassiter, and Ben Davidson contributed to the team's total of 67 sacks and 666 yards lost against the opposing offense. He played for the Raiders through 1972. He was considered \\"the premier tackle in the old American Football League\\" until he was slowed by a series of leg injuries. Pittsburgh Steelers In July 1973, the Raiders traded Keating to the Pittsburgh Steelers for an undisclosed 1974 draft pick. Keating appeared in 12 games, four as a starter, for the Steelers during the 1973 NFL season. Kansas City Chiefs In September 1974, Keating signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. He became a starter for the Chiefs during the 1974 NFL season, appearing in 14 games, including 12 as the team's starting left tackle. He concluded his football career with the Chiefs in 1975, appearing in nine games, four as a starter. Later years and family After retiring from football, Keating worked as a private investigator for a law firm and later opened his own agency in Walnut Creek, California. He maintained his primary residence in the Bay Area, but began spending several months a year in Limoux in the south of France. Keating had three sons, James Alexander Keating, Patrick Gould and Ryan Gould. Keating's younger brother, Bill Keating, also played football for the University of Michigan and in the American Football League. Keating died from prostate cancer in 2012 at a hospice in Denver, Colorado. Postmortem, Keating was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

The next section was a repeat of an experiment conducted by Kenneth Clark in the 1940s where African-American children were asked to choose between black or white dolls. In the original experiment(s) the majority of the children choose the white dolls. When Davis repeated the experiment 15 out of 21 children also choose the white dolls over the black, giving similar reasons as the original subjects, associating white with being pretty or good and black with ugly or bad.

Early life Edward Betts was born at Buckland, near Dover, son of William Betts (1790‚Äì1867), a successful contractor's agent and railway contractor. He was apprenticed to a builder at Lincoln. However, becoming more interested in engineering, he then worked as agent for Hugh McIntosh building the Black Rock lighthouse at Beaumaris, Anglesey. () Railway contractor Edward Betts's first railway undertaking was to supervise the building of the Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway for Hugh McIntosh under George Stephenson as engineer. After the death of McIntosh in 1840, William Betts & Sons‚Äîthe family firm now named for Edward and his father‚Äîgained contracts on the South Eastern Railway for stretches that included the Marsden-Ashford line, Maidstone Branch, and the Saltwood tunnel. They also obtained large contracts on behalf of David McIntosh for the Midlands County Railway, whereby the Betts family relocated to Leicester, and for the Manchester-Birmingham Railway. After that, Betts continued to gain contracts, especially in the Chester area. Upon his father's retirement at Bevois Mount, Southampton in 1845, Betts assumed full responsibility for the Betts company business. Separately, the partnership between the major civil engineering contractors Samuel Morton Peto and Thomas Grissell was dissolved in 1846, and so Betts worked with Peto on parts of the Great Northern Railway. Peto and Betts In 1848, Peto and Betts established a formal partnership and together they were to work on a large number of railway contracts. Frequently, they also working in partnership with Thomas Brassey as Peto, Brassey and Betts. Possibly the greatest enterprise of this trio was the building of the Grand Trunk Railway in Canada. Betts undertook the actual management of the venture which included the Victoria bridge across the Saint Lawrence River at Montreal. The Grand Crimean Central Railway Peto, Betts and Brassey built at great speed the Grand Crimean Central Railway which enabled supplies, particularly heavy ammunition, to be transported from Balaclava to the British troops engaged in the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War. Betts in particular was responsible for obtaining the enormous amount of supplies and equipment, the fleet of ships to convey them from England to the Black Sea and the navvies and skilled workers needed to carry out the work, also in a very short period of time. Domestic and civil In 1843, Betts married Ann Peto (19 September 1820 ‚Äì 23 January 1908From the family vault at Aylesford), the sister of Samuel Morton Peto. Both are interred in the family vault in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul's Parish Church, Aylesford. Their children were: # Edward Peto Betts (b. 1845) sometimes referred to as Edward Ladd Betts. # Elizabeth Peto Betts (22 October 1846 ‚Äî 1 March 1940) interred in the family vault at Aylesford. # Morton Peto Betts (30 August 1847 ‚Äì 19 April 1914), a leading English sportsman of the time. He was notable for scoring the first goal in an English FA Cup Final. # Alice Peto Betts (b. 1849) # Ernest William Peto Betts (29 October 1850 ‚Äì 12 November 1932Cambridge University Alumni, 1261‚Äì1900) was ordained as a Church of England minister and officiated at the weddings of his siblings Morton and Ann. # Percy Campbell Betts (b. 7 January 1856 ‚Äì 14 October 1878) accidentally shot himself at home while cleaning a revolver.THe Leeds Mercury, 19 October 1878 Interred in the family vault at Aylesford. # Herbert Peto Betts (b. 1857) was ordained as a Church of England minister and officiated at his sister Ann's wedding. # Ann Gertrude Betts (b. 1858) Around 1850 Betts bought a 'palatial residence', Preston Hall near Aylesford in Kent, and had it rebuilt in a Jacobean style, where he employed a staff of 18. Also in the 1850s, he acquired a London home at 29 Tavistock Square where he employed a further 8 servants and by 1860 he had moved to Great George Street, Westminster. In 1858, already a magistrate and a Deputy Lieutenant, he became High Sheriff of Kent. In the general election of 1865, he contested the Maidstone seat as a Conservative but was unsuccessful. Later work Betts and Peto had always been amenable to major speculation; for example, once they had built the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, they leased it as operators for twenty- one years from the opening in 1854, a speculation said in 1863 to be losing ¬£24,000 a year (equivalent to ¬£ in ). In the 1860s, Betts and Peto agreed to build a line between London Bridge and Victoria for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and to be paid entirely in the company's shares and debentures. To raise the funding for the construction they became involved in complicated finance-raising schemes, and with their overseas operations hindered by war, they overstretched themselves. Consequently, Betts and Peto were probably the most prominent casualties of the collapse of the bank Overend, Gurney and Company and the ensuing banking crisis when railway stocks were particularly badly affected and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway became insolventThe Times, 21 December 1866, p. 8; Issue 25687; col E. and therefore the shares they had been paid in became worthless. They were unable to pay their creditors and became insolvent in the following year. Only minor works were to follow for Betts; small alterations to the Metropolitan Railway and an abortive attempt to improve the navigation of the River Danube. Later life After his bankruptcy, Betts was forced to sell Preston Hall (to his friend, Thomas Brassey) and moved to The Holmwood, Bickley Park, near Bromley, Kent \\"... where he could still maintain a carriage.\\" For the sake of his health he was sent by his doctors to Egypt in 1871 but he died the following year in Aswan.

Gunman Richard Durn opened fire at the end of a town council meeting, resulting in the deaths of eight councilors, and the injury of 19 others. Durn committed suicide the following day, by leaping from a police station window during questioning. Shooting At approximately 1:15 a.m. (CEST), at the Nanterre town hall, following a meeting of the municipal council chaired by Mayor Jacqueline Fraysse, Richard Durn rose from his seat, removed firearms previously hidden under his jacket, and opened fire. Durn killed eight councilors and injured 19 others; 14 critically, before being overpowered by Gerard Perreau-Bezouille and other councilors. Once overpowered, Durn began shouting, \\"Kill me!\\" Following events Durn was interrogated at the police station at 36 Quai des Orf√®vres, Paris, on 28 March. After confessing, Durn committed suicide by throwing himself from the fourth floor window. Durn had sent a letter to a friend in which he explained his plan: \\"Because I have by my own will become a kind of living-dead, I have decided to end it all by killing a small local elite which is the symbol of, and who are the leaders and decision makers in, a city that I have always detested.\\" He explained that he intended to kill the mayor, \\"and then as many people as possible [...] I will become a serial killer, a mad killer. Why? Because I am frustrated and I do not want to die alone, because I have had a shitty life. I want to feel powerful and free just once.\\" Perpetrator thumb The perpetrator in the shootings was Richard Durn, 33, who was originally from Slovenia. He held a masters degree in political science and a degree in history and participated in humanitarian actions in the former Yugoslavia , as well as various anti-globalization events.According to the police, Durn was an environmental activist, and a former member of the Socialist Party before joining the Greens. He was also a member of the Ligue des droits de l'homme. He acquired his Glock and Smith & Wesson weapons to practice sport shooting. For this he had obtained the necessary prefectural authorizations. However, at the material time, he was no longer a member of a shooting club and his licenses had expired a long time ago. Aftermath An official tribute was paid to the victims on 2 April, in the presence of President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant. The massacre was discussed by French philosopher Bernard Stiegler in his book, Acting Out. Stiegler argues that Durn's feeling of non- existence was symptomatic of a society which tends to destroy the love of oneself and others, and that Durn's actions represent a \\"hyper-diachronic\\" acting out which is made possible by this feeling of non-existence. The event which takes place in the middle of the campaign of the presidential election of 2002. Beyond the unanimous tributes of the political class, a statement by Jacques Chirac on insecurity appears to his opponents as an attempt at political recovery condemned by the PS. The campaign resumes its course but is again marked by the theme of insecurity by the Paul Voise case. Ten years later, the media draw the parallel with the Toulouse and Montauban shootings.En 2002, la pr√©sidentielle d√©j√† marqu√©e par un fait divers, le JDD, 19/3/2012Tuerie de Nanterre: dix ans d√©j√†, Pais-Match, 26/3/2012. Also, many right-wing polemical voices rose to demand the dissolution of the political party to which Richard Durn belonged, which will have no effect. Three days before the first round of the presidential election, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin proposed 9 measures to tighten up the arms legislation. Following the example of Tony Blair in 1998, one of the measures planned was to confiscate without compensation all handguns with central percussion legally held by sport shooters. Reactions were numerous, notably via the Internet, and contributed to the failure of candidate Jospin in the first round. The sports shooters noted the State's shortcomings and its inability to operate its administrative monitoring system for weapons subject to authorization or declaration. The Prime Minister nevertheless tried to pass his text urgently between the two towers. This will be rejected by the Constitutional Council on a technical point, a \\"consultation\\" meeting had not had time to be organized. With also the attempted attack by Maxime Brunerie against President Jacques Chirac on , the State nevertheless tightened its legislation on the practice of sport shooting with the law for internal security (LSI) of . A medical certificate is now required to apply for possession of a firearm. The psychiatric history is checked with the Departmental Directorate of Health and Social Affairs (DDASS). The prefectural services have been instructed to react when the expiry date of the authorizations has passed. The .22 LR caliber rifles classified in 7th category cease to be sold over the counter.

The name was borrowed from Okada Air, a now defunct Nigerian local airline. Motorcycle taxis or okadas are also commonly used in some other West African countries, including Togo (ol√©yia), Benin (z√©midjans), Burkina Faso, Liberia (phen-phen), Ghana and Sierra Leone. Etymology The airline was named after Okada town near Benin City, the hometown of its owner, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion. Commercial motorcycles were later nicknamed after the airline company because they could manoeuvre through the heavy traffic of Lagos and take passengers to their destinations in a timely manner, in the same way as the airline. The ironic humour of an airline's name being used for commercial motorcyclists, as well as the local familiarity with Okada Air, caused the nickname of okada to outlive the airline from which it originated, which many Nigerians no longer remember. In January 2020, the word \\"okada\\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary January updates, along with 28 other widely used Nigerian words. History The use of motorcycle taxis in Nigeria predates the Babangida administration: they were known in the Cross River State in the 1970s while Achaba or motorcycle taxis were also present in parts of Yola and Gongola State (now Adamawa State) in the late 1970s and spread to Lagos through a group of individuals in the Agege Local Government Area. Okadas began to spread in the 1980s and became more popular in the late 1980s following an economic downturn in Nigeria, which was partly a consequence of the adoption of a liberal economic policy in the form of a structural adjustment program combined with rapid urbanization, unemployment, and inadequate intra-city public transportation. Some of the advantages of the use of motorcycle taxis for intra-city commercial transport are that they are readily available. They can also easily navigate through narrow roads, rough terrain, and remote areas and meander through the hectic urban traffic, thereby meeting the unmet transport needs of some urban residents. Unemployed youths began to use motorcycles to earn money by transporting passengers swiftly to their doorsteps and sometimes on narrow or poorly maintained roads. This type of transportation quickly became popular, and acceptance of it increased steadily. Okadas are now one of the primary modes of transportation in Nigeria, and constitute a cheap and adaptable transportation system, the most popular informal one in the country. Even in remote villages, they arrive at regular intervals. It has become a means of transportation regularly used by people of all ages, men and women alike. Unfortunately, the rise in okada usage has been accompanied by increased occurrences of risky driving and accidents on Nigerian roads. As a result, okadas have come under heavy criticism, resulting in legislation intended to restrict or prohibit their operation in some Nigerian cities, notably Lagos in 2012. Okadas in Nigerian society Okadas in Kano, Nigeria Taxicab and bus service in Nigeria is inadequate, and congestion and poorly maintained roads are widespread. Okadas are used in cities such as Lagos by businessmen, government workers, and students to overcome traffic congestion, and can navigate roads that are inaccessible to automobiles and buses, particularly in villages and urban slums. Contributing to the flourishing of okadas is their low purchase price for operators, and their superior fuel efficiency, which is particularly important during petrol shortages in Nigeria. Okada fares are usually higher than those of public transit. Riding on an okada has been described as \\"a unique experience\\" by both tourists and local users.Cervero, R: \\"Informal Transport in the Developing World\\", 2005 Demographics of okada drivers and passengers Okadas in Lagos, Nigeria A study carried out in 1993 in Yola, a medium-sized city that is also the capital of the northeastern state of Adamawa, Nigeria, provides additional insight into the okada business. The study showed that about 88% of the okada drivers were between 18 and 30 years old, and only 47% had received any type of formal education. The survey also elicited information from 106 passengers. Customers generally were male (65%); were young adults between 18 and 30 years of age (57%); had completed at least secondary school (83%); were unemployed but in the job market (59%); and had low to moderate incomes (45%). They valued okadas mainly because they were fast and readily available. Reasons that customers disliked them were that they considered them to be unsafe (this was stated by 67% of the respondents) and expensive (stated by 43% of the respondents). A survey of okada customers in Akure also revealed customer concerns over safety‚Äî61% felt operators drove too fast and 31% said that they drove too recklessly. Left with few transportation options, however, many continue to patronize okadas despite knowing well the significant risks involved.

A special suburban station was built to the west of the mainline terminal, serving three suburban lines, to Bernau on the Berlin- Stettin railway, to Oranienburg on the North Railway, and to Velten via Berlin-Tegel on the Kremmen Railway. In 1939, these three suburban lines were paired with the three southern suburban lines to form three transversal lines, by means of the North-South S-Bahn link with a tunnel from Stettiner Bahnhof to Anhalter Bahnhof under the Berlin city centre. As part of opening of the first phase, the northern section, the present-day underground station of the S-Bahn opened on 28 May 1936. The new underground station replaced the former suburban railway station, whose railhead building can still be seen west of the Nordbahnhof on Zinnowitzer Stra√üe. The new, underground, S-Bahn station was located East of the main building, with the tracks crossing from the west to the east under the approaches of the mainline tracks. On 25 April 1945 the S-Bahn ceased operation due to the Soviet invasion, which had reached Berlin's suburbia on 21 April. Most likely on 2 May 1945 the SS exploded the tunnel ceiling under Landwehrkanal, which caused the subsequent flooding of the tunnel. After World War II the station itself was within the Soviet sector (East Berlin). After drainage and repair the tunnel and its stations reopened for traffic in November 1947. Platform looking north On 1 December 1950, the name of the formerly German town of Stettin was deleted by a renaming into Berlin Nordbahnhof. Since the rail lines leading to the station crossed the territories of West Berlin, it was closed by the GDR authorities on 18 May 1952 and finally demolished in 1962. The adjacent S-Bahn station remained under the name of Nordbahnhof. During the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany and East Berlin the S-Bahn, operated by the eastern Deutsche Reichsbahn, interrupted traffic between 17 June and 9 July 1953. Between 13 August 1961, the day the Berlin Wall went up, and 1 September 1990 trains did not stop at the station, because it was located in East Berlin. Nevertheless, the Reichsbahn continued to operate the line to connect the stations in the northern and southern areas of West Berlin. Trains only stopped in the stations with entrances in West Berlin, and when they passed through the East Berlin stations passengers viewed from the train windows the empty and barely lit platforms of so-called ghost stations, where time had stood still since 13 August 1961. All entrances were closed until the station reopened on 1 September 1990. Soon after, the station closed again for extensive refurbishment lasting one and a half years. The tunnel and station reopened on 1 March 1992. The Nordbahnhof entrance hall was restored in 2006, including a new layout of the forecourt with indicated tracks and inset plaques bearing the destinations of the former trains to the Baltic coast and an exhibition near the platforms describing the era of the \\"ghost stations\\".

The club is situated in Mitchelton in the Northern Suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland. History=Early Seasons The Brisbane Rhinos were founded by four dedicated players who decided a gridiron team was needed on Brisbane's northside. The Brisbane Rhinos American Football Club was established in 2001, and after a few seasons made the playoffs in 2004 losing to eventual champions the Ipswich Cougars in the playoffs. The following season the Rhinos beat the Cougars in the semi final on a last minute play to make their first Sunbowl. They went on to defeat the Daisy Hill Wildcats 12-7 to be crowned the champions. 2006 saw the Rhinos again make the Sunbowl but were beaten by the Gold Coast Stingrays 27-13. 2008 proved to be a good season for the Rhinos becoming minor premieres and also making another appearance in the Sunbowl, unfortunately again going down to the Gold Coast Stingrays. A number of the Brisbane Rhinos American Football Club players have gained selection on the state and national gridiron teams. Including 8 players in the Queensland state squad for the 2010 Nationals. These players were Brad Boland, Geno Gerbo, Luke Jackson, Kris Hodge, Paul Mason, John Mellifont, Matt Neil and Graham Spurr. The Rhinos also have a team competing in the junior division (14-18 yrs) since 2003 and made the Sunbowl in that division in 2004, losing to the Bayside Ravens after winning a triple overtime semi final. Also in 2008 losing to the Gold Coast Stingrays. Rhinos take on the Kenmore Bears 2005 Season / Queensland Sun Bowl XXI The Brisbane Rhinos won the E-Banc Trade Gridiron Queensland Sun Bowl XXI 12-7 over the Daisy Hill Wildcats on Saturday 12 November 2005, held at Usher Park, Daisy Hill. The game was a classic hard hitting football game with the Fullbacks and Running Backs on both teams earning every yard the hard way. The Rhinos clearly dominated the 1st quarter, with the offense putting a string of plays together culminating in a touchdown. Unfortunately the offense were unable to convert the touchdown. The 2nd quarter while dominated by the Rhinos, the offense was unable to score. The second half started the way the Rhinos knew it would, with the Wildcats giving the ball to their Fullback or Running Back on every play, trying to run it down the throat of the league's best defense. Showing that great defenses will bend but never break, the Wildcats did manage a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter but that was them done for the game. The Rhinos defense seemed to be fired up and hell bent on showing that another touchdown was not going to happen again for the rest of the game. The 3rd quarter was forgettable for the Rhinos offense but they did keep their heads up and came back in the 4th quarter proving that the game isn't over till the final whistle. In the fourth quarter the Rhinos offense started like the 3rd, with not much happening. Then with a little over 2 min remaining in the game the Rhinos offense took over after the Rhinos defense shut down the Wildcats running game. The Rhinos came out fired up and ready to prove that they can never be underestimated. The Offense spluttered at first but then picked up the pace and started to move the ball down the field. With 1.22mins remaining in the game the Rhinos were 4th down and 9 yards to a first down and 20+ yards needed for a touchdown. The Rhinos offense dug deep and were out to prove the coaches confidence in them was justified. The Wildcats seemed to already be celebrating a win, but the Rhinos weren't done yet! With a clean snap to QB Dan Clark, the Rhinos offensive line used their bulk and training to create a good pocket. With wide receivers Callum O'Sullivan & Matt Neil heading towards the end zone it was going to be all or nothing. O'Sullivan ran a perfect post route and crossed the goal line just in front of the goal posts, quarterback Dan Clark saw this unfolding and delivered a perfect hard & fast pass right into the arms of Callum. It was such an accurate pass that the two Wildcat defenders covering O'Sullivan had no chance of batting the pass down. The Rhinos originally kicked the conversion but were flagged for 12 men on the field. The penalty meant the Rhinos had to try the conversion from the 20yd line. Unfortunately kicker Mark Tatnell had the leg but not the accuracy. Score 12-7 with 44 seconds remaining. The Wildcats had to abandon their running game which they had used all game, to try and score as quickly as possible. But the cornerbacks were at their best and ready for anything the Wildcats threw at them. After several pass attempts and a few flags against the Rhinos, the Wildcats still needed to make 60yds for a touchdown. Unable to do so the Rhinos had achieved what the rest of the league had thought was impossible.. winning a Sunbowl and becoming Queensland Sunbowl XXI Champions!

It is situated on the B√≥br river between Szprotawa and ≈ªaga≈Ñ. Located in the historical region of Lower Silesia, Ma≈Çomice had been a centre of smelting bog iron by bloomery hearths since medieval times. History Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Ma≈Çomice Ma≈Çomice originated as a Slavic settlement. After a deer antler tool was found on the Bober river in 1877, excavations in the 1930s showed probable age from between 1000 and 1200 on the basis of pottery finds. The area formed part of the Medieval Kingdom of Poland and from the 13th century, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it was part of the Piast-ruled duchies of G≈Çog√≥w and ≈ªaga≈Ñ. The first written mention of the village under the Old Polish name Ma≈Çymicz dates from 1329. The village existed on agriculture and the production of bog iron. Around 1572, the lords of Schoenaich Mallmitz conferred limited town privileges. A chapel of the Virgin Mary was established in 1496, with the pastors coming from Eisenberg. This chapel, which also served as the crypt of the Kittlitz family, was rebuilt in Baroque style in 1737. In 1741 came the construction of a Protestant church. A year later the village came under Prussian control, and in 1816 became part of the district of Szprotawa/Sprottau. More important than the village was the extensive ancient manorial estate, which had wide-ranging possessions in the duchies of ≈ªaga≈Ñ and G≈Çog√≥w. A significant baron von Schoenaich is Fabian von Schoenaich, one of the largest landowners of Lower Silesia and Lusatia, who ruled between 1400 and 1680, later inherited by the Counts of Redern. In 1740, except for Mallmitz, the manors Primkenau and Kotzenau were in the possession of the Counts of Redern. In 1766 Mallmitz came into the possession of the burgraves of the von Dohna family, who ruled until 1945. Their seat was an old moated castle, which was rebuilt in 1690 as a Renaissance castle.

Corinne (November 3, 1943 ‚Äì August 27, 2006) was a photographer, author, and editor notable for the portrayal of sexuality in her artwork. According to Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia, \\"Corinne is one of the most visible and accessible lesbian artists in the world.\\" Early life and education Corinne was born and grew up in Florida. Her mother introduced her to principles and techniques for making visual art. According to Corinne, \\"I have seldom succeeded in keeping a diary, but I have almost always carried a drawing pad, and since my eighth year, I have also had a camera.\\" Corinne spent her first year of college (1962-3) studying art at Newcomb College in New Orleans, LA, where she studied painting with Ida Kohlmeyer.Biographical Reference File, Tee A. Corinne, Newcomb Archives, Tulane University She then transferred back to Florida, where she earned a B.A. in printmaking and painting (with minors in English and history) from University of South Florida, Corinne went on to get an M.F.A. in drawing and sculpture at Pratt Institute in 1968. After a few years of teaching and backpacking in Europe, she became attracted to the back-to-the-land movement and communal living. She was also, in her words, sliding into suicidal depression. > Something didn't feel right. Nowadays they talk about over-achieving adult > children of alcoholics and the problems they have with depressions . . . > Around the age of thirty I realized that art could no longer solve my > problems . . . I found therapy, separated from my husband, became involved > with women and joined the Women's Movement. I felt better. Career Corinne began exhibiting and publishing art and writing in the mid-1960s. Her first notable work was in 1975, and is still in print today. Aged 27, she realised that although her art education had enabled her to depict male genitals, she had not observed her own since she was a child. \\"I knew that the things we don't have names for, or images of, are the ones we label crazy or bad. I believed that reclaiming labial imagery was a route to claiming personal power for women.\\" She decided to produce artistic images of vulvas, and self-published the Cunt Coloring Book, reclaiming the word \\"cunt\\"; it was later issued by a publisher as Labiaflowers. She was a co-facilitator of the Feminist Photography Ovulars (1979‚Äì1981) (cf seminar) and a co-founder of The Blatant Image, A Magazine of Feminist Photography (1981‚Äì1983). She was the author of one novel, three collections of short stories, four books of poetry and numerous artists books and small edition publications. Family, her show of mixed media drawings about growing up in an alcoholic family, has been the subject of a video interview by Jane Scott Productions. Portfolios of her art have been published in Lesbian Subjects, Feminist Studies, Gallerie: Women's Art, The Advocate, Philadelphia Gay News, The Lesbian Inciter, I Am My Lover (first edition, 1979) and Femalia. In 1980, she was one of the ten invited artists whose work was exhibited in the Great American Lesbian Art Show. In the early 1980s, Tee Corinne developed strong personal and artistic connections to Oregon after she moved to southern Oregon and lived and became active in the many women's communities springing up in the area. As she notes in one of her manuscripts, \\"Slowly, in Oregon, I reconnected with the deep levels of creativity that run in me and began producing work which pleased me.\\" She became adept at representing lesbian sexuality in ways that would elude the male gaze. In 1982, she produced a series of photographs called Yantras of Womanlove. Concerned with protecting the privacy of her models, she used techniques involving multiple prints, solarization, images printed in negative, and multiple exposures. Tee consistently and conscientiously included women of color, large women, older women, and women with disabilities as her subjects. Sometimes printers would refuse to print her works and art galleries would refuse to show it. Corinne wrote about art for a variety of publications and, from 1987, was the art books columnist for Feminist Bookstore News. A co-founder and past co-chair of the Gay & Lesbian Caucus (an affiliated society of the College Art Association), she also co-founded the Women's Caucus for Art Lesbian & Bisexual Caucus. In 1989, Corrine received a Lambda Literary Award in the lesbian anthology category for her editing of Intricate Passions (published by Banned Books). In 1991, she was chosen by Lambda Book Report as one of the fifty most influential lesbians and gay men of the decade, and in 1997 she received the Women's Caucus for Art President's Award for service to women in the arts. Perhaps her best known work is the cover of the 1993 self-titled debut album of the English alternative rock band Suede. In 1998, her photographs appeared on the cover and sleeve of the timmi- kat ReCoRDS' release, \\"Milkshake: A CD to Benefit The Harvey Milk Institute\\". Personal life In 1966, Corinne married the man she described as her 'best friend'. She came out in 1975 at which time she was in a relationship with Honey Lee Cottrell. Over the years, Corrine embarked upon relationships with Caroline Overman (early 1980s), Lee Lynch (mid 1980s) and Beverly Anne Brown (1989‚Äì2005). In 2003, Brown was diagnosed with cancer, which led to Corinne's series \\"Cancer in our Lives\\" (2003-5). Death and legacy Corinne died on the 27th August 2006 in Southern Oregon after a struggle with liver cancer. She was 62 years old. Her manuscript collection was donated to the University of Oregon Libraries, and is now housed in the library's Special Collections unit. The collection includes correspondence, literary manuscripts, artwork, photographs, artifacts, and other documents that reflect Corinne's life and work. Moonforce Media created the Tee A. Corinne Prize for Lesbian Media Artists in 2006 to annually honor Corinne as an artist with bold vision and a fierce dedication to encouraging and preserving lesbian art. The award is an unrestricted grant of up to $1,000 annually. The prize is dedicated to artists working in photography, film, video, digital media, new media, or any fusions of these forms and in any genre including documentary, narrative, experimental, or any other styles or combination of genres. The award furthers Corinne's wish that individual lesbian artists be financially supported to work independently and without censorship. In 2014, Corinne was included prominently in a 45-year retrospective on LGBT photography on the website of news station KQED. In 2015 the Golden Crown Literary Society awarded the first Tee Corinne Outstanding Cover Design award to Ann McMan for her work on the book Everything. In 2016, Lesbian News published a laudatory editorial retrospective on Corinne's life. Bibliography=Books *\\"Bodies: A Collage\\", in woman in power (Issue 18, 70-72) *Courting Pleasure.

The memorial consists of a 55 ft by 58 ft (16.8 m by 17.7 m) curved Portland stone wall: the symbolic arena of war, emblazoned with images of various struggling animals, along with two heavily laden bronze mules progressing up the stairs of the monument, and a bronze horse and bronze dog beyond it looking into the distance. Located on Park Lane, at the junction with Upper Brook Street, on the eastern edge of the park, The Animals in War Memorial was officially opened on 24 November 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal. In May 2013 it was one of two London war memorials vandalised on the same night. The word \\"Islam\\" was spray-painted on it causing ¬£2,766 in damage, and the nearby RAF Bomber Command Memorial suffered ¬£6,500 in damage. A 31-year-old man later admitted to vandalising the memorials and was charged for a total of 94 vandalism and destruction of property offences carried out over several weeks against homes, cars, memorials and a church, causing over ¬£50,000 in damage.

Club career=Early years Born in Lagos, Sunny began his career in Nigeria with Ebedei and Jegede Babes. In 2003, he participated in two youth championships in Sweden and Spain: in the latter he appeared in Madrid's third edition of the Annual Immigrants World Cup, where he impressed so much he was given a five-year-contract with Polideportivo Ejido, in the second division. Valencia Sunny became a regular player for the Andalusia team, making 65 competitive appearances during his two-year spell and signing for Valencia in the summer, but after one season where he was scarcely used, he was loaned to fellow La Liga club Osasuna. In late January 2009, he was linked with a move to England's Portsmouth, but the deal eventually collapsed due to financial complications. On 30 June 2009, after a season which was marred by injury, Sunny was loaned to Betis for one year with a view to a permanent four-year move. He also appeared rarely during the second level campaign, as the Verdiblancos failed to return to the top division (seven matches out of 42). In July 2010, Sunny had a trial in England with newly promoted Premier League side Blackpool, playing in a pre-season friendly against Crewe Alexandra on 27 July and four days later against Bristol City, but nothing came of it. Numancia Sunny spent the first months of the new season training on his own, having been deemed surplus to requirements by Valencia manager Unai Emery. On 19 January 2011 he was again loaned, moving to Numancia from the second level.
