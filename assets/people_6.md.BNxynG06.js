It is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Despite being a low-lying site, Oakmere is still considered a hill fort. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC.Payne, Corney, & Cunliffe (2007), p. 1. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.Sharples (1991), pp. 71-72. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". Location and layout Although there are over 1,300 hill forts in England, they are concentrated in the south of the country, with only seven in Cheshire.Forde- Johnston (1962), pp. 13‚Äì14. There are two groups of hill forts in the county, each with three members (Maiden Castle is on its own in the south); Oakmere hill fort is in the southern group with Eddisbury hill fort and Kelsborrow Castle. Located at , Oakmere, in common with all of the hill forts in Cheshire, sits on part of the central ridge that runs north‚Äìsouth through the county.Forde-Johnston (1962), p. 23 A low-lying site, Oakmere hill fort is on a triangular area of land projecting into a mere, also called Oakmere.Forde- Johnston (1962), pp. 21-22. Today, the waters of the mere are below the defences at the south-western end of the site, with a gap between the edge of the mere and the defences; however when the hill fort was built the water- level would have been higher and closer to the scarp, offering the site natural defences. Ramparts were thrown up around the south-west and north sides of the site, creating an arc, and a ditch was created in front of the rampart. The bank survives to a height of and, at its deepest point, the ditch is now deep although it was originally deep; the distance between the inner edge of the bank and the outer edge of the ditch is .Forde-Johnston (1962), p. 21 The depth of the ditch is not uniform, indicating that either the hill fort was unfinished or perhaps bearing testament to an attempt by the inhabitants of Oakmere hill fort to re-excavate and deepen the ditch. The entrance to the site was in the southern end of the defences and is similar to the entrances of Bradley, Helsby, and Kelsborrow hill forts.Forde-Johnston (1962), p. 22. History In 1960, Oakmere hill fort was excavated by archaeologist James Forde-Johnston; the excavation focused on the site's southern defences and showed that the ditch was wide at its zenith and originally deep in places. The site has been disturbed and there are two modern breaks in the defences. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Oakmere protection against unauthorised change.

Stutzman was a candidate in the 2010 U.S. Senate election, but was defeated in the primary election in May 2010 by former Senator Dan Coats. On June 12, 2010, Stutzman won the Republican nomination for the general election and special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mark Souder, congressman for Indiana's 3rd congressional district. Stutzman defeated 14 other candidates on the second ballot by winning a simple majority (229) of the 400 votes cast by precinct committee members. On May 9, 2015, Stutzman announced that he would run for the United States Senate seat held by Dan Coats. He was defeated in the Republican Primary by Representative Todd Young. Early life, education and career Stutzman is a fourth-generation farmer who grew up on a farm located in both St. Joseph County, Michigan and LaGrange County, Indiana. He graduated from Lake Area Christian High School located in Sturgis, Michigan in 1994.

In 2008 he won the Small Business Champion Award from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. He was cited as a Taxpayer Friendly State Legislators by Indiana WatchDog an independent, volunteer organization. He served as the ranking member of the Indiana State Senate Utilities and Technology Committee and helped to pass alternative energy incentive legislation in Indiana. In 2006 he served as the chairman of the Indiana Public Policy Committee taking strong stands for conservative values on controversial issues. =Government waste= Stutzman advocates for more accountability in state government operations. He co- authored a bill to establish the Hoosier Grace Commission which passed in 2003. The commission helped eliminate wasteful state government spending and has brought fraud and/or scandals to public awareness. =Education= Stutzman authored a bill that required more money to go directly to the classroom. The bill was instrumental in paying back the $600 million that was owed by state government to schools, and increased funding for students six years in a row. =Affordable Care Act= In Congress, Stutzman has opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In September 2013, he advocated attaching a measure defunding the Act to must-pass legislation funding the federal government.'This is the line in the sand,' House Republicans say, by Lisa Mascaro, LA Times, 18 September 2013 After the government subsequently shut down, Stutzman remarked that the issue at stake was no longer merely the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Republicans would need some concession in order to reopen the government. =Taxes= In 2010 Stutzman signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.

There is no specific academic theory or classification system for recession shapes; rather the terminology is used as an informal shorthand to characterize recessions and their recoveries. DEAD? The most commonly used terms are V-shaped, U-shaped, W-shaped, and L-shaped recessions. The shapes take their names from the approximate shape economic data make in graphs during recessions. The letters can also be applied referring to the recoveries (for example, a \\"V-shaped recovery\\").  V-shaped recession  The Recession of 1953 in the United States is a classic V-shape. ; Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis rightthumb300px In a V-shaped recession, the economy suffers a sharp but brief period of economic decline with a clearly defined trough, followed by a strong recovery. V-shapes are the normal shape for recession, as the strength of economic recovery is typically closely related to the severity of the preceding recession. A clear example of a v-shaped recession is the Recession of 1953 in the United States. In the early 1950s the economy in the United States was booming, but because the Federal Reserve expected inflation it raised interest rates, tipping the economy into recession. In 1953 growth began to slow, in the third quarter, the economy shrank by 2.4 percent. In the fourth quarter the economy shrank by 6.2 percent, and in the first quarter of 1954 it shrank by 2 percent before returning to growth. By the fourth quarter of 1954, the economy was growing at an 8 percent pace, well above the trend. Thus GDP growth for this recession forms a classic v-shape. More importantly, the GDP graph itself has a V shape.  U-shaped recession  300px A U-shaped recession is longer than a V-shaped recession, and has a less-clearly defined trough. GDP may shrink for several quarters, and only slowly return to trend growth. Simon Johnson, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, says a U-shaped recession is like a bathtub: \\"You go in. You stay in. The sides are slippery. You know, maybe there's some bumpy stuff in the bottom, but you don't come out of the bathtub for a long time.\\" (U,V,W,L) The 1973‚Äì75 recession in the United States can be considered a U-shaped recession. In early 1973 the economy began to shrink and continued to decline or have very low growth for nearly two years. After bumping along the bottom, the economy climbed back to recovery in 1975.  W-shaped recession  The early 1980s recession in the United States is sometimes given as an example of a W-shaped recession. ; Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis rightthumb300px In a W-shaped recession, (also known as a double-dip recession), the economy falls into recession, recovers with a short period of growth, then falls back into recession before finally recovering, giving a \\"down up down up\\" pattern resembling the letter W. The early 1980s recession in the United States is cited as an example of a W-shaped recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research considers two recessions to have occurred in the early 1980s. The economy fell into recession from January 1980 to July 1980, shrinking at an 8 percent annual rate from April to June 1980. The economy then entered a quick period of growth, and in the first three months of 1981 grew at an 8.4 percent annual rate. As the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker raised interest rates to fight inflation, the economy dipped back into recession (hence, the \\"double dip\\") from July 1981 to November 1982. The economy then entered a period of mostly robust growth for the rest of the decade. The European debt crisis in the early-2010s is a more recent example of a W-shaped recession. A combination of government austerity, falling business investment, rising interest rates, global economic weakness, high energy prices, and weak consumer spending after the Great Recession of 2008-2009 tipped many Eurozone countries into a second recession from 2011 to 2013. Countries affected included Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Ireland, Germany and Cyprus. Greece, while part of the Eurozone, saw continuous economic contraction from 2007 to 2015, and thus does not fit the definition of a W-shaped recession, but rather an L-shaped recession. The United Kingdom is not a member of the Eurozone, but was a member of the European Union until 2020, and suffered a minor W-shaped recession when GDP contracted in Q4 2011 and Q1 2012.  L-shaped recession  An L-shaped recession or depression occurs when an economy has a severe recession and does not return to trend line growth for many years, if ever. The steep drop or degrowth, is followed by a flat line makes the shape of an L. This is the most severe of the different shapes of recession. Alternative terms for long periods of underperformance include \\"depression\\" and lost decade; compare also \\"malaise\\". The Japanese asset price bubble led to a Lost Decade in Japan; this period has been characterized as an L-shaped recovery. ; Source: Penn World Tables leftthumb300px A classic example of an L-shaped recession occurred in Japan following the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1990. From the end of World War II throughout the 1980s, Japan's economy was growing robustly. In the late 1980s a massive asset-price bubble developed in Japan. After the bubble burst the economy suffered from deflation, and experienced years of sluggish growth; never returning to the higher growth Japan experienced from 1950-1990. After the late-2000s recession in the United States followed a similar economic bubble (the United States housing bubble) some economists feared the U.S. economy could enter a prolonged period of low growth even after recovering from the recession. By 2013, however, U.S. GDP growth rebounded, allaying fears of stagnation. The Greek recession of 2007‚Äì2016 could be considered an example of an L-shaped recession, as Greek GDP growth in 2017 was merely 1.6%. Greece technically suffered through four separate, but compounding, periods of contractions over the 9 year period.  K-shaped Recession  thumb A K-shaped Recession is one where recession is quick like a V-shaped recession for the socially advantaged, but slow and L-shaped for the socially disadvantaged.  Other shapes  Since the terms are informal, commentators will sprinkle in other descriptions. Financial blogger Mike Shedlock describes a WW-shaped recession with the country \\"slipping in and out of recession for a prolonged period of time, perhaps 3-4 years or more.\\" Financier George Soros has said the 2009 recession may be an \\"inverted square root sign\\"-shaped recession. Soros explained to Reuters that this meant: \\"You hit bottom and you automatically rebound some, but then you don't come out of it in a V-shape recovery or anything like that. You settle down ‚Äî step down.\\" During the 2001 recession, a trader named Thierry Martin writing for Jim Cramer's TheStreet.com proposed a J-shaped recovery, which he says was \\"strictly for optimists\\" and could be caused by \\"a new high-tech product category, or even a series of improving earnings reports, [that] could send us sky-high without looking back.\\" The J-shaped economic recovery is unrelated to the J-curve phenomenon.

This equation is analogous to the formula for the kinetic energy of a particle with mass m and velocity v, namely :T = \\\\frac{1}{2} m\\\\mathbf{v}^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot m\\\\mathbf{v} and can be derived from it, by expressing the position of each particle of the system in terms of q. In general, the mass matrix M depends on the state q, and therefore varies with time. Lagrangian mechanics yields an ordinary differential equation (actually, a system of coupled differential equations) that describes the evolution of a system in terms of an arbitrary vector of generalized coordinates that completely defines the position of every particle in the system. The kinetic energy formula above is one term of that equation, that represents the total kinetic energy of all the particles. Examples=Two-body unidimensional system = System of masses in one spatial dimension. For example, consider a system consisting of two point-like masses confined to a straight track. The state of that systems can be described by a vector q of two generalized coordinates, namely the positions of the two particles along the track. :q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}^\\\\textsf{T}. Supposing the particles have masses m1, m2, the kinetic energy of the system is :T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\\\frac{1}{2} m_i \\\\dot {x_i}^2 This formula can also be written as :T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\dot q^\\\\textsf{T} M \\\\dot q where :M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & m_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} =N-body system = More generally, consider a system of N particles labelled by an index i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, N, where the position of particle number i is defined by ni free Cartesian coordinates (where ni is 1, 2, or 3). Let q be the column vector comprising all those coordinates. The mass matrix M is the diagonal block matrix where in each block the diagonal elements are the mass of the corresponding particle: :M = \\\\operatorname{diag}\\\\left[ m_1 I_{n_1},\\\\, m_2 I_{n_2},\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, m_N I_{n_N} \\\\right] where In i is the ni √ó ni identity matrix, or more fully: : M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_1 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots &\\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & m_1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & m_2 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots &\\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & m_2 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & m_N & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots & m_N\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = Rotating dumbbell = Rotating dumbbell. For a less trivial example, consider two point-like objects with masses m1, m2, attached to the ends of a rigid massless bar with length 2R, the assembly being free to rotate and slide over a fixed plane. The state of the system can be described by the generalized coordinate vector :q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x & y & \\\\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} where x, y are the Cartesian coordinates of the bar's midpoint and Œ± is the angle of the bar from some arbitrary reference direction. The positions and velocities of the two particles are :\\\\begin{align} x_1 &= (x, y) + R(\\\\cos\\\\alpha, \\\\sin\\\\alpha) & v_1 &= \\\\left(\\\\dot x, \\\\dot y\\\\right) + R\\\\dot \\\\alpha(-\\\\sin\\\\alpha, \\\\cos\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 &= (x, y) - R(\\\\cos\\\\alpha, \\\\sin\\\\alpha) & v_2 &= \\\\left(\\\\dot x, \\\\dot y\\\\right) - R\\\\dot \\\\alpha(-\\\\sin\\\\alpha, \\\\cos\\\\alpha) \\\\end{align} and their total kinetic energy is :2T = m\\\\dot x^2 + m\\\\dot y^2 + mR^2\\\\dot\\\\alpha^2 - 2Rd\\\\sin(\\\\alpha) \\\\dot x \\\\dot\\\\alpha + 2Rd\\\\cos(\\\\alpha) \\\\dot y \\\\dot\\\\alpha where m = m_1 + m_2 and d = m_1 - m_2. This formula can be written in matrix form as :T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\dot q^\\\\textsf{T} M \\\\dot q where :M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 & -Rd\\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & m & Rd\\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ -Rd\\\\sin\\\\alpha & Rd\\\\cos\\\\alpha & R^2 m \\\\end{bmatrix} Note that the matrix depends on the current angle Œ± of the bar. Continuum mechanics For discrete approximations of continuum mechanics as in the finite element method, there may be more than one way to construct the mass matrix, depending on desired computational accuracy and performance. For example, a lumped-mass method, in which the deformation of each element is ignored, creates a diagonal mass matrix and negates the need to integrate mass across the deformed element.

It is attached with one-way security screws to discourage casual removal, which would defeat the interlock scheme. Trapped-key interlocking utilizes locks and keys for sequential control of equipment and machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped-key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety. In 1893, French inventor Paul Bour√© created engagement lock devices to ensures train traffic safety. They were used in the French railway system in the 1890s to control track switching operations and were manufactured by Trayvou, now known Serv Trayvou Interverrouillage (STI) and owned by Halma.. Later, the Englishman James Harry CastellCastell (1880‚Äì1953), Frenchman B. Trayvou and the American R. L. Kirk also developed trapped-key interlocking systems. Therefore, such systems are commonly referred to as Castell, Bourr√©, Trayvou or Kirk keys. Both worked in the power generation and distribution industries in the early part of the 20th century, and both pioneered the use of trapped-key interlock for switchgear control. Trapped-key interlocks can be found in many industrial settings including electrical utilities, railway, petroleum, and chemical plants as a response to occupational safety and health legislation. Interlock devices A typical trapped-key interlock device consists of a lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a cam. The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re- energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt. Some complex sequences use key exchange blocks or boxes, that allow alternative sequences of operation. Interlock devices may have an electrical solenoid which holds the key until an electrical circuit is interrupted; for example, the power supply for a high-voltage cabinet has been de-energized, releasing a key to allow access to the interior of the cabinet. Some interlocks include a time delay function or a rotation detector to ensure a machine has had time to come to a stop before allowing the next step of an interlock sequence to proceed. A key exchange block may only hold and release keys and may not have a bolt to interlock process equipment, or may be part of the interlock of a particular machine or device. This is a transfer block, part of a trapped-key interlock system. It does not have a bolt to stop operation of a device, but holds and releases other keys. Manufacturers of trapped-key interlock devices provide application guides showing typical interlock problems and recommended arrangements. Since the reliability and safety of the scheme critically depends on the possession of keys, duplicate keys must be carefully controlled to prevent any possibility of an unsafe operating sequence. For example, a lost key might be replaced only by a duplicate held off-site, or might require ordering a replacement from the original manufacturer. Example For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric kiln while it is operating, a trapped-key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. Whenever the kiln power switch is turned on, the key is automatically held by the interlock, and cannot be manually removed. In order to open the kiln door, the power switch must first be turned off, which releases the key and allows it to be removed from the interlock. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the power switch from being turned on. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the power switch interlock.Harry Fraser, The electric kiln: a user's manual 2nd edition, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000, page 41 A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.

Alum Creek Lake was constructed from 1970 to 1974 as part of the Flood Control Act of 1962. Alum Creek Dam was constructed on Alum Creek, a tributary of Big Walnut Creek, which drains into the Scioto River. Alum Creek Reservoir holds of water and is open to fishing, boating, ice fishing, ice boating and swimming. The park is just north of the state capital of Columbus and contains the remnants of a settlement by freed slaves that arrived in Ohio from North Carolina. History=Native Americans= The first evidence of man living in the Alum Creek State Park area dates back over 2,000 years ago to the Adena culture. The Adena were a Pre-Columbian Native American culture that existed from 1000 BC to 200 BC, in a time known as the early Woodland Period. The Adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system. Seven mounds were found in the Alum Creek valley and six of the mounds were excavated by archaeologists before the valley was flooded, creating Alum Creek Reservoir. The Lenape tribe inhabited the area at the arrival of Anglo- Americans. The Lenape had originally lived along the Delaware River in what is now New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They were displaced by the arriving colonial settlers and the Iroquois Indians who were the dominant group in the area. The Lenape established a large community on the banks of the Olentangy River at what is now the city of Delaware, and had a corn field in what is now downtown Delaware. =Early settlers= Most of the Native Americans in Ohio were driven out or killed by the arriving Anglo settlers and military. The first permanent white settler in the area was Moses Byxbe. He built his home in 1805 along Alum Creek in Berkshire Township. He owned over of land in the area that he was able to purchase as part of the settlement program given to veterans of the American Revolutionary War. The pioneer settlers were forced to build fortifications during the War of 1812 to protect against attack by warriors under the leadership of Tecumseh and his British allies. One such fortress, Fort Cheshire, was constructed along Alum Creek. It was two stories tall with the second story reaching over the entry to the fort thus enabling the defenders to shoot and drop boiling water on any attackers. Fort Cheshire stood until the American Civil War and was later used as a schoolhouse. A plaque commemorating the fort is located at the family campground of Alum Creek State Park. =Underground Railroad= The Underground Railroad, note the numerous paths passing through Ohio Ohio, sharing a border with the slave state of Kentucky, played an important part in freeing slavery in the United States along the Underground Railroad. A major path of the Underground Railroad ran along Alum Creek. It is thought that over 40,000 slaves passed through the area on the Sycamore Trail. The white bark of the sycamore tree provided a guide for fleeing slaves making their way north to Canada at night. The Hanby House in Westerville was an important safe house in Franklin County. Escaping slaves would wade in Alum Creek as a means of hiding their scent from pursuing dogs and slave catchers. Also, there was a settlement of former slaves from North Carolina along what became known as Africa Road on the southern end of what is now Alum Creek State Park. These former slaves also played a role in the Underground Railroad in Ohio. =Dam and state park= Tainter Gates and Spillway of Alum Creek Dam Alum Creek Dam is part of the flood control plan for the Ohio River basin. Construction of the dam was authorized by the United States Congress as part of the Flood Control Act of 1962. Dam construction began in 1970 and was completed in 1974 with the establishment of Alum Creek State Park. The building of Alum Creek Dam created Alum Creek Lake, the body of water that Alum Creek State Park is adjacent to. Natural history Alum Creek State Park is in central Ohio and is surrounded by farmlands and new housing developments. The park is home to many species of plants and animals that cannot live on the surrounding farmland. The old- growth forests of beech and maple trees were cut down for farming purposes, but in the area of the park these trees have come back to form a thriving secondary forest. Wild flower species include bloodroot, wild geranium, spring beauties and trillium. The forest provides a habitat for white-tail deer, groundhogs, fox squirrels, and rabbits. Recreation A busy day at the beach Alum Creek State Park offers year-round recreational opportunities. Park activities include camping, hunting, hiking, picnicking, mountain biking, snowmobiling and horseback riding, fishing and ice fishing, boating and ice boating, and swimming. There are of bridle trails, of hiking trails, and of mountain biking trails. The lake has five boat ramps with boats of unlimited horsepower permitted. The campground has 286 sites with electricity, showers, restroom, basketball courts, horseshoe pits and playgrounds. There are also cabins and a primitive camp along the bridle trail. The park's beach is the largest inland beach in Ohio and includes a beach house and beach volleyball courts. The lake is open to ice fishing during the winter months. Game fish found in the lake include large mouth and small mouth bass, bluegill, crappie, sunfish, channel catfish, saugeye, walleye and muskellunge. Saugeye and muskies are stocked by the State of Ohio, Division of Wildlife, and fishing tournaments are hosted throughout the year. Common game species at the park include white-tail deer, squirrels, and raccoons.

The Lillenas family farm comprised of rocky ground, which was sold to allow the family to migrate to the United States. While Anna and her three children lived temporarily in a home south of Bergen, Ole Lillenas migrated from Norway to the United States of America via Canada in 1886, where he bought a farm in Colton, South Dakota.McGraw, 5; 1900 US Census. After Ole finished constructing a sod house, Anna, and the three children were re-united with him in 1887. In 1889 the Lillenas family relocated again to a farm on the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon.McGraw, 5; Dan Harris, Children's Ministries Connections, The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Music Composers Authors & Songs: A Biographical Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1952) While living in Astoria, Lillenas learned English and began to attend school.McGraw, 5. In 1900 the family moved to Roseville Township, Kandiyohi County, Minnesota. While in Roseville, Lillenas began attending high school in a Lutheran school at Hawick, Minnesota. At the age of 17, Lillenas began a four- year correspondence course from the International Correspondence Schools in chemistry and chemical analysis with private tutors. Lillenas worked as a farm labourer most of the year, but during winter he concentrated on his studies. About 1906 Anna Marie Lillenas died, and Ole decided to relocate the family to North Dakota, however Lillenas decided to move back to Astoria, Oregon, where he finished his correspondence course and found employment in a chemical factory. =Spiritual experience= Like most Scandinavians at that time, Lillenas was raised in a Lutheran family. The Lillenas family were devout in their religious life, and attended community services when held in their area.Hughes. At the age of fifteen Lillenas became a confirmed member of the Lutheran Church in Hawick.Haldor Lillenas, Down Melody Lane (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press, 1953):5; \\"Lillenas Publishing Company\\", in Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music, ed. By W.K. McNeil (Routledge, 2005):231. However, Lillenas indicated in his autobiography that at that time, he had not experienced \\"the miracle of the new birth\\".Melody, 5. As a young boy, Lillenas had been befriended by an elderly woman who taught him English, and told him about Jesus. As a consequence, in 1906 Lillenas began to attend meetings at the Peniel Mission, a holiness rescue mission, in Astoria, Oregon Burnis H.

According to Lillenas in a 1948 interview, it was shortly after the death of his mother, soon after moving to Astoria, one summer evening \\"he paused to listen to a street corner service. There he heard for the first time the strains of 'Tell Mother I'll Be There'. He made his decision then to devote his life to Christian service.\\"Special to the Post-Dispatch [Tuscumbia, MO](8 December 1948) According to McGraw, the \\"singing and testimonies brought conviction to his heart. Later that year he was saved, and three weeks later his heart was cleansed.McGraw, 6; Charles Edwin Jones, Perfectionist Persuasion: A Social Profile of the National Holiness Movement within American Methodism, 1867-1936 (University of Wisconsin--Madison, 1968):228; Charles Edwin Jones, Perfectionist Persuasion: The Holiness Movement and American Methodism, 1867-1936 (Scarecrow Press, 1974):45. Soon he was \\"helping in the mission, singing to his heart's content, witnessing with joy to 'the wonderful grace of Jesus,' and writing songs with increasing skill and volume.\\"McGraw, 6. In 1907 Lillenas moved to Portland, Oregon, where he worked with the Peniel Mission located at 247 NW Couch Street. All Peniel Mission workers were unsalaried, but the local mission paid for most of their expenses. Soon after, Lillenas testified that he believed he was called to be a minister of the gospel,Melody, 19. at which time he was appointed leader of the Portland mission. During his year of leadership, \\"he saw so many souls won to Christ that he felt more certain than ever that he should devote his life to the Lord's work.\\" In 1908 Lillenas became a member of the Portland First Church of the Nazarene, then located at 428 Burnside Street,McGraw, 6; , John L. Adams, Musicians' Autobiographies: An Annotated Bibliography of Writings Available in English, 1800 to 1980 (McFarland, 1982):62. which had been founded on 4 July 1906. Soon after Lillenas enrolled in the ministerial course of studies, which he began by correspondence.Melody, 22. Soon afterwards, Lillenas joined a vocal group associated with the Salvation Army called the \\"Charioteers' Brigade\\", which held street meetings and revival services throughout a large portion of California.Children's Ministries Connection. =Ministerial preparation= As a result of some generous donations, and the efforts of Rev. A.O. Hendricks, pastor of the Portland Church of the Nazarene, in 1909 Lillenas was able to continue his ministerial studies at the Deets Pacific Bible College, an antecedent of Point Loma Nazarene University, located at the corner of San Pedro and East 28th Streets, Los Angeles, California.Ronald Kirkemo, Additionally, Lillenas was able to secure part-time work to finance his studies, but by the end of the year accepted the ministry as the music director of a local church, and was active in songwriting and preaching. During this time Lillenas also studied voice at the Lyric School of Music in Los Angeles. =Marriages and family=Bertha Mae Wilson While at Deets College Lillenas was in a college group that held evangelistic services most weekends.Mallalieu Wilson, 30.

Lillenas and Bertha Mae both preached, sang, and wrote songs, and often practised in the home of her father.Wilson, 30; McGraw, 6. In his autobiography Lilenas recalled: \\"We soon learned that our voices blended well and so we arranged it that our lives should also be blended.\\"Melody, 24.

Lola Dell After the death of Bertha from cancer in March 1945, Lillenas married Lola Dell (born 23 March 1894 in Kansas; died October 1974 in Kansas) later that year. =Later years= In the depths of the Great Depression, 1938, the Lillenas family purchased a rural acreage in the Miller County, Missouri hills of The Ozarks, halfway between Tuscumbia and Iberia on Missouri Route 17, about southwest of Jefferson City. Here they constructed their home, which they called \\"Melody Lane\\". It was here that Bertha Mae died of cancer in March 1945, and where Lillenas and his second wife, Lola, lived until they relocated to Pasadena, California by 1955. When they lived at Melody Lane, Lillenas was an active member of the Iberia Church of the Nazarene, where there is now a memorial stained glass window in his honour. After a visit to Israel in 1955, Lillenas sponsored a Palestinian Greek Orthodox family he had met as immigrants to the USA, that included twelve-year-old Sirhan Bishara Sirhan (born March 19, 1944), the convicted assassin of Robert F. Kennedy.John Dart, \\"Sirhan Family Tries Church After Church: Religious Interests Evidenced Without Settling Upon Satisfactory Denomination\\", Los Angeles Times (8 June 1968):18; Sidney C.

Kennedy (Random House, 1970):163. =Death and burial= Lillenas died on 18 August 1959 at Aspen, Colorado. Career=Pastor= Soon after his conversion in 1906, Lillenas was convinced that he was called to be a minister. Lillenas was a pastor for the Church of the Nazarene for fifteen years from 1910. Soon after his marriage in October 1910, they moved to Sacramento, California where they took charge of the Peniel Mission. After a year, Lillenas became the pastor of the Lompoc, California Church of the Nazarene.Mallalieu Wilson, 38. Lillenas and Bertha Mae were both ordained as elders in the Church of the Nazarene on the Southern California District in 1912 by Dr. Hiram F. Reynolds.Floyd T. Cunningham, ed., Our Watchword & Song: The Centennial History of the Church of the Nazarene (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 2009):287. At the time Bertha's father was the district superintendent. During this pastorate, Lillenas took a two-year course in composition and harmony with Welsh singer and composer Daniel Protheroe (born 5 November 1866; died 25 February 1934) and Adolph Rosenbecker from the Siegel-Myers University Correspondence School of Music in Chicago, Illinois\\"Haldor Lillenas: 1885-1959\\", Music Composers Dictionary.

Auburn, Illinois (1916‚Äì1919);It was here that Lillenas wrote his most famous hymn, Wonderful Grace of Jesus, see Kenneth W. Osbeck, 25 Most Treasured Gospel Hymn Stories (Kregel Publications, 1998):109. Peniel, Texas; and Indianapolis, Indiana (1923‚Äì1926).Stacey Nicholas, \\"Holiness Churches\\", in The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis, eds. David J. Bodenhamer, Robert Graham Barrows, and David Gordon Vanderstel (Indianapolis University Press, 1994):699; L. C. Rudolph, Hoosier Faiths: A History of Indiana Churches & Religious Groups (Indiana University Press, 1995):424. When Lillenas resigned from Indianapolis First Church to focus on his publishing house, Bertha became the pastor until they relocated to Kansas City, Missouri in 1930. =Song evangelist= For ten years Lillenas was a song evangelist, who travelled with Bertha Mae holding revival services. Among those churches where he held evangelistic services was the Wesleyan Methodist Church in New Jersey where the father of George Beverly Shea was the pastor.George Beverly Shea, How Sweet the Sound (Tyndale House Publishers, 2004):155. =Hymnwriter= From a very young age, Lillenas began to write his own songs, however it was not until he was 19 years old, that he attempted to have them published. In a 1948 interview, Lillenas indicated: \\"I was living in North Dakota at that time and I noticed an advertisement from a publishing company asking for new songs to publish. I didn't know then that a reputable publisher never has to advertise for songs. I spent $25 to have my songs published and I received $3.65 in \\"royalties\\" from that venture. My first few songs were not too successful.\\" In the same interview he revealed that after many rejections, he finally succeeded in selling ten of his songs to one publisher for 50 cents each. One of these songs, He Set Me Free, became popular. Lillenas indicated that soon after his conversion at the age of 21, that he began to increasingly write hymns and songs that expressed his faith and joy. Lillenas was a prolific composer of hymns, and it is estimated that \\"in his lifetime, he wrote some 4,000 hymns, and supplied songs for many evangelists.\\" Lillenas composed songs for cantatas for Easter and Christmas, Special Day church services. Lillenas used many pseudonyms to compose his songs, including Virginia Rose Golden, Laverne Gray, Richard Hainsworth, Rev. H. N. Lines, Robert Whitmore and Ferne Winters. In 1938 Lillenas became a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).Music Composers, Authors & Songs Dictionary. While some of his hymns, such as Wonderful Grace of Jesus and The Bible Stands, crossed denominational barriers and appeared in the hymnals of various Protestant churches, most were used by Lillenas' own denomination and its ecclesiastical cousins within the Wesleyan-Holiness movement. Nazarene historian Floyd Cunningham sees \\"the number of songs by Haldor Lillenas that we sang, that were peculiar to us\\" as evidence of increased sectarianism in the Church of the Nazarene in its second generation.Floyd T. Cunningham, \\"Holiness Embodied in the Asia-Pacific Context\\", Didache 4:1 (June 2004):10 Timothy Smith asserts that this generation believed that \\"to keep the Spirit in the church, it seemed necessary to keep up the tempo.\\"Timothy L. Smith, Called Unto Holiness: The Story of the Nazarenes: The Formative Years (Kansas City: NPH, 1962):12, referenced in Cunningham, 10. Among the prominent hymns that Lillenas wrote are: * He Set Me Free (1909); * Holiness Forevermore (1910).McGraw, 7;. * Where They Need No Sun (1911); * Wonderful Peace (1914); * Jesus Has Lifted Me (1916) (music only); * Will the Circle be Broken? (1916);Included in Homer A. Rodeheaver, comp., Awakening Songs: For the Church, Sunday School, and Evangelistic Services(Chicago: The Rodeheaver Company, n.d.):91, Note Written by Lillenas. Chorus is identified as by H.L. Lines (a pseudonym of Lillenas). * The Bible Stands (1917); * Glorious Freedom (1917); * Wonderful Grace of Jesus (1918);The Defender 16 (Defenders of the Christian Faith, Inc., 1941):18-19; Osbeck, More 101 Hymn Stories, 312-316; Kenneth W. Osbeck, Amazing Grace: 366 Inspiring Hymn Stories for Daily Devotions, 2nd ed. (Kregel Publications, 2002):168. * It Is Glory Just To Walk With Him (1918) (music only); * I Have Settled The Question (1919); * Tell the Bless√®d Story (1920); * The Peace That Jesus Gives; * O My Heart Sings Today (1924); * I Know a Name (1928); and * There's a Blessed and Triumphant Song. * My Wonderful Lord (1938);McGraw, 7. In 1958 Lillenas wrote The Sun Never Sets, a song to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Church of the Nazarene, based on a quotation from early Nazarene founder Phineas Bresee, who often said: \\"We are in the sunrise of the Nazarene movement and the sun never sets in the morning.\\" Wonderful Grace of Jesus (1918) Lillenas' best known song is probably Wonderful Grace of Jesus, which he wrote during his pastorate at the Church of the Nazarene in Auburn, Illinois. Lillenas explains the origin of this gospel song: > In 1917, Mrs. Lillenas and I built our first little home in the town of > Olivet, Illinois. Upon its completion, we had scarcely any money left to > furnish the little home. Having no piano at the time, and needing an > instrument of some kind, I managed to find, at one of the neighbor's home, a > little wheezy organ which I purchased for $5.00. With the aid of this > instrument, a number of my songs, were written which are now popular, > including 'Wonderful Grace of Jesus.'Osbeck, More 101 Hymn Stories, 312-316. Wonderful Grace of Jesus was copyrighted in 1918, but not published until 1922 in the Tabernacle Choir Book. Lillenas was paid $5.00 for this song. =Poet= Lillenas was a respected poet.The Biographical Dictionary of Contemporary Poets: The Who's Who of American Poets (Avon House, 1938); Michael Anthony Panelle and Donna Beatrice Brown, comp., Poets-On-Parade, 1938: A Collection of Contemporary American Poetry (Watchtower books, 1939). One of his notable poems was his 1928 poem, Poverty.Haldor Lillenas, \\"Poverty\\", in Russell Victor DeLong, The High Cost of Low Living (Kansas City, MO: Nazarene Publishing House, 1949):80-81, US Catalog of Copyright Entries (Renewals) Books from 1928 Titles starting with O to R, Marion K. Rich, Rejoice: Your're a Minister's Wife (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 1978):104. =Publisher= In 1924, while still serving as pastor of the Indianapolis First Church of the Nazarene, Lillenas founded the Lillenas Publishing Company. Shares were offered initially for $100 each. The President was E.W. Petticord; the Vice President was Kenneth H. Wells; the Secretary/Treasurer was Fra Morton, while Lillenas was the manager.Whitsett, 6. On 16 October 1925 Lillenas Publishing Company opened the doors to their offices, which were located at 5921 East Washington Street (at the corner with Arlington Avenue). In 1926 Lillenas resigned as pastor to allow him to devote his energies to the publishing company. Bertha Mae assumed the pastoral responsibilities. Before Lillenas Publishing Company was sold to the Nazarene Publishing House in Kansas City, Missouri in 1930, more than 700,000 hymnals and song books were published and sold.The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis, 699. The sale included 1,535 copyrights.Whitsett, 7. The sale agreement mandated that Lillenas would serve as manager of Lillenas Publishing Company for ten years and then be reviewed. However Lillenas continued as an editor until his retirement in 1950, at the age of 65. After his retirement, Lillenas served as an adviser to the Music department of Nazarene Publishing House until his death.\\"Lillenas Publishing Company\\", in Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music, ed. W. K. McNeil (Routledge, 2005):231. =Author= Lillenas was the editor and compiler of over fifty song books for church and Sunday School. Lillenas' first book was Special Sacred Songs, which was published in 1919.Eleanor, Whitsett, A History of the Lillenas Publishing Company and its Relationship to the Music of the Church of the Nazarene (Kansas City, MO: Lillenas Publishing Company, 1972):5. Among his other publications was the first official hymnal for the Church of the Nazarene, Glorious Gospel Songs, published in 1931, soon after Lillenas Publishing Company became part of the Nazarene Publishing House. Glorious Gospel HYMNS included about 700 hymns and gospel songs, of which 81 were of his own composition. After his retirement from the Nazarene Publishing House in 1950, Lillenas and his second wife, Lola, travelled extensively, including three trips to his native Norway. During this period Lillenas wrote three books: Modern Gospel Song Stories (1952); an autobiography, Down Melody Lane: An Autobiography (1953); and Motoring 11,000 miles Through Norway: A Guide for Tourists with Sixty Suggested Tours (1955), a travel book based on his three trips to Norway. Awards and honours In 1941 Olivet Nazarene College awarded Lillenas an honorary Doctor of Music degree in recognition of his contributions to American hymnody. In 1982 Lillenas was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame, in the same class as John T. Benson, Sr.; Thomas A. Dorsey; Charles H. Gabriel; Lowell Mason; B.B. McKinney; and John Newton. In the Caravan scouting programme of the Church of the Nazarene, the Haldor Lillenas Award is presented to outstanding fifth and sixth grade children.

Biography Offen lived most of his life in Chicago and worked as an insurance investigator, editor, freelance writer, and theater producer. With R. R. Cuscaden he was the co-editor of Mainstream: A Quarterly Journal of Poetry (1957), one of the first publishers of Richard Brautigan. He was also co-editor with Cuscaden of Odyssey: Explorations in Contemporary Poetry and the Arts (1958‚Äì59), which published the early work of Charles Bukowski, LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), David Ray, and others. He was a reviewer and executive editor of Chicago Literary Times (1962‚Äì1965), poetry editor of December (circa 1970‚Äì72), and columnist (‚ÄúPoetry Beat‚Äù) for the Chicago Daily News (1974‚Äì75). From 1970 to 1977, he was a book reviewer for the Chicago Sun-Times, a drama critic for Chicago's weekly newspaper, Skyline, and worked in the Poets-in-the Schools program sponsored by the Illinois Arts Council. Theatre In the 1970s he co-authored Dillinger: Dead or Alive? with Jay Robert Nash and wrote Cagney and Brando. In 1975 Offen and his second wife, Rosine (1930‚Äì2000), an Actors‚Äô Equity actress and director, formed the theater company, The Peripatetic Task Force. He was the executive producer of this company, which produced avant-garde and original plays. He was also instrumental in creating Gangway Playhouse in Chicago, a summer outdoor free children's theater. The company's production of Jack Stokes's Wiley and The Hairy Man at Gangway Playhouse won a special Joseph Jefferson Award in 1977 for children's theater.

He leads the University's Energetics Research Group, which is one of the world's leading groups using doubly labeled water (DLW) to investigate energy expenditure and balance in animals. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: Since 2011, he has also been working as a '1000 talents' Professor at the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing, China, where he runs the molecular energetics group. Education Speakman in 2015 Speakman was educated at Leigh Grammar School, near Manchester, and then went to the University of Stirling where he was awarded a BSc in Biology and Psychology in 1980 and a PhD in 1984 for research on the energetics of foraging in wading birds. He was subsequently awarded Doctor of Science (DSc) degrees by both the University of Aberdeen in 1996 and University of Stirling in 2009. in 2017 he obtained a BSc in Maths and Statistics from the Open university. Career and research Speakman's work focuses on the causes and consequences of variation in energy balance, and in particular the factors that limit expenditure, the genetic and environmental drivers of obesity and the energetic contribution to ageing. He is an internationally recognised expert in the use of isotope methodologies to measure energy demands and has used these methods on a wide range of wild animals, model species and humans. During the mid-1980s and early 1990s, Speakman made many contributions to the development of the DLW method, culminating in the book Doubly labelled water: theory and practice, published in 1997 that remains the standard reference work for applications of this methodology in humans and other animals. Since 2018 he was the chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency doubly-labelled water database management committee, which manages a database of over 6000 measurements of human subjects made using the DLW method. Speakman is well known for his work on obesity, in particular for criticising a long-established theory for obesity known as the thrifty gene hypothesis. His alternative hypothesis proposes that the modern distribution of obese phenotypes arose via the release from predation and random genetic drift: the drifty gene hypothesis.J. R. Speakman. (2008). Thrifty genes for obesity, an attractive but flawed idea, and an alternative perspective: the 'drifty gene' hypothesis. International Journal of Obesity, 32, 1611-7. Speakman, J.R. (2006).

Speakman. (2007). A nonadaptive scenario explaining the genetic predisposition to obesity: the \\"predation release\\" hypothesis. Cell metabolism, 6, 5-12. This idea is controversial and has been criticised by others that support the original thrifty gene hypothesis.A. M. Prentice, B. J. Hennig and A. J. Fulford. (2008). Evolutionary origins of the obesity epidemic: natural selection of thrifty genes or genetic drift following predation release? International Journal of Obesity, 32, 1607-10, Speakman's group was the first to link genetic variation to differences in food consumption in humans by examining polymorphic variation in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene.J. R. Speakman, K. A. Rance and A. M. Johnstone. (2008). Polymorphisms of the FTO gene are associated with variation in energy intake, but not energy expenditure. Obesity, 16, 1961-5. With Aberdeen colleague Ela Krol, among others, he has published a series of over 30 papers in the Journal of Experimental Biology, which culminated in a novel hypothesis that animal energy expenditure is limited by the capacity to dissipate body heat. This idea ‚Äì the \\"heat dissipation limit hypothesis\\" (HDL) was published by Speakman and Krol in the Journal of Animal Ecology in 2010.Speakman, J.R. and Krol, E (2010) Maximal heat dissipation capacity and hyperthermia risk: neglected key factors in the ecology of endotherms Journal of Animal Ecology 79: 726-746 The idea is claimed to have wide implications for our understanding of many aspects of ecophysiology and ecology ‚Äì such as limits on range distributions, maximum possible sizes of endothermic animals e.g. dinosaurs, Bergmann‚Äôs rule, effects of climate change etc.Gremillet et a. (2012) Heat dissipation limit theory and the evolution of avian functional traits in a warming world. Functional eology 26: 1001-1006 The idea is revolutionary because it shifts the fundamental locus of control over energy expenditure from extrinsic factors outside the animal (e.g. food supply, fractal supply system, uptake capacity), to intrinsic factors inside an animal (heat dissipation capacity). An independent review of studies of energy expenditure concluded that the HDL hypothesis provided a better explanation of the patterns of energy expenditure in endotherms than does the metabolic theory of ecology.Hudson, L.N. et al (2013) The relationship between body mass and field metabolic rate among individual birds and mammals.

It has been reported from just one county, Lee, in the far northeastern portion of the state of Mississippi. Description A colony of Pennsylvania sedge in the Morton Arboretum Pennsylvania sedge produces leaves up to long and wide that become arching at maturity. It has culms (stems) long. Pennsylvania sedge blooms early in the spring, from April to June. Each flower cluster contains one slender staminate (male) spike long above one to three shorter pistillate (female) spikes each with 4 to 12 florets. During the blooming period, the staminate spike produces slender cream-colored anthers, aging to light brown, and each pistillate floret produces three long white, thread-like styles. The scales underneath the florets are dark purple. Ecology This competitive species is often found in large monotypic stands. It is mainly vegetative, spreading via systems of cordlike rhizomes. Shorter rhizomes produce tufts, clumps, and mats, and longer rhizomes form wide, matted colonies.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 29 and 30 October 2009. It is the third serial of the third series. It guest stars David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, marking the first appearance of parent programme Doctor Who's main character in a spin-off show. Filmed after \\"The End of Time\\", the episode includes the final scenes David Tennant recorded during his tenure as the Doctor.David Tennant: Doctor Who farewell was 'very emotional' - The Guardian - Jason Deans - 30 October 2009 In the story, alien investigator Sarah Jane Smith gets engaged to her boyfriend, Peter Dalton. However, alien time traveller and old friend of Sarah Jane's, the Doctor, raises an objection at her wedding, and the marriage is revealed to be a malicious plot set up by one of Sarah Jane's recurring enemies, The Trickster. Plot=Part 1= The episode starts with Sarah Jane sneaking out of her home for \\"a traffic report meeting\\". With help from Mr Smith and K9, Luke, Rani and Clyde find her in a restaurant with a man. As they are leaving, Clyde is puzzled by the sound of the TARDIS. Sarah Jane returns home and finds out that she was spied upon, but seems happy and announces that she is seeing a man, Peter Dalton, and that she has invited him to Bannerman Road. Sarah Jane tells Luke that she is worried about what Peter might think about her adventures. Luke tells her not to worry and that she looks happy. After Sarah Jane leaves the room, Luke also hears the sound of the TARDIS. When Peter arrives at the Smiths' house, Sarah Jane tries to hide all evidence of her extraterrestrial adventures, but a parcel arrives containing an alien creature. Rani and Clyde, who were trying to see what Peter was like, take the parcel back to Rani's house. Peter arrives as Clyde and Rani leave, but Rani's mother runs across to also look at him. In the Chandras' house, Rani and Clyde see a multi-eyed slug-like creature burst out of the parcel; detecting the alien, K9 leaves Sarah Jane's house to warn about the creature. Luke manages to explain K9 away as a prototype toy. K9 then joins Rani and Clyde in trying to catch the creature as Sarah Jane, Peter and Luke go for a meal. During the meal, Rani, Clyde and K9 manage to bring the alien slug to the attic where Mr Smith teleports it to its home planet, Polongus. Two days later, Peter proposes to Sarah Jane, who accepts. He gives her an engagement ring, which glows red. Meanwhile, Rani and Clyde investigate Peter's home, which they find to be unoccupied. Back at the attic, Sarah Jane reveals to Luke, Rani and Clyde that she has agreed to marry Peter. Rani and Clyde tell Sarah Jane and Luke that they checked Peter's house and found it empty. The engagement ring glows again and rather than getting angry, Sarah Jane seems happy and explains that Peter has another flat in London, which she has visited many times. Mr Smith detects an anomaly when the ring glows, but Sarah Jane orders Mr Smith to deactivate. When the wedding day arrives, Clyde still has his doubts, but Luke tells him to keep calm and not ruin the wedding, and asks him to help hide K9. When Sarah Jane enters the hotel, Rani also hears the sound of the TARDIS engines. During the ceremony, when the registrar asks if there is any reason why the couple should not be wed, the Tenth Doctor bursts through the doors, demanding the wedding be stopped. As he warns Sarah Jane to step away from Peter, the Trickster appears and kidnaps Sarah Jane. The Doctor tries to save her but she, Peter and the Trickster disappear. =Part 2= As Luke, Clyde and Rani regain consciousness, the Doctor introduces himself, swiftly revealing that they and K9 are the only people in the hotel, which now exists in a white void trapped at 15:23:23; The Trickster has literally trapped them in a second, cutting them off from the rest of the world, and more importantly, cutting them off from the TARDIS, which cannot materialise properly. Using K9's sensors and the sonic screwdriver, the Doctor is able to determine that Sarah Jane is trapped in another second, deducing that The Trickster has separated the group to prevent them helping Sarah Jane. As Sarah Jane realises what has happened, she removes her engagement ring, realising that it has been influencing her actions. Peter protests that the \\"Angel\\" (The Trickster) told him that the ring would only ensure everything worked out at the wedding, and points out that Sarah Jane accepted his proposal on her own. As Peter explains that The Trickster came to him when he had an accident at home, offering him his life and the love he never had, The Trickster states that Sarah Jane and her allies will only to be returned to the real universe when she says \\"I do\\". While attempting to find a way out of the hotel, the Doctor confronts The Trickster, revealing that he is the personification of the Pantheon of Discord; The Trickster reciprocates with his own knowledge of the Doctor and explaining that, with Sarah Jane's marriage marking the beginning of her new life, she will forget her old life of defending Earth, creating more chaos for the Trickster to feed on. The Trickster also remarks ominously to the Doctor that \\"The Gate is waiting for you\\". As the TARDIS appears, attempting to \\"lock on\\" to its pilot, the Doctor explains that they can use the artron energy that powers the TARDIS to fight The Trickster. But his attempt to help Luke, Rani and Clyde into the TARDIS fails, with the TARDIS and the Doctor being cut off from the hotel as the TARDIS dematerialises with the Doctor still inside. However, Clyde's attempts to enter the TARDIS result in him becoming temporarily charged with artron energy, allowing him to attack The Trickster. With The Trickster's power momentarily disrupted by Clyde's attack, the Doctor is able to materialise the TARDIS in Sarah Jane's second, telling her that there is only one way to end The Trickster's deal. As the Trickster and Clyde appear, both momentarily weakened by Clyde's attack, Sarah Jane tearfully informs Peter that the only way to stop The Trickster is for Peter to take back the deal, even though this will mean his death. Peter genuinely died in the accident, and is currently living a half-life that will only become real once he marries Sarah Jane. Though The Trickster claims that Peter is too weak to make that decision, Peter states that his love for Sarah Jane has strengthened him, ending the deal and returning the hotel to the moment before the Doctor's arrival, with Peter having vanished and nobody else but the heroes remembering anything about the presence of the Trickster or the Doctor. As Sarah Jane later cries in the attic, she is joined by Luke, Rani and Clyde, who console her on her loss before the TARDIS materialises in the attic. After the Doctor allows the three teenagers to look around the TARDIS, he departs once more, assuring Sarah Jane that she still has an incredible life ahead of her. =Continuity= * The Travist Polong from Part 1 appears to be the same alien that Sarah Jane was chasing in the hospital during the events of The Mark of the Berserker. * Sarah Jane jokes about sending the Doctor a wedding invitation, asking if she should send it to Metebelis Three. Sarah Jane visited Metebelis Three with the Third Doctor in Planet of the Spiders. * Sarah Jane was previously controlled by a ring in The Hand of Fear, her last adventure with the Fourth Doctor. * Clyde states that Brigadier Lethbridge- Stewart is \\"back in Peru\\". He had just returned from a previous mission there in Enemy of the Bane, and was also described as being in South America in the 2008 Doctor Who episode \\"The Poison Sky\\". He also describes the Brigadier as being Sarah Jane's oldest friend. She first met both him and The Doctor in the first episode of the Third Doctor serial, The Time Warrior. It had been intended by the production team that Lethbridge-Stewart would indeed appear in the story and meet the Tenth Doctor, but actor Nicholas Courtney was recovering from a stroke and unable to take part. * Clyde notes his concern that Peter Dalton is simply marrying Sarah Jane for the money \\"her aunt left her\\". Aunt Lavina Smith was a recurring unseen character during Sarah Jane's tenure with the Third and Fourth Doctors, and was depicted quite elderly in 1981's \\"A Girl's Best Friend\\". Sarah Jane described herself as being \\"all alone\\" in \\"Invasion of the Bane\\" and speaks of Aunt Lavina in the past-tense in The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith. Aunt Lavina is definitively dead in the 2002 Big Finish audio drama, Sarah Jane Smith: Comeback which states that Lavinia left her fortune to Sarah Jane, but the canonicity of that story is questionable. * No mention is made of the absence of Sarah Jane's foster brother / foster cousin, Brendan Richards, whom Aunt Lavina reared after Sarah Jane was grown. The two first met in person in \\"A Girl's Best Friend\\". The 2002 Big Finish audio drama, Sarah Jane Smith: Comeback states that Brendan is living in San Francisco, but the canonicity of that story is questionable. * When The Doctor calls his former companion \\"Sarah\\", Rani 'corrects' him, stating that she insists upon being addressed as \\"Sarah Jane\\". The Doctor responds that she never minded when he called her \\"Sarah\\", as the Fourth Doctor routinely addressed her as simply \\"Sarah\\" during her tenure on Doctor Who. * The Trickster previously appeared in Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane? and The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith; The Doctor refers to The Trickster in \\"Turn Left\\" in which the Time Beetle, one of The Trickster's Brigade, alters Donna Noble's timeline so that she never met The Doctor. The Trickster is also mentioned by Jack Harkness in the Torchwood: Miracle Day episode \\"Immortal Sins\\". * When The Doctor and The Trickster confront each other, The Trickster states that the Doctor once held the Key to Time. The Fourth Doctor assembled the Key in The Armageddon Factor, and the Fifth Doctor held the complete key in the audio drama The Chaos Pool. * The Trickster refers to The Doctor being like \\"fire and ice\\"; in \\"The Family of Blood\\", Timothy refers to The Doctor in the same manner. The Trickster tells The Doctor that \\"the Gate is waiting for [him]\\", foreshadowing the Immortality Gate in \\"The End of Time\\". * Defeating The Trickster and correcting the timeline always requires someone to sacrifice his or her own life: Peter Dalton in this episode, Donna Noble in \\"Turn Left\\", Eddie and Barbara Smith in The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, and Andrea Yates in Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane? * The Doctor tells Luke, \\"Good to meet you in the flesh\\", and acknowledges that Luke helped him save Earth, in reference to their video conferences in \\"Journey's End\\". * When objecting to the children's attempts to ask The Doctor for a trip, Sarah Jane reminds Clyde and Rani about their confinement to Earth by the Judoon. In Prisoner of the Judoon, Clyde and Rani were given a mitigated sentence of confinement to Earth for interfering in the Judoon's pursuit of a Veil. The Doctor nevertheless briefly sends Clyde off-world in \\"Death of the Doctor\\". * The Doctor uses a football rattle to calm the kids down. He previously used a football rattle in the Fourth Doctor serial The Masque of Mandragora as a distraction technique. * In the concluding scenes, Sarah Jane and The Doctor each tell the other not to forget them: this same exchange took place in The Hand of Fear, as Sarah Jane left the TARDIS for the final time until The Five Doctors. * Sarah Jane and The Doctor meet next in Death of the Doctor, although before that they'll silently wave goodbyes to each other in \\"The End of Time\\". * K9 Mark IV explains how he is able to navigate the three-story Smith house when he announces \\"activating stair-negotiating hover mode.\\" K9 Mark III lacked hover ability, and Sarah Jane was shown lifting him into and out of her car's hatchback in \\"A Girl's Best Friend\\". K9 Mark IV is later shown in \\"The Gift\\" to use his hover mode to exit Sarah Jane's car. * Sarah Jane's is one of two weddings of former companions The Doctor attends in late 2009; each is also attended by another former companion (in this case, K9). The Doctor briefly visits Donna Noble's wedding to give her (through her grandfather, fellow companion Wilfred Mott) a winning lottery ticket. These, along with the wedding of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams (also attended by \\"future companion\\" River Song) in \\"The Big Bang\\" show The Doctor at three weddings of companions in less than eight months.\\"The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith\\" (Sarah Jane's wedding) aired 29‚Äì30 October 2009; part 2 of \\"The End of Time\\" (Donna Noble's wedding) aired 1 January 2010; \\"The Big Bang\\" (Amy Pond & Rory Williams' wedding) aired 26 June 2010. Additionally, he saves the lives of newly-wed former companions Mickey Smith and Dr. Martha Jones, though it's not indicated in what year that occurred. Cast notes Zienia Merton had previously appeared as Ping Cho in the Doctor Who serial Marco Polo in 1964. Nigel Havers had previously played Nick in the Eighth Doctor audio drama No More Lies. Nicholas Courtney was originally going to appear in this story as the Brigadier, but had to pull out for health reasons. The character is said to be stranded in Peru, which had been previously given as his whereabouts during The Sontaran Stratagem. Had Courtney appeared, this story would have been the only televised encounter between the Brigadier and the Tenth Doctor. Novelisation This was the ninth of eleven Sarah Jane Adventures serials to be adapted as a novel. Written by Gareth Roberts, the book was first published in paperback on 5 November 2009.

He was the starting left halfback for Fritz Crisler's Michigan teams in 1941 and 1942. Kuzma was a native of Gary, Indiana. He attended Emerson High School in Gary, where he was an all-state fullback and starred in three sports‚Äîfootball, basketball and track. Football Hall of Famer Tom Harmon also hailed from Gary. Harmon graduated in 1937 and enrolled at the University of Michigan. Kuzma graduated two years later and followed Harmon to Michigan. Kuzma was six-feet, three-inches tall, and weighed 195 pounds as a player at Michigan. Kuzma followed Harmon as Michigan's principal running back in 1941, and comparisons to Harmon were inevitable. Kuzma lacked Harmon's blazing speed and was instead a power-runner who ran through and over the opposition. As NEA Sports Editor Harry Grayson put it, \\"He's a smacker from Smackersville.\\" Aside from his ability as a power runner, Kuzma was a good passer, solid defender, and also served as the Wolverines punter and punt returner. He was considered the Wolverines' best punter since Harry Kipke played for Michigan 20 years earlier. In a 1941 game against Northwestern, Kuzma punted the ball 53 yards with the ball going out of bounds at the Northwestern four-yard line; Crisler called the kick \\"miraculous.\\" In the same game, he threw two touchdown passes, including a 46-yard pass in the fourth quarter that proved to be the game winner as Michigan edged Northwestern, 14‚Äì7. In his first four games as a starter in 1941, Kuzma scored five touchdowns and passed for two more. By mid-season, the Associated Press ran a feature story on Kuzma, reporting that \\"this 19-year- old gridder had surpassed Harmon's sophomore record in scoring, had neared his first-year passing mark and had become one of the Western Conference's greatest kickers.\\" Kuzma had a solid sophomore year, rushing for an average of 4.3 yards per carry and finishing second in the Big Ten Conference in total offense yards per game. Kuzma attended the school of business administration at Michigan and was a member of Phi Gamma Delta. Kuzma was inducted into the military in 1943 and subsequently drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1944 NFL draft. After World War II, Kuzma returned to the University of Michigan to complete his degree, but he did not return to the football team. He graduated in 1947 and chose not to play football professionally but rather served as an assistant football coach at the University of Colorado from 1947‚Äì48. In 1949, Kuzma returned to Michigan and went into the steel business in Detroit. He remained in the steel business until 1979. He next co-founded a chemical coatings company where he worked until his retirement in 1987. He also served as president of the University of Michigan's \\"M\\" Club. Kuzma died at age 74 in Cape Coral, Florida.

He is the former executive director of the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC). Early life and career Deliƒá was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He attended Gazi Husrev-beg Secondary School in Sarajevo from 1980 to 1984. After high school, he completed a year of mandatory service in the Yugoslav Army from 1984 to 1985. After his military service, Deliƒá studied at the Sarajevo Institute of Philosophy from 1985 to 1986. After deciding to take up Islamic studies at the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan where he earned a bachelor's degree in Islamic and Arabic studies from 1986 to 1990. Deliƒá returned home to Bosnia, and worked in the business sector, as well as working as an imam. He went on to become head imam in the Croatian region of Dalmacija. During this time, the war in the Balkans broke out, and Deliƒá worked as a coordinator for two humanitarian organizations helping Bosnians. Deliƒá left the war-torn region with his wife and three-year-old daughter in August 1995, moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. =Canada= After arriving in Vancouver, Deliƒá was hired by the British Columbia Muslim Association to serve as the imam of its mosque in Richmond, British Columbia a suburb of Vancouver. He would also go on to serve as an Islamic studies teacher and vice-principal of the association's B.C. Muslim School, and became a spokesperson for the Muslim community. Deliƒá served the BCMA from 1995 to 2006. Deliƒá's appeared on radio and television programs across British Columbia. He also worked to forge strong relationships with Christian, Jewish, Sikh and Aboriginal leaders. As an imam, Deliƒá led congregational prayers, taught religious classes, performed marriages and funerals, gave talks and lead youth camps and seminars. He also counseled prison inmates, visited hospital patients, received tour groups from non-Muslim communities, and gave lectures at schools and universities about Islam. While working for the BCMA, Deliƒá completed his Master of Science in Education at the University of Oregon in 2001. In 2006, he earned his Ph.D from the Faculty of Education at Simon Fraser University. In 2008, he was commissioned by the Canadian government's Department of Heritage to conduct a comparative study on Muslim integration in Canada, France and Bosnia. In this study, Deliƒá suggests that for Canada's Muslims, Canada's multiculturalism model opens up opportunities to renew and reform their communal outlook within mainstream society while maintaining their religious beliefs. He argues that \\"this approach is unlike the one experienced by Muslims in France who live in a model of systemic assimilation or Muslims of Bosnia who were politically and socially under pressure to abandon their religious beliefs and become 'others' \\" (Deliƒá, 2008). He argues the major difference is that Canada consciously and officially defines itself as a multicultural state in that it not only tolerates but also welcomes people with a variety of ethnic origins, respects minority religions and cultures, and has made constitutional commitments to this end. Deliƒá had been invited to speak on 4 October 2010 to a gathering at National Defence Headquarters celebrating Islamic Heritage Month, but his invitation was revoked by then-Defence Minister Peter MacKay on three days' notice. MacKay's spokesperson cited comments made in 2006 by a former president of the Canadian Islamic Congress as the reason. The National Post published the text of Deliƒá's undelivered speech the following day, while conservative blogger Arnie Lemaire claimed credit for influencing the minister's decision.  Views =Islamic extremism= In 2003, Deliƒá was interviewed by The Vancouver Sun newspaper after Imam Gamal Solaiman called Muslims to wage attacks on American troops in the Middle East. Deliƒá criticized the imam's speech stating that instead, Muslim leaders should \\"say that nobody has a right to kill innocent people and destroy the future of children and their possibilities in life.\\" In October 2004, a tape was sent to a media outlet of a speech by Vancouver-based Imam Younus Kathrada who preached at the Dar al-Madinah Islamic Society. On the tape, Kathrada delivered a lecture in which he called Jews the \\"brothers of monkeys and swine.\\" The Canadian Jewish Congress filed a formal complaint with the hate crimes unit of the Vancouver Police, and Kathrada was the subject of a joint Royal Canadian Mounted Police-Vancouver Police investigation. Deliƒá, who was the imam in the nearby suburb of Richmond at the time, criticized Kathrada's comments. He said \\"[Kathrada] does not represent me or other Muslims.\\" He added \\"You can't bring Saudi Arabia into Canada.\\" Deliƒá also told The Richmond Review newspaper that he worried about the damage the incident caused in the Muslim community and specifically the impact it might have had on Muslim youth. =Interfaith activity= Deliƒá introduced regular interfaith programs while working in British Columbia. In April 2004, he helped organize a meeting between Muslim leaders and rabbis and members of the Beth Tikvah and Ahavat Olam Synagogues in the Vancouver area. The purpose of this groundbreaking discussion was to reach out across the divide between the Muslim and Jewish communities. This led to the creation of the annual Muslim-Jewish Peace Walk. In 2007, Deliƒá became the first Muslim ever to be a guest speaker at the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishopss in Cornwall, Ontario. At the conference, Deliƒá shared the story of how his best friend was a Catholic while growing up in Bosnia, and how they had been oblivious to the ethnic and religious conflict around them. Deliƒá has also lectured at Ottawa's Lay School of Theology, a school sponsored jointly by the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa, and by the Ottawa Presbyteries of the Presbyterian and United Churches. Personal Deliƒá lives in Ottawa, Ontario.

Ranch is located at 411 North Hollywood Way in Burbank, California and was formerly called the Columbia Ranch. It was the backdrop for many of the Columbia Pictures movies and Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures Television shows, including Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, Dennis the Menace, Hazel, Bewitched, Gidget, I Dream of Jeannie, The Monkees, The Flying Nun, Here Come the Brides, The Partridge Family, The Hathaways, The Waltons, Lost Horizon, High Noon, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, You Were Never Lovelier, The Wild One, The Wrecking Crew, and Autumn Leaves. Only the front facades of the houses and buildings were built; the interiors were always shot at other locations or studios. The streets were constructed and arranged in such a way as to allow shooting at multiple angles to create the illusion of a much larger area, though the lot only spans across about six city blocks. History The ranch started in 1934, as a plot purchased by Harry Cohn head of Columbia Pictures Corporation. The studio, with its headquarters located at Sunset & Gower, in Hollywood, made numerous movies, but had to rent neighboring movie studios‚Äôs backlots for outdoor shooting due to the lack of space at the Sunset lot. By the end of 1934 this problem was solved as Columbia had acquired a lot in Burbank, at the corner of Hollywood Way and Oak Street, on what is said to have been the Burbank Motion Pictures Stables. It was the perfect movie ranch as it was still rural enough to be landscaped as the studio needed it to be. Gate 12 of the lot in 2015 Columbia Pictures used the ranch as a backdrop for almost all of their outdoor scenes. Many serials such as the original Batman, Superman, Captain Midnight, Blondie and The Three Stooges were filmed on the lot. In the 1960s, the ranch was booming with business. Not only were movies being filmed on a regular basis, Columbia's television division (Screen Gems) used the ranch to film these shows. In 1970, a catastrophic fire destroyed a quarter of the lot. Half of the Western set, the Colonial/European set and parts of Blondie street burned, including Blondie house (which was also used as the Father Knows Best home). Although quickly rebuilt, two additional fires destroyed much of what was original at the Ranch, including New York Street, Modern Street, and half of the Boston townhouses. By mid-1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. studios combined forces to combat the financial troubles each encountered, and merged under the name The Burbank Studios. Thus the ranch became a \\"back-backlot\\", as Warner Bros already had a massive backlot. In 1990, Columbia Pictures moved its production facilities to the historic Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer lot in Culver City. As a result, Warner Bros. gained ownership of the lot and renamed it Warner Ranch. The ranch, now containing additional soundstages, remains in use. Its permanent fountain in the park, built around 1935, was seen in the opening credits of Friends, as well as in Hocus Pocus, in 1776, the musical, in the scene \\"The Lees of Old Virginia\\"; and various TV shows from the 1960s. On April 15, 2019, it was announced that Warner Bros. will sell the property to Worthe Real Estate Group and Stockbridge Real Estate Fund as part of a larger real estate deal to be completed in 2023 which will see the studio get ownership of The Burbank Studios in time to mark its 100th anniversary.

The National Park Service and the District of Columbia signed a memorandum of agreement, on October 24, 1944, for the development of two Fort Drive sections, the first of which was from MacArthur Boulevard to Nebraska Avenue.Barthelmes, Wes.

Tuemmler, whom the National Capital Planning Commission hired to re-evaluate Fort Drive, suggested the right-of-way land should \\"be reconstituted as a recreational facility\\" and, to emphasize that park recreation concept, rename it \\"Fort Park System.\\" It would be \\"a place to get away from cars.\\" Further, he saw it as a \\"ring of recreation and green space\\" around the city, running from Fort Greble Park to Battery Kemble Park, with hiking and bicycle paths.

Guest stars in \\"A Chorus Lie\\" include Matt Damon, Leslie Jordan, Patrick Kerr, and real life members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles. In the episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a rivalry with a fellow named Owen (Matt Damon). They are competing to be the final entrant in a gay men's chorus, and after learning that Owen is straight, Jack tries to \\"in\\" him with help from Grace (Debra Messing). Meanwhile, Karen (Megan Mullally) tries to pass off Will (Eric McCormack) as her lover and not her lawyer when she discovers that she is the object of pity for being single at her own Valentine's Day party. The episode received positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"A Chorus Lie\\" was watched by 25.3 million viewers during its original broadcast, making it the most- watched episode in the history of the show. The episode garnered three Emmy Award nominations and won one in the \\"Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series\\" category. Plot Following his audition, Jack (Sean Hayes) receives a callback and is informed that he has become a finalist for the Manhattan Gay Men's Chorus. At the final auditions for the chorus, Jack is informed by the choral director that he will have a solo, but before he can sing it, Owen (Matt Damon)--originally intended for the solo part--barges in and sings his part. Jack sees Owen as a competition and thinks of a way to get rid of him. He learns that Owen is posing as a gay man, after observing his gaze at a woman. Jack strikes a plan to get Owen to confess he is straight, in which he invites him to \\"rehearse\\" in Will and Grace's apartment. Jack's plan fails miserably, so he enlists the help of Grace (Debra Messing) to \\"in\\" Owen for him. Grace begins flirting with Owen, which ultimately leads to the two making out, prompting Jack to barge in and take a picture. Owen, however, tricks him into pulling the film out of the camera, destroying the proof. At the chorus rehearsal, Jack and Owen begin bickering, which results in Jack revealing to everyone that Owen is straight, to which Owen admits. Despite the revelation, the chorus director (Patrick Kerr) tells Owen he has made it into the chorus. Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) accepts Karen's (Megan Mullally) invitation as her date, due to her husband being in prison, to her annual Valentine's Day party. It is there that Karen passes off Will as her \\"gigolo,\\" after her rival Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan) teases her for being alone. Word gets around that Will is \\"working\\" for Karen for the weekend, which prompts many women asking for Will's \\"services\\". Much to his dismay, Will believes he, a lawyer, is accepting legal clients. Karen finally reveals to Will that she has been telling everyone he is her gigolo. Will becomes outraged at the revelation and leaves. At the party, Beverley makes fun of Karen because she has no partner for the annual spotlight dance. Will, however, returns and dances with Karen. Production Matt Damon guest starred on the episode \\"A Chorus Lie\\" at the request of his friend Sean Hayes who plays Jack on the show. \\"A Chorus Lie\\" was written by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and directed by series producer James Burrows. In January 2002, it was confirmed that actor Matt Damon would guest star on Will & Grace. In the same month, it was announced that NBC would extend \\"A Chorus Lie\\" with four additional minutes to accommodate the network's \\"supersize\\" plan to compete against the CBS reality show Survivor. Jeff Zucker, who at the time was President of NBC Entertainment, said that the show's producers approached NBC about the \\"supersizing\\" idea rather than the other way around; \\"When scripts came in long, [the producers] asked NBC if the network could handle a few extra minutes of footage.\\" Zucker commented that the lengthening of this episode \\"turned out great, and there was no real extra work for anyone. It's a great development that [the producers] know that [NBC is] open to things like this.\\" In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Damon revealed that he was asked to appear on the show by Sean Hayes, a friend of Damon's and the actor that plays Jack on Will & Grace. Damon enjoyed the idea for the episode and agreed to appear on the show. He commented that it was easy for him to get into character because he had previously played a gay character in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 that he would like to come back and guest star.

Jack sings \\"Lyin' and a-cheatin'!\\" to Owen and Owen sings \\"tubby and a-tone-deaf\\" to Jack, a reference to Hal David and Burt Bacharach's 1963 song \\"Wishin' and Hopin'\\". Reception \\"A Chorus Lie\\" brought in 25.3 million viewers, which drew the highest number of viewers in the show's history, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode received a 15.5 rating/23 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode outperformed the 15.2 rating/22 share of CBS' crime drama series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in the 18-49 category. The episode was nominated for three Emmy Awards, Tony Askins won an Emmy for Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Peter Chakos was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, and James Burrows was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. The episode received generally positive reception. According to Darrell Giles of The Courier Mail, several American critics characterized it as the best episode of the show. Jason Steele of the Chicago Tribune's RedEye named it one of his three favorite episodes of Will & Grace. Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk wrote that the episode was hilarious. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted, \\"Damon's spunky appearance ... as a straight guy posing as homosexual and competing with Jack (Sean Hayes) for a spot in a gay men's choir. The show is endlessly imaginative in the ways it explores themes like this with a humor that doesn't betray or belittle its core gay characters.\\" Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News was less positive about the episode, stating that it \\"plays like bad camp. There's nothing realistic about it‚Äî[the characters] seem more like the inhabitants of a lame Saturday Night Live sketch than marginally real characters.\\" He also noted that \\"the extent of the tastelessness of the sex talk and Karen faking a sexual encounter is amazing.\\" Eric McCormack praised Damon's performance. Critics praised Damon's performance in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon \\"did a well-publicized (and very good) gig\\" on the show. Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was \\"incredibly charming\\" and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: \\"If it weren't for some inspired guest stars ‚Äî Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning it up on the dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot ‚Äî this season would be an awfully sad misfire.\\" Wales on Sunday's Wil Marlow called Damon's performance one of the most memorable guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he \\"held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes.\\" Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode \\"flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo\\", but \\"Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he has in his last three films.\\" Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was \\"magnificent\\" in the episode and a \\"great experience\\" for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites \\"A Chorus Lie\\" as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.

The road straddles the River Cam on Magdalene Bridge (built 1823), just south of Magdalene College (hence the name) and just north of St John's College, one of the largest University of Cambridge colleges. Magdalene Bridge or the Great Bridge is on the site of the original bridge that gave 'Cambridge' its name.  History  Magdalene Street used to be the northwestern part of Bridge Street.Magdalene Street, Cambridge: History ‚Äî The Original 'Gateway to Cambridge' . It developed as the northern approach to the original river crossing for entering Cambridge. The first crossing was as a ford and this was built up as causeways by the Romans. Eventually a bridge was built across the Cam, giving Cambridge its name. The hilltop on the northwest bank helped protect the crossing point and ensured that Cambridge became a major inland port. The area around the river became the site for coaching inns, factories, merchants' houses, and warehouses, making use of the river‚Äôs resources and the trade at the crossing point. When the Fens were drained in the 17th century, the river was no longer tidal. With time, the area became increasingly isolated from the main part of the town, which expanded on the other side of the crossing. The isolation and poverty of the area saved it from redevelopment in Victorian times. Even in the 1930s, Magdalene College was too poor to carry out a plan to demolish the street up to the bridge. Subsequently, with the assistance of the College, the street was preserved as one of the oldest in Cambridge. Some of the buildings date from the 16th century and many are now listed. Magdalene Bridge Magdalene Bridge The current cast-iron Magdalene Bridge or \\"Great Bridge\\", dates from 1823 and was designed by Norwich architect Arthur Browne. It is a single span of cast iron surmounted by an iron railing decoration terminating in ashlar piers. It became a Grade II listed building in 1969. It was repaired and strengthened in 1982. There had been a series of wooden bridges on the site from Anglo-Saxon times until James Essex built the first stone bridge in 1754.

After he retired from the Union Army, he finished his medical education and became a professor as well as a president of the Bellevue Hospital Medical College. He received much recognition and fame for his 1882 book, The Science and Art of Midwifery, which quickly became a widely referenced text. Early life Lusk was born and raised in Norwich, Connecticut. Lusk, the fifth generation of his family, was the son of Sylvester Graham Lusk and Elizabeth Freeman Lusk (n√©e Adams). Lusk attended a school run by local Reverend Albert Spooner in preparation for attending Yale College. However, his uncle believed that learning the old version of grammar from Spooner would get Lusk rejected from Yale, and for the winter of 1853‚Äì1854, he attended Anthon's Grammar School at Murray Street, New York City. For the winter of 1854‚Äì1855, Lusk was sent by his mother to Russell's Military School in New Haven, Connecticut to gain physical toughness through gymnastics. In 1855, he enrolled at Yale University in the class of 1859, but left school at the end of his freshman year and studied medicine in Berlin and Heidelberg from 1858 to 1861. Career Captain William Thompson Lusk, Assistant Adjutant-General of the United States Volunteers When the American Civil War broke out, he joined the Second New York Volunteers regiment. He moved through the ranks from Private to Assistant Adjutant General by 1863. Unusually for his time, Lusk did not practice the usual custom of vilifying of the Southern soldiers; his letters actually indicate that he respected the Southerners and spoke of \\"Yankee hordes\\" invading the Southerners' \\"splendid plantations\\". He was promoted to Captain on February 24, 1862 (retroactive to January 19, 1862), and resigned from the United States Volunteers on February 28, 1863, with the intention of going back to New York to take command of a regiment. He was instead appointed Assistant Adjutant-General (with a rank of Captain) and assigned to the staff of Daniel Tyler on June 26, 1863, but resigned just two months later on September 17, 1863, after his troops were sent to Delaware and marked as inactive. Lusk took part in engagements at Blackburn's Ford, First Bull Run, Port Royal, James Island, Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and many other minor battles. He was also a staff officer of Isaac I. Stevens until Stevens' death, and he commanded two companies during the Draft Riots of 1863. =After war= A portrait of William Thompson Lusk After he left the war, he returned to Bellevue Hospital Medical College, where he finished medical school and received his M.D. in 1864. He was the valedictorian of his graduating class. After that he spent one year in Europe studying under various medical professionals, though his New York Times obituary lists this time period as having lasted 4 years. He studied in Edinburgh with James Y. Simpson, in Vienna with Carl Braun, and then in Prague with Seifert. Lusk came back to New York in 1868 to establish his practice. On his return from Europe, Lusk was appointed Professor of Physiology at Long Island College Hospital. In the winter of 1871, on the invitation of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Lusk moved to Boston to lecture on physiology at Harvard Medical School. Lusk was Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Bellevue Hospital Medical College until his death after the previous seatholder, Dr. George T. Elliot, died. At the same time as accepting the professorship, he also became co-editor of The Medical Journal, and held that position from 1871 to 1873, and also became a visiting physician at Bellevue Hospital. Just a few hours later, Harvard offered him a position, which he declined. In 1890, upon the hospital's consolidation with New York University Medical College, Lusk became President of Bellevue Hospital Medical College On October 5, 1886, Lusk joined New York Commandery of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He also joined George Washington Post, No. 103, Dept. New York, Grand Army of the Republic on March 17, 1887. =Medical work= Lusk wrote many medical papers, including his 1876 paper, Nature, Causes and Prevention of Puerperal Fever, which was one of the first papers to come out in support of germ theory. In 1882, he published The Science and Art of Midwifery. The book achieved great sales in America and England, and was translated into many languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, Arabic. It went through four editions, the last of which was practically a rewrite. Lusk was either planning to or in the process of writing a fifth edition when he died. Lusk was also one of the first physicians to successfully perform a Caesarean section. In March 1887, Lusk performed the second Caesarian section in the United States where both the mother and child survived. By some time in 1888, he had already performed three fully successful Caesarian sections within the past year. Lusk was also a recognized authority on gynecology. Personal life On May 4, 1864, after Lusk finished medical school, he was married to Mary Hartwell Chittenden (1840‚Äì1871), the only daughter of U.S. Representative Simeon B. Chittenden. In 1871, his wife died, and he was left with two sons and two daughters. Chittenden Memorial Library at Yale University was built in his wife's honor. Five years after his first wife's death, Lusk remarried to Matilda (n√©e Myer) Thore, with whom he had one daughter. His second wife also predeceased him, with Maltida dying in 1892. Lusk died, very suddenly and unexpectedly, of apoplexy at his residence, 47 East 34th Street in New York City, on June 12, 1897. He was survived by five children; two sons and two daughters from his first marriage and a daughter from his second. According to his obituary in the New York Times, he left a fortune of over three million dollars to his estate. At the time of his death, his eldest son was a Yale professor, and his younger son had just graduated from Yale in 1890. =Awards and honors= Lusk also received many other scientific awards and distinctions.

He died in the defense of Neuss. Biography Cloedt was born in Northelen, near Werl, the fourth of ten sons of Johann Cloedt (c. 1527‚Äì1587) and Margaretha of Westphalia.Johann Christoph Brotze, Sammlung verschiedner Liefl√§ndischer Monumente, Unpublished manuscript, data has been extracted and placed online here . As a young man, he served for several years in Henry III's army in France; by 1585, he served under the Dutch provinces, and in 1586, he was in the force of Adolf von Neuenahr, when he secured the city of Neuss for Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the Calvinist contender for the Electorate of Cologne, during the so-called Cologne War (1583‚Äì1588). Sack of Westphalia In March 1586, accompanied by Martin Schenck von Nydeggen, who had switched to Dutch Service in 1585, Cloedt went to the County of Westphalia at the head of 500 foot and 500 horse. After plundering Vest and Recklinghausen, on 18 March he and Schenck captured Werl through trickery. They loaded a train of wagons with his soldiers and covered them with salt. When the wagons of salt were seen outside the city gates, they were at once admitted, salt being a valued commodity. The \\"salted soldiers\\" then over-powered the guard and captured the town. Some of the defenders escaped to the Werl citadel, which his troops stormed in vain. When they could not capture the citadel, they thoroughly sacked the city. Count Claude Barclay, also known as Haultpenne, collected his force of 4,000 and besieged them in Werl. Schenck and Cloedt were thus attacked from the outside, and from the several hundred guards in the Werl citadel. They loaded their wagons, this time with booty, took 30 magistrates as hostages, and attacked Haultpenne's force, killing about 500 of them, and losing 200 of their own. After fighting their way through Haultpenne's force, Cloedt returned to Neuss and Schenck to Venlo on the Neuss river.L. Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln, Cologne, 1863‚Äì1880.

Defense of Neuss In late July 1586, the Duke of Parma surrounded Neuss with over 8,000 Italian and Spanish troops of the Army of Flanders, and another 2,000 men under the command of Karl von Mansfeld. They grossly outnumbered the defenders of the city, reported variously as 1,600 or 1,800, including largely farmers, citizens, shepherds, clerics, teachers, journeymen, day laborers, and various craftsmen.Leonard Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt Koeln, published 1851, p. 186.Google Books, accessed 26 July 2009, in German, here. Prior to a punishing cannonade, the Duke offered terms, which Cloedt declined. The city, he claimed, had no authority to treat with him, as the city's rights and protection came from the Holy Roman Emperor himself. As the herald left, the journeymen hurled insults at him and the Duke of Parma.Ennen, p. 195. At the assault of the Rhine Gate, over 400 men were killed, and Cloedt was gravely injured. In short order, the fortifications were overrun, and 10,000 Spanish, Italian and Germans entered the city, intent on plunder and whatever else they could find. Cloedt was found in the abbey in the center of the town, and hanged from the window with six of his commanders.Ennen, p. 199. =Aftermath= Eight of the buildings in the city remained standing at the end of the battle. A fire consumed most of the town that had not been damaged in the cannonade. The entire garrison of 1,600 defenders was killed, either in battle or subsequently; over 3,000 civilians were also killed.

Measuring approximately 60 feet by 90 feet and fronting on Waianuenue Avenue, the structure occupies the site of the former Volcano Stables. Three retail spaces on the ground floor each have separate store fronts. The entry stair to the second floor office spaces is located between the first and second retail spaces at the East side. Three separate full basements are located below these spaces. It was the first building built in Hilo to house multiple businesses in the same structure, and the first not constructed for its owner's occupancy. A vault on the ground floor was probably constructed by the first tenant in the space, the Peoples Bank of Hilo when they opened on September 1, 1916. Another notable tenant was the C. Brewer & Co., which had purchased the Pepeekeo Sugar Company in 1904. The Hilo Masonic Hall was another of the few fireproof buildings built just a few years earlier and a block away, in 1910. The only earlier commercial building that survives in Hilo is the S. Hata Building, built in 1912 by the brother of a board member of the Peoples Bank. The Hilo Federal Building was also built in this part of Hilo in 1915. In 1922 the first bank disaster in Hawaii caused the Peoples Bank to shut down. The \\"big five\\" corporations controlled by descendants of early American missionaries, might have been a factor in its demise. Although known for the sugar industry, major banks were also controlled by the same families. These include the Bishop Bank which opened in Hilo in 1910 (now First Hawaiian Bank), and First Bank of Hilo which opened in 1906 (now part of Bank of Hawaii). In 1929 the building was purchased by C. Brewer for their subsidiary Hilo Terminal and Transportation Company there until 1953 when they moved to the Hilo Pier and the parent company moved its Hilo corporate offices into the building. During this period the Hilo Chamber of Commerce used the second floor of the building. In 1961, upon completion of the C. Brewer Building in Honolulu as corporate offices, C. Brewer sold the building to Irving Melnick, a clothing manufacturer, who owned the structure until his death, when it passed to the living Melnick Trust. Coyne Mattress Company purchased the property in 1992, the owners as of 2009. The building was listed as state historic site 10-35-7507 on September 28, 1992,Historic Places in Hawaii County on official state web site and added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on January 7, 1993 as site 92001748.

Career summary Gareth John Williams was born in Cardiff, Wales on 23 April 1953. He was educated at Greenshaw High School in Sutton, Surrey. Before concentrating full-time on his studies for his A-level tests, he spent a period of time in Newfoundland, Canada. By the mid-1970s he was working in a London record shop. An avid record collector, Williams made himself known to drummer Charles Hayward and guitarist Charles Bullen. This eventually led to the formation of the band This Heat where Williams proved to be an excellent lyricist and musician, and a maniacal but intuitive performer on bass guitar and keyboards. =This Heat= The band itself anticipated a punk style whereby their sometimes excessive experimentalism steered them away from more mainstream success, but regardless of this they built up a solid base of passionate admirers. They shunned musical technique in favor of what they called \\"accidents.\\" They played their first concert in Feb 1976, only days after their formation. During the early days improvisation dominated their performances, but gradually they encompassed both abstract and formal stylings in their music, where trance-like soundscapes merged into violent yet danceable anthems with cascades of noise punctuated by abrupt silence. In 1977 John Peel featured them on his BBC Radio 1 show. This Heat's performance proved an intoxicating hybrid of music played exceptionally noisily, usually in complete darkness, with a proto-punk attitude. Their first album, titled This Heat (1979), was two years in the making. The maxi-single Health and Efficiency (1980) permitted Williams to demonstrate his now considerable skill. Their second album Deceit (1981) was to follow, but by then Williams had left the band. =Going to India= After leaving the band Williams went on to study Kathakali dance drama in Kerala in southern India. He also was to co-author the first Rough Guide to India whilst studying Indian religion and music at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. =Flaming Tunes= After returning from India, Williams in 1985 created Flaming Tunes with friend Mary Currie. The music was short, with raw and sorrowful songs, released in a hand-coloured cassette package. It was never intended as a \\"demo tape for The Heat\\" as a subsequent bootleg CD quoted, bringing much distress to Williams. The album was re-mastered and placed on CD in a total package in 2009. =Mind the Gap= During the 1990s Williams briefly joined his This Heat bandmate Charles Hayward in the avant-rock band Mind the Gap. He also was to feature in Hayward's monthly \\"Accidents & Emergencies\\" series at the Deptford Albany Empire. Williams went on to be a promoter, and as a DJ and he recorded zealously at home with the singer Viv Corringham and also with This Heat's original sound engineer Martin Harrison. =Death= Williams had been ill for a few years but died of cancer on 24 December 2001, aged 48. Williams was survived by his partner, Nick Goodall, who died in 2007. Nick Goodall took the photograph on the cover of the This Heat album Deceit. =Legacy and re-release of some albums= Many musicians worldwide recognize This Heat as an influence to their music, including The The's Matt Johnson and Steve Parry of Hwyl Nofio. Compact discs were to revive interest in This Heat with the re-release of the albums along with the archival Out of Cold Storage 6-CD box set, which includes Made Available/John Peel Sessions, Repeat, Deceit, This Heat Live 80/81, Health and Efficiency and This Heat.

Nishimura has been described as \\"a legendary director and effects artist\\" and \\"the Tom Savini of Japan\\" with \\"talent to burn\\". Life and career Nishimura, born on April 1, 1967, had been interested in film from childhood but a major influence on his career was a painting by Salvador Dal√≠ with distorted human bodies that he saw when in elementary school. He majored in law in college. Nishimura has said that he doesn't watch much television or movies but reads horror magazines and gets much of his inspiration from his dreams. He started making films while in junior high school by teaching himself about filming, lighting, special effects and modeling. In 1995 with a small crew he made the independently produced movie Anatomia Extinction (Genkai jink≈ç keis≈´). Nishimura wrote the screenplay, directed, and did the special effects. The film was shown at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1995 where it won a Special Jury Award. The film would later form the basis for Tokyo Gore Police. For several years, Nishimura did special effects and special makeup effects for a number of movies including the controversial thriller from Sion Sono, Suicide Club, and Noboru Iguchi's 2003 comedy- romance-horror . In 2005, he did the special effects for the science fiction horror film directed by Y≈´dai Yamaguchi and Jun'ichi Yamamoto. One review of the film says \\"the makeup and special effects that the film is sold on are solid. Produced on a very meager budget, the make-up appliances look great.\\" Nishimura worked with Noboru Iguchi again in 2008 when he was in charge of special effects and makeup effects for the low-budget action and gore film The Machine Girl. When he finished The Machine Girl, Media Blasters, the USA distributors of the DVD, asked if he wanted to do another movie. He decided to do a re-make of his earlier short film Anatomia Extinction from 1995 and created the science fiction horror movie Tokyo Gore Police. Nishimura co-wrote the screenplay, directed the movie, did the special make-up effects and modeling, and had a small cameo role as well. Nishimura said that one difference was that as director, he could no longer take naps during breaks as he could when he was only concerned with special effects. In 2009, he did the makeup effects on Samurai Princess (also called Samurai Princess: Devil Princess) for director Kengo Kaji, and also on director K≈çsuke Suzuki's Stop the Bitch Campaign. For the 2009 production of , Nishimura teamed with Naoyuki Tomomatsu as co-director and with fight choreographer Taku Sakaguchi who had previously worked with Nishimura on Tokyo Gore Police and Meatball Machine. The movie had its world premier at the New York Asian Film Festival on June 26 and opened in Japan August 15, 2009. Nishimura started his own effects company based in Tokyo, Nishimura Eizo Co., Ltd. Partnering with visual effects company Studio Buckhorn and Studio HigeMigane in 2010, it became part of Pabaan: The Image Production Group. In 2010, Nishimura co-directed Mutant Girls Squad with Noboru Iguchi and Tak Sakaguchi, as well as directing the action/horror film Helldriver, his first solo directing duty since \\"Tokyo Gore Police.\\" The same year, he created the special effects for Horny House of Horror, starring AV starlets Asami, Mint Suzuki, and Saori Hara. In 2011, Nishimura directed the \\"Killer\\" music video for Osaka rock band . Nishimura directed the music video for Ena Fujita's June 2018 single \\"Ienai Koto wa Uta no Naka\\".

It has been translated into 18 languages and spent more than a year on The New York Times, The Globe and Mail, and other bestseller lists, and sold more than one million copies.Nielsen Bookscan Overview The aim of This Is Your Brain on Music was to make recent findings in neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson.Huron, D. (2006). \\"Exploring How Music Works Its Wonders\\". Cerebrum. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics.Sullivan, J. (2006, August 20). \\"He's rocking the world of neuroscience\\". The Boston Globe. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. This Is Your Brain on Music describes the components of music, such as timbre, rhythm, pitch, and harmonyBortz, F. (2006, September 3). \\"The science of music, the purpose of music\\".

The Guardian, Features & Review p. 9. while also making these topics accessible to nonexpert readers by avoiding the use of scientific jargon. One particular focus of the book is on cognitive models of categorization and expectation, and how music exploits these cognitive processes. This Is Your Brain on Music was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award in 2006-2007 for best in the Science and Engineering category, and a Quill Award for best debut author of 2006-2007.

They are also referred to as carpoids. Description The Homalozoa lacked the typical pentamer body form of other echinoderms, but all were sessile animals. Instead all Homalozoans were markedly asymmetric, and were extremely variable in forms The body (theca) was covered with calcite plates with a number of openings. Their form is in some cases so unusual that it is unclear which openings are to be considered as mouth and anus. Many of them were stalked, similar to sea lilies (crinoids), but often their bodies were bent over, so that the mouth and anus projected forwards rather than upwards. Some forms, especially stylophorans, rested flat on the sea floor. In some forms the single ray (brachiole or aulacophore) possessed an ambulacral groove. It has been claimed that some forms possessed gills and gill slits. Taxonomy Homalozoans were traditionally considered to be stem-group echinoderms,  pages 401-404 but had also been considered to lie in the stem lineage of the chordates (calcichordates). However, it is now generally accepted that homalozoans were echinoderms because their calcite skeleton was composed of the typical stereom crystalline structure. They include the unusual stylophorans (mitrates and cornutes), Homoiostelea (solutes), the Homostelea (cinctans), and the Ctenocystoidea (ctenoid-bearing homalozoans). They have recently been recognised as a polyphyletic group. The stylophorans are now classified as a clade of the Crinozoa, whereas the other three are classified as clades of the Blastozoa. =Solutes= Unlike many other types of echinoderm, solute homalozoans lack radial symmetry (such as the five limbs of a starfish).A. B. Smith Deuterostome phylogeny and the interpretation of problematic fossil echinoderms, page 543-544 in Thomas Heinzeller, James H. Nebelsick Echinoderms: M√ºnchen, CRC Press, 2004 , Solutes are the sole order of the class Homoiostelea. Solute fossils have an irregularly shaped flattened body covered in calcite plates, and are up to about 10 cm long. The body has two appendages, interpreted as a \\"feeding arm\\" at one end, bearing tube feet at its end, and a \\"stele\\" at the other, which may have been used by the animal to propel itself along the sea floor.Henry Gee Before the backbone: views on the origin of the vertebrates, Springer, 1996 page 204 See also *Blastozoa **Cystoidea * References Paleozoic echinoderms Animal subphyla ","title":"Homalozoa"},{"id":"23755931","text":"Yuri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov (; born 2 August 1958) is a Russian professional football official and a former player.

It is an open organization with members from the Colombian government, private sector and any individuals interested in the compliance of standards in Colombia. Icontec works closely with other international organizations for standardization such as ANSI and DIN. Icontec accredits organizations, companies and individuals that engage in the manufacturing or development of products and industrial processes. Icontec is a member of the International Organization for Standardization ISO and is an active partner in regional standards organizations such as COPANT and IEC. Icontec is present in different countries of the Americas and the Caribbean. Its headquarters are in Bogota, Colombia. History Icontec was founded on May 10, 1963 under the leadership of Colombian engineer Javier Henao and 17 entrepreneurs who were seeking to create an organization dedicated to the creation of standards and the overseeing of existing ones that had not been implemented in Colombia. Since then, the institute has grown as a national authority in the management of standards. A seal with the Icontec logo has been a common signature of quality and compliance of international standards in many products in the Colombian market and is often featured in TV ads. By decree 767 of 1964 and decree 2416 of 1971, Icontec is the advisor for the Colombian government in the international trade sector and it is the one that oversees and seeks the improvement of the guidelines in the relationship vendor-customer. Icontec's last major certification by the Colombian government was ratified in 1993 under decree 2269. ICONTEC is the national standards body, and is an active member of the most important international and regional standards bodies. This allows the Institute to participate in the definition and development of regional and international standards in order to be in the vanguard of information and technology. ICONTEC is a certification body having world coverage through IQNet, the international certification network, through which they offer certification services around the world, provided by 10.000 auditors qualified in all economic sectors. Standardization ICONTEC, as the national standardizations body, coordinates the preparation of technical guides and standards and other normative documents applicable in Colombia. To this purpose, there are approximately 250 standardization committees in which industry, consumers, academy and general interests participate, in order to establish the fundamental requirements related to quality, safety, security, health care and environment, for products, services, processes and systems. Conformity assessment Since 2003 Icontec has worked closely with different economic sectors as a certifier of process administration and it grants the certification of quality in Colombia. Education and development programs Through its Education and Development Department, ICONTEC has designed and offers diverse training programs specially addressed to manufacture and service companies, and to other specific sectors which allow entrepreneurs and their personnel to acquire and apply management systems concepts and methods. The Institute has programs in the topics of quality, environmental, occupational health and safety management systems, and training to auditors, leading to maintenance and improvement of quality systems. Specific programs for health care, education, hotels and tourism, financial, good agricultural practices sectors, travel agencies, micro-businesses, quality management in food sector, public Management, integral risk administration in companies, and an administrative program for organizational improvement, have already been designed and are currently offered. ICONTEC and the Climate Change Challenge ICONTEC has designed and developed the technical infrastructure necessary to offer services related to climate change organizational initiatives. The Institute's Climate Change Services: The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), created in the framework of the Kyoto protocol, allows that developing countries that do not have commitments of greenhouse gas reduction develop projects of reduction or capture of GHG emissions. These reductions can be certified and sold to those countries that have reduction commitments. In order to obtain the certification of the reductions, it is required that the project has been validated and verified to demonstrate that reductions are reached in the declared periods ICONTEC is the first Latin American entity accredited by the CDM Executive Board as a Designated Operational Entity for the validation and verification of projects in the following sectoral scopes: * Energy industries (renewable / non-renewable sources) * Energy distribution * Energy demand * Manufacturing industries * Chemical industry * Mining/mineral production * Waste handling and disposal * Afforestation and reforestation * Agriculture Health care accreditation This program is not accredited by the International Society for Quality in Health Care, ISQua. Calibration of measurement equipment ICONTEC offers calibration of measurement equipment and instruments, in order to support industry development and satisfy the increasing demand in the field of metrology in the areas of dimensional metrology, pressure, mass and scales, temperature, and volumetry. International recognition Through the DAR/TGA, and ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) accreditations, the quality and environmental management certificates granted by ICONTEC are recognized by the 52 accreditation bodies around the world who have signed the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) for achieving international acceptance of certificates and eliminating technical barriers to trade.

With the enlargement of the spectrum of pupils, a curriculum based on the model of the so-called higher school for daughters (dt. H√∂here T√∂chterschule) was introduced in 1894. After the expulsion of the German sisters in the First World War, they returned in 1922 to Alexandria to work again. Already in 1911, a commercial class was launched where the students learned accounts, shorthand and typewriting, and deepened their skills in foreign languages. In 1924, the first German teacher, appointed by the Foreign Office, undertook their service as teachers at the school. Continuously, the number of German teachers in parallel with the ever growing number of pupils increased. After World War II, in 1946, Arabic became an official language taught at school. The first German secondary school leaving examination after grade 10 was conducted in 1958. In 1964, the first candidates registered for the Egyptian Thanaweya Amma school-leaving examination.

It deals primarily with the social effects of drastic age rejuvenation technology and first contact theory. In 2008 the novel was nominated for a Hugo Award and a Campbell Award. Plot summary The novel focuses around Don Halifax and his wife of sixty years, Sarah, an astronomer who translated the first transmission sent from an extraterrestrial source to Earth 38 years prior to the opening of the story. Sarah, now 87, is tasked to decode the second message sent from the unknown alien race - if she can live long enough to do so. A wealthy industrial billionaire, Cody McGavin, offers to put up billions of dollars to perform a \\"rollback\\" on not only Sarah, but her husband of 60 years, Don. This process, which reverts a person's body to a much younger state, is successfully performed on Don, but fails to work with Sarah. This leaves Sarah gradually creeping toward death while Don's life begins anew. Much of the story focuses on Don as he discovers the advantages and disadvantages of being young again, with periodic flashbacks to when Sarah translated the first alien message.

From 1866 it served additionally as the Navy Department of the North German Confederation. The Reichsflotte 1849 In June, 1848 the Frankfurt National Assembly created the first Navy Department with businessman Arnold Duckwitz as Minister for Navy Affairs (Minister f√ºr Marineangelegenheiten). After the closure of the Frankfurt National Assembly in May 1849, Austrian Lieutenant Fieldmarshal August von Jochmus became Navy Minister of the revived German Confederation. With the end of the Provisional Central Power (Provisorische Zentralgewalt) of the Frankfurt National Assembly in December 1849, the first Naval Department dissolved and authority in naval matters again came under the sovereignty of individual members of the German Confederation. A Royal Naval Division (K√∂nigliche Marine-Abteilung ) was established in Berlin, as a department of the Prussian Minister of War, with Lieutenant Colonel von Wangenheim Bogun as head in the years 1848-1853. He administered the Prussian Navy under the Naval High Command (Oberkommando der Marine). Then, on 14 November 1853 by a Prussian royal cabinet order (K√∂nig Kabinettsordre) the Naval Division was combined into an Admiralty Council (Admiralit√§t), which would provide united command and administrative authority. From 1859 to 1860 Admiral Jan Schr√∂der was chief of the Prussian Navy administration (Marineverwaltung). In 1861 the Prussian government created a new Navy Department (Marineministerium). After Wilhelm I became King of Prussia the Admiralty of the Prussian Navy was on 16 April 1861 dissolved by cabinet order. The Naval High Command under Prince Adalbert of Prussia became independently and directly subordinate to the king. After the retirement of Admiral Jan Schr√∂de the administration of the navy was under the new Navy Department (Marineministerium), which was under Prussian War Minister Albrecht von Roon until 1873. The Admiralty Council (Admiralit√§tsrat) was to co-ordinate naval affairs of the Navy Department and the Naval High Command, but could only make proposals. The Navy Department was responsible for the Danzig (today Gdansk) shipyard, the depots in Geestem√ºnde (today Bremerhaven), Kiel and Stralsund, the admiralty commissary (Admiralit√§tskommissariat) in Oldenburg and the base at Jade Bight (today Wilhelmshaven). The Naval High Command was responsible for the fleet. This dual organization did not work well. There was much unfruitful work and friction between the two organizations. A possibility for change arose with the outbreak the Franco- Prussian War in 1870 when Prince Adalbert was transferred to army field command. By cabinet order the tasks of the Naval High Command were on 29 June 1870 transferred to the Navy Department. Next, departments for technical and general administrative affairs was formed. The existing division of powers was abolished and a central authority created. The departmental friction disappeared almost completely. Due to the great increase in the duties of the Prussian War Minister, Wilhelm I on 30 November 1871 moved the Navy Department from the War Ministry to a newly created admiralty, which in a few months would become the German Imperial Admiralty.

The homeland is considered to be the Altai Mountains. These findings have suggested a common point of cultural origin, possession of advanced metal working technology, and unexplained rapid migration. The buried were nomadic warriors and metal-workers, traveling on horseback or two-wheeled chariots. The name derives from the Seima (Sejma) cemetery at the confluence of the Oka River and Volga River, first excavated around 1914, and the Turbino cemetery in Perm, first excavated in 1924.A Dictionary of Archaeology, edited by Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson, page 517 Origin ST weapons contain tin bronze ore originating from the Altai Mountains region (central Mongolia and southern Siberia), with further ST discoveries pointing more specifically to the southeastern portions of the Altai and Xinjiang, China. These sites have been identified with the origin of the mysterious ST culture.  Artifacts and weapons  The bronzes found were technologically advanced for the time, including lost wax casting, and showed high degree of artist input in their design. Horses were the most common shapes for the hilts of blades. Weapons such as spearheads with hooks, single-bladed knives and socketed axes with geometric designs traveled west and east from Xinjiang.  Dispersal  The culture spread from these mountains to the west and to the east. These cultures are noted for being nomadic forest and steppe societies with metal working, sometimes without having first developed agricultural methods. The development of this metalworking ability appears to have occurred quite quickly. Although they were the precursor to the much later Mongol invasions, these groups were not yet strong enough to attack the important social sites of the Bronze Age. ST bronzes have been discovered as far west as the Baltic Sea and the Borodino treasure in Moldavia. Theories= Transmission into Southeast Asia = It has been conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BC and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China, and southward into Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Thailand) across a frontier of some 4,000 miles. Supposedly this migration took place in just five to six generations and enabled people from Finland in the west to Thailand in the east employing the same metal working technology and in some areas horse breeding and riding. However, further excavations and research in Ban Chiang and Ban Non Wat (both Thailand) argue the idea that Seima-Turbino brought metal workings into southeast Asia is based on inaccurate and unreliable radiocarbon dating at the site of Ban Chiang. It is now agreed by virtually every specialist in Southeast Asian prehistory, that the Bronze Age of Southeast Asia occurred too late to be related to ST, and the cast bronzes are quite different. = Uralic urheimat = The same authors conjectured that the same migrations spread the Uralic languages across Europe and Asia. The existence of uralic aboriginal Samoyedic and Ob-Ugrian groups like the Nenets, the Mansi people and the Khanty, anchor the Uralic languages in an ancient language group originating in Central Asia. These languages did not experience any real documentation, until Finnish native linguist Matthias Castr√©n encountered them on his journeys in the 1840s. Whether or not these languages belong to the Altaic languages is still unclear, but plenty of evidence suggest a connection with the Korean language. http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110110000378 https://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/Korean3.html http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/85842/1/17.%202241262.pdf Notable is the similarity between the range of Haplogroup N3a3‚Äô6, especially in the western part of Eurasia and the distribution of the Seima-Turbino trans- cultural phenomenon during the interval of 4.2‚Äì3.7 kya.E.

He was an All-Big Ten halfback who led the conference in scoring in 1933. In his junior and senior seasons at Michigan, he led the team to two consecutive undefeated seasons and national championships. While playing football at Michigan, Everhardus was a teammate and fraternity brother of future U.S. President Gerald Ford. Biography Everhardus was a native of Kalamazoo, Michigan where he attended Kalamazoo Central High School. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1930 and was a three-year starter at halfback for the Wolverines' football teams. He became known as the \\"Flying Dutchman\\" while playing for Michigan. During his junior and senior years, the Wolverines football teams won back-to-back national championships with a two- year record of 15-0-1, outscoring opponents by a combined total of 254-31\\\\. In 1933, Everhardus was the leading scorer in the Big Ten Conference with 64 points on eight touchdowns and ten point after touchdown kicks. He scored three touchdowns and three extra points in a 1933 game against Cornell, including a 52-yard touchdown run and an 85-yard kickoff return to open the second half. Everhardus contributed to the Wolverines' second straight undefeated season as much with his kicking as with his running. In a 10-6 win over Iowa in 1933, Everhardus had a 47-yard run and kicked for a field goal and extra-point. After the Iowa game, the Associated Press reported: > \\"Herman Everhardus, the flying Dutchman from Kalamazoo, unleashed a toe as > true as a navy siege gun and Bill Renner displayed uncanny passing aim today > as Michigan's powerful football team, playing in snow and ice, swept toward > a fourth consecutive Big Ten championship with a hard-earned victory over > Iowa.\\" Everhardus with fraternity brother Gerald Ford, 1932 While playing for Michigan, Everhardus was a teammate and fraternity brother of future U.S. President Gerald Ford. When Ford tried out for the freshman football team, he needed a job to help pay his expenses. Everhardus arranged to get Ford a job waiting tables at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house, where Ford later became a fraternity brother of Everhardus. At the end of the 1933 season, Everhardus was selected as a first-team back on the All-Big Ten teams selected by the United Press and the Newspaper Editors Association (NEA). He was also selected as a second-team All-American by the NEA and the International News Service. In announcing the 1933 All-Big Ten team, the United Press wrote: \\"Everhardus was Michigan's foremost back, with his running and stellar defensive work. He kicked three field goals in crucial games and won the Illinois game with his extra point after touchdown, 7-6.\\" The NEA wrote the following in naming Everhardus as its first-team All-Big Ten fullback: > \\"The fullback post is well filled by Herman Everhardus, Michigan. Although > playing a halfback post, the flying Dutchman is a typical fullback. He > showed he could crash tackles and the center of the line equally as well as > he could run the ends or snare a pass. Defensively, he was a Gibraltar.\\" Everhardus was also selected to play in both of the major post-season all-star games. On January 1, 1934, Everhardus and Michigan teammate Chuck Bernard played for the East team in the annual East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco. Although the East team lost, Everhardus was credited with \\"a phenomenal 70-yard punt ... which traveled 50 yards from the line in the air.\\" And in August 1934, Everhardus was selected as a member of the College All-American team to play the annual game against the NFL champions at Soldier Field in Chicago. The College All-Americans played the NFL champion Chicago Bears to a scoreless tie, and the Associated Press cited Everhardus as one of three college stars who \\"stood out on the floodlighted field.\\" In addition to his performance in the backfield, Everhardus gained attention for a 60-yard kick that pinned the Bears deep in their own territory late in the game. After graduating from Michigan, Everhardus signed a contract to play professional football for the Detroit Lions, but obtained a release from the contract so that he could accept a position as an assistant football coach at Penn State.

History The story of the Seabird Indian Band began over 130 years ago in June 1879 with Gilbert Malcolm Sproat (19 April 1834 ‚Äì 4 June 1913), a representative of the Indian Reserve Commission, would consult with First Nations people and later allocate the island known then as Skow-a- kull (correct spelling Sq'√©wqel) as a reserve to be held in-common by the people from Popkum, Skw'√°tits, Ohamil, Ska-wah-look, Hope, Union Bar and Yale because the land they currently resided on could not sustain crops, and the land on Seabird Island would provide rich soil and provide a place for First Nations families to live their lives on.Seabird Island Band website Seabird Island speaks a mix of Halq'em√©ylem and Thompson language. The Halq'em√©ylem name for the Seabird Island Band, Sq'√©wqel, is translated to \\"Turn in the River\\", the English name Seabird Island would be taken from the June 1858 groundings of a transport paddle-wheeler, the SS Sea Bird, on an island bar in the Fraser River across from Seabird Island.

Seabird Island First Nations Festival The Seabird Island First Nations Festival was first established in May 1969 by Grand Chief Archie Charles and his wife Mary Charles. Today, the Seabird Island First Nations Festival is a celebration of First Nations diversity, culture, growth and First Nations sport talent. Each year the Seabird Island First Nations Festival hosts 9,000 visitors, entertainers, players, War Canoe-pullers, volunteers and sponsors. The tournaments include: Ball Hockey, Soccer, War Canoe racing and Slahal. The Seabird Island First Nations Festival occurs the last full weekend in May each year. Technology In 2007, the Seabird Island Band, in partnership with Siemens and BelAir Networks launched a wireless mesh network throughout the Seabird Island Band community. Seabird Island Band would become the first First Nations community in Canada to achieve this feat. The wireless mesh network would be used to offer Seabird Island Band with ubiquitous, high-speed broadband wireless access supporting residential, educational and business communication requirements. Prior to 2007, most Seabird Island Band community members could only access dial-up internet ‚Äì only the community core had access to high-speed internet. Sustainable Housing In 2004, Seabird Island Band began an innovative, cutting edge, sustainable community housing that uses renewable technologies, and includes first-in-the-world features. Sustainable Housing project provided band members with improved quality, energy efficient housing by integrating renewable energy sources, and it is affordable. Plus, it has other remarkable features, such as reduced maintenance and lower heating and electricity cost, because of the advanced technology. This unique development is part of the Seabird Island Band's \\"Sustainable Community Plan\\". The idea behind sustainable community planning is to use land and design neighbourhoods in a way that reduces costs and minimizes environmental impacts, while creating a livable community - both now and well into the future.

Torcida Split is a HNK Hajduk Split supporters' group in Croatia with the branches in other countries, mostly, (but not exclusively) among Croat communities. Founded on 28 October 1950, Torcida is the oldest supporters group in Europe. They are one of the major football fan groups in Croatia and the one of the largest in Southeast Europe. Their mascot is a donkey, but common symbol of Torcida is caricature of legendary Hajduk supporter ≈Ωan Ojdaniƒá. History The Torcida was founded in 1950 by a group of sailors from Korƒçula who had witnessed the passion of the crowd at the World Cup Final in Brazil. Hajduk Split supporters, Torcida, were formed on 28 October 1950 by a group of students in Zagreb, namely Ante Doriƒá, Ante Ivani≈°eviƒá and Vjenceslav ≈Ωuvela, and are considered the oldest organized supporters group in Europe. They took their name from the Brazilian fan group they idolized, which comes from the Portuguese 'torcer' which means 'to cheer on'. \\"Hajduk lives forever\\" is their slogan. The name \\"Torcida\\" returned to public use in 1980, when the new generation of fans of Hajduk wanted, by the old name and tradition, to celebrate and support the club and its heritage. Since then, the fans assemble in the north stand of the new stadium in Poljud. Alliances They are on very good terms with another ultra group from Dalmatia, Tornado Zadar. They are on good terms with the biggest ultra group of Portuguese club Benfica, No Name Boys (NN). This friendship started during the Croatian war, when NN showed a message \\"Freedom for Croatia\\", and some time later, Benfica played in Croatia against Hajduk and after the game a car accident occurred in M√©rida, Spain, where 3 members of NN lost their lives (including the leader of NN, Gullit). Furthermore, the group has a good relationship with the fans of Gornik Zabrze, a Polish football club, who also call themselves Torcida. The two groups have visited each other at their respective stadiums on multiple occasions, and this friendship reached its peak in February 2018 when Gornik Zabrze invited Hajduk Split for a friendly match on March 24, which would celebrate Gornik's 70th anniversary. Torcida is also on good terms with Magic Fans of Saint Etienne.

He participated in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, as a member of the Free Officers Movement, which overthrew the monarchy then under the rule of King Farouk. Mohieddine held important political and media roles throughout Gamal Abdel Nasser's presidency, although the two had a number of falling outs as well. His political influence diminished during the early part of Anwar Sadat's presidency until he founded the leftist political party National Progressive Union Party (Tagammu) in 1976. Under Mohieddine's leadership, Tagammu became a significant opposition force during Hosni Mubarak's rule. Early life Mohieddine was born in Kafr Shukr (Qalyubia) Lower Egypt in 1922 to a well-off family that owned sizeable landholdings in the Nile Delta area. He graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1940 and served as a cavalry officer. In 1942, he befriended Gamal Abdel Nasser at a military college. In 1943‚Äì44, he joined the Free Officers Movement, becoming one of the ten original members. In 1951, he received a bachelor's degree in commerce from the University of Cairo (then known as Fuad University). He adopted Marxism but, although he was associated with HADETO, an Egyptian Communist movement, Mohieddine most likely did not actually join it.; however, he did have ties with the Communist-oriented Democratic Movement for National Liberation. Political life under Nasser By the spring of 1952, the Free Officers devised an operational command to depose King Farouk, with Mohieddine responsible for the armored corps. On July 23, he commanded his armed units through Cairo and the coup was successfully undertaken. He and Nasser wrote the first proclamation of the \\"revolution\\" on Cairo Radio. Mohieddine attended the ceremonious departure of the king and, according to him, Farouk stated to the attending officers that he \\"thought of doing the same thing they were doing.\\" Mohieddin addressing members of the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council, 1954 After Muhammad Naguib was made president, Mohieddine became a part of the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). When army officers loyal to Nasser kidnapped Naguib in February 1954, Mohieddine unexpectedly ordered Naguib be released immediately and he was. He explained the reason he took that action was because he felt Nasser and the Free Officers could not rule Egypt without Naguib. Nasser, who was prime minister, responded to his move by dismissing all the officers loyal to him. At the advice of his cousin and fellow RCC member, Zakaria Mohieddine, Khaled dropped out of sight for a few days after the protest, returning to Cairo on March 5. The RCC members, including Mohieddine, agreed that he be sent to Europe as part of trade mission. According to close sources, his parting with Nasser was sober but not devoid of \\"shared sorrow\\". The Egyptian regime designated him as a representative of the RCC abroad, leaving the impression that his informal exile was temporary. With Nasser officially assuming the presidency and the end of the Suez Crisis in 1956, Mohieddine returned to Egypt and took a leading role in the government, being put in charge of the evening Al Messa' newspaper which he founded. He was also the publisher of the daily. A year later he served in the central committee of the National Union and was elected a member of the National Assembly. He was one of four people appointed by Nasser to set up the first conference of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization during 1957‚Äì58. Mohieddine later chaired the Egyptian Peace Council and henceforth became a member of the World Peace Council's presidential council in 1958. On March 8, 1959, an Arab nationalist rebellion broke out in Mosul, Iraq with the intent of deposing the anti-Nasser and pro- Communist president Abdel Karim Qasim. When it was put down, Nasser's anti- Communism feelings apparently deepened and he accused Mohieddine of supporting Qasim. Nasser subsequently unceremoniously fired him and twelve other editors from Al Messa on March 13. Mohieddine was soon arrested and remained incarcerated until the end of 1960. He became board chairman of Akhbar al-Yawm in 1964. In April 1965, after Nasser began taking a more pro-Soviet stance on domestic affairs, Mohieddine was appointed secretary of the Arab Socialist Union's (ASU) Press Committee. Around this time he also chaired the Aswan High Dam committee and was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1970. Later life Because of his politics, Mohieddine was imprisoned for two months in the 1971 Corrective Revolution launched by Anwar el-Sadat who became president after Nasser's death the year before. Within the ASU, he soon took leadership of the leftist platform, that later evolved into the National Progressive Union Party (also referred to as \\"Taggamu\\") in 1976 and was one of its three delegates elected to the People's Assembly that same year. He was suspected by government authorities of inciting the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. In 1978, he founded and edited his party's press organ, al-Ahaly. The next year he was charged with activities \\"against the state\\" but was not tried. Because he was a former RCC member, Mohieddine was spared when Sadat jailed other dissidents in 1981. He continued to practice politics and was considered a part of the \\"loyal opposition\\" to president Hosni Mubarak. In 1990, he won a parliamentary seat after three defeats. His nephew, Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohieddin, announced he had abandoned plans to stand for election in the Kafr el-Shukr electoral district in October 2005, standing aside in favor of Khaled Mohieddin, who failed to win election.Khattab, Azza.

In 2004, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other locations, under the name \\"Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range\\". According to a legend, it was founded by the priest Ragy≈ç Sh≈çnin, a monk from India. The temple was purposely built near Nachi Falls, where it may have previously been a site of nature worship. Seiganto-ji is part of the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex, and as such can be considered one of the few jing≈´-ji (shrine temples, see article Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç) still in existence after the forcible separation of Shinto and Buddhism operated by the Japanese government during the Meiji restoration.For details of the subject of shrine temples, see the article Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç. It is Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage's No.1 (first stop) and an Important Cultural Properties of Japan.  History  During the reign of Emperor Nintoku (313 ‚Äì 399), according to temple legend, Ragy≈ç Sh≈çnin, a monk from India, came here following the river in search of a suitable place in which to practice his austerities and found Nachi waterfall. After practicing shugy≈ç, Kannon appeared to him at the base of the waterfall and so he built a hermitage dedicated to Kannon in this place. During the reign of Empress Suiko (592 ‚Äì 628), Sh≈çbutsu Sh≈çnin came here from Yamato in order to undergo austerity practices. At that time he carved a 4 meter high image of Nyoirin Kannon from a single piece of camellia tree. The Hond≈ç (main temple) was built to enshrine this image which became the focus of the Nachi Kannon cult and is the image that is enshrined in the present Nyorind≈ç. In 988 Emperor Kazan (Ëä±Â±±Â§©Áöá) (968-1008) visited the Kumano area on his first pilgrimage and, being deeply moved by the image of Kannon, he declared this Temple One of the Saigoku Kannon pilgrimage. It is said that Emperor Kazan completed 1000 days of severe spiritual training under the waterfall, after which he had a vision of Kannon in the form of the kami Kumano Gongen. The kami instructed the emperor to find the priest Butsugan of Hasedera (Temple 8 of the pilgrimage), who helped the emperor to remap out the current pilgrimage route. Emperor Kazan wrote all the goeika poems that are still used throughout the pilgrimage as sacred hymns. It became a custom in later years for other emperors who went on this pilgrimage to also compose poems of their own for each of the sacred sites. Because Emperor Gotoba (1180-1239; r. 1183-1198) made the pilgrimage to Kumano 31 times and his successor Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127 ‚Äì 1192; reigned 1155 ‚Äì 1158) made it 34 times, the pilgrimage became popular during this era. However, members of court had been coming here for about 400 years prior to this, believing it was near to Kannon‚Äôs paradise island located to the south of Japan called Fudaraku (Potala in Sanskrit). The temple buildings, like many of the temples on the pilgrimage route, were burned to the ground by Oda Nobunaga during the civil wars of the 16th century. The Nyorind≈ç (Main Temple) was rebuilt in 1587 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Imperial Regent who unified Japan after the wars. It is typical of Momoyama Era style of architecture with a shingled distinctive roof called irimoya. The Nyorind≈ç is heritage listed as a nationally Important Cultural Property. When the government reinstated the power of the Emperor during the Meiji era (1868 - 1912), an attempt was made to separate Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines that had for over a thousand years shared the same grounds. Because of this, Seigantoji was formally abolished, the priests stripped of their authority and no funding was given to the temple. At that time Seigantoji had three main temples as well as 37 residential and training building. But all that remained after the Meiji Restoration was the Nyorind≈ç and the abbot‚Äôs quarters. However, gradually over the following century it was slowly rebuilt due to its position as an important part of the Kumano-Nachi syncretic mountain veneration religion of Shugend≈ç. In 1918, a Sutra mound was excavated at the base of the waterfall and found to contain many important archaeological artifacts, including statues, mirrors, altar fittings and Sutra cylinders. These are now displayed in the Ryuhoden (‚ÄúTreasure Hall‚Äù), located next to the Pagoda. These Sutra mounds were created by priests in times of war to hide their treasures but also many items were buried in this way as a result of the belief that the end of the world was coming at the start of the 10th century.

While in the past Rastafarians were discriminated against by government practices, since 2015 the government has taken steps to make amends. Representatives of the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities in Jamaica have described the country as being tolerant of religious diversity. Christian=Protestantism= 62% of the Jamaican population are Protestants. Jamaican Protestantism is composed of several denominations: 24% Church of God, 11% Seventh-day Adventist, 10% Pentecostal, 7% Baptist, 4% Anglican, 2% United Church, 2% Methodist, 1% Moravian and 1% Brethren Christian. The Church of God has 111 congregations in six regions: * Western: 10 congregations in the parishes of St. James, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland and Trelawny * South Central: 27 congregations in the parishes of Manchester and St. Elizabeth * North Central: 17 congregations in the parishes of St. Ann, Manchester and Clarendon * Central: 21 congregations in the parishes of St. Catherine, Manchester and Clarendon * South Eastern: 19 congregations in the parishes of St. Andrew, Kingston and St. Catherine * North Eastern: 17 congregations in the parishes of Portland, St. Mary and St. Ann =Roman Catholicism= There are about 50,000 (2%) Catholics in Jamaica, which is divided into three dioceses, including one archdiocese: * Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kingston in Jamaica * Roman Catholic Diocese of Mandeville * Roman Catholic Diocese of Montego Bay The Missionaries of the Poor monastic order originated in Kingston, Jamaica. Also notable is the school, St. George's College, Jamaica. =Latter-day Saints= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reports 5,891 members living in Jamaica. Members of the Church are organized under the Kingston Jamaica Stake, the Mandeville Jamaica District and the Kingston Jamaica Mission, and members attend the Panama City Panama Temple. =Eastern Orthodoxy= The Eastern Orthodox Church has limited history in Jamaica. There were a notable number of Syrians who immigrated to the island and were visited by a Father Antonio Michael, who later entrusted them to the local Anglican parishes. https://orthodoxhistory.org/2010/02/22/an-antiochian- priest-in-jamaica-1910/ These Orthodox later interacted with Father Raphael Morgan, a figure who has recently garnered interest among Orthodox historians. According to Jamaica Church of England Parish Register Transcripts, Morgan was born between 1863-1866 and originally baptized and christened into the Church of England. He would later convert to Orthodoxy and serve as a priest, though details are still emerging as to the specifics of his life. https://orthodoxhistory.org/2014/06/05/the-birth-of-fr-raphael-morgan/ Today, there is a small but steadily growing number of Orthodox believers in Jamaica. One example is a native Jamaican man who asked the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America to establish a mission in the country for inquirers like him and others. https://journeytoorthodoxy.com/2016/08/why-one-jamaican-became-an- orthodox-christian/ The mission was established on 24 April 2015 as the Holy Orthodox Archdiocese in Jamaica, a Vicariate of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Mexico of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. On 15 December 2019, the mission announced that it had officially decided to leave their original jurisdiction in favor of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Metropolitan Hilarion has put Vladyka Luke of Syracuse in charge of receiving the mission. https://orthochristian.com/126556.html Rastafari movement The Rastafari movement or Rasta is a new religious movement that arose in the 1930s in Jamaica, which at the time was a country with a predominantly Christian culture where 98% of the people were the black descendants of slaves. Its adherents worship Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia (ruled 1930‚Äì1974), as God incarnate, the Second Advent of Jesus Christ or as Christ in his Kingly Character, depending on their views on the Emperor. The 2001 census counted 29,026 Rastafari. Other religions Other popular religions in Jamaica include Islam, Bah√°'√≠ Faith with perhaps 8000 Bah√°'√≠s and 21 Local Spiritual Assemblies, Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism.religiousintelligence.co.uk, religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu There is also a small population of around 200 Jews forming the Shaare Shalom Synagogue in Kingston, who describe themselves as Liberal-Conservative. The first Jews in Jamaica trace their roots back to early 15th-century Spain and Portugal. There are an estimated 5,000 Muslims in Jamaica. Religious freedom The constitution of Jamaica establishes the freedom of religion and outlaws religious discrimination. A colonial-era law criminalizing Obeah and Myalism continues to exist, but has rarely been enforced since Jamaica's independence from the United Kingdom in 1962.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Jamaica US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Registration with the government is not mandatory for religious groups, but provides groups with some privileges, such as being able to own land and enter legal disputes as an organization. Groups seeking tax-exempt status must register separately as charities. The public school curriculum includes nondenominational religious education. Some public schools are run by religious institutions, but are required to hold to the same standard as other public schools. Religious private schools also operate in Jamaica. While Rastafarians were once persecuted by the government of Jamaica and routinely harassed by police looking for then-illegal cannabis, the government has since taken steps to accommodate Rastafarians, including the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of cannabis for religious purposes in 2015, and formal apologies coupled with financial reparations for past actions against the Rastafarian community, such as the Coral Gardens incident. Rastafarians still face some societal discrimination, particularly when seeking employment, but community representatives have stated that incidences of discrimination have sharply decreased since 2015. Representatives of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities in Jamaica have described Jamaican as being tolerant of religious diversity, and identified the high level of interfaith dialogue as evidence to support this claim.

He worked in or covered Pennsylvania politics for nearly three decades, serving most recently as bureau chief for the online news service Capitolwire.com. Early life and education DeCoursey was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, attended William Penn Charter School, and graduated from Yale College in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in English language and literature. Career DeCoursey started his professional career as an aide to former Philadelphia City Councilwoman Ann Land. He then worked as press secretary for U.S. Rep. Bob Borski, from late 1987 until late 1990. He first became a full-time reporter for the Reading Eagle-Times in August 1990. He worked as a political reporter and columnist for The Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from March 1997 to 2005 before being hired by GovNetPA to produce original news content for Capitolwire.com, where he became bureau chief. Mark Bernstein, a lifelong friend, recalled DeCoursey's explanation for becoming a journalist after being a political insider: \\"He said being a press secretary was all about not saying everything you know. And he wanted to switch to something where he could tell everything he knew, rather than spinning it as a press secretary would.\\" DeCoursey was first to report on the 2011 proposal by Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi (R), with the support of Gov. Tom Corbett, to change Pennsylvania from a winner-take-all electoral vote system, to a system that awards electoral votes by congressional district.On September 16, 2011, writing of that proposal, PoliticsPA reported that \\"DeCoursey broke that news ‚Äì the biggest non-presidential story of the summer ‚Äì last Thursday.\\" De Coursey appeared on Public Radio International's Whad'Ya Know? in 2005 and CNN's Capital Gang in 2004. He appeared on Inside Politics on CNN in October 2004. Reputation In 2005, he was named one of \\"Pennsylvania's Most Influential Reporters\\" by the Pennsylvania political news website PoliticsPA. In 2008, the political website PolitickerPA.com named him one of the \\"Most Powerful Political Reporters\\" in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Report named him to the 2009 \\"The Pennsylvania Report 100\\" list of influential figures in Pennsylvania politics and noted that his Capitolwire briefing was a \\"must read for all legislators, staff members, and lobbyists in the state capital\\", even if it was controversial due to DeCoursey's \\"attack dog reputation and his sometimes one-sided comments.\\" He was named to the PoliticsPA list of \\"Sy Snyder's Power 50\\" list of influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2002. Controversy During the 2000 presidential election, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was known to be under consideration as the running mate for Republican George W. Bush. DeCoursey and fellow journalist Albert J. Neri began planning a book about Ridge and contracted with an agent to pursue a book deal in the event that he was selected. After Ridge withdrew his name from consideration, both Neri and DeCoursey wrote columns blasting Ridge for pretending to be a candidate after he had withdrawn his name from consideration three weeks before announcing it. Both contrasted that behavior with Ridge's general reputation for honesty. Tim Reeves, Ridge's press secretary said that the situation was a \\"journalistic conflict of interest.\\" Veteran Philadelphia Inquirer editor and journalism professor at Pennsylvania State University Gene Foreman agreed, noting that the book deal was not disclosed and that the two columns seemed \\"particularly personal\\" and contained \\"pretty extraordinary\\" language. In return, the editors of both newspapers that had carried the columns noted that they were aware of the book project and the Patriot-News consulted with Bob Steele of The Poynter Institute, who said there was no reason to disclose the potential book to readers. The incident was covered in the American Journalism Review. In 2003, an article in the Lancaster Sunday News speculated that DeCoursey and Charlie Thompson, both then reporters for the Patriot-News, were operating the political website PoliticsPA under a pseudonym. DeCoursey and Thompson both denied any involvement in the site, and reporter Helen Adams later wrote a correction. Personal life DeCoursey married and was later divorced from his former Patriot-News colleague Diana Fishlock; they had two children. As a hobby, DeCoursey led a group of volunteers who performed statistical analysis of Philadelphia Phillies games for the company STATS, Inc. in an early form of what is now called sabermetrics. He also edited a fan newsletter called the Philadelphia Baseball Philes and worked painstakingly to develop a new statistic to better measure and compare the defensive performance of baseball players. Death DeCoursey died on January 1, 2014 at his parents' home in Philadelphia after battling pancreatic and lung cancer. His final column for Capitolwire.com was published the week of his death.

Glazier, a banker.Hans-Martin Schenke, Apostelgeschichte 1, 1 - 15, 3 Im Mittelaegyptischen Dialekt des Koptischen (Codex Glazier) (Texte Und Untersuchungen Zur Geschichte Der Altchristlichen Literatur 137), Berlin: Akademie Verlag 1991, p. 1 In 1983, it was given with the Glazier Collection to the Pierpont Morgan Library. Charles Ryskamp, director of the Morgan Library, described the Glazier Collection as an \\"important addition to the Morgan Library's\\" . Currently, the book is housed in Berlin's Altes Museum. Theodore C. Petersen published in 1964 a selection of readings in English translation. He planned to provide a critical edition of the codex, but died in 1966.Tobias Nicklas, Michael Tilly, The Book of Acts as church history: text, textual traditions and ancient..., Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 117 The manuscript was examined by Petersen, Haenchen, Weigandt, Bober, Epp, and Schenke. Eldon Jay Epp found several unique readings of the codex. The text of the codex was edited by Schenke in 1991.Hans-Martin Schenke, Apostelgeschichte 1, 1 - 15, 3 Im Mittelaegyptischen Dialekt des Koptischen (Codex Glazier) (Texte Und Untersuchungen Zur Geschichte Der Altchristlichen Literatur 137), Berlin: Akademie Verlag 1991. The readings of the codex have been incorporated into the apparatus of Nestle-Aland 26th edition of Novum Testamentum Graece.  Significance  Before the discovering of the Codex Glazier, a number of readings of Codex Bezae had support only of later, mixed Western witnesses and no pure witnesses. In such cases always was difficult to decide whether the reading is to be taken as Western or not. The evidence of Codex Glazier allows to separate old Western readings from late reading. It allows to decide with greater assurance. Codex Bezae has a lacuna in 8:29-10:14. The Old Latin Codex Floriacensis (designated by h), is also lacking in this section up to 9:24a, and after 9:24a. Codex Glazier is an important witness for reconstruction the Western text for this portion. At least 21 reading of Glazier of this portion may represent the Western text.Elton Jay Epp, Coptic Manuscript G67 and the Role of Codex Bezae as a Western Witness in Acts, in: Perspectives on New Testament Textual Criticism (Leiden 2005), p. 27 The manuscript is also important as a witness of the Coptic language, because it is one of few manuscripts that are written in the dialect of Coptic used in Middle Egypt.

History The development of the principles underlying SPD techniques goes back to the pioneering work of P.W. Bridgman at Harvard University in the 1930s. This work concerned the effects on solids of combining large hydrostatic pressures with concurrent shear deformation and it led to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1946. Very successful early implementations of these principles, described in more detail below, are the processes of equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) developed by V.M. Segal and co-workers in Minsk in the 1970s and high-pressure torsion, derived from Bridgman's work, but not widely developed until the 1980s at the Russian Institute of Metals Physics in modern-day Yekaterinburg. Some definitions of SPD describe it as a process in which high strain is applied without any significant change in the dimensions of the workpiece, resulting in a large hydrostatic pressure component. However, the mechanisms that lead to grain refinement in SPD are the same as those originally developed for mechanical alloying, a powder process that has been characterized as \\"severe plastic deformation\\" by authors as early as 1983. Additionally, some more recent processes such as asymmetric rolling, do result in a change in the dimensions of the workpiece, while still producing an ultrafine grain structure. The principles behind SPD have even been applied to surface treatments. Methods=Equal channel angular extrusion= During the ECAE process, the material is pressed through an angular die and experiences shear deformation, without changing its cross-sectional dimensions. Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE, sometimes called Equal channel angular pressing, ECAP) was developed in the 1970s. In this process, a metal billet is pressed through an angled (typically 90 degrees) channel. To achieve optimal results, the process may be repeated several times, changing the orientation of the billet with each pass. This produces a uniform shear throughout the bulk of the material. =High pressure torsion= During the constrained HPT process, the material experiences shear deformation between a fixed and a rotating anvil, without losing its original dimensions. High pressure torsion (HPT) can be traced back to the experiments that won Percy Bridgman the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physics, though its use in metal processing is considerably more recent. In this method, a disk of the material to be strained is placed between 2 anvils. A large compressive stress (typically several gigapascals) is applied, while one anvil is rotated to create a torsion force. HPT can be performed unconstrained, in which the material is free to flow outward, fully constrained, or to some degree between in which outward flow is allowed, but limited. =Accumulative roll bonding= In accumulative roll bonding (ARB), 2 sheets of the same material are stacked, heated (to below the recrystallization temperature), and rolled, bonding the 2 sheets together. This sheet is cut in half, the 2 halves are stacked, and the process is repeated several times. Compared to other SPD processes, ARB has the benefit that it does not require specialized equipment or tooling, only a conventional rolling mill. However, the surfaces to be joined must be well-cleaned before rolling to ensure good bonding. =Repetitive corrugation and straightening= Repetitive corrugation and straightening (RCS) is a severe plastic deformation technique used to process sheet metals. In RCS, a sheet is pressed between two corrugated dies followed by pressing between two flat dies. RCS has gained wide popularity to produce fine grained sheet metals. Endeavors to improve this technique lead to introduce Repetitive Corrugation and Straightening by Rolling (RCSR), a novel SPD method. Applicability of this new method approved in the various materials. =Asymmetric rolling= In asymmetric rolling (ASR), a rolling mill is modified such that one roll has a higher velocity than the other. This is typically done with either independent speed control or by using rolls of different size. This creates a region in which the frictional forces on the top and bottom of the sheet being rolled are opposite, creating shear stresses throughout the material in addition to the normal compressive stress from rolling. Unlike other SPD processes, ASR does not maintain the same net shape, but the effect on the microstructure of the material is similar. =Mechanical alloying= Mechanical alloying/milling (MA/MM) performed in a high-energy ball mill such as a shaker mill or planetary mill will also induce severe plastic deformation in metals. During milling, particles are fractured and cold welded together, resulting in large deformations. The end product is generally a powder that must then be consolidated in some way (often using other SPD processes), but some alloys have the ability to consolidate in-situ during milling. Mechanical alloying also allows powders of different metals to be alloyed together during processing. =Surface treatments= More recently, the principles behind SPD have been used to develop surface treatments that create a nanocrystalline layer on the surface of a material. In the surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT), an ultrasonic horn is connected to an ultrasonic (20 kHz) transducer), with small balls on top of the horn. The workpiece is mounted a small distance above the horn. The high frequency results in a large number of collisions between the balls and the surface, creating a strain rate on the order of 102‚Äì103 s‚àí1. The NC surface layer developed can be on the order of 50 Œºm thick. The process is similar to shot peening, but the kinetic energy of the balls is much higher in SMAT. An ultrasonic nanocrystalline surface modification (UNSM) technique is also one of the newly developed surface modification technique. In the UNSM process, not only the static load, but also the dynamic load are exerted. The processing is conducted striking a workpiece surface up to 20K or more times per second with shots of an attached ball to the horn in the range of 1K-100K per square millimeter. The strikes, which can be described as cold-forging, introduce SPD to produce a NC surface layer by refining the coarse grains until nanometer scale without changing the chemical composition of a material which render the high strength and high ductility. This UNSM technique does not only improve the mechanical and tribological properties of a material, but also produces a corrugated structure having numerous of desired dimples on the treated surface. Applications Most research into SPD has focused on grain refinement, which has obvious applications in the development of high-strength materials as a result of the Hall-Petch relation. Conventionally processed industrial metals typically have a grain size from 10‚Äì100 Œºm. Reducing the grain size from 10 Œºm to 1 Œºm can increase the yield strength of metals by more than 100%. Techniques that use bulk materials such as ECAE can provide reliable and relatively inexpensive ways of producing ultrafine grain materials compared to rapid solidification techniques such as melt spinning. However, other effects of SPD, such as texture modification also have potential industrial applications as properties such as the Lankford coefficient (important for deep drawing processes) and magnetic properties of electrical steel are highly dependent on texture. Processes such as ECAE and HPT have also been used to consolidate metal powders and composites without the need for the high temperatures used in conventional consolidation processes such as hot isostatic pressing, allowing desirable characteristics such as nanorystalline grain sizes or amorphous structures to be retained. Some known commercial application of SPD processes are in the production of Sputtering targets by Honeywell and UFG titanium for medical implants. Grain refinement mechanism The presence of a high hydrostatic pressure, in combination with large shear strains, is essential for producing high densities of crystal lattice defects, particularly dislocations, which can result in a significant refining of the grains. Grain refinment in SPD processes occurs by a multi- step process: #Dislocations, which are initially distributed throughout the grains, rearrange and group together into dislocation \\"cells\\" to reduce the total strain energy. #As deformation continues and more dislocations are generated, misorientation develops between the cells, forming \\"subgrains\\" #The process repeats within the subgrains until the size becomes sufficiently small such that the subgrains can rotate #Additional deformation causes the subgrains to rotate into high-angle grain boundaries, typically with an equiaxed shape. The mechanism by which the subgrains rotate is less understood. Wu et al. describe a process in which dislocation motion becomes restricted due to the small subgrain size and grain rotation becomes more energetically favorable. Mishra et al. propose a slightly different explanation, in which the rotation is aided by diffusion along the grain boundaries (which is much faster than through the bulk). F.A. Mohamad has proposed a model for the minimum grain size achievable using mechanical milling. The model is based on the concept that the grain size is dependent on the rates at which dislocations are generated and annihilated. The full model is given by \\\\frac{d_{min}}{b}=A_3 \\\\left ( e^{-\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta Q}{4RT}} \\\\right ) {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{D_{p0} G b^2 }{ u_0 k T} \\\\right )}^{0.25} {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\gamma }{ G b } \\\\right )}^{0.5} {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{ G }{ H } \\\\right )}^{1.25} *On the left side of the equation: dmin is the minimum grain size and b is the Burgers vector. *A3 is a constant. *Œ≤=Qp‚àíQm/Q (Qp is the activation energy for pipe diffusion along dislocations, Qm is the activation energy for vacancy migration, and Q is the activation energy for self-diffusion), Œ≤Q represents the activation energy for recovery, R is the gas constant, and T is the processing temperature. *Dp0 is the temperature-independent component of the pipe diffusion coefficient, G is the shear modulus, ŒΩ0 is the dislocation velocity, k is the Boltzmann constant, Œ≥ is the stacking fault energy, and H is the hardness. While the model was developed specifically for mechanical milling, it has also been successfully applied to other SPD processes. Frequently only a portion of the model is used (typically the term involving the stacking fault energy) as the other terms are often unknown and difficult to measure. This is still useful as it implies that all other things remaining equal, reducing the stacking fault energy, a property that is a function of the alloying elements, will allow for better grain refinement. A few studies, however, suggested that despite the significance of stacking fault energy on the grain refinement at the early stages of straining, the steady-state grain size at large strains is mainly controlled by the homologous temperature in pure metals and by the interaction of solute atoms and dislocations in single-phase alloys.

The cave expands below water level (a shape described as an \\"inverted mushroom\\") to up to across. The maximum depth of the cave reaches 54 ft/16.5 m with the surface diameter being 120 ft. The water level in the cave has fallen along with the water table in the area. However, as of 2018 the water level has risen above the main stage/platform. The cave was opened to the public as a dive site in the early 1990s. Four underwater passages extend from the pool under the opening, from to under the surface of the water. The passage called chamber 3, under water, contained animal and human remains and artifacts. The animal remains, which appeared to be associated with the human remains and artifacts, were from extinct (Pleistocene) species, including mastodons, ground sloths, camels, horses, dire wolves, bog lemmings, Florida spectacled bears, saber-toothed cats, and peccaries. The human remains have been dated to about 7,500 BC.

Its plot is about an army investigator who tries to shut down a scam that preys on soldiers, and unknowingly falls in love with the woman behind it. Plot The Office of Dependency Benefits, O.D.B., is a U.S. government agency in charge of payment and financial support to women who have husbands serving in World War II. Even after the war, the office still handles all these issues. The story picks up when Colonel Pete Martin from the Army Intelligence is assigned to investigate a series of incorrect claims for support that has been discovered at the O.D.B. Among other things, there is evidence that some women have married multiple times to get more money. Pete's job is to find these fraudulent women and bring them to justice. Pete goes undercover and pretends to be a newspaper reporter, which used to be his occupation before the war. He begins his investigations on the West Coast, keeping an eye on the suspected women. He observes a suspicious young woman named Helen Keefe (Elizabeth Wright) give cash to an equally suspicious- looking man, George Shields, and after that, she is introduced to another young man. Pete immediately orders their arrest. At the restaurant, a businesswoman named Sheila Seymour introduces herself to Pete. She claims to be the owner of an upscale beauty salon and running a canteen for servicemen. Pete is unaware that she also is the head of the racketeering business and in charge of all the allotment frauds. To her aid, she has three men: Whitey Colton, Louis Moranto, and Deacon Sam. Since Pete discovered a case of ongoing fraud in the restaurant, Sheila is furious with her associates, and fires Moranto for not doing his job properly. Whitey is sent to tail Pete and keep track of his investigation. Whitey follows Pete to the O.D.B. offices, and confirms that he is an investigator. Pete continues to pretend being a reporter, and goes to Sheila's canteen. He meets her, and they agree to meet the next day for an interview as background to one of the article he pretends to write. He is still unaware of Sheila's involvement in the racket. Sheila sees her daughter, Connie, in a bar with two soldiers, and becomes upset with her behavior. Sheila tells Connie that she has to stay in school for two more months, after which they will go to South America together with Whitey. Sheila's plan is to quit the racketeering business by then. But problem arises as Spike Malone, one of Moranto's former goons, and his girlfriend Gladys Smith try to get into the racketeering business. They follow Sheila to her home and see her daughter Connie. It turns out Gladys recognizes Sheila, because she used to go to reform school with her. Pete sees signs of the racketeering business when he visits the canteen, and the next time he meets Sheila, he warns her about the illegal business going on at her place of business. Gladys starts working Sheila by sending her blackmail letters. Sheila puts Whitey on catching the blackmailer and handing her over to the police. She succeeds, and Gladys ends up in jail, where she meets Helen and finds out that Sheila is, in fact, running the whole allotment racketeering business. After telling Gladys, Helen commits suicide in jail. Gladys is soon released from jail, and decides to get her revenge in Sheila through her daughter. Gladys and Spike arrange a string of wild parties, and get Connie to attend them. Then, they sneak into Sheila's home and threaten her with a gun, asking for a large sum of money in exchange for Connie. Sheila manages to alert Whitey about her situation, and he and his men arrive to the rescue. A gunfight ensues, and Spike is shot and runs off, injured. Sheila manages to kill Gladys. After all the wild partying, Connie is taken into custody by Pete, and since he isn't aware that Sheila is the girl's mother, he asks her to help him with Connie, as a role model the girl can look up to. Sheila again uses Whitey, and sends him off to break Connie out from captivity. He manages to do that, but is shot and wounded in doing so. In the meantime, Pete has tracked Spike, and finds out that he is involved with Sheila somehow. Sheila and Connie pack to go to Mexico together, but Sheila goes to take care of Pete before they leave. Connie is sent ahead for Mexico with her other reliable associate Deacon, but they are stopped. Sheila attempts to kill Pete, but she is herself killed by one of his men. Pete decides to let Connie run, and turns in his report to the O.B.D, suggesting they forget about the girl's background.Film synopsis, tcm.com; accessed March 11, 2014.

He invented the Sundanese solf√®ge system (da mi na ti la) and the Sundanese 17-tone model. He was born in Sumedang on 7 December 1902, and died in Bandung on 9 April 1979. Biography Koesoemadinata is widely known among the Sundanese people as a composer. He wrote Sundanese traditional songs such as \\"Lemah Cai\\" (Our Native Land), \\"Dewi Sartika\\" and \\"Sinom Puspasari\\". He was also a playwright and director of Sundanese music-dramas called Rinenggasari; among those he wrote are Sarkam- Sarkim and Satan Mindo Wahyu Revelation (Satan Personification as Divine Revelation). He formulated the Sundanese solf√®ge system (da mi na ti la) and wrote many theoretical publications on Sundanese music, including Ilmu Seni Raras (Our Musical Art) (1969) and Ringkesan Pangawikan Rinenggaswara (An outline of music theory) (1950). His research and experimentation on tone and scale systems led him in 1950 to his 17‚Äìtone Sundanese tuning and scale system, in which one octave consists of 17 equal intervals of 7010/17 cents. (Weintraub (2001) suggests that Koesoemadinata was aware of 17-tone theories that had been developed for Persian art music, but another source close to Koesoemadinata considers that he would only have known of the western 12-note chromatic scale, as he had no access to world literature on ethnomusicology.) Koesoemadinata's knowledge on the Sundanese pelog and salendro music system was acquired in his youth by learning to play the gamelan and the rebab, as well as by learning how to sing Sundanese tunes from Sundanese musicians and singers. He was introduced to science and western music theory when he was at the school for teachers (Kweekschool and Hogere Kweekaschool) in Sumedang, West Java, where he started his research on the frequency measurement of sounds from gamelan instruments and Sundanese singing. In 1923, he created the Sundanese solf√®ge system (da mi na ti la) and wrote a book on Sundanese music theory entitled Elmuning Kawih Sunda (Science of Sundanese Music). After completing Hogere Kweekaschool, he worked as a teacher from 1924 to 1932, while he continued his research into the theory of Sundanese music. Between 1927 and 1929, Koesoemadinata met Jaap Kunst, a Dutch ethnomusicologist who was conducting research on musical instruments in Java and Bali. They jointly wrote and published articles, and Koesoemadinata is often cited in Kunst's 1934 book De Toonkunst van Java. During this period, Koesoemadinata gained a better understanding of the frequencies of gamelan and of vocal sounds, and he started to perform frequency measurements using a monochord. He converted the frequency intervals into a logarithmic musical scale, using the concept of cents from Ellis (1884) and Hornbostel (1920) and Reiner's concept of musical rule. In 1933, the colonial government commissioned Koesoemadinata to form a Sundanese music education system for all-indigenous schools in West Java. After the independence of Indonesia, from 1945 until 1947, he taught science, history and English for high school teachers in Bandung. The rest of his professional career was spent mainly as an expert for the Department of Culture of West Java in Bandung. He was also an adjunct lecturer at the Gamelan Conservatory in Surakarta, Central Java from 1953 to 1959. In 1958 (to 1959) he was appointed its director. Gamelan Ki Pembayun In 1969, sponsored by the Government Tourism Industry in West Java, Koesoemadinata created a gamelan named Ki Pembayun (meaning the first-born), which is the largest ever bronze gamelan in Indonesia. This gamelan was designed to demonstrate Koesoemadinata's theory of 17-tone tuning and scale system. Ki Pembayun was prepared for a Ramayana international festival in Pandaan, Central Java, in 1971, but it was only ever played in rehearsal, because it was too difficult to play. Ki Pembayun was subsequently lost. Only a few photographs and some recordings of it survive; they may have been taken and recorded by Dr. Margaret Kartomi, professor of music at Monash University, Australia.

Early life and education Dao was born on April 27, 1921, in Suzhou, China, where his father was a lawyer. There he went to Soochow University, where he received his undergraduate degree. He attended Saint John's University in Shanghai, where he earned his master's degree and received his medical training, and went to the United States in 1949 for a residency in surgery. He had planned to return to China, but chose to reside in the U.S. after Mao Zedong rose to power. Once he settled in the United States, he adopted the name \\"Thomas\\".Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Dr. Thomas Dao, Expert on Treatment of Breast Cancer, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, July 25, 2009. Accessed July 26, 2009. Medical career He worked for future Nobel Prize winner Dr. Charles Brenton Huggins at the University of Chicago Medical School as a researcher assisting in Huggins' studies of how hormones relate to cancer in humans. There, Dao participated in research studies of treating advanced cases of breast cancer by surgical removal of the adrenal gland and ovaries. In 1951 he became an instructor in surgery at the medical school, and was named assistant professor of surgery in 1954. Starting in 1957, he served at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York as director of its breast surgery department, focusing on treatment of breast cancer and research into how it is caused and stimulated by hormones. At the time, radical mastectomy was the standard method of treatment used for 90% of cases until the 1970s, involving a surgical procedure where the entire affected breast, axillary lymph nodes and underlying chest muscle (including the pectoral muscles) were removed as soon as a malignant tumor was found through a biopsy. Dao's research showed that more conservative approaches in which the mastectomy was not performed immediately and in which much smaller portions of tissue were removed were just as effective as the radical approach. In 1974, Dao was the physician who performed a modified radical mastectomy for Rose Kushner, who was to become an effective patient activist in opposition to the more radical standard treatments for breast cancer. He endorsed her controversial 1975 book on the subject of breast cancer and its treatment, saying \\"Every woman in the United States should read this book.\\"Barron H. Lerner (2003), The breast cancer wars: hope, fear, and the pursuit of a cure in twentieth-century America, Oxford University Press US, , By the time of his death, the prevailing standard was a two-step approach in which a patient takes time to consider treatment options with their physician after malignant tumors have been identified. He served at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute until 1988. Personal Dao was a resident of Williamsville, New York. He died at age 88 on July 16, 2009, at Hospice Buffalo in Cheektowaga, New York due to Pick's disease. He was survived by his second wife, whom he married in 1954, as well as by their two daughters and two sons, four children from a first marriage that ended in divorce, 14 grandchildren and a great-grandson.

The United States Navy launched an amphibious assault against a series of four forts known as the Barrier Forts near the city of Canton (modern-day Guangzhou). It was considered an important battle by the British whose interest lay in capturing Canton. Background Sailing off the Chinese coast, and had received news of the beginning of the Second Opium War. The two sloops-of-war were tasked with protecting American lives by landing a 150-man detachment of marines and sailors in Canton. After a peaceful landing the Americans occupied the ancient city. Commanded by both Commodore James Armstrong and Captain Henry H. Bell, arrived in Canton's harbor and learned of the occupation. San Jacinto then landed a shore party of her own. On November 15h 1856, after a brief stay and no military contact, the force withdrew from the city. During the withdrawal, Commander Andrew H. Foote of the Portsmouth rowed out to his ship. As he rowed past the Pearl River Forts, the Chinese garrison fired on the small American boat a few times but the withdrawal continued. The next day the U.S. seamen had constructed a plan to attack Canton's citadels in retaliation for the Chinese attack on Commander Foote. Battle Map of the assault on the Barrier Forts, 20‚Äì22 November Now a force of one steam frigate the (San Jacinto), and two sloops-of-war, the naval squadron under James Armstrong made their way up the Pearl River and launched an attack on Canton's coastal forts. USS Portsmouth closed in on the nearest of the four citadels and fired the initial salvo on November16. For two hours her bombardment continued until the Chinese batteries were silenced. After this first engagement, Chinese and American officials decided to try to settle the matter diplomatically. This failed and on November20, Commodore Armstrong ordered his ships to fire again on two more of the Chinese forts. This bombardment lasted until the Chinese batteries weakened slightly, after which the Levant, commanded by William N. Smith, received 22 cannonball shots in her sails, rigging, and hull. Under cover of their ships' fire, a storming party of 287 troops led by Foote landed unopposed. Spearheading this force were about 50 marines under Captain John D. Simms and a small detachment of sailors.Bernard C. Nalty (1962). The Barrier Forts: A Battle, a Monument, and a Mythical Marine .

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger. p. 8. They quickly captured the first enemy fort, then used its 53 guns to attack and capture the second fort. When taking the second position, the Chinese launched several counterattacks with some 3,000 Qing Army soldiers from Canton. In a few more days of intense combat until the 24 November the U.S. force, with help from the blockade, pushed back the attacking Chinese army, killing and wounding dozens of the attackers, capturing two more forts and spiking 176 enemy guns. Chinese casualties were an estimated 250 to 500 killed or wounded. The Americans land forces sustained seven killed and 22 wounded. USS Levant suffered one killed and six wounded in her exchange with the Pearl River Forts. Portsmouth was hit 18 times and the Levant 22 times, but neither was seriously damaged.Tucker, Spencer C. (2013). Almanac of American Military History. Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO. p. 782. . Aftermath After James Armstrong's attack on the Chinese fortifications, diplomatic efforts began again and the American and Chinese governments signed an agreement for U.S. neutrality in the Second Opium War. This ended the United States' participation in the conflict until 1859, when Commodore Josiah Tattnall in the chartered steamship Towey Wan participated in the Battle of Taku Forts, which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1857, the British and French would use Pearl River to attack Canton from water, resulting in the Battle of Canton. America's opening of Asia continued into the 1860s with conflict, such as the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits and a following bombardment, as well as an expedition to Korea in the 1870s.

The native canoe in the foreground is offshore from the site of the village of Qayqayt. The Qayqayt First Nation (qiq√©yt), also known as the New Westminster Indian Band, is a band government located at New Westminster, British Columbia. The New Westminster Indian Band - Qayqayt First Nation is recognized by all levels of government, as well as the Assembly of First Nations where they hold delegate status. The Qayqayt First Nation historically spoke the Downriver Dialect of Halkomelem called h…ônÃìqÃì…ôminÃì…ômÃì, a Coast Salish language. The Qayqayt First Nation is one of the smallest First Nations in Canada and the only one registered without a land base. History The people who were permanent residents of what is now considered New Westminster were Musqueam and Kwantlen. Throughout the 1800s Musqueam and Kwantlen are continually documented as being in at qiq√©yt and tÃïsicÃì…ôlÃï…ôs. A reserve for the ‚ÄúLangley Indians‚Äù (Kwantlen First Nation) nd Musqueam (Musqueam I.R. #1) was established directly on top of the fishing village of qiq√©yt. In 1879, the federal government allocated three reserves as general reserves for ‚ÄúAll Coastal Indians.‚Äù These reserves were established inclusive of of the South Westminster Reserve, on the North Arm of the Fraser River and on Poplar Island. These carry the Musqueam names of yel…ô…¨k ∑…ô, sk ∑tex ∑q…ôn, and w…ôÃÅqÃì ∑aœá…ôn sœá ∑ay…ôm…ô…¨. On September 4, 1913 George Roberts ‚Äúof the New Westminster Band of Indians‚Äù met with commissioners of the British Columbia, Royal Commission on Indian Affairs. In his interview Roberts acknowledged Musqueam as chief of the ‚ÄúNew Westminster‚Äù Indians and many Musqueam continued to use the site seasonally through the 1930s and 40s for fishing.British Columbia, Royal Commission on Indian Affairs, Evidence Submitted to the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs for the Province of British Columbia: New Westminster Agency Transcripts. Musqueam continued to live at qiq√©yt into the 1930s. In 1959 this reserve was sold to pay for a water systems on Musqueam's I.R. #2. qiq√©yt continues to be important to Musqueam and they continue to fish in the waters around this important village site. In Musqueam issued their Declaration which states Musqueam‚Äôs rights and title to their unceded traditional territory and countersigned by the community at the time. qiq√©yt is site #32.http://www.musqueam.bc.ca/musqueam-traditional-territory-0 Kwantlen First Nation recognizes qiqeyt as a very significant part of their unceded traditional territory.

He received the Marine Corps Brevet Medal for bravery. Early life Pope was born February 28, 1841, at the Charlestown Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, and was the son of the Union Navy officer Commodore John Pope. Military career When the American Civil War started in 1861, he was only 21 but accepted an appointment in the United States Navy, on board the steam- sloop USS Richmond, which was commanded by his father. While aboard the Richmond, he and the other members of the crew participated in engagements from October 12‚Äì13, 1861, while on blockade duty at the Passes of the Mississippi River. He accepted a commission in the Marine Corps in 1861 and served continuously for 44 years, retiring as a colonel in 1905 although he was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list. Although two Marine Corps officers were awarded the Brevet Medal for service during the Civil War, Pope is the only one to receive it because the other recipient, James Forney, died before it could be presented. During the second inaugural parade for President William McKinley, Pope commanded a Marine regiment. General Pope was a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He died at his home in Milton, Massachusetts, January 22, 1922, and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Dorchester, Massachusetts.

Plot Hearing that her husband is dead, Sandra Marshall arrives at his prominent family's remote estate to claim her inheritance. She receives a cold reception, especially from the husband's uncle, research scientist Mark Caldwell, who had not known about her. He even accuses her of being a schemer. But he allows her to stay in the mansion while details are worked out. Caldwell's teenage niece, Julie, welcomes Sandra. But what the girl says is troubling. She claims her uncle is holding her prisoner on the property, that strange things are going on in a sealed-off area of the mansion, and that the older family members and their servants may not be telling the truth about the recent death. Though Caldwell insists that Julie simply has an overactive imagination, Sandra begins to wonder what to believe and whom to trust. She wants to find out for herself. Cast * Errol Flynn as Mark Caldwell * Barbara Stanwyck as Sandra Marshall * Geraldine Brooks as Julie Demarest * Richard Basehart as James Caldwell Demarest * Jerome Cowan as Senator Charles Caldwell * John Ridgely as Jackson Laidell * Patricia Barry as Angela (as Patricia White) * Rory Mallinson as Becket * Helene Thimig as Marta * Paul Stanton as Davenport * Barry Bernard as Roberts Production=Original novel= The novel was published in January 1945. The New York Times said \\"the plot has pace; the manse is traditionally eerie, the heroine is charming. Situations and dialogue, however, are often clumsily handled.\\" The Chicago Tribune called it \\"a spicy piece\\". =Development= In April 1945 Warner Bros bought the film rights as a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck. Catherine Turney was assigned to do the script and Dennis Morgan announced as co star. The film took a while to be made. In March 1946, Errol Flynn was announced as co star and Peter Godfrey as director. The movie was a \\"Thomson Production\\", i.e. made through Flynn's company at Warner Bros. Two of the supporting cast were from the New York stage, Geraldine Brooks and Richard Basehart, and had just been put under contract by Warner Bros. (Basehart had given an acclaimed stage performance in The Hasty Heart.) =Shooting= Filming started in May 1946 and took place to August 1946. Reception The film was not released until July 1947. =Critical= The Wall Street Journal said the film was \\"often as dull as it is frightening because its melodramatic story is full of cliches... without tommy gun or sword, Mr Flynn seems unhappily wooden.\\" The Christian Science Monitor said it \\"grips the attention and holds it right through...the result is something well above average.\\" \\"Its melodramatic antics are rather fun\\", said the Washington Post. Thework=Los Angeles Times called the film \\"murky\\" and \\"fairly opaque\\" although it felt audiences \\"are likely to be impressed by the performance of Flynn.\\" The New York Times said \\"its final explanation of the mystery is ridiculous and banal.\\" Filmink magazine wrote \\"a weaker/younger/more clearly neurotic actor\\" than Stanwyck \\"may have added to the tension...because Stanwyck can clearly handle herself ‚Äì even poking around a locked lab at one in the morning you don‚Äôt feel too worried for her\\" adding that \\"Errol is very effective in an atypical role ‚Äì slightly aloof, cold, sinister‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help imagine that maybe he was channeling his father, or some other patriarchal family member.\\" =Box Office= The film was moderately successful at the box office, Variety estimating its rentals in the US and Canada at $2 million.

In a budget impasse, the state government cannot pass a budget through the General Assembly and so the Commonwealth cannot pay its bills or payrolls. Update as of March 23,2016 the budget impasse for this fiscal year is over. UPDATE AS of 10/5/2017 the budget impasse for this fiscal year is ongoing. Sources http://www.pa.gov/Pages/budgetFAQs.aspx#.VvMX-Zj3aJI http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160324_Wolf_relents_on_budget__ends_historic_impasse.html Background The Pennsylvania Constitution requires the adoption of a budget by midnight June 30 each year, the last day in the fiscal year. There were seven consecutive budget impasses in Pennsylvania between 2003 and 2009, with tensions between Democratic Governor Ed Rendell and the Republican-controlled State Senate delaying the passage of annual budgets. While the trend was broken for several years after 2009, conflicts between the Legislature and the Governor led to subsequent budget impasses in 2014 and 2015. Past budget impasses=2007= In 2007, state employees who were considered non- essential were furloughed for one day during that year's budget impasse. =2008= In 2008, three state employee unions (AFSCME, SEIU Local 668 and FOSCEP) sought a declaration from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that \\"the Governor's furlough plan is not \\"legally required\\" by Article III, Section 24 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the FLSA, as the Governor's Office has asserted in public statements.\\" The Governor, Ed Rendell, and the then- Treasurer, Robin Wiessmann, filed a cross-application for summary relief, asking the Court to indicate that paying state employees outside the budget is not allowed by state law. =2009= In 2009, the state had a $3.2 billion deficit. Twenty-four year term State Rep. Edward G. Staback has stated that, \\"It is probably the worst I have ever seen.\\" Governor Rendell proposed an increase of 16% in the state's personal income tax to balance the budget. Republican lawmakers and some Democrats have insisted on there being no new taxes in 2009. This disagreement over the state's budget has created this year's budget impasse. Instead of implementing furloughs like previous years, all Pennsylvania state employees are required to continue working through the budget impasse. The majority of these employees will not be paid until after the new budget is adopted. During the impasse, 16,000 state workers took advantage of low interest loans to provide for expenses while they were without paychecks. =2014= The first and only budget impasse that occurred during the Tom Corbett administration took place during the negotiations over the 2014-2015 state budget. The fiscal year elapsed without a signed budget, as Corbett withheld his signature from a $29.1 billion budget passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, citing the absence of pension reform. The impasse ended on July 10, when Corbett ultimately signed the Legislature's budget proposal, which continued to lack pension reform. When signing the budget, the Governor used his line item veto power to cut $65 million, or 20 percent, of the Legislature's operating budget, a move that drew criticism from state lawmakers. =2015= Wolf Vetoed the entire budget in June. 88 days later he vetoes the stop gap measures passed by the Republican Legislature. As of December 29, 2015, a budget was passed. The budget is a stop gap measure and the governor vetoed $6.8 billion in spending.

The Public Schools Club was founded in October 1863 at 17 St James's Place, London. As outlined in the British journal The Athenaeum, from its foundation, the club restricted its membership to former pupils of Charterhouse School, Eton College, Harrow School, Rugby School, Westminster School and Winchester College. By 1885, a \\"Public Schools Club\\" was advertising for \\"suitable premises\\" in London in which to re-establish their establishment. The club was re-founded in 1909, based at number 13 Albemarle Street which until very recently had been the home of the Albemarle Club. The Public Schools Club disbanded during World War I as a result of the heavy casualties sustained among its membership. By 1910, the alpine sports club which had been founded c.1905 as the Winter Sports Club by Sir Henry Lunn was incorporated as the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club and under the control of ‚ÄúAlpine Sports, Ltd.‚Äù. In 1910, the club advertised that it \\"devoted its attention to Norway as a field for winter sports\\". Many British gentlemen's sports clubs such as the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club were interested in the activities of Sir Henry Lunn and his son Sir Arnold Lunn. After the war the club was re-founded in 1920 in Curzon Street, Mayfair. A 1937 road-widening scheme (linked to the 1935 road alterations which necessitated demolishing half of Lansdowne House and creating the Lansdowne Club) forced the club out of its premises, and it moved to 100 Piccadilly, where it remained for the rest of its existence. Suffering from dwindling membership, the club closed in 1972, merging with the East India Club, and moving to the East India's premises in St James's Square. However, the merger has proved to be something of a takeover, as the East India naturally had no remaining members from the long-defunct East India Company, and the Public Schools Club has imported a steady stream of members.Anthony Lejeune, The Gentlemen's Clubs of London (Macdonald and Jane's, London, 1979) pp. 200-3 Indeed, the East India currently claims some 40% of its members come under the 'J7' rule imported from the Public Schools Club, whereby students leaving their public school at 18 pay a ¬£360 (as of 2014) fee in exchange for membership until the age of 25.

It aired on TQS from 1986-1991, with Pierre Lalonde as host, and was taped on the same set as the then-concurrent Global/USA Network version. Main game Two teams comprising a celebrity and civilian faced a seven word chain. Each team member was given one responsibility. One teammate was the letter giver, and decided whether to give a letter to his or her partner or to other team's word guesser. A correct response was worth points and control of the board. In Round One, each word guessed was worth 10 points, but the final word guessed in that chain was worth 20 (changed to 15 in season two). In Round Two, these values escalated to 20 points each, and 40 points for the final word. Values for Round Three were again increased to 30 points each, and 60 for the final word. In the event that a fourth chain was needed to decide the game, the point values were 40 points per word and 80 for the final word. The goal was 200 points. Bonus chain The winning team could collect a cash jackpot by completing one last word chain. The team was shown the first word in a chain, and the initial letter of the other words. One at a time, the players would guess at the next word in the chain. For each wrong guess, the next letter would be filled in, and a letter deducted from their account which started at seven (nine at first). If the team could finish the chain before running out of letters the civilian won the cash jackpot. If not, he/she won $100 per correct answer. The jackpot began at ; and $500 was added each day it was not claimed.

The callsign is primarily administered by the United States Navy for military flight operations on the East Coast. Naval aviation news - Page 15 United States. Naval Air Systems Command, United States. Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Naval Historical Center (U.S.) - 1989 - \\"Giant Killer\\" is the way that most aviators refer to FACSFac VaCapes. The call sign is utilized by military air traffic controllers responsible for flight operations within restricted military airspace or to direct military air craft that is transiting civilian airspace. The call sign is commonly published in NOTAMs that designate restricted airspace reserved for military flight operations or combat exercises where normal airspace operating rules do not apply.MARSA Prior to the introduction of the call sign, standardized identification methods for military controllers holding operating authority over a specific section of airspace did not exist. To reduce the confusion and to ensure standardized emergency communication procedures among the various branches of the U.S. military, the call sign GIANT KILLER is used to denote the controlling authority for a section of military airspace dedicated to combat training or combat operations within the U.S. In rare circumstances, call signs like GIANT KILLER may be used during a national emergency when a specific controller has been assigned a section of airspace. This was the case on September 11, 2001 when US Navy personnel utilized the call sign to vector three F-16s from Langley Air Force Base to the National Capital Region for air defense purposes. It is possible for a specific controller to utilize more than one call sign, with GIANT KILLER being one of them. For clarity, the name is always written in capital letters with a space between the words.  Origins  The U.S. military commonly uses pairs of words that do not sound phonetically similar as call signs. This reduces the chance for confusion during transmission of critical messages. Most military air traffic control facilities that use the GIANT KILLER call sign maintain direct communications to weapons capable flight squadrons; the \\"killer\\" portion of the call sign may be more than a coincidence.  Safety considerations for general aviation  A significant safety concern for military combat exercise planners is the possibility of a general aviation aircraft mistakenly entering restricted airspace while an active combat training exercise is underway. Added safety measures are taken when target drones are used during war games. During such times, it is not uncommon for the military to release a specific safety NOTAM via the Federal Aviation Administration. Such NOTAMs usually indicate that any aircraft in the vicinity of restricted airspace should contact GIANT KILLER on a specified frequency if a pilot becomes involved in a situation near the specified coordinates. Certain target drones have a radar signature that is comparable to many single engine aircraft commonly used within the General Aviation community. Use of a common call sign like GIANT KILLER reduces the time needed to clarify the origin of critical safety messages.

He was a prominent participant in the Arts and Crafts Movement, and was active in Oakland and San Francisco, California.  Life  Dirk van Erp was born January 4, 1862, in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, the son of Willem van Erp and Agatha (born Agatha Tjepkema). Dirk's father and other family members were coppersmiths. He emigrated to the United States in 1890, and arrived in San Francisco in 1891, where he went to work for Union Iron Works. In 1892, he married Mary Richardson Marino and their first child, a daughter named Agatha, was born in 1894. In 1898, he traveled to the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, but failed to find his fortune. He returned to work at the Union Iron Works later that same year. The couple's son, William Henry van Erp, was born in April 1901. In 1900, van Erp moved to Vallejo, California, and got a job as a coppersmith at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He began making vases from brass shell casings as gifts to friends. About 1907 van Erp began selling to art galleries. In 1908, he opened the Art Copper Shop in Oakland, and began exhibiting his work at local Arts and Crafts exhibitions. In 1909, he exhibited more than two dozen pieces at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, a World's Fair held in Seattle, Washington. His shop won a gold medal. In September 1909 van Erp entered into a partnership with Elizabeth Eleanor D'Arcy Gaw (1868‚Äì1944), who had attended the Art Institute of Chicago. She had also studied English Arts and Crafts in London at the Guild and School of Handicraft, founded by Charles Robert Ashbee. They opened a studio at 376 Sutter Street, San Francisco in mid-September. From February 1910 the partnership began marking their wares with a stamped device of a windmill, with their names underneath. The partnership ceased on 30 January 1911; van Erp continued marking with the windmill device, with D'Arcy Gaw's name cut out from the stamp. The cutting-out of her name was not complete, and some wares can be found with a faint impress of some or all of the letters. Although their partnership lasted less than a year, D'Arcy Gaw exerted a strong and lasting influence on van Erp's design sensibility. He began making lamps to her design during this period, with shades incorporating mica panels. In 1915, van Erp exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a World's Fair held in San Francisco. During World War I, van Erp significantly reduced his artisan production, and returned to employment at Union Iron Works to contribute to the war effort. He resumed his prolific artisan production after the war ended in 1918. At some point van Erp's nephew, Auguste Tiesselinck, emigrated from the Netherlands to join his business.

His son, William van Erp, continued to operate the shop until 1977, when he died.pp. 291-292  Legacy  Kenneth Trapp, curator for decorative arts at the Oakland Museum of California summarized van Erp's legacy as follows: \\"Although most famous for his lamps, many of which are commanding in size and stunning in design, van Erp produced other pieces of such exceptional beauty and strength as to stand unrivaled in American metalwork.\\"Trapp, 1993, p.149 Trapp concluded, \\"Dirk van Erp is widely considered the most important metalsmith of the Arts and Crafts movement\\" A copper and mica lamp ca. 1912 - 1915, designed by D'Arcy Gaw and Dirk van Erp, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was donated in 1989 by Charles and Jane Kaufman.Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History In June, 2002, a copper and mica lamp designed by D'Arcy Gaw and made by Dirk van Erp was sold for US$180,000 at Craftsman Auctions in Lambertville, New Jersey.

Mr. O'Driscoll died in an accident in 1849 and is buried at Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Refugio. Catherine and Daniel had two sons, Jeremiah (1838‚Äì1890) and Robert Sr (1841‚Äì1914), Clara's father. Upon Catherine's death in 1852, Ellen and Daniel Doughty sold the Mississippi plantation and moved to Refugio to raise the boys. Both Jeremiah and Robert Driscoll Sr. were Privates in the Refugio Home Guard Unit during the American Civil War. Jeremiah and Robert Sr. expanded their operations into a multimillion-dollar operation in ranching, banking and commercial developments in Nueces County, Texas, in particular Corpus Christi. Clara Driscoll was born on April 2, 1881, to Robert Driscoll Sr. and the former Julia Fox (1834‚Äì1899) on Copano Bay in St. Mary's of Aransas in Refugio County, Texas. Clara's brother Robert Driscoll Jr. was born October 31, 1871 near Victoria. He died July 7, 1929. =Education= Clara was fluent in four languages and educated at private academies: Mrs. Gregory's School in San Antonio, Texas; Miss Peebles & Miss Thompson's School for Girls in New York City; and Ch√¢teau de Dieudonne, a finishing school in Bornel, France. =Writing career= In 1905, Clara published The Girl of La Gloria, and in 1906 she published In the Shadow of the Alamo. The three-act comic opera Mexicana, was adapted from a book by Driscoll, and was financed by her. Music was by John Raymond Hubbell with lyrics by Clara Driscoll and Robert Bache Smith. The production ran at the Lyric Theatre (New York) for 82 performances, from January 29, 1906 to April 7, 1906. It was produced by Lee Shubert, Jacob J. Shubert and The Shubert Organization. Listed among her friends in attendance were both United States Senators from Texas, Joseph W. Bailey and Charles Allen Culberson as well as three Texas members of the United States House of Representatives, James L. Slayden, Albert S. Burleson and John Nance Garner, who would become Vice President (1933‚Äì1941) under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. =Marriage, Laguna Gloria and divorce= On July 31, 1906, Clara married Tennessee-born Henry Hulme Sevier in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. The couple honeymooned in Europe and settled in the Sevier villa on Long Island. When Robert Driscoll Sr. died in 1914, the Seviers returned to Texas to be involved in the Driscoll family business. In 1917, Hal Sevier founded the Austin American-Statesman. Hal remembered his wife's fondness for Lake Como in Italy during their honeymoon, and sought to give her the Texas version. In August 1915, they bought 28 ¬Ω acres on Lake Austin at Mount Bonnell overlooking the Colorado River five miles (8 km) west of Austin. The land had originally been purchased by Stephen F. Austin who died before he could develop it. They chose the name Laguna Gloria, and Clara supervised the development of the estate and construction of the 15-room mansion, which became Clara's showplace for entertaining visitors from around the world. From 1922‚Äì1926, university student Mary Lubbock Lasswell became a frequent visitor to Laguna Gloria. Mary described Clara as a magnetic personality with reddish-black hair and brown eyes, and who was \\"exceedingly outspoken\\". Lasswell remembered that both the Seviers were fond of Mexican and Spanish songs. Mary likened Clara to \\"an eagle among a flock of pouter pigeons\\". Clara closed Laguna Gloria when her brother died in 1929 and the Seviers returned to the Palo Alto ranch headquarters. Clara managed the family's businesses and became president of Corpus Christi Bank and Trust Company. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Hal Sevier as ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Chile. In 1935, the couple became legally separated. They never had any children. The couple divorced on July 7, 1937 and Clara resumed the use of her maiden name. =Saving the Alamo= Driscoll returned from Europe in 1898 and settled in San Antonio. She was alarmed at the state of the Alamo, stating her opinion in the San Antonio Express that \\"unsightly obstructions\\" near the Alamo should be removed to allow the Alamo to stand alone. The public entrance known as the Alamo's mission chapel was already owned by the State of Texas, which had purchased the building from the Roman Catholic Church in 1883 and had given custody to the City of San Antonio. The city had made no improvements to the chapel structure and ownership did not include the long barracks (convento). In 1903, Adina Emilia De Zavala enlisted Clara Driscoll to join the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and chair the De Zavala fundraising committee to negotiate the purchase of the long barracks that was owned by wholesale grocers Charles Hugo, Gustav Schmeltzer and William Heuermann.dÃ™ The asking price was $75,000, most of which came out of Clara Driscoll's bank account. On January 26, 1905, the state legislature approved and Governor S.W.T Lanham signed legislation for state funding to preserve the Alamo property. The state reimbursed Clara Driscoll and on October 4, 1905, the governor formally conveyed the Alamo property, including the convento and the mission church, to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. A divide between two factions erupted over how the long barracks property was to be used. Driscoll and othersCharles M. Reeves to the San Antonio Business Men's Club, August 30, 1906, De Zavala Papers believed it was not part of the original structure and should be turned into a park. Clara offered to raze the building at her own expense. De Zavala was adamant that the long barracks was part of the original building and where the major part of the battle had occurred. In 1908, De Zavala had a stand-off with authorities inside the structure. By 1911, Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt ordered the long barracks be restored to its original condition as it was in mission days. During the 1912 restoration,San Antonio Express, January 25 and 26, 1912, February 4, 1912 workers discovered foundation work that verified De Zavala's instincts that the structure had indeed been an original part of the Alamo. However, Governor Colquitt was eventually unsuccessful in preserving the barracks building and when he was out of town on business Lieutenant Governor William Harding Mayes allowed for the further removal of the second floor of the structure.A Line in the Sand p. 214 Driscoll then succeeded in obtaining an injunction preventing the state from initiating any reconstruction work of the convent and a case was upheld on appeal, allowing the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to remain as custodians in 1913. Clara continued to work on behalf of the Alamo for the rest of her life. In 1931, she again put up $70,000 of her own money to help the state legislature purchase more city property surrounding the shrine. In 1933, she backed down city engineers who wanted to purchase a portion of the Alamo property to widen Houston Street. By 1935, the persuasive Driscoll talked the City of San Antonio Fire Department out of putting a new fire station adjacent to the Alamo. As president of the DRT in 1936, she oversaw Centennial celebrations of the shrine. When Clara died in 1945, her body lay in state in the Alamo chapel. =Political involvement= Driscoll served as the Democratic party's national committeewoman from Texas 1922‚Äì1938 and supported her friend John Nance Garner's 1940 bid for the Presidency. Garner's campaign cost $165,000. After Franklin D. Roosevelt was reelected, she remained loyal to FDR. Upon her death, Time magazine described Clara's political acumen: > Money Player. Politicians soon learned to respect her: she could drink, > battle, cuss and connive with the best of them, outspend practically all of > them. Uvalde's white-browed John Nance Garner became her great & good > friend‚Äîin & out of smoke-filled rooms, they understood each other. She made > quadrennial $25,000 donations to national campaigns, but know-how, not > money, worked her up to national committeewoman. =Civic and philanthropic endeavors= Driscoll served as vice chairman of the Texas Centennial Exposition executive board. In 1939, Clara donated $92,000 to the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs, which paid off all debts against their headquarters known as The Mansion. In response, committee workers declared October 4, 1939 as Clara Driscoll Day in Austin. There was a reception, candle lighting, and unveiling of a portrait titled \\"Clara Driscoll, Patriot\\" by Corpus Christi artist Roy Miller. Clara built the Hotel Robert Driscoll, which opened on May 25, 1942 in Corpus Christi, to memorialize her brother. Clara maintained a penthouse suite in the hotel. The structure is now the Wells Fargo Building. In 1943, Clara deeded Laguna Gloria and a $5,000 gift to Texas Fine Arts Association Holding Company. At her death, she established the Driscoll Foundation Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi.

Maveeran Kaduvetti J Guru's daughter Ms.Viruthambigai & His son Mr.Kanalarasan started a team called \\"Manjal Padai\\" to safeguard whole Tamil Nadu vanniyar community especially teenage girls & their families.  Elections  Also known as Gurunathan, Guru represented the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) party. This had been formed from the Vanniyar Sangam, a caste association of which Guru was president and which was known on occasion for its violent protests against people. After an unsuccessful attempt to win a seat in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1996, Guru was elected as a PMK candidate from Andimadam constituency in the 2001 elections.2001 Tamil Nadu Election Results, Election Commission of India He lost the contest for the Jayankondam constituency in the 2006 elections but won the seat in the 2011 elections. His attempt to defend it in the 2016 elections resulted in him coming second to J. K. N. Ramajeyalingam of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Comments by Guru against various Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) ministers in June 2008 caused the DMK to end its alliance with the PMK, although the relationship had been difficult for some time previously. Guru was arrested and imprisoned on remand in July on suspicion of attempted murder. The PMK founder, S. Ramadoss, protested the arrest, claiming it was part of a political vendetta. The detention order, which had been made under the National Security Act and upheld by the Madras High Court was revoked in November of that year, with conditions attached that included he posted bail in the two outstanding cases against him, including the alleged attempted murder, and that he desisted from making inflammatory speeches. When Guru stood in the Tiruvannamalai constituency in the 2009 general elections, he suffered a record defeat as the DMK targeted PMK candidates after the break-up of the alliance.  Legal issues  Guru was acquitted in the 2008 attempted murder case in 2010 due to lack of evidence. At the time of the 2011 state assembly elections, Guru and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate M. Muruganandam were noted as having the most outstanding cases of all the candidates, with nine each. Guru ‚Äî whose cases mostly related to allegations of attempted murder, damage to public property and speeches inciting racial hatred ‚Äî pointed out that he had never lost a case and that \\"\\"No court has convicted me so far. Several cases can be filed against me but the people, my conscience and God know whether I am a criminal or not.\\" There were further legal problems in 2012, when he was cited under the Indian Penal Code by the police for unlawful assembly and riot in relation to a speech he allegedly delivered at Thazhambur, Kancheepuram district. Furthermore, a speech at the Chithirai festival in Mamallapuram resulted in his 2013 arrest under the National Security Act. At the time of the 2016 state assembly elections, there were 18 police cases pending against Guru, of which charges had been pressed in six. This was the greatest number filed against any candidate, with the combined total for all candidates being 324.  Personal life  Guru was born on 1 February 1961 in Kaduvetti, now a part of Ariyalur district, Tamil Nadu. He was the son of a local leader of the Communist Party of India.

History The Stone Foxes originated in the sleepy foothills of California‚Äôs Central Valley where founding members Aaron Mort and brothers Spence Koehler (guitar) and Shannon Koehler (drums, vocals) grew up. After high school, they went to college at San Francisco State University. A couple of years later, after living with the three founding members and discovering their similar musical tastes, Avi Vinocur (guitar, bass) joined the band. Formed in late 2005, The Stone Foxes spent their first few years together working on balancing out their musical style. The end product (for now) is a style infused with country, rock, blues, and a touch of San Francisco. The group‚Äôs songs are full of classic blues structures and shout-along moments. In April 2011, keyboardist Elliott Peltzman joined the band. Later that year, they opened for Cage The Elephant and Grammy winners The Black Keys at Mesa Amphitheatre in Phoenix, Arizona. Their cover of Slim Harpo's \\"I'm A King Bee\\" was featured in the national ad campaign for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. In 2013, following the departures of Aaron Mort and Avi Vinocur, the band underwent a major change in personnel marked by the additions of multi-instrumentalist Brian Bakalian, singer/guitarist/bassist Vince Dewald, and guitarist/violinist Ben Andrews. The new lineup released the album Small Fires that same year, featuring the singles \\"Everybody Knows,\\" Ulysses Jones,\\" and \\"Cotto.\\" On their fourth album, The Stone Foxes took a different approach to releasing their new music, launching Foxes First Friday. Beginning with \\"Locomotion\\" on September 5, 2014, the band detailed plans to release a new song for free on the first Friday of every month. Coupled with live versions, bonus tracks, and photos from the road, each song was compiled into an album titled Twelve Spells, which was released in August 2015. That same year, the band was covered in Forbes for their DIY success that came without the help of a record label. In February 2016 The Stone Foxes embarked on their first UK tour with Bath-based, Zambian brother duo Bite The Buffalo. Most dates on the tour sold out. In 2017, the band released the Visalia EP, a collection of songs they created while camping in the town of the same name. Singles included \\"Fight,\\" \\"Shake Like Buddy Holly,\\" and the autobiographical \\"If I Die Tonight,\\" about lead singer/drummer Shannon Koehler's lifelong struggle with a congenital heart condition. On September 18, 2018 the band announced members Elliott Peltzman, Brian Bakalian, and Vince Dewald would be leaving the band. The band will continue with a new lineup.  Philanthropy  The Stone Foxes have founded the Goodnight Moon Project to combat homelessness. The band has also partnered with SuperFood Drive to collect and donate healthy food at their shows to those locally in need.

Savage's eloquent, witty, dashing and daring life may have been the inspiration for the pulp novel character Doc Savage. In his youth in San Francisco, Savage studied engineering and law, and graduated from the United States Military Academy. After a few years of surveying work with the Army Corps of Engineers, Savage went to Rome as an envoy following which he sailed to Egypt to serve a stint with the Egyptian Army. Returning home, Savage was assigned to assess border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico, and he performed railroad survey work in Texas. In Washington D.C., he courted and married a widowed noblewoman from Germany. Savage returned to San Francisco with his wife to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and taking part in a family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and took part in the social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, Savage volunteered to lead men in battle. Instead, he was given command of an engineering unit which then built a complete base in Havana. Returning to New York, he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband. Four years after mustering out of the Army, Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded at the age of 57 by a horse and carriage on the streets of New York. Early life and career Savage was born in Utica, New York, the son of Jane Moorhead Ewart and Richard Savage (1817‚Äì1903), a lawyer and manufacturer whose family had lived in the Utica area for years.Stark Family Association, United States Military Academy.

The 1848 finding of gold in California, prompted Savage's father to join the California Gold Rush in 1850. Savage and the rest of his family left New York in 1851 to join his father. They arrived in San Francisco in February 1852. Savage was among the first boys to attend public school in the new city, along with future poet Charles Warren Stoddard and the brothers Gus, Charles and Harry de Young who would found the San Francisco Chronicle.Stoddard, Charles Warren. Pacific Monthly, December 1907. \\"In Old Bohemia: Memories of San Francisco in the Sixties\\". Retrieved on July 26, 2009. While the younger Savage was in school, his father helped discover the rich silver deposits of the Comstock Lode. Savage finished high school at age 15 and began to study law with U.S. Senator James A. McDougall. Later, he studied with the law firm Halleck, Peachy & Billings, while partner Henry Halleck was back East serving as major general in the Union Army. At the start of the American Civil War Savage joined the Union Army, but his father secured his discharge on the grounds of his extreme youth. Savage's father used his influence to push for California to stay on the Union side, and was rewarded by President Lincoln with the post of Collector of Internal Revenue in which capacity he served between 1861 and 1873. Through government connections, Savage's father gained for Savage an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1864. Despite the danger of Confederate privateers, Savage chose to travel east by way of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company to the Isthmus of Panama, followed by the Atlantic leg to New York, but significant wartime delays prevented him from joining the summer plebes at the academy. Rather, he took his place with the September students. In 1868, Savage graduated sixth in his class of 55 at West Point, and was assigned as brevet second lieutenant with the Army Corps of Engineers at Yerba Buena Island in San Francisco Bay. (The \\"brevet\\" rank acknowledged that Savage was needed as a second lieutenant despite the US government limiting the number of serving army officers.) Savage took part in survey work on the Indian reservations of Round Valley in Northern California and the Pima and Maricopa reservations in Arizona.Cullum, George Washington; United States Military Academy. Biographical register of the officers and graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, Houghton, Mifflin, 1891, p. 108. Government and writing career Savage performed his Army tasks but was unhappy with the narrowly defined role. He tendered his resignation on December 31, 1870. Through President Grant, he went to Marseilles and Rome as an American vice-consul. In 1871, Savage traveled to Egypt to act with the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone, a former American general in the Egyptian Army, serving under Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army, Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three commissioners investigating a series of border incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872‚Äì74. At the same time, he worked with Richard King and the nascent Corpus Christi & Rio Grande Railroad as chief surveyor for the route to Laredo. At the German Embassy in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 1873, Savage married the aristocratic Anna Josephine Scheible, a German widow three years older than he who had arrived in war-torn America in 1864 with her first husband, Gustav, to look after family-owned land in Georgia. Gustav Scheible died in 1866 and Anna became a favorite of the Washington social circle. Her marriage to Savage produced one daughter, who later married Anatol de Carriere, a minor nobleman and an Imperial Russian Councilor of State.The New York Times, June 26, 1913. \\"Says Russia Won't Yield On Passports; Indifferent to Our Demands, American Wife of Imperial Councilor Thinks.\\" Retrieved on January 23, 2010. In 1874, Savage began a ten-year stay in San Francisco. He worked with his father and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a prominent role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who wanted to get rid of Chinese immigrants.The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco. The Sand Lot and Kearneyism, Jerome A. Hart. Retrieved on July 27, 2009. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories. While in San Francisco, Anna Savage began a devoted interest in the fight for women's suffrage. Savage retired from government service in 1884 to practice law with his youngest brother. In 1890, he moved to New York City. Portrait and signature as published in 1894 In late 1890 at a friend's house on Lake George in upstate New York, while recovering from a near-fatal case of jungle fever contracted in Honduras, Savage wrote a tale loosely based on his life, entitled My Official Wife. The book was a great success, and was translated into many languages. The Times in London called it \\"a wonderful and clever tour de force, in which improbabilities and impossibilities disappear, under an air that is irresistible.\\"Current Opinion, p. 177. Current Literature Pub. Co, 1891 Savage followed his first book with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able to carry on a conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894. =Critical review= In 1893, Savage's book The Masked Venus was scathingly reviewed in the Overland Monthly: Savage's In the Shadow of the Pyramids was reviewed in The Literary World in May 1898. The reviewer said that Savage used \\"a happy mixture of audacity and ignorance quite untrammeled by facts.\\" The \\"absurd\\" main character was criticized as unrealistically exposed to mortal danger almost daily, \\"just escaping dagger thrusts and pistol shots, with results more favorable to the theatrical progress of the story than to his common sense.\\" The previous month in the same periodical, Savage's 25¬¢ book For Life and Love was dismissed as \\"a slap-dash romance\\". Final decade In 1896, Savage sued his publisher for $12,000 in unpaid royalties. The publisher, Frank Tennyson Neely, who had filed for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client, argued that he did not owe Savage anything, instead, Savage owed him.

This evolved into a straight, stiff blade without a frame, up to 14 feet long and with a handle at each end, the upper called the tiller and the lower one being the box, so called from its appearance and because it could be removed when the saw was taken out of one cut to be positioned in another.

Whipsawing for boatbuilding in Alaska, late 19th century Sawyers either dug a large pit or constructed a sturdy platform, enabling a two-man crew to saw, one positioned below the log called the pit-man, the other standing on top called the top-man. The saw blade teeth were angled and sharpened as a rip saw so as to only cut on the downward stroke. On the return stroke, the burden of lifting the weight of the saw was shared equally by the two sawyers, thereby reducing fatigue and backache. The pitman had to contend with sawdust in his mouth and eyes and the risk of being crushed by a falling log, although modern photographsArnoult, Annie, La Grande Histoire des Scieurs de Long show the saw dust falling, as would be expected, away from the pitman, the teeth being on the opposite edge from him.

The larger body is said to have \\"captured\\" the asteroid, which thereafter is its natural satellite. Typically, asteroids that approach close to a planet are either thrown out into space or else hit the planet. However, occasionally the asteroid is captured in an orbit around the planet. This is possible with any planetary body given the right conditions. As of 2014, U.S. engineers were working on methods for telerobotic spacecraft to capture an asteroid. In June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid 2011 MD was a prime candidate for capture by an Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), perhaps in the early 2020s. This effort was later cancelled by NASA in 2017. Orbital mechanics Asteroid capture happens when an asteroid \\"misses\\" a planet when falling towards it, but it no longer has enough velocity to escape from the planet's orbit. In that case, the asteroid is captured, entering a stable, closed elliptic orbit around the planet which does not pass through the planet's atmosphere. This depends on variables such as the asteroid's velocity relative to the planet, the mass of the planet, the trajectory of the asteroid, and perturbations from other bodies. An approaching asteroid will almost always enter a planet's sphere of influence on a hyperbolic trajectory relative to the planet, because solar orbits within Neptune's orbit have speeds much greater than planets' escape velocities. Put another way, the asteroid's kinetic energy when it encounters the planet is too great for it to be brought into a bounded orbit by the planet's gravity; its kinetic energy T is greater than its absolute potential energy V with respect to the planet, meaning that the planet's gravity does not constrain its motion. However, an asteroid's trajectory can be perturbed by a third body (e.g. a satellite, or another planet) in a way that reduces its kinetic energy in the planet's reference frame. If this brings the asteroid's velocity below the local escape velocity, its trajectory changes from a hyperbola to an ellipse, and the asteroid is captured. In rare cases, with or without such a perturbation, the asteroid travels on a trajectory that intersects with the planet, resulting in an impact event. Triton (moon) and Deimos (moon) are suspected to be naturally captured bodies. Asteroid Redirect Mission NASA proposed the Asteroid Redirect Mission (or Asteroid Initiative), an unmanned robotic mission, to \\"retrieve\\" a near-Earth asteroid with a size of about and a mass of around 500 tons (comparable in mass to the ISS). The asteroid would be moved into a high lunar orbit or orbit around EML2 (halo orbit, Lissajous orbit) for research and exploration purposes.http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/study/asteroid/asteroid_final_report.pdf Under consideration for moving the asteroid are grabbing the asteroid and using solar electric propulsion to \\"directly\\" move it, as well as gravity tractor technology. Once the asteroid is in lunar or EML2 orbit, at least one crewed mission would rendezvous with it, to collect and return samples. One of the advantages of a lunar orbit compared with an Earth orbit would be the safety: even at the end of the mission the natural perturbations of the trajectory would cause an eventual impact on the Moon, not on Earth. Furthermore, travel times to such a captured asteroid are much shorter, and launch windows are very frequent compared to transferring to near-Earth objects. The first challenge is to find a suitable asteroid to retrieve ‚Äì objects of the desired size are very dim and difficult to find. As many larger asteroids are known, an alternative for the retrieval of a small asteroid is to \\"pick up\\" a suitable sized rock from a larger asteroid, and move only that rock to a lunar or EML2 orbit. The timeline in the 2013 mission overview showed a test flight in the 2017 timeframe followed by a rendezvous and capture mission in 2019. The asteroid then would be moved to cislunar space by around 2021. The mission could provide a relatively low-cost route to satisfying Barack Obama's goal of sending astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025, and help develop knowledge and skills useful for future asteroid impact avoidance, in-situ resource utilization (including water for astronauts and for producing fuel, and material for bulk shielding against cosmic rays, for use there or elsewhere in space) and other asteroid mining (as well as providing a first target for the latter two). =Aerocapture= The technology needed to move a large asteroid into an arbitrary orbit does not yet exist; altering an asteroid's orbit around the Sun would require a large delta-v to be imparted to an object with a mass several orders of magnitude greater than existing spacecraft. Once an asteroid is on course to encounter a planet with an atmosphere, it is in principle possible to tweak its orbit so that it intercepts the planet's atmosphere, using aerobraking to slow the asteroid at periapsis by dumping some of its kinetic energy into the atmosphere - this technique has however never been used by spacecraft performing rendezvous manoeuvres with other planets such as Mars, but it would reduce the otherwise very large amount of fuel required to decelerate a spacecraft from a Sun- orbital velocity to a planet-orbital velocity. This technique is referred to as aerocapture.

It portrays the tragic consequences of the virulent propaganda that spread false stories of atrocities and stigmatized anything German during the Great War.  Plot  In 1909 in the town of Archedale, Mary Archer, an American girl from the prominent Archer family, meets Hugo Wilbrandt, a German chemist who knows her cousin and childhood sweetheart Jeff. It had been assumed for years that Mary and Jeff would marry someday, but Mary falls in love with Hugo and he with her. They soon marry and start a family. Hugo enthustically adopts his new country and becomes an American citizen on the eve of World War I. Allied propaganda soon promotes anti-German sentiment, which eventually costs Hugo his professorship at the local university. Hard times fall on the family, and the Wilbrandt's young son Teddy dies. Hugo convinces Mary to return to her parents home with a promise that he will soon follow. Hugo later sends Mary a letter stating that although he is now a citizen, he is not being accepted as an American. He also informs her at the end of the letter that he is returning to Europe to fight for his people. Mary is devastated and divorces Hugo. Mary volunteers her time in a USO-like organization supporting the American war effort. Mary goes to France where she meets two new arrivals, Martha Sewell and Serena Honeywell, who are petrified that they will be taken prisoner and ravished by the Germans. Martha even brings along a pistol for protection and poison pills to take if she is captured. Mary quickly confiscates them. The American Army is just about to kick off their Meuse-Argonne Offensive, but there are rumors that nearby there is a German spy who is collecting information. In a canteen, Mary recognizes Hugo dressed in a US Army uniform and urges him to escape because she realizes she still loves him. Hugo leaves just as Jeff arrives looking for the spy. Knowing that Jeff would immediately recognize Hugo, Mary diverts Jeff's attention long enough for Hugo to get away safely. Upon returning to her room, Mary finds Hugo there and they share a night together. As Hugo prepares to leave, Mary is torn between her love for Hugo and her duty to protect the lives of hundreds of American soldiers. She asks Hugo to delay his departure until dawn and to have a glass of wine with her before he goes. Mary prepares two glasses of wine but secretly drops poison pills in each.

In my immediate family my father > makes concerete tanks, my mother's an industrial machinist and my brother's > a bricklayer. Helen Kedgley and Bob Maysmor, the curators of the 2008 exhibition Samoacontemporary, describe Laita‚Äôs work as ‚Äòlayered with feeling ‚Äì many of her paintings explore intense personal experiences and family histories. Laita often embeds words and phrases in her paintings, hinting at veiled knowledge and withheld information; she deliberately avoids overt messages in her work.‚Äô Karen Stevenson writes of Laita's work, 'Her artistic practice has to do with creating a visual language that reflects the complexity of the oral traditions of the past.' Stevenson adds, 'As one would slowly build images in the mind's eye, Laita creates images that reveal; but only after the viewer has truly looked. Language, people and images of cultural knowledge emerge from what appears to be an abstract canvas.' =Vahine Collective= Lily Laita works collaboratively with artists Niki Hastings-McFall and Lonnie Hutchinson as the 'Vahine Collective'. In 2012 the group received the 2012 Creative New Zealand and the National University of Samoa Artist in Residence. They spent one month in Samoa and built on research they began for their exhibition Vahine in 2002 on ancient rock platforms called tia seu lupe (pigeon snaring mounds). Exhibitions Laita has exhibited prolifically in New Zealand and internationally including Te Moemoea no Iotefa (1990/1991), Bottled Ocean (1993/1994) and Vahine (2003). She has been part of major group exhibitions including the Samoa Contemporary touring exhibition which opened at the Pataka Museum and Gallery in Wellington 2008, followed by the Sarjeant Gallery, Wanganui and Tauranga Art Gallery in 2009. She was part of This is not a Vitrine, this is an Ocean at Waikato Museum Te Whare Taonga o Waikato in 2011. In 2014, Laita's solo exhibition, Va I ta ‚Äì Illumination, opened at Whitespace in Auckland.

Entrepreneurial life Tuzman started at Brown University and transferred to Harvard starting his sophomore year. After graduating from Harvard University, Tuzman worked for five years at Goldman Sachs, before launching govWorks, Inc., an Internet startup, along with his childhood friend Tom Herman. As the company's CEO, Tuzman raised $60 million in venture capital. Following the burst of the \\"dot- com bubble\\" govWorks was sold to First Data Corp. for nearly $12 million, which did not cover the over $35 million in debt. The journey from the company's founding to its sale was chronicled in a documentary Startup.com (2001), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001. Tuzman then founded Recognition Group (later called KIT Capital), a company aimed at providing exit strategies, financial restructuring, and interim management for distressed companies. Among dozens of projects, KIT Capital managed the sale of Tigris Corp., a privately held strategic sourcing and supply chain consultancy based in New York City, to Verticalnet, Inc. in 2004. In 2001, KIT Capital/Recognition Group took over KPE, a struggling web development subsidiary of Grey Global Group, where Tuzman took the role of the CEO and chairman. He sold the company to Mobilocity, Inc. (which was subsequently sold to Agency.com) less than a year later. In May 2005, Tuzman was brought in as the President of JumpTV, a small start-up that focused on delivering foreign Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) content. Under his leadership, the company grew to become a leading company in delivery of syndicated foreign television content over the Internet around the globe. In August 2006, Tuzman JumpTV's IPO, with Morgan Stanley as the lead underwriter, raised over $60 million; they raised an additional $100 million in a secondary offering, less than a year later. In late 2007, Tuzman sold in the public market a substantial portion of his shareholding interest in JumpTV, which subsequently floundered. In late 2007, Tuzman purchased a controlling interest in ROO Group and became the company's CEO and chairman of the board. After financial restructuring and key acquisitions ROO, an Internet video technologies company, became one of the leading end-to-end IP video providers under the new name of KIT digital. KIT digital listed on the NASDAQ Global Market in August 2009 under the ticker \\"KITD\\". Tuzman left KIT digital in April 2012. After his departure, Tuzman made public bids to acquire the company in several open letters to KIT digital's board of directors, saying that he believed the company was being purposefully mismanaged to bankruptcy by insiders. Arrest and conviction On Monday, September 7, 2015, Tuzman was arrested in Colombia on charges of accounting fraud; the following day, KIT Digital's former chief financial officer, Robin Smyth, was arrested in Australia. Together with Omar Amanat and Stephen Maiden, manager of the Maiden Capital hedge fund,\\"NJ Investment Manager Denies KIT Digital Fraud\\" they were charged with a series of crimes related to three criminal \\"schemes\\".This Week In Securities Litigation, January 8, 2018. Subsection: Manipulation‚Äîfinancial fraud: U.S. v. Tuzman. First, with respect to Maiden Capital, between February 2009 and June 2012 Amanat and others carried out a scheme to conceal the fact that firm clients suffered losses from an investment in Enable Invest Ltd, a hedge fund run by Amanat's brother for which he had raised capital using a series of misrepresentations. The second scheme involved a market manipulation involving the shares of KIT Digital (KITD). Maiden, at the request of Tuzman and Amanat, had driven up the price of KITD's shares when the company was seeking to raise money and shortly before the shares were listed on NASDAQ. The third scheme involved an accounting fraud that took place over a two-year period beginning in 2010. This scheme, designed to fraudulently inflate the revenue of KITD, involved the use of improper revenue recognition and sham round trip transactions. KIT Digital filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and is now known as Piksel, Inc. Following his arrest, Tuzman was held in La Picota prison in Bogot√°, awaiting extradition. The conditions at La Picota prompted his legal team to file a complaint with the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (part of the Organization of American States), which was signed by over 150 other inmates citing numerous abuses such as lack of medical care, lack of running water, extortion, etc. The complaint has been acknowledged by the commission and has resulted in an investigation into the Colombian prison system. He was extradited to the United States, and at his bail hearing in July 2016, Tuzman claimed to have few assets left and significant liabilities, but prosecutors noted that Tuzman was wearing a $70,000 watch and the judge doubled his bail to $5 million.\\"$70,000 watch costs businessman accused extra $2.5M in bail\\" Tuzman's trial for 20 charges of fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, false statements in SEC reports, and manipulative and deceptive practices, began on October 30, 2017.law360 Smyth and another former KIT executive had earlier pleaded guilty and become government witnesses, as had Stephen Maiden. Over the course of a six-week trial they detailed the fraud for the jury, including the roles of Tuzman and Amanat in orchestrating it. In December 2017, Tuzman and Amanat were found guilty on all charges (in Tuzman's case, market manipulation conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy relating to defrauding KIT Digital shareholders, and accounting fraud conspiracy relating to KIT Digital).

George calls him \\"a prominent lieutenant of Lokmanya Tilak\\". He was editor of Kesari, Lokmanya and Navakal. The subject of navakal is political , trade and market price Khadilkar in the beginning of his career wrote prose-plays, but achieved \\"even greater recognition\\" with plays like Svayamvara ‚Äì which had songs which were based on Indian classical music. The notability of his dramatic technique, in his fifteen plays, was to \\"endow ancient Hindu legends and tales with contemporary political significance\\". The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), remarks that while Annasaheb Kirloskar \\"laid the foundation of popular sangit natak\\", it saw its great rise and gradual decline with the advent of Khadilkar. It considers Khadilkar along with Bal Gandharva as \\"the architect of what later on came to be called the golden age of the Marathi drama\\". In 1921, after Tilak's death, Lokmanya was founded by admirers of Tilak. Khadilkar assumed its editorship. In 1923 he resigned because of his support of Gandhi's position in division of nationalist political opinion, under opposition from the promoters who rejected it. In March 1923 Khadilkar started his own newspaper Nava Kaal, which \\"supported Gandhi's programme\\" and its editorials \\"preached Gandhi's philosophy. Life and career Khadilkar was born on 25 November 1872 in Sangli. At the age of 15, he wrote a novel, and the next year he wrote a play. He received his B.A. degree in 1892 from Deccan College in Pune. Out of his abiding interest in plays, he closely studied during his college years the plays of Sanskrit and English playwrights. Association with Tilak In 1897, Khadilkar joined the editorial staff of Bal Gangadhar Tilak's daily Kesari (‡§ï‡•á‡§∏‡§∞‡•Ä). His ideas and literary style so closely matched those of Tilak that the readers of Kesari never knew as to which of the two had written the editorials appearing in the newspaper. In 1908 the colonial government arrested Tilak on charges of sedition for an article written by Khadilkar. Tilak was sentenced to six years transportation to be served in Mandalay. During 1908‚Äì10, Khadilkar served as the chief editor of Tilak's English daily Maratha besides serving on the editorial board of Kesari. In 1910, he left the editorship of both Kesari and Maratha, but returned to work as the editor of Keasari during 1917‚Äì20. =Plotted Nepalese invasion of India= Khadilkar was a part of plot that envisioned the invasion of India by the only indedendent Hindu King of a part of India: The king of Nepal. This invasion was to spark an uprising within the country in his support, so that India would be one sovereign Hindu state under the King of Nepal. Tilak's trusted lieutenants Vasukaka Joshi and Khadilkar, entered Nepal, \\"where they set up a tile factory, as a respectale front for an arms and munitions plant designed to supply to the invading Nepalese army.\\" A Maharashtrian school teacher Mataji, introduced the two to the King of Nepal. They received a contract to retile the palace roof. They were joined by Hanmantrao Kulkarni of Jabalpur and Ketkar from Gwalior. The King of Nepal was influenced to send Nepalese students to Japan for technical training. Joshi went to Japan and the United States. The German arms manufacturing machinery never arrived. The plot never \\"even approached fruition\\". Later career After Tilak's death in 1920, Khadilkar worked as the editor of daily Lokamanya (‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø) during 1921‚Äì23. In 1923, he founded daily Nava Kal (‡§®‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≥), which supported Gandhi. In 1929, British authorities imprisoned Khadilkar for a year for the crime of disloyalty to the colonial government. Khadilkar presided over Marathi Sahitya Sammelan at Nagpur in 1933. He died on 26 August 1948. Kichak Vadh Kichak Vadh (The Assassination of Kichak) (1907) is a play based on an episode in the Mahabharat, Kichak is a minister at the court of Virat who attempts to molest Draupadi, he is assassinated by her husband Bhima as a result. The play was a manifestation of resistance to British rule. This molestation is used as a metaphor for the policies of the British colonial government in India. Kichak represented Lord Curzon: Viceroy to the King, just as Kichak was minister to King Virat; Draupadi represented India and Bhima represented an extremist nationalist, in contrast to Yudhishtar, standing for moderate nationalism. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature... states that \\"Kichaka was cast in the mould of the then Viceroy, Lord Curzon, and some of his aggressively arrogant utterences (like, 'the rulers are rulers and the slaves are slaves') found direct echoes in the words of Kichaka, while the popular mood of resentment and revolt was vehemently expressed by the fiery speeches of Draupadi and Bhima\\" Bhatia considers that the playwright contrasts the aggression and hatred of the government for its colonial subjects with the resistance of those who attempt rescue the nation from colonial evils. Themes of sacrifice, war and duty \\"sharpened the quest of freedom\\". The play was an allegorical attack on the colonial government. Nagendra considers the play as a notable example of the use of a mythological character as a symbol of oppression. =Audience reaction to Kichak Vadh= Ignatius Valentine Chirol's 1910 book Indian Unrest describes the play's plot and explains the allegories. According to Chirol, the play provides a response to John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn, who ridiculed the boast of radical nationalists that they could free their country and defend it from invaders. Chirol suggests that any Englishman who saw the play would remember vividly the tense scowling face of the men as they watch the outrages of Kichak and tearful eyes of the ladies as they watch \\"Draupadi's entreaties\\", \\"their scorn for Yudhishthira's tameness, their admiration of Bhima's passionate protests, and the deep hum of satisfaction which approves the slaughter of the tyrant.\\" =Ban= The Press Act in India was requested for sanction by the Government of India, in response to the sudden rise in revolutionary activities in 1909. Morley refused in deference to hostile reactions from the English public and \\"'Friends of India' members of the Parliament.\\" Kincaid was asked to write on the \\"seditious climate fostered by the native papers\\". Kincaid wrote four articles in the Times, amongst them was \\"A seditious play of the Deccan', a critique of the Marathi play Kichak Vadh by K. P. Khadilkar\\" as an example of sedition. These articles written on 18 January 1910, not only hastened the passage of the India Press Act of 1910 but also called for Kichak Vadh to be banned. The articles were reproduced by The Times of India and Bombay Gazette on 5 and 7 February 1910 respectively. The play was finally banned. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: K to Navalram mentions that \\"the London Times, in an eloquent outburst against this play, said in effect, Khadilkar is a most dangerous extremist, and Kichak Vadha is a cleverly veiled incitement to murder the European officials.\\" Plays The following is the list of Khadilkar's plays: # Savai Madhavrao Yancha Mrutyu (‡§∏‡§µ‡§æ‡§à ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§µ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å)(1895‚Äì96) # Bhaubandaki (‡§≠‡§æ‡§ä‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶‡§ï‡•Ä) (1909): Described as his last political play. # Kanchangadachi Mohana (‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡§®‡§ó‡§°‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π‡§®‡§æ) # Manapman (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®) (1911) # Swayamvar (‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§µ‡§∞) (1916) # Keechak-Wadh (‡§ï‡•Ä‡§ö‡§ï‡§µ‡§ß) (1906) # Menaka (‡§Æ‡•á‡§®‡§ï‡§æ) # Widyaharan (‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§π‡§∞‡§£) (1913) # Sawitri (‡§∏‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä) # Draupadi (‡§¶‡•å‡§™‡§¶‡•Ä) (1920) # Sawati Matsar (‡§∏‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞) # Satwa Pariksha (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ)) # Bayakanche Banda (‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§°) # Tridandi Sanyas (‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏) # Prem Sarkar considers Khadilkar a versatile genius who created \\"several types of womanhood in some of his dramas in verse.\\" Vidyaharan (Stealing of learning) \\"will be found to be more complex in treatment of the relations between the sexes than is Rabindranath Tagore's Chitra. ...

It has also been suggested that a Mr Basket was in charge of issuing timber-cutting licences in the very early days; however, there is no evidence of any Mr Basket having lived there or been in charge of licences.http://www.anps.org.au/documents/June_2005.pdf Placenames Australia - Recording Indigenous Placenames The town's main industries include apple and cherry orchards, and there are numerous cottages available for bed and breakfast accommodation.http://www.takeabreak.com.au/NortonSummitArea/AdelaideHills/Burdetts- Country-Retreats.htm Basket Range Primary School was established in 1885, and the Basket Range CFS was founded in 1969.http://www.etcfs.org.au/index.php?page=basket-range Basket Range Post Office opened on 1 April 1892.

Later, he was heavily involved as an investigator for the Arkansas Project, a co-ordinated attempt in the 1990s to investigate then U.S. President Bill Clinton. The project was funded by conservative media billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Background Armistead was born in Lula, a rural community in Coahoma County in northern Mississippi, to Roscoe Perry Armistead (1903-1966) and the former Eula Mae Perryman (1907-2004). He attended Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, and Memphis State University in Memphis, Tennessee. He served in the United States Army in the Korean War. He was a member of the Masonic lodge, the Shriners, and the American Legion. Career He began his work in law enforcement as a deputy sheriff for Coahoma County. He then was employed for many years as a state highway patrol officer. In the 1960s, as head of the highway patrol, he was sent to work for the Sovereignty Commission, a state body established to develop a legal method of maintaining Mississippi's then racial segregationist laws. He was selected to investigate the \\"Dixie Mafia\\" (a term Armistead apparently coined himself) by the then-Governor John Bell Williams, a Democrat. His role was investigative; he had no powers of arrest. After working undercover, he became chief investigator of the highway patrol, during which time he was present in May 1970 at the Jackson State Killings, when state police opened fire on African-American student protesters at Jackson State College in the Mississippi state capital; two students were killed. He was one of the police witnesses who controversially alleged the presence of a student sniper, providing a pretext for the shooting. This allegation was dismissed by congressional investigation. Armistead then became chief investigator of the state Bureau of Identification, and then director of the criminal investigation section of the Mississippi Department of Safety, before becoming head of the Mississippi state police. =Working against the Dixie Mafia= In 1976, Armistead became director of the Organized Crime Strike Force in New Orleans, Louisiana. In an interview, he characterized the Dixie mafia as more ruthless than Cosa Nostra: \\"There wasn't a well from Mississippi to West Texas that didn't have a dead body floating in it. The big difference was the lack of ceremony. It was just 'I'm going to get rid of Ambrose today; I don't need permission; and I go out and do it.' As simple as that. And that's the end of Ambrose. It hasn't changed much either.\\". =Regional Organized Crime Information Center= On leaving the police, in the late 1970s, Armistead ran a non-profit crime-fighting organisation called the Regional Organized Crime Information Center in Memphis, which received a $2.3 million-a-year grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Agency to help local police and prosecutors track the movements of habitual felony offenders across state lines. Former Memphis police director E. Winslow 'Buddy' Chapman has said that he never found evidence of what the center did; Justice Department accounting officials have said records of Armistead's grant proposal and other documents no longer exist. The ACLU raised concerns that the center was spying on private citizens. =As a private detective= He later became a private detective \\"specialized in political dirty tricks on behalf of Republican candidates\\". Most notably he was involved in the smearing in 1983 of Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate Bill Allain, having fostered rumors that Allain had had sexual relations with three transvestites, a plot eventually uncovered by ABC's 20/20 program. Allain went on to win the election anyway by defeating Republican nominee Leon Bramlett. Armistead was hired to investigate (and solve) the organized crime-related murders of Biloxi judge Vince Sherry and his wife (and former city councillor) Margaret. Resistance to the civil rights movement Joe Conason notes that Armistead rose to be chief of Mississippi State Police under Governor John Bell Williams, \\"the last openly racist governor of Mississippi\\" and that \\"Armistead rose to power during an era of official terrorism and violent repression against black citizens and civil rights advocates\\". Former fellow anti- Clintonite David Brock has alleged that Armistead was involved in \\"white resistance to civil rights\\". In addition to his involvement in the cover-up in the Jackson state killings, as part of the Sovereignty Commission, Armistead was involved in surveillance of potential threats to the existing segregated order. On one occasion he engineered the removal of a university campus security chief for trying to arrest a white student who had administered a beating to a black student. Involvement in the Arkansas Project According to documents recovered from the American Spectator, Armistead was paid at least $353,517 by the Arkansas Project. The Washington Post says that it is not entirely clear what services he provided for that money, although it has been established that Armistead was involved in promoting three key aspersions of the Arkansas Project narrative - that Clinton had been protecting drug smuggling, that Clinton had himself used cocaine, and that Clinton was implicated in the alleged murder of Vince Foster. Armistead provided results from his investigations into Clinton's alleged protection of a cocaine smuggling ring while Clinton was governor of Arkansas to the House Banking Committee. All allegations were judged by federal authorities to be without foundation. =Attempts to implicate Clinton in cocaine smuggling and use= Armistead was funded by Scaife to investigate rumors of Bill Clinton's involvement in helping cocaine runners in rural Arkansas. The substance of the allegation was that Clinton had turned a blind eye to cocaine smugglers operating out of an airport in Mena, Arkansas, because a wealthy campaign contributor was said to profit from the illicit activity, and also because proceeds from the smuggling were allegedly funding a covert CIA operation. These rumors had originated earlier in the decade with talk radio shows in Arkansas funded by the conservative Citizens for Honest Government organization associated with the Virginia evangelist Jerry Falwell. This organisation had also been involved in payments to witness in the Troopergate affair. Armistead travelled across North and South America purportedly gaining information, which he supplied to the House Banking Committee. Three federal investigations found that these allegations had no basis whatsoever. Under questioning, Armistead also misled Federal Drug Enforcement Administration officers twice about the source of his funds (which was Scaife), claiming alternately funding from the Republican National Convention (who later denied all contact) and from the House Banking Committee. David Runkel, House Banking Committee spokesman, admitted that they had met with Armistead on a number of occasions, but denied he was a primary source for allegations that they were investigating. Armistead's report also formed the basis for articles in the American Spectator. Armistead also investigated allegations that Bill Clinton had once used cocaine himself, providing material for R. Emmett Tyrrell, editor of the American Spectator, who published the (unsupported) allegations just before the 1996 presidential election. =Vince Foster murder rumors= On July 20, 1993 in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia, Vince Foster, a deputy White House Counsel during Clinton's first presidential term, was found with a gunshot to the head, a day after contacting his doctor to get treatment for depression. Several official investigations concluded unequivocally that the death was a suicide. However, as he was a law partner and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, it was alleged by a number of anti-Clinton conspiracy theorists that his knowledge of the Clintons' financial affairs (which the Whitewater theorists claimed would reveal their illegal dealings) had led them to have him killed. Former conservative journalist David Brock recalled being summoned to a meeting with Armistead in Miami, at an airport hotel. Armistead laid out an elaborate \\"Vince Foster murder scenario,\\" Brock said ‚Äì a scenario that he found \\"implausible\\". =Spying on John Camp= Armistead was also found to have been spying on CNN journalist John Camp, after Camp had reported that the cocaine ring allegations against Clinton were groundless. The results of his efforts, a dossier containing information on Camp's private life and that of two of his family members, were passed to the Senate House banking committee. This was not the first time Armistead had spied on journalists; as part of his work for the Sovereignty Commission he had placed television news commentator Howard K. Smith under surveillance. =Connections to the Starr Investigation= Salon reporters also discovered that Armistead had met several times with the head of the Starr investigation team in Little Rock, Arkansas, Hickman Ewing; some of these meetings were attended by federal agents, who have confirmed them. Ewing's association with Armistead went back to the 1970s, when they had known each other and worked together when Ewing was a federal prosecutor in Memphis and Armistead headed a nonprofit crime- fighting organization there. After the Starr Investigation=Investigating the death of Steve Kangas= When former military intelligence specialist turned progressive writer Steve Kangas committed suicide less than sixty feet from Richard Scaife's office in February 1999, Scaife hired Armistead, along with Richard Gazarik, a reporter from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (a newspaper owned by Scaife), to investigate the circumstances of Kangas' death. Kangas had been critical of Scaife on online forums including Kangas' own website Liberal Resurgent. He had accused Scaife of being head of a vast right-wing conspiracy, and of persecuting Bill Clinton, whom Kangas considered to be a moderate Republican. Kangas was found with a pistol and forty-eight rounds of ammunition. Armistead and Gazarik were investigating whether Kangas had been out to kill Scaife. They spoke to his family, reviewed his Internet postings, and checked both his apartment and place of employment. It has subsequently been claimed that Scaife's use of Armistead and Gazarik has fuelled conspiracy theories about Kangas' death. =Armistead v. Minor= In 2002, Armistead lost a libel case against the Mississippi journalist Bill Minor. In a 1998 regular \\"Eyes on Mississippi\\" column, Minor referred to Armistead's \\"odoriferous background in Mississippi, ranging all the way from head-bashing of black civil rights workers to concocting a bizarre homosexual scandal in an attempt to defeat a gubernatorial candidate.\\" The column was ruled by an 8-0 decision to be \\"substantially true\\". This case was heard on appeal because a lower court had ruled that Armistead was \\"libel-proof, meaning that his reputation was so bad that defamatory statements could not hurt him [any] more\\", a decision overturned by the appellate judge. Death Despite the slur from the court, Armistead's obituary refers to his \\"devoting his life to serving others through law enforcement.\\" The obituary does not mention the Sovereignty Commission or the Arkansas Project. His services, with Mississippi Highway Patrol honors, were held at the Tunica Presbyterian Church in Tunica, Mississippi, at which he was a member. He is interred along with his parents and wife at Oakridge Cemetery in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

Multidisciplinary team involvement can range from physiotherapists, occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, doctors, pharmacologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and sports physiologists. Prehab can be applied to surgical populations in oncology, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular and orthopaedic settings. The intention is that increasing baseline fitness prior to surgery will allow for relatively higher fitness post-operatively. Prehabilitation interventions are tailored to the patient so that even those with high amounts of comorbidities can receive a positive outcome. Research evidence is mixed, but suggests that prehabilitation reduces hospital stays and therefore risk of hospital acquired infections such as pneumonia. In 2013, a pilot study of prehabilitation in colorectal surgery found that it improved postoperative functional recovery, measured in terms of the walking capacity at 4 weeks and 8 weeks (although the time in hospital and post-operative complications were similar), is also being considered for use in some cardiovascular interventions, and may also be of some benefit for preventing lung complications, such as pulmonary atelactasis, in general surgery.

In musical notation, this is represented by an \\"X\\" for a note head instead of an oval, or parentheses around the note head.\\" False note\\", OnMusic Dictionary. It should not be confused with the X-shaped notation that raises a note to a double sharp. On stringed instruments, this is played by sounding a muted string. \\"Muted to the point where it is more percussive sounding than obvious and clear in pitch. There is a pitch, to be sure, but its musical value is more rhythmic than melodic or harmonic...they add momentum and drive to any bass line.\\" Occurring in a rhythmic figure, they are purposely deemphasized, often to the point of near silence. In popular music drumming, these notes are played \\"very softly between the 'main' notes,\\" (off the beat on the sixteenth notes) most often on the snare drum in a drum kit.Mattingly, Rick (2006). All About Drums, p.61. Hal Leonard. . Ghost notes are often used by electric bass players and double bass players in a range of popular music and traditional music styles. In vocal music, it represents words that are spoken in rhythm rather than sung. Terminology Ghost notes are also called \\"dead notes\\", \\"muted notes\\", \\"silenced notes\\" or \\"false notes\\". Instrumental music Ghost notes, however, are not simply the unaccented notes in a pattern. The unaccented notes in such a pattern as a clave are considered to represent the mean level of emphasis‚Äîthey are neither absolutely emphasized nor unemphasized. If one further deemphasizes one of these unaccented notes to the same or a similar extent to which the accented notes in the pattern are emphasized, then one has 'ghosted' that note. In a case in which a ghost note is deemphasized to the point of silence, that note then represents a rhythmic placeholder in much the same way as does a rest. This can be a very fine distinction, and the ability of an instrumentalist to differentiate between what is a ghost note and what is a rest is governed largely by the acoustic nature of the instrument. Wind instruments, including the human voice, and guitars are examples of instruments generally capable of ghosting notes without making them synonymous with rests, while a pianist or percussionist would have more difficulty in creating this distinction because of the percussive nature of the instruments, which hampers the resolution of the volume gradient as one approaches silence. However, in such a case as that the ghost notes were clearly audible, while being far less prominent than the unaccented notes which represent the mean degree of emphasis within the example, then a percussionist could be said to create what we might define as ghost notes. A frequent misconception is that grace notes and ghost notes are synonymous. A grace note is by definition decidedly shorter in length than the principal note which it 'graces', but in many examples the grace note receives a greater degree of accentuation (emphasis) than the principal itself, even though it is a much shorter note than the principal. In other words, while a grace note could be ghosted, the ghosting of notes is a function of volume rather than of duration. =Percussion= Drumming: Ghost notes indicated by parentheses, main notes distinguished by accents In drumming, a ghost note is played at very low volume, typically on a snare drum. In musical notation, ghost notes are indicated in parenthesis surrounding the note. According to The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco, the purpose of a ghost note is to \\"...be heard under the main sound of the groove. This produces a subtle 16th-note feel around a strong back beat or certain accents.\\" The term ghost note, then, can have various meanings. The term anti-accent is more specific. Moreover, there exists a set of anti-accent marks to show gradation more specifically. Percussion music in particular makes use of anti-accent marks, as follows: #slightly softer than surrounding notes: ‚ó° (breve) #significantly softer than surrounding notes: ( ) (note head in parentheses) #much softer than surrounding notes: [ ] (note head in square brackets) Examples can be heard in the drumming of Harvey Mason, Mike Clark, Bernard Purdie,Gianni, Jason (2003) The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco, p. 35.

Stuff! Good Bass Players Should Know, p.51-52. . A guitarist wishing to ghost a note can decrease the pressure the fretting hand is exerting upon the strings without removing the hand from the fretboard (which would result in the sounding of the open pitches of those strings). This is sometimes called a 'scratch', and is considered a ghost note unless all the unaccented notes in the pattern were 'scratched' (in which case the scratches are unaccented notes). On the double bass and electric bass, as with the guitar, ghost notes can be performed by muting the strings, either with the fretting hand or the plucking/picking hand, which creates notes of indeterminate pitch that have a percussive quality. On the electric bass, ghost notes are widely used in the slap bass style, as a way of creating a percussive, drum-like sound in funk and Latin music. On the double bass, percussive ghost notes are sometimes performed by slapping the strings against the fingerboard, which creates a percussive, \\"clacky\\" sound. With the double bass, slap-style ghost notes are used in rockabilly, bluegrass, and traditional blues and swing jazz. Bassists James Jamerson (of Motown), Carol Kaye (of Motown), Rocco Prestia (for Tower of Power), and Chuck Rainey (for Steely Dan, Aretha Franklin, and others) all include \\"tons of ghost notes done right\\" in their playing.  Vocal music  In vocal music, especially in musical theater, a ghost note represents that the lyrics must be spoken rather than sung, retaining the marked rhythm but having indeterminate pitch. Notes with value less than a half note use an \\"X\\" instead of an oval as a note head. Occasionally a half note or whole note is represented with an open diamond note head, often representing a scream or grunt. As an extreme example, ghost notes are almost exclusively used in \\"Rock Island\\", the opening number of The Music Man. This notation may also indicate Sprechstimme or rapping.

Classification Molecular studies have provided evidence that this species' closest relative is Papilio phorcas, with Papilio constantinus being the next closest (see images below). It is a member of the Papilio genus of which Papilio appalachiensis and Papilio xuthus are also members. Papilio dardanus is the nominal member of the dardanus species group.

This female-limited mimicry was first described in 1869 by Roland Trimen. Males have a more or less uniform appearance throughout the species' range, but females come in at least 14 varieties or morphs. Some female morphs share a very similar pattern of colouration with various species of distasteful butterfly (e.g. from the Danainae, a subfamily of nymphalids), while others have been found that mimic male appearance (andromorphs). The persistence of these various morphs or different types of females may be explained by frequency dependent selection. Cook et al. suggest that Batesian mimics gain a fitness advantage by avoiding predators, but suffer harassment from males (see sexual conflict), whereas andromorphs (male mimics) are vulnerable to predation but are not harassed by male mating attempts. Morphs are divided into three general groups based on patterning: the hippocoon group, the cenea group, and the planemoides group. The hippocoon group holds the largest amount of morphs; phenotypes within this group are characterized by four bands of alternating black and color patterns. Within the cenea group patterns are greatly dominated by black coloration and contain small splotches of color. The planemoides group has black bands surrounding the outside of the wing with a large splotch of color through the middle of the wing. This group also contains the female forms that are male-like mimics. Diversity in the wing patterns of each group is seen mostly in the coloration of each organism, while black patterns are generally consistent in each morph. Phenotypic variation within the female morphs of Papilio dardanus has been found to be controlled at one locus named H that contains at least 11 different alleles. Recent studies have narrowed down the region of H to approximately 24 genes that is centered around the engrailed (en) gene which codes for specific transcription factors. The engrailed site has been found to have non- synonymous mutations throughout individuals in the species which would allow the divergence of each morph. Studies support that the engrailed gene in Papilio dardanus is monophyletic and has only evolved once within the species. Findings also suggest that the many different mimetic alleles in the Papilio dardanus genome are solely from mutations in the species. In other words, alleles did not enter into the genome from genetic transfer from other species. Different combinations of the alleles at H lead to the variety of forms seen within the species. Genetic crosses of individuals found a general dominance hierarchy within the alleles. Allele combinations also determine not only which morph will be expressed but the actual size of the patterns shown. Each allele is able to either influence a larger or smaller mimetic pattern in an organism. Such female-limited Batesian mimicry is not unique to this species, even in the genus Papilio. For instance Papilio memnon shows a similar case of polymorphism in females. Similarly, male mimicry has been observed in another insect, a damselfly Ischnura ramburii which also appears to have evolved camouflage to avoid sexual coercion by males.Lessells, K.

The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA), popularly dubbed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and from 1969 onwards known as the House Committee on Internal Security, was an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives. The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having Fascist or Communist ties. When the House abolished the committee in 1975, its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee. The committee's anti-communist investigations are often compared to (and confused with) those of Joseph McCarthyFor example, see who, as a U.S. Senator, had no direct involvement with the House committee.Patrick Doherty, Thomas. Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture. 2003, pp. 15‚Äì16. McCarthy was the chairman of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate, not the House. History=Precursors to the committee=Overman Committee (1918) Lee Slater Overman headed the first congressional investigation of American communism back in 1919. The Overman Committee was a subcommittee of the committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democratic Senator Lee Slater Overman that operated from September 1918 to June 1919. The subcommittee investigated German as well as Bolshevik elements in the United States.Schmidt, p. 136 This committee was originally concerned with investigating pro-German sentiments in the American liquor industry. After World War I ended in November 1918, and the German threat lessened, the committee began investigating Bolshevism, which had appeared as a threat during the First Red Scare after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The committee's hearing into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted February 11 to March 10, 1919, had a decisive role in constructing an image of a radical threat to the United States during the first Red Scare.Schmidt, p. 144 Fish Committee (1930) U.S. Representative Hamilton Fish III (R-NY), who was a fervent anti-communist, introduced, on May 5, 1930, House Resolution 180, which proposed to establish a committee to investigate communist activities in the United States. The resulting committee, commonly known as the Fish Committee, undertook extensive investigations of people and organizations suspected of being involved with or supporting communist activities in the United States. Among the committee's targets were the American Civil Liberties Union and communist presidential candidate William Z. Foster.Memoirs, pp. 41‚Äì42 The committee recommended granting the United States Department of Justice more authority to investigate communists, and strengthening of immigration and deportation laws to keep communists out of the United States.To Added Law for Curb on Reds The New York Times, November 18, 1930 p. 21 McCormack‚ÄìDickstein Committee (1934-1937) From 1934 to 1937, the Special Committee on Un-American Activities Authorized to Investigate Nazi Propaganda and Certain Other Propaganda Activities, chaired by John William McCormack (D-Mass.) and Samuel Dickstein (D-NY), held public and private hearings and collected testimony filling 4,300 pages. The committee was widely known as the McCormack‚ÄìDickstein committee. Its mandate was to get \\"information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it\\". Its records are held by the National Archives and Records Administration as records related to HUAC. In 1934, the Special Committee subpoenaed most of the leaders of the fascist movement in the United States. Beginning in November 1934, the committee investigated allegations of a fascist plot to seize the White House, known as the \\"Business Plot\\". Contemporary newspapers widely reported the plot as a hoax. However contemporary sources and some of those involved, such as Gen. Smedley Butler, confirmed the validity of such a plot. It has been reported that while Dickstein served on this committee and the subsequent Special investigation Committee, he was paid $1,250 a month by the Soviet NKVD, which hoped to get secret congressional information on anti-communists and pro-fascists. It is unclear whether he actually passed on any information. Dies Committee (1938-1944) Conservative Texas Democrat Martin Dies served as chair of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, predecessor to the permanent committee, for its entire seven-year duration. On May 26, 1938, the House Committee on Un-American Activities was established as a special investigating committee, reorganized from its previous incarnations as the Fish Committee and the McCormack-Dickstein Committee, to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having communist or fascist ties; however, it concentrated its efforts on communists. It was chaired by Martin Dies Jr. (D-Tex.), and therefore known as the Dies Committee. Its records are held by the National Archives and Records Administration as records related to HUAC. In 1938, Hallie Flanagan, the head of the Federal Theatre Project, was subpoenaed to appear before the committee to answer the charge the project was overrun with communists. Flanagan was called to testify for only a part of one day, while a clerk from the project was called in for two entire days. It was during this investigation that one of the committee members, Joe Starnes (D-Ala.), famously asked Flanagan whether the Elizabethan era playwright Christopher Marlowe was a member of the Communist Party, and mused \\"Mr. Euripides\\" preached class warfare. In 1939, the committee investigated people involved with pro-Nazi organizations such as Oscar C. Pfaus and George Van Horn Moseley.\\"Saturday, October 21, 1939\\" in \\"Moseley, George Van Horn (1874-1960)\\" in Moseley testified before the committee for five hours about a \\"Jewish Communist conspiracy\\" to take control of the US government. Moseley was supported by Donald Shea of the American Gentile League, whose statement was deleted from the public record as the committee found it so objectionable.New York Times: \\"The News of the Week in Review,\\" June 4, 1939, accessed April 4, 2011 The committee also put together an argument for the internment of Japanese Americans known as the \\"Yellow Report\\".Myer, Dillon S. Uprooted Americans. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1971. p. 19. Organized in response to rumors of Japanese Americans being coddled by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) and news that some former inmates would be allowed to leave camp and Nisei soldiers to return to the West Coast, the committee investigated charges of fifth column activity in the camps. A number of anti- WRA arguments were presented in subsequent hearings, but Director Dillon Myer debunked the more inflammatory claims. The investigation was presented to the 77th Congress, and alleged that certain cultural traits ‚Äì Japanese loyalty to the Emperor, the number of Japanese fishermen in the US, and the Buddhist faith ‚Äì were evidence for Japanese espionage. With the exception of Rep. Herman Eberharter (D-Pa.), the members of the committee seemed to support internment, and its recommendations to expedite the impending segregation of \\"troublemakers\\", establish a system to investigate applicants for leave clearance, and step up Americanization and assimilation efforts largely coincided with WRA goals. In 1946, the committee considered opening investigations into the Ku Klux Klan, but decided against doing so, prompting white supremacist committee member John E. Rankin (D-Miss.) to remark, \\"After all, the KKK is an old American institution.\\"Newton, Michael. The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi A History. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co, 2010, p. 102. Instead of the Klan, HUAC concentrated on investigating the possibility that the American Communist Party had infiltrated the Works Progress Administration, including the Federal Theatre Project and the Federal Writers' Project. Twenty years later, in 1965‚Äì1966, however, the committee did conduct an investigation into Klan activities under chairman Edwin Willis (D-La.).Newton, p. 162. =Standing Committee (1945-1975)= Democrat Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania was chair of HUAC from 1955 until his death in 1963. The House Committee on Un-American Activities became a standing (permanent) committee in 1945. Democratic Representative Edward J. Hart of New Jersey became the committee's first chairman.Walter Goodman, The Committee, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1968 Under the mandate of Public Law 601, passed by the 79th Congress, the committee of nine representatives investigated suspected threats of subversion or propaganda that attacked \\"the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution\\". Under this mandate, the committee focused its investigations on real and suspected communists in positions of actual or supposed influence in the United States society. A significant step for HUAC was its investigation of the charges of espionage brought against Alger Hiss in 1948. This investigation ultimately resulted in Hiss's trial and conviction for perjury, and convinced many of the usefulness of congressional committees for uncovering communist subversion.Doug Linder, The Alger Hiss Trials ‚Äì 1949‚Äì50 , 2003. =Hollywood blacklist= In 1947, the committee held nine days of hearings into alleged communist propaganda and influence in the Hollywood motion picture industry. After conviction on contempt of Congress charges for refusal to answer some questions posed by committee members, \\"The Hollywood Ten\\" were blacklisted by the industry. Eventually, more than 300 artists ‚Äì including directors, radio commentators, actors, and particularly screenwriters ‚Äì were boycotted by the studios. Some, like Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Alan Lomax, Paul Robeson, and Yip Harburg, left the U.S or went underground to find work. Others like Dalton Trumbo wrote under pseudonyms or the names of colleagues. Only about ten percent succeeded in rebuilding careers within the entertainment industry. In 1947, studio executives told the committee that wartime films - such as Mission to Moscow, The North Star, and Song of Russia - could be considered pro-Soviet propaganda, but claimed that the films were valuable in the context of the Allied war effort, and that they were made (in the case of Mission to Moscow) at the request of White House officials. In response to the House investigations, most studios produced a number of anti-communist and anti- Soviet propaganda films such as The Red Menace (August 1949), The Red Danube (October 1949), The Woman on Pier 13 (October 1949), Guilty of Treason (May 1950, about the ordeal and trial of Cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty), I Was a Communist for the FBI (May 1951, Academy Award nominated for best documentary 1951, also serialized for radio), Red Planet Mars (May 1952), and John Wayne's Big Jim McLain (August 1952).Dan Georgakas, \\"Hollywood Blacklist\\", in: Encyclopedia Of The American Left, 1992. Universal-International Pictures was the only major studio that did not produce such a film. = Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss = Whittaker Chambers (1948) On July 31, 1948, the committee heard testimony from Elizabeth Bentley, an American who had been working as a Soviet agent in New York. Among those whom she named as communists was Harry Dexter White, a senior U.S. Treasury department official. The committee subpoenaed Whittaker Chambers on August 3, 1948. Chambers, too, was a former Soviet spy, by then a senior editor of Time magazine. Alger Hiss (1950) Chambers named more than a half-dozen government officials including White as well as Alger Hiss (and Hiss' brother Donald). Most of these former officials refused to answer committee questions, citing the Fifth Amendment. White denied the allegations, and died of a heart attack a few days later. Hiss also denied all charges; doubts about his testimony though, especially those expressed by freshman Congressman Richard Nixon, led to further investigation that strongly suggested Hiss had made a number of false statements. Hiss challenged Chambers to repeat his charges outside a Congressional committee, which Chambers did. Hiss then sued for libel, leading Chambers to produce copies of State Department documents which he claimed Hiss had given him in 1938. Hiss denied this before a grand jury, was indicted for perjury, and subsequently convicted and imprisoned. The present-day House of Representatives website on HUAC states, \\"In the 1990s, relying on Soviet archives and records from the Venona project ‚Äì a secret U.S. program that decrypted Soviet intelligence messages ‚Äì some scholars argued that Hiss had indeed been a spy on the Kremlin's payroll.\\" =Decline= Democrat Richard Howard Ichord Jr. of Missouri was chair of the renamed House Internal Security Committee from 1969 until its termination in January 1975. In the wake of the downfall of McCarthy (who never served in the House, nor on HUAC), the prestige of HUAC began a gradual decline in the late 1950s. By 1959, the committee was being denounced by former President Harry S. Truman as the \\"most un-American thing in the country today\\".Stephen J. Whitfield. The Culture of the Cold War. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996 In May 1960, the committee held hearings in San Francisco City Hall which led to the infamous riot on May 13, when city police officers fire-hosed protesting students from the UC Berkeley, Stanford, and other local colleges, and dragged them down the marble steps beneath the rotunda, leaving some seriously injured.\\"The Sixties: House Un-American Activities Committee\\" at PBS.org Soviet affairs expert William Mandel, who had been subpoenaed to testify, angrily denounced the committee and the police in a blistering statement which was aired repeatedly for years thereafter on Pacifica Radio station KPFA in Berkeley. An anti- communist propaganda film, Operation Abolition,\\"Operation Abolition\\", Time magazine, 1961.\\"Operation Abolition\\", video.google.com and Time magazine, Friday, March 17, 1961. was produced by the committee from subpoenaed local news reports, and shown around the country during 1960 and 1961. In response, the Northern California ACLU produced a film called Operation Correction, which discussed falsehoods in the first film. Scenes from the hearings and protest were later featured in the Academy Award-nominated 1990 documentary Berkeley in the Sixties. The committee lost considerable prestige as the 1960s progressed, increasingly becoming the target of political satirists and the defiance of a new generation of political activists. HUAC subpoenaed Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman of the Yippies in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Yippies used the media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings. Rubin came to one session dressed as a Revolutionary War soldier and passed out copies of the United States Declaration of Independence to those in attendance. Rubin then \\"blew giant gum bubbles, while his co-witnesses taunted the committee with Nazi salutes\\".Youth International Party, 1992. Rubin attended another session dressed as Santa Claus. On another occasion, police stopped Hoffman at the building entrance and arrested him for wearing the United States flag. Hoffman quipped to the press, \\"I regret that I have but one shirt to give for my country\\", paraphrasing the last words of revolutionary patriot Nathan Hale; Rubin, who was wearing a matching Viet Cong flag, shouted that the police were communists for not arresting him as well.Jerry Rubin, A Yippie Manifesto . Hearings in August 1966 called to investigate anti-Vietnam War activities were disrupted by hundreds of protesters, many from the Progressive Labor Party. The committee faced witnesses who were openly defiant. According to The Harvard Crimson: In an attempt to reinvent itself, the committee was renamed as the Internal Security Committee in 1969. =Termination= The House Committee on Internal Security was formally terminated on January 14, 1975, the day of the opening of the 94th Congress.Charles E.

Listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange since 1983, it has major interests in hotels, travel, maritime services and logistics. The group also has a significant presence in printing, plantations, power generation, financial services, IT, Business Process Outsourcing/Knowledge Process Outsourcing sector, elevator agency services, garments, and property development. Aitken Spence has been recognised by Forbes as one of the most successful publicly traded companies with annual sales under US$1 billion outside of the United States, for three consecutive years. In 2012, Aitken Spence was adjudged the top winner of the Best Corporate Citizen Award in 2017 and 2012 presented by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and has retained the title for 11 consecutive years. The company is one of the first signatories to the UN's Global Compact in Sri Lanka. History Patrick G. Spence Whilst the roots of Aitken Spence can be dated back to Wilson & Archer Partnership of the 1830s in the early British Colonial Ceylon, the company began to take its current form after the signing of a formal partnership agreement between Thomas Clark and Patrick Gordon Spence‚ÄîScottish merchants and shipping agents in Galle‚Äîon 1 September 1868, wherein Clark Spence & Co. was established. Clark Spence & Co.'s trading segment at this stage included exports of natural vein graphite (plumbago), gems, hides, Sappan wood, ebony, coffee, coconut oil, coir yarn, bristle fibre, arrack, and citronella oil to United Kingdom, Continental Europe, United States of America and Australia; and imports of Burmese rice and coal for steamer ship bunkers. On 5 April 1871, Patrick Gordon Spence, secured Clark Spence & Co. as the sole agent of Lloyd's of London in Ceylon. In order to service the Agency for the Lloyd's of London for the Port of Colombo, Clark Spence & Co. partnered with Britton, Aitken & Co. to open a branch office in Colombo. On New Year's Day, 1873, E.C. Britton opted out of the Britton, Aitken & Co. partnership, resulting in Patrick Gordon Spence, Edward Aitken and S.R. Aitken coming together to form Aitken Spence & Co. to manage the operations in Colombo, whilst Clark Spence & Co. continued in partnership to operate in Galle. In 1876, Aitken Spence & Co. obtained the Lloyds agency from Clark Spence & Co. Aitken Spence had also obtained the local agency of Morgan Crucible Company for trading in plumbago. As Colombo became the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence & Co became more prominent and subsequently its partner company, Clark Spence & Co. originally based in Galle, became a subsidiary of Aitken Spence & Co. Edward Aitken By the 1880s, Aitken Spence had also secured the shipping agencies Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd and Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland for Ceylon. The company moved into plantations sector as an agency house in the early 1900s and with the onset of the Great Depression, began to withdraw from its trading business. In 1918, Aitken Spence purchased the Freudenberg Building in Colombo, and made it its company headquarters having renamed the building as Lloyds Building. As a pioneer in port operations, Aitken Spence was entrusted in coordinating the Operations of Colombo Port during the Second World War. Aitken Spence became a Private Company in 1952. In its centenary year, 1968, it appointed its first Sri Lankan Chairman, E.L. Van Langenberg. By 1971, as Sri Lanka was preparing to end British dominion and declare as republic, the company became a wholly Sri Lankan owned entity. In 1972, it began to offer shares to its executives, thereby broad basing its ownership. The company eventually moved on from this model and in 1983 offered its shares to the general public on the Colombo Stock Exchange with an issued share capital of Rs. 51 million. During the early 1960s and early 1970s, Insurance and Plantations sectors‚Äîwhich were core business segments of Aitken Spence, where the company had been well established at the time‚Äîwere nationalized. However, the Group's marine insurance segment (including its Lloyd Agency) continued to operate as it did not fall within the purview of nationalization. Despite the setbacks from nationalization, in realizing the then government's thrust to boost tourism, Aitken Spence launched its tourism segment in 1972 with investments in its first hotel (Neptune Hotel in Beruwala, Sri Lanka opened in 1974). The company then entered into Aviation in 1974 (as general sales agent for Singapore Airlines in Sri Lanka). In consolidating its travel agency business that had begun with the launch of Aitken Spence Hotels in 1974, Aitken Spence set up Aitken Spence Travels in 1977 as inbound and outbound tour operators in Sri Lanka and as agents for Eurail and Britrail. Tourism is now a core business segment of Aitken Spence. With Sri Lanka adopting open market economic policies focused on export led growth in 1977, Aitken Spence forayed further into new business segments : Container and allied services in 1979; Garments and apparels in 1979; International courier service agency with TNT in 1981; and Elevators in 1989 as agent of OTIS. With insurance sector being deregulated in the 1980s, the Group played a pivotal role in the resurgence of private sector insurance as a proponent of the National Insurance Corporation and Union Assurance Ltd, stakes in which Aitken Spence subsequently divested. Aitken Spence reentered Plantations sector, when the sector was reprivatized in 1992, through its stake in Udapussellawa Plantation PLC that was later divested. In response to the Power Crisis in Sri Lanka in 1996, Aitken Spence began to explore investment opportunities in power generation sector, with first two power plants coming online in 2002. The Group also maintained container vessel operations, with acquisition of five ships in a joint venture with Ceyline Group in 2003, which it later divested in 2008. In 2010, in continuing its partnership with Ceyline Group, Aitken Spence invested in CINEC, Sri Lanka's largest private higher education institution. In 2004, Aitken Spence Travels partnered with TUI Group of Germany to form a joint venture that is the largest leisure, travel and tourism company in the world. Aitken Spence was the first Sri Lankan resort operator to embark on overseas resort operations having acquired Bathala Island Resort of Maldives in 1993. In 1996, Aitken Spence entered Bangladesh through Aitken Spence Cargo with its shipping services. A decade later, in 2006, Aitken Spence entered the Indian hospitality sector, having secured management contracts for five hotel properties in India. On the same year, the company broke new ground by becoming the first Sri Lankan company to venture into port efficiency management outside of Sri Lanka, when it undertook to improve efficiency of ports in the African continent. The company increased its global presence even further by obtaining the management of four hotel properties in Oman in 2007. In 2013, Aitken Spence announced its proposed venture into Fiji to manage the Ports of Suva and Lautoka in a public private partnership with the Government of Fiji. The Group has expressed interest to further diversify its investments in Fiji, venturing into hospitality, power and printing sectors. Currently, the company has operations in eight countries (Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, India, South Africa, Oman, Fiji and Myanmar), spanning several continents with 13,000 employees.

The company has been ranked among the Top 10 Corporate Citizens for an unprecedented 13 consecutive years. Aitken Spence won multiple category awards such as for Employee Relations and Community Relations, Triple Bottom Line Award for its work on Environmental Sustainability and was awarded the sector based sustainability champions for Diversified Holdings. Aitken Spence's sustainability framework has been rated Platinum by STING Corporate Accountability Index 2018 for the 6th consecutive year and has been ranked among the top three companies in the index since 2011. Published by LMD bi-annually, the index rated the top 50 companies from the LMD 100 (excluding investment companies) as well as key state-owned enterprises on a holistic and integrated model covering corporate social responsibility, sustainability and governance. As a result of the company's long-standing engagement with the local network of the UN Global Compact, Aitken Spence has been admitted to the board and the steering committee of the Sri Lanka Network. The company reports 'Advanced' in the UNGC Communication on Progress (COP) which indicates that the company qualifies as GC Active and, in addition, cover the company's implementation of advanced criteria and best practices. Rohan Fernando, head of plantations and business development at Aitken Spence, was the former chairman of the Global Compact Sri Lanka Network. Aitken Spence is amongst the first 38 companies in the world to endorse the Women's Empowerment Principles, a joint initiative of UN Women and UN Global Compact to promote gender equality in business, and the first company to do so in Sri Lanka. Aitken Spence is also one of the first companies in Sri Lanka to pledge its support to the Caring for Climate initiative, which is a joint effort by UNEP, UNFCCC and UNGC to promote positive climate action in business. In July 2013, Aitken Spence launched Empowering Sri Lanka First, an English and IT teaching program for children from its neighbouring communities as its flagship corporate community engagement initiative. The program enrols eight-year-old students for weekend English classes (180 children currently enrolled in pilot phase from Dambulla, Ahungalla, and Mawaramandiya) for a period of three years. The curriculum of the English program has been custom designed by British Council to complement Sri Lanka's local school syllabus and teachers from local communities trained on interactive pedagogy. Aitken Spence has announced its plans to commence the IT component of the program in September 2013. The project was recognized with a merit award at the Best Sustainability Projects Awards 2014. As part of a broadbased diversification strategy, the sector embarked on a landmark project in Sri Lanka's waste to energy sphere. Seen as a vital and much needed solution for the waste disposal crisis within Colombo city limits, the proposed project involves the construction of a 10MW waste-to-energy plant at Muthurajawela. The plant will be fuelled by waste collected from the Colombo Municipal Area, which was previously dumped in Meethotamulla. The plant is equipped to convert between 600 ‚Äì 800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste daily to electricity.

Aitken Spence Hotels and Resorts  Earl's Regency-Kandy Aitken Spence Hotels and Resorts currently operates the following hotels in Sri Lanka: Bandarawela Hotel, Earl's Regency and Earl's Regent- Kandy. In 2012, total ownership of Hotel Hilltop Kandy was acquired; however, in 2017, the Group divested its ownership of Hotel Hilltop Kandy and took on the management of The Regent Kandy, a newly refurbished property with a four-star rating located in the centre of the city. Aitken Spence has previously announced its interest to develop its properties in Ahungalla and Nilaveli as resort properties. In November 2013, Aitken Spence announced its plans to enter into a joint venture with Spanish hotel chain RIU Hotels to build a 500-room, 5-star resort in Ahungalla to be opened in winter 2015. The business model for the new hotel involves attracting long haul travelers to Sri Lanka through charter flight holiday packages facilitated by TUI. Model is set on Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport & Sri Lanka's Southern Expressway providing the connectivity for tourists‚Äîdisembarking from TUI's weekly 787 Dreamliner Charters‚Äîto reach the hotel.

Strategic investments=Power generation= Aitken Spence first entered the power sector in 1996 in a joint venture with a Japanese investor to build two thermal power plants in Sri Lanka with the Government of Sri Lanka inviting private sector to invest in resolving the then power crisis. However, due to the longevity of the process in obtaining clearances, the Japanese partner backed out and in 1999, Aitken Spence (51%) partnered with Commonwealth Development Corporation Globeleq (29%), Baneras House of India (10%) and Wartsila Finland Oy (10%) to construct the Ace Matara Power Station (24.4MW) and Ace Horana Power Station (24.4MW). Subsequently, following a Request for Proposal by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in February 2002, Aitken Spence together with Caterpillar Power Ventures Corporation began the construction of the Embilipitiya Power Station (100MW), which came online in April 2005. Ace Power Embilipitiya thermal power plant operates on a 100MW while the Branford Hydro power plant operates at 2.5MW, Ace Wind power plant at 3MW and Western Power at 10MW capacity. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the Ceylon Electricity Board and Ace Power Embilipitiya lapsed in 2015; however, renewed the agreement for a one more year in April, 2016, when the country ran into power crisis after two back-to-back blackouts in late 2015 and early 2016. During the first quarter of 2018, the government decided to extend the purchasing of the thermal power for three more years as the country had four seasons of back-to-back dry spells, which exhausted reservoirs and the crucial catchment areas. Ace Wind Power, Ambewela Hydro, Wind, Solar, Waste-to- Energy and Dendro Power Aitken Spence has also sought to diversify its power portfolio with increased presence in the clean and renewable energy domain in Sri Lanka. Aitken Spence Power has already completed construction of the 2.5 MW Branford Hydro Power Plant in Matale, and of Ace Wind Power power plant in Ambewela that has an installed capacity of 3 MW. Both power plants were connected to the national grid during 2012/13 financial year. Aitken Spence Power is also currently building the Aitken Spence Power Station, Waste-To-Energy Coprocessing Plant at Muthurajawela. Ace Power embarked on a landmark project in the country's waste to energy sphere. Seen as a vital and much needed solution for the waste disposal crisis within Colombo city limits, the proposed project involves the construction of a 10MW waste-toenergy plant at Muthurajawela. The plant will be fuelled by waste collected from the Colombo Municipal Area, which was previously dumped in Meethotamulla. The plant is equipped to convert between 600 ‚Äì 800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste daily to electricity. Estimated to cost Rs. 13 billion on completion, the project is funded through a combination of equity and term loan funding. The construction work on the project commenced following the ground-breaking ceremony held in August 2017 with the participation of the president. This new waste to energy project is due to commence commercial operations in 2019. Aitken Spence Hotels (through biomass plants and solar generation) and Plantations (through mini hydro projects) have also undertaken mini power projects of their own.

Palmer, The Archaic Community of the Romans (Cambridge University Press, 1990, 2009), p. 118; Mark D. Fullerton, The Archaistic Style in Roman Statuary (Brill, 1990), pp. 15‚Äì16. In ancient Roman religion and myth, the Querquetulanae or Querquetulanae virae were nymphs of the oak grove (querquetum) at a stage of producing green growth. Their sacred grove (lucus) was within the Porta Querquetulana, a gate in the Servian Wall.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 263. According to Festus, it was believed that in Rome there was once an oakwood within the Porta Querquetulana onto the greening of which presided the virae Querquetulanae.Festus p. 261 L s.v. Etymology Since the Querquetulanae are the nymphs of the sacred oak grove (querquetum), the word stems from Latin quercus, meaning \\"oak\\".Moralejo, Juan J. \\"Labiovelares en material galaico y lusitano\\". In: Callaica Nomina: Estudios de Onom√°stica Gallega. Biblioteca Filol√≥xica Galega. Fundaci√≥n Pedro Barri√© de la Maza, D.L. 2007. pp. 219. In Festus In his entry on the Querquetulanae, Festus says that their name was thought to signify that they were nymphs presiding over the oak grove as it began to produce green growth, and that the Porta Querquetulana was so called because this kind of woodland (silva) was just within the gate.Querquetulanae virae putantur significari nymphae praesidentes querqueto virescenti, quod genus silvae iudicant fuisse intra portam, quae ab edo dicta sit Querquetularia: Festus-Paulus p. 314 in the edition of Lindsay. Festus says that virae in archaic Latin meant feminae, \\"women\\", as if it were the feminine form of vir, \\"man\\", and that the words virgines (singular virgo) and viragines (virago) reflect this older usage. Virgo, from which the English word \\"virgin\\" derives, meant a young woman who had just reached the age to be with a man (vir): in the Etymologies of Isidore, \\"she is said to be a virgo on account of her youthful bloom and vigor\\" (viridiori aetate).Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 11.2.21; Carlin A. Barton, Roman Honor: The Fire in the Bones (University of California Press, 2001), p. 42, note 44; see also Isidore 11.2.23 and 12.1.32, and Servius, note to Bucolics 3.30. In ancient etymologies, the concepts of vis (plural vires), \\"power, force, energy\\", and viriditas, \\"flourishing vigor\\", were thought to belong to a semantic group that included vir, virtus, and the virgo or vira who possessed \\"youthful vigor, growth, fertility, freshness, and energy\\".Barton, Roman Honor, pp. 41‚Äì42. Denarius of Accoleius Lariscolus A denarius issued by Publius Accoleius Lariscolus around 43‚Äì41 BC has sometimes been thought to represent the Querquetulanae on its reverse side. In this view, the head on the obverse represents a bust of Acca Larentia.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 402. A.B. Cook interpreted the three female figures on the reverse as \\"archaistic caryatids\\" bearing a beam on which five trees are supported. He saw the nymph on the left as holding a bow, and the one on the right holding a lily. The trees, however, he identified as more likely to represent larches (larices, singular larix), from which he derives the name Lariscolus (\\"young larch\\"), hence embodying the sisters of Pha√´ton transformed to larches.Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 402. Alf√∂ldi established the currently dominant view that the reverse represented a \\"triple goddess\\" statue in a cypress grove, with Diana Nemorensis on the obverse to represent the origin of the gens Accoleia in Aricia.Fullerton, The Archaistic Style, pp. 15‚Äì16. Diana, however, had an affinity with the oak, and had an ancient sanctuary on the Mons Querquetulanus (see below).Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 400. Lares Querquetulani The Lares Querquetulani (\\"tutelaries of the oak grove\\") had a shrine (sacellum) on the Esquiline.Varro, De lingua latina 5.49. These Lares may be connected to the Querquetulanae, depending on where their grove is to be located.In the view of Richardson, they were not connected to the Porta Querquetulana and its grove; A New Topographical Dictionary, p. 233. One of the former peoples listed by Pliny who participated in the Latin Festival were the Querquetulani.Pliny, Natural History 3.69. Palmer thought their name in conjunction with the Lares Querquetulani and the Querquetulanae virae indicated the existence of a curia called Querquetulana, since only a few names of the thirty curiae are known.Palmer, The Archaic Community of the Romans, pp. 172‚Äì173. The Querquetulanae virae may have also have been tutelaries of the Latin Querquetulani.Jean Bayet, Histoire politique et psychologique de la religion romaine (Payot, 1969, 2nd ed.), p. 27. As indicated by inscriptions, in general Lares and nymphs might be the joint recipients of cultus in Italy and share the same sacred space.Hartswick, The Gardens of Sallust, p. 14; Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 402.

A hybrid electric truck is a form of truck that uses hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology for propulsion, instead of using only a combustion engine. According to a report from Pike Research, the global market for hybrid medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses will increase from 9,000 vehicles sold in 2010 to more than 10 times more (more than 100,000 vehicles) in 2015. During this five-year period, the firm forecasts that a total of nearly 300,000 hybrid electric trucks will be sold worldwide.  History  In 2003, GM introduced a hybrid diesel-electric military (light) truck that is equipped with a diesel electric and a fuel cell auxiliary power unit. Hybrid electric light trucks were introduced in 2004 by Mercedes Benz (Sprinter) and Micro-Vett SPA (Daily Bimodale). International Truck and Engine Corp. and Eaton Corp. have been selected to manufacture diesel-electric hybrid trucks for a U.S. pilot program that is serving the utility industry in 2004.  Vehicles  PEPCO's hybrid diesel-electric utility truck exhibited in the 2010 Washington Auto Show. In mid-2005, Isuzu introduced the Elf Diesel Hybrid Truck to the Japanese market. They claim that approximately 300 vehicles, mostly route buses are using the Hinos HIMR (Hybrid Inverter Controlled Motor & Retarder) system. In 2007, high purchase price meant a hard sell for hybrid trucks and appears the first U.S. production hybrid truck (International Durastar Hybrid). Other vehicles are: * Big mining machines, for example the Liebherr T 282B dump truck or Keaton Vandersteen LeTourneau L-2350 wheel loader are powered that way. Also there was several models of BelAZ (7530 and 7560 series) in USSR (now in Belarus) since 1970. * NASA's huge Crawler-Transporters are diesel-electric. * Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid is a diesel-electric commercial truck. * Hino Motors (a Toyota subsidiary) has the world's first production hybrid electric truck in Australia ( diesel engine plus a electric motor). * Azure Dynamics Balance Hybrid Electric is a gasoline-hybrid electric medium dutry truck based on the Ford E-450 chassis. * Volvo FE Hybrid with Volvo Trucks D7F Engine with diesel and parallel hybrid. Suitable for example waste collecting trucks. Other hybrid petroleum-electric truck makers are DAF Trucks, MAN AG with MAN TGL Series, Nikola Motor Company with the Nikola One, Nissan Motors and Renault Trucks with Renault Puncher.  Powertrains  Hybrid electric truck technology and powertrain maker: ZF Friedrichshafen, Eaton Corporation, Azure Dynamics.  Fleets  Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) has the largest fleet of hybrid electric trucks in North America. The hybrid electric tractors are the standard bulk delivery truck that the company uses for large deliveries. CCE plans to incrementally deploy 185 of the hybrid electric trucks across the United States and Canada in 2009, bringing their total number of hybrid electric delivery trucks to 327, the largest such fleet in North America.

Exodus is not a paraphrase of the biblical book, but rather a re-telling of the story of the Israelites' flight from Egyptian captivity and the Crossing of the Red Sea in the manner of a \\"heroic epic\\", much like Old English poems Andreas, Judith, or even Beowulf. It is one of the densest, most allusive and complex poems in Old English, and is the focus of much critical debate. Style and imagery Exodus brings a traditional \\"heroic style\\" to its biblical subject-matter. Moses is treated as a general, and military imagery pervades the poem. The destruction of the Egyptians in the Red Sea is narrated in much the same way as a formulaic battle scene from other Old English poems, including a 'Beast of Battle' motif very common in the poetry. According to Malcolm Godden, the allusion to battle within the poem is a way to illustrate that God defends his chosen people. The main story is suspended at one point to tell the stories of Noah and Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac. Some scholars consider this change of subject a feature of the \\"epic style\\" comparable with the similar digressions in Beowulf, while others have proposed it is a later interpolation. Edward B. Irving edited the poem twice, 1955 and 1981: the first edition excerpted the Noah and Abraham portion as a separate poem; on later reflection, Irving recanted, admitting it was an integrated part of the Exodus poem. There appears to be justification in patristic sermons for connecting the crossing of the Red Sea with these topics. Allegory In recent decades, attention has shifted away from the \\"heroic\\" aspects of Exodus to consider its densely allusive structure and possible typology. Peter J. Lucas, for instance, has argued that the poem is an allegorical treatment of the Christian fight with the devil. The Crossing of the Red Sea has been seen as echoing the baptismal liturgy and prefiguring the entrance into Heaven. The Pharaoh may be associated with Satan through some subtle verbal echoes. The Egyptians are seen as being associated with the Devil because they are attempting to keep the Israelites from reaching God. In the poem, the Israelites are being led across the path through the Red Sea by a pillar of cloud which is described as a ‚Äúsegle‚Äù (sail). Maxwell Luria argues that the sail represents a symbolic sea-voyage. This sea-voyage then represents the Israelites weathering their storm with the help of God‚Äôs protection. The Red Sea is seen as representing baptismal waters and the crossing of the Israelites as the first Christian salvation. However, J. E. Cross also argues that the poem is not simply symbolic for baptism, because the ‚ÄúCrossing‚Äù also occurs ‚Äúas a brief illustration together with other examples of saving by water‚Äù. He argues that there are too many unrelated events in the poem for it to truly serve as a baptismal allegory. However, the journey of the Israelites in the poem may be taken as a metaphor for the life of man, since life can be ‚Äúextended‚Ä¶as a pilgrim‚Äôs progress on land or as a voyage by sea‚Äù. It seems especially possible that this equation was intended when one looks back at the other symbols of stormy weather and salvation. Furthermore, the Egyptians are referred to as ‚Äúlandsmen‚Äù while the Israelites are called ‚Äúsea-faring‚Äù and being led by God‚Äôs ‚Äúsail,‚Äù which gives strength to the idea that the Israelites are making their way toward salvation. In the Old English version of the poem, Moses is said to have parted the sea with a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù staff, a description which does not appear in the Latin script. According to Luria, the cross which Jesus was nailed to was also described as being ‚Äúgreen,‚Äù and therefore he equates this with meaning that Moses was pious, while others, such as the Egyptians, represented ‚Äúdry wood‚Äù or impious people. Within the poem, allusions to both Noah and Abraham are made. Noah, who built an ark to survive the great flood, and Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his son, Isaac, both represent a symbol of Christian salvation. Luria argues that like Moses, Noah also represents a type of Christ-like figure. Similarly, Isaac may represent a Christ-like figure, since he was a son who was to be sacrificed as well. The poem hinges on the emphasis that ‚Äúfaith is the key to salvation‚Äù.Luria p. 604 The faithful Israelites made it across the Red Sea, while the faithless Egyptians perished in the water. J.E. Cross describes how Aelfric, an Anglo-Saxon abbot, once gave a sermon over Exodus, in which he too describes the poem as being allegorical. Aelfric believed that Egypt represented the world, the Pharaoh represented the Devil, the Red Sea represented baptism, the Egyptians represented sins, and the pillar of cloud represented Christ.Cross p. 123 Similarities with Other Poems There are similar metaphors and lines in other Old English literature, which shows that Exodus was influential to the Anglo-Saxons. The poem centers largely around the concept of water and the sea, and consequently contains many synonyms and metaphors for those concepts. Similar themes of a sea-voyage also occur in The Seafarer, Christ II, and The Wanderer. One particular line from Exodus also appears in The Seafarer: ‚Äúatol y√∞a gewealc‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúthe horrible rolling waves‚Äù.

The digestive system of gastropods has evolved to suit almost every kind of diet and feeding behavior. Gastropods (snails and slugs) as the largest taxonomic class of the mollusca are very diverse indeed: the group includes carnivores, herbivores, scavengers, filter feeders, and even parasites. In particular, the radula is often highly adapted to the specific diet of the various group of gastropods. Another distinctive feature of the digestive tract is that, along with the rest of the visceral mass, it has undergone torsion, twisting around through 180 degrees during the larval stage, so that the anus of the animal is located above its head. A number of species have developed special adaptations to feeding, such as the \\"drill\\" of some limpets, or the harpoon of the neogastropod genus Conus. Filter feeders use the gills, mantle lining, or nets of mucus to trap their prey, which they then pull into the mouth with the radula. The highly modified parasitic genus Enteroxenos has no digestive tract at all, and simply absorbs the blood of its host through the body wall. The digestive system usually has the following parts: * buccal mass (including the mouth, pharynx, and retractor muscles of the pharynx) and salivary glands with salivary ducts * oesophagus and oesophagal crop * stomach, also known as the gastric pouch * digestive gland, also known as the hepatopancreas * intestine * rectum and anus Buccal mass  The buccal mass is the first part of the digestive system, and consists of the mouth and pharynx. The mouth includes a radula, and in most cases, also a pair of jaws. The pharynx can be very large, especially in carnivorous species. Many carnivorous species have developed a proboscis, containing the oral cavity, radula, and part of the oesophagus. At rest, the proboscis is enclosed within a sac-like sheath, with an opening at the front of the animal that resembles a true mouth. When the animal feeds, it pumps blood into the proboscis, inflating it and pushing it out through the opening to grasp the gastropod's prey. A set of retractor muscles help pull the proboscis back inside the sheath once feeding is completed. { Drawing of the digestive system of Paryphanta busbyi. 1-2 - buccal mass, 1 - mouth, 2 - pharynx, 3 - retractor muscles of the pharynx, 4 - salivary glands, 5 - salivary ducts, 6 - oesophagus, 7 - stomach.

The radula is a chitinous ribbon used for scraping or cutting food. = Jaw = Several herbivorous species, as well as carnivores that prey on sessile animals, have also developed simple jaws, which help to hold the food steady while the radula works on it. The jaw is opposite to the radula and reinforces part of the foregut. The purely carnivorous the diet, the more the jaw is reduced. There are often pieces of food in the gut corresponding to the shape of the jaw. The jaw structure can be ribbed or smooth: File:Geomalacus maculosus jaw.jpgDrawing of the jaw of the Kerry Slug Geomalacus maculosus. The jaw of this species measures about 1 mm and has broad ribs.

Some species have no jaw. = Salivary glands = Salivary glands plays primary role in the anatomical and physiological adaptations of the digestive system of predatory gastropods.Ponte, G., & Modica, M. V. (2017). Salivary Glands in Predatory Mollusks: Evolutionary Considerations. Frontiers in Physiology 8: 580. . Ducts from large salivary glands lead into the buccal cavity, and the oesophagus also supplies the digestive enzymes that help to break down the food. Salivary secretions lubricate the food and they also contain bioactive compounds.  Oesophagus  The mouth of gastropods opens into an oesophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, the oesophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its posterior portion, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the oesophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is therefore reversed from the usual gastropod arrangement. In Tarebia granifera the brood pouch is above the oesophagus.Appleton C. C., Forbes A. T.& Demetriades N. T.

Plakobranchus ocellatus (Gastropoda) Continuously Acquires Kleptoplasts and Nutrition from Multiple Algal Species in Nature\\". PLoS ONE 7(7): e42024. In most species, the stomach itself is a relatively simple sac, and is the main site of digestion. In many herbivores, however, the hind part of the oesophagus is enlarged to form a crop, which, in terrestrial pulmonates, may even replace the stomach entirely. In many aquatic herbivores, however, the stomach is adapted into a gizzard that helps to grind up the food. The gizzard may have a tough cuticle, or may be filled with abrasive sand grains. In the most primitive gastropods, however, the stomach is a more complex structure. In these species, the hind part of the stomach, where the oesophagus enters, is chitinous, and includes a sorting region lined with cilia. In all gastropods, the portion of the stomach furthest from the oesophagus, called the \\"style sac\\", is lined with cilia. These beat in a rotary motion, pulling the food forward in a steady stream from the mouth. Usually, the food is embedded in a string of mucus produced in the mouth, creating a coiled conical mass in the style sac. This action, rather than muscular peristalsis, is responsible for the movement of food through the gastropod digestive tract. Two diverticular glands open into the stomach, and secrete enzymes that help to break down the food. In the more primitive species, these glands may also absorb the food particles directly and digest them intracellularly.  Hepatopancreas  The hepatopancreas is the largest organ in stylommatophoran gastropods. It produces enzymes, and absorbs and stores nutrients.  Intestine  Garden Snail, Cornu aspersum defecating.

It was published in 2003. Plot summary Bay of Souls begins in the vein of James Dickey's Deliverance (1970), with the novel's central character Michael Ahearn,and his cronies hunting in the wilds of Minnesota. But Michael's attempts at Hemingwayesque role-playing are limited by his daydreaming, he brings a gun only to justify his presence out in the woods. While Michael waits in a deer stand, a strange hunter despairingly stumbles by, trying to haul a large buck on a pitifully inadequate wheelbarrow. Michael takes pleasure in the other man's humiliation, but the experience proves prophetic of several burdens assumed during the novel and the difficulty characters will have sustaining them. For instance, soon after the hunting incident, Michael's son Paul almost dies from exposure after searching for his dog in the snow. Then Michael's wife, Kristin, breaks her leg trying to carry her son home. After this trauma, Michael finds his relations with his wife deteriorating, and so he turns to the attentions of Lara Purcell, a professor of political science.The Atlantic Monthly 291 (May, 2003): 123. A femme fatale with an interest in Caribbean voodoo, Lara leads Michael into high-stakes adultery, which includes erotic play with a gun and cocaine use. She has a murky background involving Soviet espionage and links to South American organized crime. Her devil-may-care attitude toward danger seduces Michael into trying to live out the literary vitalism that he has been studying in his literature class.Commonweal 130, no. 16 (September 26, 2003): 22-23. Bay of Souls combines elements of these novels when Michael sleeps with Lara without Kristin's knowledge and then welcomes an opportunity to visit Lara's native island, St. Trinity, which is embroiled in its own civil war. When Lara asks, \\"Are you mine in the ranks of death?\\" Michael quickly assents. She can supply the kick and the danger missing from his life as a professor and a family man.Booklist 99, no. 11 (February 17, 2003): 956. Ostensibly, Lara must return to St. Trinity to sell off her stake in the Bay of Saints Hotel but also, given the voodoo religion practiced on the island, she has to preside over the transference of her deceased brother's soul from Guinee, a kind of underwater purgatory, to a place of honor. Additionally, Lara claims she needs to get her soul back because her brother's spirit gave it to a voodoo figure named Marinette, an older female spirit who lives under the sea. This semi-serious religious subtext calls into question all of Lara's motivations. Even though Michael does not fully admit it to himself, he knows that if Lara does not have a soul, then all of her seductive powers come from hidden agents that may have a whole different agenda than the one that Lara professes to have. As he reflects, if she does not have a soul, \\"then everything between us would be illusion.\\"The Economist 367, 8328 (June 14, 2003): 83. While Lara has no problem moving between midwestern academia and Third World intrigue, Michael has difficulty putting his theories into action. Once he arrives in St. Trinity separate from Lara (they have to take different flights), Michael encounters a chaotic world of voodoo drums, warring military camps, CIA intervention, and drug running. Carrying what seems to be drugs and emeralds in three canisters, a small airplane crashes into the ocean, and Lara is partially responsible to the Colombian militia for this loss. She arrives suddenly in Michael's hotel room, has sex with him, and then asks him to undertake a night dive to retrieve the containers. He agrees, thinking, \\"Without physical courage . . . there is no moral courage.\\" He gets together some scuba diving gear, boats out past a moonlit reef, and then plunges down into one of the deepest parts of the Atlantic Ocean.Kirkus Reviews 71 (January 1, 2003): 24. Once Michael dives into the water, he finds it almost pleasant to become \\"a different animal in a different element.\\" He thinks of how he has gotten tired of an academic's constant introspection, certainly a hazard of academic fiction as well. There is color and drama in his attempt to retrieve the packages from a plane overturned deep in the ocean. He has to beware of the plane shifting and locking him inside. He also has to watch his air supply, and the freakish sight of the pilot's bloated body being eaten by all manner of fishes testifies to the \\"ghastliness inherent in material existence.\\" Here Stone uses horror effects reminiscent of Peter Benchley's Jaws (1974), but he ties it thematically to Lara's attempts to get her brother's soul back from the depths of the ocean. Michael almost suffocates on his ascent from the plane, and he drops one of the more valuable packages, but he makes it back up‚Äîjust to face a Colombian militia mystified and angered by his involvement. In a temple nearby, Lara dances in a trance during voodoo rites for her brother. Michael confronts Hilda, the tough-talking militia leader upset over the loss of the drugs, and the novel abruptly shifts into a nighttime drum-filled dreamscape, wherein Michael encounters the voodoo spirit Marinette, who takes on aspects of a succubus embracing him, and a male figure named Baron Samedi who pushes a wheelbarrow loaded down with a goat. Both of the spirits mock Michael's desire to know what is going on. In his delirium, he hears someone whisper, \\"If I were you . . . I should save my life,\\" and soon he finds himself running from everyone, including Lara, in the darkness, and flies back to Fort Salines and his suspicious wife.Library Journal 128, no. 5 (March 15, 2003): 117. In the end, Bay of Souls is an economical read with a strong conclusion, but it lacks the weight of detail of Stone's other novels, leaving a slimness in characterization in places and a sense of compilation-style recycling of the author's favorite themes and situations. While it lacks the gravitas of Damascus Gate, there is still a surprising and satisfactory sense of judgment at the end that ties together the thematic strands of the rest of the novel.Publishers Weekly 250, no. 7 (February 17, 2003): 55. While St. Trinity ultimately takes on a perverse aura as its rulers look to exploit the island paradise for tourism, Michael finds his hometown lifestyle transformed upon his return. Kristin discovers two boarding passes with Lara and Michael's names on them in his luggage. She divorces Michael and accepts the attentions of Norman, a fellow academic, in his stead. Michael is reduced to living on campus. He feels guilt not only for the deserved loss of his family but also for his abandonment of Lara, who, it turns out, not only survived her trance amid the Colombian militiamen but also became St. Trinity's ambassador to France.The New York Times Book Review 152 (April 6, 2003): 9. Michael's ultimate crime is that he loses his nerve. He attempts to go to \\"the ranks of death\\" with Lara, and he succeeds underwater, but he does not want to confront the voodoo underworld of the island. In a sense, he playacts at facing danger just as he playacted at hunting earlier in the novel. During his dreamlike encounter with Lara in the last scene of the novel, Michael accuses her of sending him to hell, but his problem is much more an internal failing that ends up coloring everything around him. He drops the burden of the possibility of a higher spiritual knowledge, and he is left with nothing as a result. He tries to have it both ways, both risking his soul and saving his life, and the compromise places him in a kind of limbo‚Äî\\"a life suspended on the quivering air.\\" The Times Literary Supplement, August 1, 2003, p. 21. In the process, Stone hints at a metaphysical understanding that is both darker and deeper than Michael apprehends, but for all Michael's lack of knowledge, judgment is still swift and fierce.

It is the debut feature-length film under the Bad Alliteration Films independent production banner. The Insomniac premiered at the Sinema Old School Singapore-based independent distribution house, opening in the 100-seater venue on August 13, 2009, in Singapore. The film's narrative centers on Ali, a workaholic writer who is struggling to complete his latest work of fiction. His sleepless efforts slowly force him to lose his mind. The film was shot and edited in Film-noir style, relying on invoking surrealistic atmosphere and dark, ironic plot-ends. Synopsis Ali (Madhav Mathur), a possessed workaholic writer, is spiralling downwards into a permanent state of mental corrosion, in his ill-conceived insomniac efforts to complete his latest book of fiction. On one fateful night, his overactive imagination gets the better of him. Characters and episodes from his unfinished book come to life in front of his weary eyes. They get strangely intertwined with people and experiences from his own life, resulting in absurd, tragic comedy. Tormented and chased by seductive assassins, loony psychiatrists, bullies and army men, he has only one person who can actually save him, and she too seems reluctant.

History  NAPRW was a sub-command of the Northwest African Air Forces which itself was a sub-command of the Mediterranean Air Command (MAC). These new Allied air force organizations were created at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 to promote cooperation between the British Royal Air Force (RAF), the American United States Army Air Force (USAAF), and their respective ground and naval forces in North Africa and the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). Effective 18 February 1943, the NAPRW and other MAC commands existed until 10 December 1943 when MAC was disbanded and the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF), with the Mediterranean Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing (MAPRW), were established. Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, the son of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, attended the Casablanca Conference and was made the commander of NAPRW.Craven, Wesley F. and James L. Cate. The Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume 2, Chicago, Illinois: Chicago University Press, 1949 (Reprinted 1983, ).Richards, D. and H. Saunders, The Royal Air Force 1939‚Äì1945 (Volume 2, HMSO, 1953). Lt. Col. Roosevelt had been the commander of the U.S. 3rd Reconnaissance Group, which had participated in the landings in North Africa in November 1942. RAF Wing Commander Eric Fuller was Col. Roosevelt's deputy.Hansen, 235-285 One reason for the creation of the NAPRW was the grave attrition of the constituent units prior to February 1943. NAPRW was headquartered at Maison Blanche Airport outside Algiers, and deployed units to outlying bases including Malta. Under the pressure of events, the squadron structure had broken down, and it was not reconstituted until the German surrender in Tunis in May 1943. At that time, NAPRW HQ moved to el-Aouina Airport outside Carthage. After the landings in Italy, the Wing moved to San Severo near Foggia, Italy, in November. Numerous other airfields were used, and wing aircraft ranged throughout the Mediterranean from Barcelona to Budapest. The 3rd PR Group contributed early model F-4 Lightnings and a mapping detachment equipped with four Boeing B-17Fs. These aircraft were found to be unsuitable for combat operations and were relegated to other duties. NAPRW found that only the later model F-4Bs and F-5 Lightnings, with their flaws corrected, could operate in enemy airspace. NAPRW did important pioneering work in night photography using a single assigned North American B-25 Mitchell. The RAF contributed PR Spitfires and a few early de Havilland Mosquitos. Colonel Roosevelt borrowed two Mosquitos from the British, and began a campaign for American adoption of this aircraft; however, when a few new F-8 Mosquitos did get allocated to NAPRW from Canadian production, they turned out to be problem-plagued. During the first half of 1943, the Wing also flew a single Potez 540, a war prize modified to serve as a flying photo processing laboratory. From its operational nadir in February 1943, NAPRW grew to become a very large unit with nearly 3,000 men, and relative combat losses declined rapidly during its existence. Because NAPRW was the first U.S.-led reconnaissance wing to see sustained combat in Europe, its operational experience set the tone for subsequent American operations; this was why Col. Roosevelt was tagged to command the Eighth Air Force's 325th Reconnaissance Wing in England at the end of 1943. President Roosevelt inspected his son's wing at El Aouina in November 1943 during his travel to the Teheran Conference.Hansen The successor unit was the \\"Mediterranean Allied Photo Reconnaissance Wing\\"Collection Description - Mediterranean Allied Photo Reconnaissance Wing (MAPRW)  Order of battle  At the time of the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) on 10 July 1943, the NAPRW consisted of:Boyle, Robert Driscoll, History of Photo Reconnaissance in North Africa Including my Experiences with the 3rd Photo Group, Doctoral Dissertation, Department of History, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 1948. *3rd Photographic Group under Lieutenant Colonel Frank Dunn **5th Combat Mapping Squadron, P-38 Lightning **12th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, P-38 Lightning **12th Weather Detachment **15th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, B-17 Fortress **13th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (Detachment) Photo Intelligence *No. 60 Squadron SAAF Detachment, Mosquito PR.IV *No. 540 Squadron RAF Detachment, Mosquito PR.IV/PR.XI *No. 680 Squadron RAF, Spitfire PR.IX/PR.XI *2/33 Groupe (Free French Air Force), P-38 Lightning  Notable personnel  Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, the renowned French aviator and author of several aviation writings as well as The Little Prince, was a P-38 pilot in 2/33 Groupe de Reconnaissance.

Walking Wealth, 2009, bronze, Jiang Xi Art Museum collection, Nanchang, China  Biography  Wu Shaoxiang was born in 1957 in Jiangxi Province, China. Having only received ongoing formal education until he was twelve, Wu was sent to work on a farm to lay bricks and saw wood for rafters. It was only when he turned twenty-one that he could he begin his career as a sculptor. From 1978-1982 Wu studied sculpture at the Jingdezhen Ceramics Institute, then left to work at the China National Design Association in Beijing for two years. From 1984-1987, he pursued postgraduate studies under the sculptor Professor Zheng Ke, at the Central Academy of Arts and Design, now the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. After graduating with a master's degree, he taught as a lecturer at the academy. An important figure in China's New-Wave art movement, Wu won the first scholarship awarded by the city of Beijing, and was named one of the \\"Ten Most Influential Chinese Avant-Garde Artists\\" by Fine Arts of China (the most important magazine at the time for modern art published in China). The purpose behind the New-Wave group was to review traditional Chinese art through courageous experimentation in the face of the ever-increasing influence of Western culture, in order to bring Chinese art to the modern world. In 1988, the National Art Museum of China organized its first major solo exhibition, and in the same year, he was the first modern Chinese artist to be allowed to place a sculpture - \\"Meditation\\" - in a public space in Europe. On June 6, 1989, two days after the massacre on Tiananmen Square, he was able to leave China with the help of the Austrian Embassy. He settled in Austria with his wife Jiang Shuo, who is also a sculptor, and their son. In 1991, he created \\"Apple,\\" his first sculpture made entirely of coins. It was included in the Guinness World Records Book 1995 and is now in the Austrian National Bank. He obtained Austrian citizenship in 1993 and published a book of his sculptures since his arrival in Europe. He exhibited at this time in Europe and Asia. After cancer treatment in 1996 he built a new studio in Carinthia with his wife Jiang Shuo and wrote the autobiographical novel \\"The Shadow of the Sun\\". In 2006, he set up a studio in Beijing, and later he published \\"Art of Sculpture,\\" which became a textbook for all Chinese universities. He is a visiting professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of Fu Dan University in Shanghai since 2008. Due to its increasing popularity, 2012 saw the opening of a studio in Berlin. Alternating Wu Shaoxiang lives today in Austria, Berlin and Beijing. 2017 he became a visiting professor at Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. His works are also widely collected by museums and prestigious institutions worldwide.\\"Wu Shaoxiang\\" Linda Gallery Early works The artist's work first caught the attention of the public through several modern abstract sculptures, which were commissioned for several locations, including a Beijing park, the Theatre of the Chinese Association of the Arts, and the Central Academy of Science. In his early stage as a sculptor, Wu was influenced by Western modernism. His \\"Outcry Series\\" created during the mid-1980s resembled the stylistic representation of sculptors such as Arp and Br√¢ncu»ôi, as well as Duchampe's his ironic sculptures and the artistic method of Chinese impressionism. This series was noted at the time for their abstract presentation of the female body, and representation of sexual consciousness. It was made mainly of cast copper, which was polished to diminish the strength of the material, creating a smooth and luminous tactile experience. Such work indicated the lack of exploration in sexual themes in China, establishing Wu as an artistic pioneer at that time.Markbreiter, Robin:\\"Chinese Sculptor: Wu Shaoxiang\\" Arts of Asia Wu was also an active participant in the Chinese modern art circle. He wanted to provide greater international exposure to Chinese art, and avidly explored and incorporated contemporary ideas in his works. In this sense, he was much bolder compared to his more conservative and conventional contemporaries who were hesitant in addressing sexual themes. As a result, he helped to begin a new chapter in modern Chinese art history. In Austria Wu found a more liberal environment that allowed him the freedom to artistically express himself. He attempted to detach himself from the art movement in China, but found it a challenge. This made him feel like a foreigner both in China and in Austria. Thus, it would become inevitable for Wu to return to his identity, but keeping a global perspective. Some themes he explored included the concept of Yin and Yang ‚Äì which relates to Chinese philosophy and traditional Chinese medicine. Later works Living abroad allowed Wu to become more familiar with the relationship between art and commerce. He also witnessed what he felt were the detrimental effects of globalization on art. When visiting museums, Wu saw works by artists he respected as important voices of change commercialized and degraded to simple brand names, as their creations were reproduced on all types of consumer products. Bull of coins, Schloss Pakein, 369x369px The development of his past work along with a greater awareness of consumer culture enabled Wu to create his \\"Coin Series\\" in 1991, where he used coins as a medium for sculpting. For example, Apple, made up of 45,000 Austrian shilling coins, is recorded in The Guinness Book of Records in 1995 as the first and biggest coin sculpture in the world. He uses coins to produce interpretations of both Western and Chinese sculptural forms, including Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Bill Gates, the Roman goddess of love, Venus, the logo of McDonald's, and a can of Coca-Cola. This would allow him to convey a strong social message, and to establish his individual artistic signature on the international art stage, earning him prominent recognition. For his first solo exhibition -Coining MOMA(2001)- in the United States at Plum Blossoms gallery in New York, Wu Shaoxiang rendered with wielded coins his own representation of the permanent collection at The Museum of Modern Art, for example taking inspiration from Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Aristide Maillol and Jasper Johns.Balsa, Josette.: \\"Carving the Way\\" Hong Kong Tatler In doing so, he was indicating that enterprises such as the MoMA were increasingly driven by business, carrying out nationwide publicity campaigns and reproducing famous works on gift items to sell them in museum shops. In fact, they had reduced artistic images to commercial images. In his latest work, the \\"Walking Wealth\\" series, Wu continues to explore the theme of wealth and modern consumer culture, though this time using a new form of innovative sculptural representation - life-sized human figures made out of bronze-cast US dollar notes. As a postmodernist he had to deconstruct his \\"tradition\\" or reinterpret the \\"tradition\\" of his artistic education. Selecting the historical masterpieces of Western art - which are familiar to most educated Westerners - he could express the themes of his metaphorical messages in a more accessible way. With their unique body language and presentation, these anonymous figures are amusing commentaries on mankind's seemingly immense hunger for monetary fulfillment. In his worlds: \\"Inventions can free people from physical restrictions, but also lead to unexpected new restrictions. Currency is like this: It was invented to facilitate trade, but it came to dominate people's behavior and reasoning in the end. Coins can be used as a kind of normal material such as stone, wood or metal to make sculptures\\". The idea of money - illustrated by the coins and banknotes he uses - is in his mind completely incompatible with the actual value of the art. The exact interpretation of his works, however, is still unclear and fuzzy, probably intentionally. In the history of sculpture, he is the first to use coins exclusively and persistently to make sculptures, going beyond the traditional definition of this art. The raw material used is material substance, but also an art form in itself. Completed in 2007, his sculpture I Love M depicts a bust of Chairman Mao mounted on a plinth with the McDonald's logo. At the same time as referencing his childhood during the Cultural Revolution, I Love M is a commentary on the pervasiveness of capitalism and the way political figures become symbols over time.

A Freeform game in Zoo Tycoon 2 allows you to create the zoo of your choice, the only restrictions being space, animals and objects. The player's money supply is unlimited, and all items are available from the beginning of the game (except those that can only be unlocked in Scenario and Challenge games). Freeform games begin with an empty zoo, to which the player adds animal exhibits and guest facilities (such as restaurants and bathrooms), hiring employees to staff and maintain them. The player chooses a plot of land for their zoo to be built upon at the start of a new Freeform game, and each plot of land represents a different biome (e.g. tropical rainforest, mountains, deserts, or others). Each plot of land is also a different size (large, small or medium). The player must accommodate their animals with spacious enclosures, adequate food and water, animal enrichment objects (toys or items that otherwise encourage the animals to use their natural abilities and behaviors), shelters for them to sleep or gain privacy in, and environments that suit them (for example, tigers are best suited to rainforest environments, and lions to savanna ones). The player must also provide for the guests, which is done by placing food and drink stands, bathrooms, picnic areas, seating, trash and recycling bins and playgrounds around the zoo. The player can create a range of elevated and lowered terrain types, including hills, valleys, cliffs and ditches. In addition to Freeform mode, there is also a Campaign mode in which the player chooses a campaign to play through and is placed in the shoes of an average zoo owner and is assigned different goals to complete; these goals may include having to breed tapirs, train dolphins, rescuing abused animals and more. As well, there is a Challenge mode in which the player has a limited amount of money (although the player can choose their starting amount) with which goals must be completed.

Most farming lands had been nationalized under Houari Boumedi√®ne's presidency. The UNPA membership was made up by farmers who either had few or no noncollectivized lands. Since UNPA didn't have any legacy of independent union activity prior to its foundation and immediate incorporation into the political set-up of the dominant political party, UNPA proved less politically active, less cohesive, and less influential than some other contemporary Algerian mass organizations. In April 1978, UNPA held a national congress, just ahead of the FLN party congress.Lawless, Richard I., and Allan M. Findlay. North Africa: Contemporary Politics and Economic Development.

Some sectors broke away from UNPA, and formed their own unions after 1988. These groups raised demands for complete decollectivization. UNPA, on its behalf, has taken an ambiguous attitude towards land privatization. In 1995 it had supported privatizations, but this policy was later reversed.

It permits measurement of energy demands of subjects unencumbered by the traditional apparatus necessary to measure gas exchange.

It stands at the Pfarrplatz and is dedicated to James, son of Zebedee (Saint James). The church is sometimes wrongly called St. Jacob's. The confusion arises because German, like many other languages, uses the same word for both James and Jacob.  Description  The church takes the form of a simple Romanesque structure. Its modern-day appearance dates back to the 12th century. The church consists of a single nave with a raised and slightly offset choir. The left-hand side of the church has three round arched windows; the right-hand side only two.  History  The Pfarrplatz. St. James's Church stands in the middle, the former Heiligenstadt primary school is on the right Heiligenstadt was early on home to an organised Christian community with regular religious services. St. James's Church's roots can be traced back to the 5th century. From 1105, there are reports of the presence of a cult to Saint Severinus of Noricum in Heiligenstadt. A document from Bishop R√ºdiger von Passau dating from 1243 indicates that the church was a subsidiary of St. Martin in Klosterneuburg. It was made independent in 1246. A hospital and rectory next to St. James's Church are first mentioned in 1263. In 1307, Heiligenstadt was attached to the Klosterneuburg Monastery, and the parish priests of Heiligenstadt have been Canons Regular ever since. At the time, the parish of Heiligenstadt also covered the neighbouring communities of Grinzing, Sievering, Salmannsdorf, Nussdorf, Oberd√∂bling and Unterd√∂bling. The parish chronicle records that the parish was served by one parish priest, two parochial vicars and five mounted chaplains in 1480. The church was destroyed on 14 October 1529, during the first siege of Vienna. It was rebuilt in 1534 and renovated in 1668. Both the church and the hospital were destroyed in the second siege of Vienna in 1683, whereafter only the church was rebuilt. In 1745, Cardinal Sigismund von Kollonitz donated an artefact belonging to Saint Severinus to the church, which has been revered as a holy relic ever since. The church spire was built in 1752. During an archaeological dig in 1952-53, the remains of a Roman building were uncovered beneath St. James's Church. The Roman ruins lay within the bounds of the church and sometimes beyond; the building had been destroyed twice and houses two early Christian graves. The tiles used on the graves were produced by the Tenth Legion. To the north of the church lies a Roman cemetery; an Avar grave was also found near here in 1980. It has been suggested that this cemetery may be the origin of the name Heiligenstadt (Holy town). Every cemetery was once considered a ‚Äúlocus sanctus‚Äù (Holy place); this cemetery may have been so significant for Heiligenstadt as it developed during the Middle Ages that the settlement was named after it.Alfred Neumann: Vindobona, 1972, S. 110f, Earlier theories that the modern name is a reference to the grave of Saint Severinus have been rejected by more recent research.Felix Czeike: Wien Kunst&Kultur; Lexikon, , Next to the church is a vintner's house in which Ludwig van Beethoven stayed during summer 1817.Galerie Szaal Hans Robert Pippal: Am Heiligenst√§dter Pfarrplatz, √ñl auf Platte, signiert, 40 x 50 cm.

It is possible to reach the centre with Line B and Line E of the city's underground, at Leandro N. Alem and Correo Central respectively. History=Buenos Aires Central Post Office= The need for a new central post office in Buenos Aires was first raised in 1888 by the director of the Correo Argentino (Argentine Postal Service) at the time, Dr. Ram√≥n J. C√°rcano. Later that year a Congressional bill providing for its construction was signed by President Miguel Ju√°rez Celman. The Ministry of Public Works commissioned French architect Norbert Maillart for its design in 1889.Intertour net: Palacio de Correos The post office under construction (c. 1920) Designating a 12,500 m¬≤ (134,000 ft¬≤) city block on the corner of Leandro Alem and Corrientes Avenues for its construction, the Public Works Ministry chose the site as a means to beautify a land reclamation site where the shores of the R√≠o de la Plata had reached just a decade earlier. The sudden onset of the Panic of 1890 and the subsequent crisis led to President Ju√°rez Celman's resignation, however, as well as to the project's suspension.Buenos Aires Nos Cuenta n¬∫ 10 (1994). \\"La Alameda, el primer paseo de la ciudad.\\" The building in 2005 The national government revived the plans only in 1905, and in 1908 Maillart returned to Buenos Aires, where his new plans for a larger post office were approved the following April. Differences later arose between Maillart and the Argentine government, and the French architect abandoned the project in 1911. Construction, which had just started, was then left to the supervision of Maillart's chief assistant, Jacques Spolsky. Spolsky reengineered the design, which featured masonry supports, to consist of a steel-reinforced concrete structure, for which 2,882 steel pillars were placed onto the bedrock, 10 m (33 ft) deep. Limitations on the city's public works budgets resulting from the onset of World War I forced another major design alteration in 1916. The planned construction of an elevated causeway on Leandro Alem Avenue was cancelled, and a mezzanine was quickly added to the plans to compensate for an entrance which would now be one floor below the original's. Spolsky achieved this without substantial changes to the building's exterior, though the number of delays led to considerable cost overruns on the project, and its budget was exhausted in 1923. President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, however, obtained Congressional support for a new appropriation, and on September 28, 1928 (two weeks before the end of Alvear's tenure), the new Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones was inaugurated. The building's eclectic design, drawing prominently from French Second Empire architecture, was typical of the public buildings and upscale real estate built in Buenos Aires and other Argentine cities early in the 20th Century. Despite their differences, Maillart went on to design the Buenos Aires National College and the Argentine Supreme Court, and Spolsky designed post offices for Rosario and San Miguel de Tucum√°n in a similar style while at work on this structure. The largest public building completed in Argentina up to that point, the building measured eight stories and 60 m (200 ft) in height and included over 88,000 m¬≤ (948,000 ft¬≤) of indoor space. The central hall was decorated with marble throughout, features stained glass windows, numerous bronze sculptures and mail drop boxes, and a four-story-high domed ceiling.Clar√≠n (6/17/2005) =Per√≥n era= The grandiose setting led President Juan Per√≥n to move his offices in the building during the early years of his 1946-55 tenure, and the First Lady, Eva Per√≥n, designated a wing as the first headquarters of the charitable Eva Per√≥n Foundation. During the subsequent automobile boom in Argentina, the plaza facing the post office was made into a parking lot. Opposition to the 1979 sale of the parking lot for the construction of a local Bank of Tokyo headquarters proved insurmountable, and the plans were cancelled. Guillermo del Cioppo, the Minister of Urban Development and later Mayor, ordered the construction of an underground parking structure instead, and the lot above was converted into a park in 1983. The building was designated a National Historic Monument in 1997. Most of its postal activities had been transferred to a newer structure during the Per√≥n administration, and it handled only international mail in later years. In 2005, its last remaining postal bureau was closed. Under construction and restoration in 2012 Cultural Center in 2015, with new illuminated cupola dome Cultural centre President N√©stor Kirchner proposed the conversion of the abandoned building and landmark into a cultural centre in June 2005, and two years later, plans were approved for the construction of two concert halls and an exhibition gallery for the creation of the Bicentennial Cultural Centre (Centro Cultural del Bicentenario). The centre's winning design was provided by a team of architects led by siblings Enrique, Federico and Nicol√°s Bares. It was originally scheduled to be inaugurated on the Argentina Bicentennial, May 25, 2010.Clar√≠n (9/4/2007) Completion of the new centre was delayed considerably, however, and in 2012 its designated name was amended as Centro Cultural del Bicentenario Presidente Dr. N√©stor Carlos Kirchner, in honor of the late former president. Upon opening in May 2015 it was named the shorter Centro Cultural Kirchner (English: Kirchner Cultural Centre). When the architects added new spaces and elements, they purposely used different materials such as clear and frosted glass and stainless steel, to maintain sight of the ornate Beaux-Arts style beauty of the original building. The main concert hall La Sala Sinfonica (originally named La Ballena Azul, or \\"The Blue Whale\\"), seating 1,950 people, is a blimp-shaped three-storey auditorium and opera house floating in the former package-sorting area. It houses a Klais Orgelbau pipe organ (opus 1912), which can be played via a remote console. It has four manuals and about eight thousand pipes. It weighs 30 metric tons and features three 32' stops in p√©dale registers. The other principal venues are the Sala Federal for music, and La C√∫pula and Sala Argentina for live theater.Culturalkirchner.gob.ar: N√©stor Kirchner Cultural Centre Since the inauguration of President Mauricio Macri (whose father, Francisco Macri, led a conglomerate that once owned the building), the Centre became part of the newly formed Federal System of Media and Public Contents (Sistema Federal de Medios y Contenidos Publicos) and has sought to de-emphasize its function as a homage to N√©stor Kirchner. The Centre is now branded simply as \\"CCK\\" and the room that once housed a memorial display in honour of Kirchner has been dismantled.El Pais (11/5/2016) The Macri administration has intended to change the name of CCK to the \\"Bicentennial Cultural Centre\\" (Centro Cultural del Bicentenario).Taringa (25/11/2015) La Nacion (09/10/2016) In October 2016, a bill was introduced in Congress to prohibit the federal government from naming facilities after a president who has not been dead for at least 20 years, effectively forcing CCK to be renamed upon passage and enactment of the bill.The Bubble (10/10/2016) The Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, founded by P√©ron in 1948 but homeless for 67 years, has taken up permanent residency at the Kirchner Centre. As many as 10,000 patrons a day visit venues and events at the Kirchner Centre.

In 2018, the Corporation was operating an asset base with an installed capacity of 1,909 MW in Canada, the Northeastern United States and France. The Corporation was created in 1990 as a joint venture between the leaders of three companies: Laduboro, Albany Oil and Exar. The name Boralex is derived from the names of these companies: LaduBOR, ALbany Oil and EXar.http://www.boralex.com/en/boralex/history.aspx In December 2017, A Word About Wind ranked Boralex's CEO, Patrick Lemaire, 58th in the latest annual edition of wind industry influencer report. History In 1997, to support its growth and take on new projects, Boralex issues its first public share offering to finalize several acquisitions and strengthen its financial position. Cascades' interest in Boralex decreases to 71%. Boralex ends the year with an asset portfolio of 11 power stations with a total installed capacity of 62 MW. The next year, Boralex gains its first foothold in France with the acquisition of La Rochette hydroelectric power station and moves into the wood-residue thermal energy market with the acquisition of the Stratton power station in Maine, USA; other thermal power stations will be acquired in subsequent years. By the end of 2001, Boralex holds: 200 employees, 18 power stations in Qu√©bec, the United States and France, a total installed capacity of close to 350 MW, with electricity being generated by hydroelectric, thermal and gas- and wood-residue-fired cogeneration power stations. In November 2002, Boralex takes its first steps in wind power generation, starting up its first wind farm in Avignonet- Lauragais in France. This diversifies its sources of generation and allows it to further its development in France. In the late 2000s, Boralex continues to expand in the wind power market with developments in Canada. The consortium of Boralex and Gaz M√©tro Limited Partnership, with the assistance of the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, is awarded two of the three wind power projects submitted in response to Hydro-Qu√©bec's call for proposals for 2,000 MW. The Seigneurie de Beaupr√© Wind Farms will have a total installed capacity of 272 MW and will start operating in 2013. To this date, the Seigneurie de Beaupr√© Wind Farms remain the largest wind site in Canada (when including the C√¥te-de-Beaupr√© community wind farm). Boralex then strengthens its presence by acquiring the rights to nine wind farms in Ontario. Thames River site, which benefits from an installed capacity of 90 MW, will be built in three phases. In November 2016, the Niagara Region Wind Farm was commissioned. With a total installed capacity of 230 MW, NRWF is the largest wind project in Southern Ontario. In July 2017, Boralex announces that Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec (\\"la Caisse\\") has acquired all of the Class A common shares of Boralex held by Cascades Inc. representing 17.3% of the outstanding shares for the amount of $287.5 million. As part of the transaction, the Corporation and la Caisse have agreed to explore partnership opportunities with respect to investing in future projects developed by Boralex that are in line with its growth strategy. On April 20, 2018, Boralex enters into a purchase agreement to acquire the Kallista Energy Investment SAS portfolio and strengthens its position as France's largest independent producer of wind power by increasing its installed capacity from 609 MW to 772 MW. Worldwide, Boralex increased its total installed capacity by more than 11%, from 1,456 MW to 1,619 MW. On June 20, 2018, Boralex announces an agreement to acquire Invenergy Renewables' Interests in 5 Wind Farms in Qu√©bec for $215 million, a $180 million public offering and a $45 million private placement. Located in the MRC d'Avignon and the MRC des Appalaches in Eastern Qu√©bec, the Projects were commissioned between March 2012 and December 2016. They comprise state-of-the-art Enercon and GE turbines. The Projects benefit from long-term Power Purchase Agreements (\\"PPAs\\") with Hydro-Qu√©bec Distribution expiring between 2032 and 2041. Boralex announced five commercial commissionings in the Fall 2018 and an installed capacity of 1,909 MW.

Khadkas in Eastern, far-western and mid-western Nepal are descendants of the ancient wildings tribes who are believed to be a worshipper to other Brahmin tribes and long time rivals of Panday. Also, the Khadkas were dominant fighters of Uttrakhand before 18th century.

Also Khadka soldiers and kith and kin got separated to different parts of country after the death of their king. Khadga was an ancient PaikelƒÅ (warrior) rank along with ThƒÅpƒÅ, RƒÅnƒÅ and Bu·∏çhƒÅ.  History  Mansingh Khadka Magar was a king of Gorkhakot which later named as Gorkha until 1559. There was always been a running event called Liglig Daud annually where winner of race was chosen as King Of Gorkha Kingdom Drabya Shah ( Youngest Son Of Yashobrahma) was invited to take over a throne by the Brahmins in particular Bhagirath Panth and Ganesh Pande But he was not a physically good to run in an event and started a conspiracy . On Wednesday the 8th of Bhadon Badi, Saka 1481 (A.D. 1559) Rohini Nakshatra being an auspicious day, Drabya Shah was aided by Bhagirath Panth, Ganesa Pande, Gangaram Rana Magar, Busal Arjyal, Khanal Bohra and Murli Khawas of Gorkha, concealed himself in a hut. Ganesa Pande had collected all the people of who wore the brahmanical thread such as the Thapas, Busals, Ranas and Maski Ranas of the Magar tribe, they went by the Dahya Gauda route and the Durbar. Drabya Shah killed King Mansingh Khadka Magar with his own hand, with a sword. At the same auspicious moment Drabya took his seat on the gaddi .Dravya Shah used the army of the Magar (an ancient tribe of Nepal) to invade neighboring states and his successors continued this aggression to increase the territory belonging to Gorkha By 1570, when Dravya Shah died, the running race was but a memory among the people. Different kingdoms such as Rishing, Ghiring, Argha, Khachhi, Gulmi, Dhor, Satung, Paiung, Bhirkot, Gharung Mishikot, Isma were collectively known as 'Barha Magarat' or Confederation of Twelve Magar Kingdoms and were ruled by Magar Kings. Each year, people celebrate a festival of Barhakune Tal in Ghorahi of Dang district to commemorate the founding of Twelve Magarats. Similarly, there existed 'Athara Magarat' or Confederation of Eighteen Magar Kingdoms located west of Kali Gandaki River, primarily inhabited by Kham Magars.

Overall, the Ivorian-Soviet relations were sporadic and frosty as the Ivorian president F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny mistrusted the Soviet Union and had a negative view of the Soviet role in Africa. 1967‚Äì1969 The Soviet Union had declared its recognition of the independence of C√¥te d'Ivoire and offered the new state diplomatic relations in a telegram issued on August 6, 1960 (one day before independence of C√¥te d'Ivoire was declared). The Soviet Union had begun to import cocoa beans from C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1959, but this trade was discontinued in 1961.Brzezinski, Zbigniew. Africa and the Communist World. Stanford, Calif: Published for the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace by Stanford University Press, 1963. p. 73 However, in the early phase of Ivorian independence Soviet analysts classified the Ivorian government as 'reactionary'.Brzezinski, Zbigniew. Africa and the Communist World. Stanford, Calif: Published for the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace by Stanford University Press, 1963. p. 14 By the mid-1960s, there was a shift in Soviet attitudes towards C√¥te d'Ivoire. The new Soviet ambition to seek development of contacts with C√¥te d'Ivoire could be seen as part of a wider strategy, directed towards enhancing contacts to regionally important moderate states in the Third World (another example in West Africa was Nigeria).Katz, Mark N. The USSR and Marxist Revolutions in the Third World. Woodrow Wilson Center series. [Washington, D.C.]: Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 1990. p. 33 Another factor that hampered the development of Ivorian-Soviet links was the fact that Soviet Union had close links with Guinea, ruled by Houphou√´t- Boigny's adversary Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©. Guinea was accused of fomenting opposition inside C√¥te d'Ivoire, and there were suspicions that the Soviet Union had given its support to these activities. The Soviet-Guinean cooperation was however broken off.Meyer, Frank S. The African Nettle: Dilemmas of an Emerging Continent. Freeport, N.Y.: Books for Libraries Press, 1970. p. 36 A mutual agreement to establish diplomatic relations between C√¥te d'Ivoire and the Soviet Union was announced on January 23, 1967. In November the same year the first Soviet ambassador to C√¥te d'Ivoire, Sergey Petrov, was appointed. On May 30, 1969, C√¥te d'Ivoire declared that it severed the relations with the Soviet Union, as allegations were directed that Petrov had given direct support to a 1968 protest at the National University of C√¥te d'Ivoire.Ginsburgs, George, and Robert M.

The building has two components namely, the Mahal or the palace, which was built first by Akbar Shah II in the 18th century, and the entrance gate that was reconstructed in the 19th century by Bahadur Shah Zafar II, popularly known as \\"Zafar\\" (the nom de plume of Bahadur Shah II) meaning ‚ÄòVictory‚Äô. It has a forlorn history because Bahadur Shah Zafar, who wished to be buried in the precincts of the Zafar Mahal (palace) and the famous Dargah of Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki in Mehrauli, Delhi, was deported by the British to Rangoon, after the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, where he died of old age. The monument today is in a ruined state. Locals play cricket and gamble here. ASI had done a very little to preserve this monument. History Zafar Mahal, is the ruined summer palace of the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar II. The Moghul Dynasty, which started with the first Mughal Emperor Babur who conquered Delhi in 1526 AD ended after 332 years when on 7 October 1858 the last Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II (1837‚Äì1857) was tried for treason by the British and deported to Rangoon, Burma, now Myanmar from the imperial city of Delhi. The irony of this history is also that he travelled in a bullock cart, with a group of British Lancers escorting him. The graves in Mehrauli in the precincts of Zafar Mahal, built within a marble screen enclosure by Jahandar Shah for his father Bahadur Shah I and others who followed, is a minor reflection of the history of the place. Shah Alam II who had the misfortune of being blinded by Ghulam Qadir, the Rohilla leader was buried here. He was considered a \\"puppet ruler\\", first under the Marathas and later under the British. His son Akbar Shah II was also buried here. Mirza Fakruddin son of the last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died early ushered the end of the Moghul regime, was also buried here. But Bahadur Shah Zafar who had identified the location for his grave (sardgha ‚Äì the vacant land for burial) was the most unfortunate (ill fated) as he was deported to Rangoon and was buried there. The exiled emperor died in November 1862. He was buried with great urgency in the night itself with \\"lantern light\\" in presence of his few family members under the direction of a British officer. The grave was initially unmarked but later a Tablet was erected at the location but only in the 20th century. His mazar (grave) has at last become a shrine and the local Burmese and also visitors from India and Pakistan consider him a Pir (saint). It is also said that the nationalist leader of India, founder of the Indian National Army, Subhas Chandra Bose took a formal oath at this grave to free India from foreign rule. Structure Multichambered dalan with a terrace Ruins of the palace with the three white domes of Moti Masjid and Dargah of Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (left) in the background The palace, located at about to the west of Ajmeri Gate of the dargah of Khwaja Kaki has an imposing gate. It was built in 1842 by Akbar Shah II. Built as a three-storied structure in red sandstone embellished with marble, it is around wide with a gate opening called the Hathi gate (built to allow full decorated elephants with the howdah to pass through) is of opening at the entrance. An inscription on the main arch credits building of the gate (as an entry gate to the existing Mahal) by Bahadur Shah II in the eleventh year of his accession as Emperor in 1847-48 AD. A broad Chhajja (cantilevered projection) built in the Mughal style is a striking feature of the arch. At the entrance gate, the logo has small projecting windows flanked by curved and covered Bengali domes. On both sides of the arch, two ornate medallions in the form of large lotuses have been provided. The gateway also depicts a classic tripolia or three-arch opening into the baaraadaree or 12 opening structure, which fully draws the breeze. In the top floor of the palace, there is multi chambered dalan (arcade room with one open side overlooking a courtyard), considered the Indian part of the structure, which has terrace on the palace side and with a view of the entrance at the other end. European type of structures of 19th-century vintage are also seen in external decorations, which are not very pleasing. A fireplace is also seen on an inside wall, identified as a European influenced addition to the palace. A painting by Ghulam Ali Khan shows Prince Mirza Fakhruddin sitting in front of the fireplace, entertained by musicians and singers.While in the background we can see the Moti Masjid with its golden domes.(Top) Mirza Fakhruddin sitting in the middle , the fireplace just behind him.(Bottom)The fireplace today. Moti Masjid in the 1890s. Moti Masjid, Mehrauli, built by Bahadur Shah I. A masjid (mosque) called the Moti Masjid (pearl mosque), built by Bahadur Shah I (d.1712), was a private mosque of the royal family, which has now been subsumed within the palace precincts. The mosque is a small and unique three-domed structure made of white marble. Its construction is also credited to Bahadur Shah. The austere mosque has the mihrab on the west direction of prayer but is unusually not embellished, except for little border of floral carving on the south at the top edge of a dado. The Chhatta Chawk or vaulted arcade design of the Lahore gate at the Red Fort in Delhi has provided the basic design that was replicated for the Zafar gate. It is a large covered passage (arcade) with arched apartments on either side. The arcade, which has rooms within its enclosures, located just after the entrance of the gate, is two directional; one runs towards south, and the other is to the east. The palace, situated a few steps down the arcade, is now in a dilapidated condition. Its restoration is limited by the inadequate documents to deduce the original construction details. The Archaeological Survey of India document titled \\"List of Mohammedan and Hindu Monuments\\" of March 1920 provides only sketchy details. Every year Bahadur Shah Zafar used to visit this palace for hunting during the monsoon season. Also, every year, he was honoured at this palace during the Phool Walon Ki Sair (procession of the \\"Flower Sellers\\") festival held in February/March. Conservation A fifteenth-century dome in Zafar Mahal. It was declared a protected monument in 1920 under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, but is now encroached with new structures built on parts of its southern and eastern walls. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has also listed this monument as a conservation area. Now, as a part conservation activity of heritage monuments, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has proposed to set up the Mughal Museum in this palace with the intention of encouraging visitors and also to ensure removal of extensive encroachments (see photo in gallery below) that have taken place in the precincts of the old palace. ASI considers that the Museum would be a tribute to the legendary last Mughal emperor Zafar who was known more for his poetry than his administrative achievements.But until 2020 no work has taken place to make a museum.  Poetic pathos  Bahadaur Shah Zafar who was known as the poet-king wished to be buried next to graves of his predecessors Bahadur Shah I (1701‚Äì1712), Shah Alam II (1759‚Äì1806), Akbar Shah II (1806‚Äì37) and their families at sardgah or grave in the marble enclosure adjoining the dargah of the 13th century Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki in the Zafar Mahal precincts. He had special attachment to this place in Mehrauli, particularly with the tomb of Qutb Kaki, the Sufi saint of the Chisti order as he was his mureed (disciple). After he had been deported, while in Rangoon (now called Yangon) prison, Bahadaur Shah Zafar penned his couplet known by the title \\"do gaz zameen\\" meaning two yards of land, lamenting for his fate of not finding a place for his burial (at his chosen place of burial) in his home country. The couplet reads in Urdu language as: Kitna hai badnaseeb Zafar Dafn ke liye Do gaz zameen bhi Mil na saki kuye yaar mein English translation: > How unlucky is Zafar! For burial, even two yards of land were not to be had > in the land of his beloved. Just before he died, he wrote some more ghazals (couplets), which are touching for the pathos they convey. It is now, therefore, probably an appropriate time that a suitable memorial is erected at the vacant burial place he had chosen in the precincts of Zafar Mahal. Access Mehrauli village in South Delhi is well connected by a good road net work and it is also part of the Qutb complex, which is a favourite visitors destination. New Delhi International Airport is from Mehrauli. The nearest rail head is New Delhi Railway Station, which is by road. But within Mehrauli, finding Zafar Mahal in the labyrinth of narrow streets of the village needs direction and landmarks. The tomb of Adham Khan is a much visited place and from here after crossing the main road and walking through a narrow lane reach Hazrat Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Khaki‚Äôs shrine (a popular Muslim pilgrimage centre). From this shrine, walking barefoot after passing through twisting lanes reach Moti Masjid and the Zafar Mahal complex. The small marble enclosure on the right of the Masjid houses the graves of some of the Mughal emperors and also the vacant grave of Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar.

Common and widely distributed throughout Britain and Ireland wherever there is suitable habitat though easily overlooked due to its unobtrusive nature. These hoverflies inhabit coniferous and deciduous forests, woodland, hedgerows, scrub and gardens Generally they prefer shady places low to the ground. Description Baccha elongata, female hovering Baccha elongata can reach a length of .J.K. Lindsey Commanster It is one of the smaller hoverflies, the wing length is around 4.5 to 8 mm. The long, very slender body of these hoverflies is unmistakable. They also differ from other hoverflies by their elongated, thin abdomen ending in club. This club-shaped abdomen is black with a yellow spot on the 3rd and 4th segments. Legs are brownish yellow. Forehead is brightly hairy. Members of the eristaline genus Sphegina are also very slender and can be found in similar habitat but those flies have a rather different enlarged hind femur, whereas in Baccha this feature is slender. As with most hoverfly species the sexes can be told apart by the male's eyes meeting on the top of the head, but separated in the female. This species is very similar to Baccha obscuripennis Meigen, 1822. Biology Adults can be seen on the wing from spring until autumn, in two generations (April/June and July/September or October). They mainly feed on pollen and nectar of Compositae, Rosaceae (Alchemilla xanthochlora), Apiaceae (Angelica sylvestris, Heracleum sphondylium) and Hedera species. As with most other members of the subfamily Syrphinae the larvae are predatory though there seems to be a preference for a variety of different ground-layer aphids.Nature Spot This species overwinters as a larva.

Established in 2007, it offers credit building credit cards under the VISA brand for UK residents with a limited or uneven credit history. It also offers a fixed rate bond service, launched in 2011. Vanquis Bank company logo History Vanquis was set up by Provident Financial and licensed for Consumer Credit by the OFT in 2002. It received authorisation from the Financial Services Authority the following year. Initially conceived as a pilot scheme from Provident, it received approval from the parent group to expand in 2004 and relocated to the current Head Office location in London in 2005. Following extensive marketing and advertising, increased business volumes resulted in the customer services department moving to larger premises at Chatham in 2008, in part of what used to be the Chatham Naval Dockyards. In 2009 Vanquis rebranded, launched new credit cards and won the Credit Provider of the Year at the Credit Today Awards, something it would repeat in 2010, 2011 and 2012. In 2011, a further call centre was opened in Bradford, and a High Yield Bond product was authorised by the FSA. Vanquis also received a Passport banking license to operate in Poland in 2012. Management structure Vanquis is overseen by the Provident Financial board, in addition to its own management team. John de Blocq van Kuffeler is non-executive Chairman of Provident, after joining the group as Chief Executive in 1991 from Brown Shipley Holdings PLC. He is also Chairman of Huveaux PLC. Managing Director Peter Crook joined Provident in September 2005, after previously being director of Barclaycard in 2000 and MD of UK Consumer Finance. Finance Director Andrew Fisher was a former partner in Price Waterhouse and CFO of Premier Farnell, before being appointed in 2006. Managing Director Michael Lenora joined Provident in 2007, after holding positions in Barclaycard and Goldman Sachs. Offices 12 Arthur Street The head office of Vanquis is at 20 Fenchurch Street in London. Previous to this, the company was based in 12 Arthur Street. Originally called Minster House, it was redeveloped in 2004 by HKR Architects and Shieldpoint Ltd. The site around Arthur Street has uncovered historical artifacts dating from Roman waterfront development from around the 1st - 3rd century AD. Vanquis also operate a call centre in Chatham, Kent, making it one of the larger employers in the Thames Gateway area. In 2011, Vanquis opened an office in the new Southgate Complex development at 1 Godwin street in Bradford. Products Vanquis Bank offer two main credit building cards, the Vanquis Card, which has a representative APR varying from 39.9% to 59.9%, depending on the credit circumstances of the applicant, and the Aquis card, which has a representative APR of 29.8%. Both are licensed under Visa. Company results Provident invested ¬£6.7m in the Vanquis business and reached the break-even point in 2007. Vanquis provided above-estimated results in 2010, posting revenue of ¬£162m which helped Provident to strong end-of-year figures. Many have attributed the gains made by Vanquis and Provident to the continued UK recession and the difficulty of obtaining credit from mainstream lenders with existing adverse credit, however Vanquis cite that despite an increase in applications, acceptance rates are not significantly higher. In 2018, Vanquis was fined ¬£2m for failing to properly disclose charges on one of its popular repayment plans. Vanquis was also forced to pay ¬£169m back in compensation to its customers.

The D√∂bling parish was made independent in 1965; its services were held at first in rented accommodation in the Kreindlgasse. After an affordable site for a church was found in the B√∂rnergasse, the Weinbergkirche was erected there between 1980 and 1981.

A touring theatre is produced by a theater company, called the producing entity, often based in one location, and sold, as a show, by a booking agent to presenters. The presenters are responsible for arranging the venue, local crew, and any other considerations needed and specified in the rider. The presenter pays a set amount of money to the producing entity, and the producing entity then pays the traveling crew by check or direct deposit. The show could be in for one performance on one day, or for a \\"sit\\" of a week or longer. Extended engagements can last six weeks or more. Operation The contract between the presenter and the producing entity often includes stipulations on force majeure, labor actions, and schedule of compensations and when each payment is due. It can be split between a pre-performance fee, and a fee paid on the day of the performance, once complete. The contract will often stipulate the venue, venue contact information, and technical contacts. Also, the contract may state a minimum stage size, in order to ensure that the production will occur as envisioned. As with any contract, negotiations are possible, and can mean modifications to the set, staging, or responsibilities to the Presenter. Legalities Riders proscribe the needed support the touring company requires. They include, but are not limited to, local crew staffing, dressing room access, equipment to be provided by the presenter, minimum turn around time between shows, meals, lodging, parking, and loading dock requirements.

History Gisborne High School was the first and only state secondary school in Gisborne between 1909 and 1955. It was a co-educational school, however in 1956 it was decided that the school would be divided into Gisborne Boys' High School and Gisborne Girls' High School. Soon after the split, plans were made to establish a third and co- educational state secondary school. The Gisborne High Schools Board of Governors chose an area of land in outer Mangapapa to base the school, with the other option being in outer Kaiti. It was decided that the school be named 'Lytton', thus identifying it with Lytton Road where the school was to be situated. The original derivation of the name was from Lord Lytton, a distinguished British politician, poet and novelist. Building of the school commenced in May 1960 and in June of that year, Mr J. C. Wilson was appointed principal. Lytton High School was opened to new students on 1 February 1961 and began with a roll of 159 third form students and 10 staff. The school was officially opened by the then Minister of Education, William Blair Tennent on 27 October 1961. Like most New Zealand state secondary schools of the era, Lytton High School was constructed to the Nelson Two-Storey standard plan, characterised by its two-storey H-shaped classroom blocks. In 1963, after the construction of a second classroom block, it was decided the two-storey blocks should be given the MƒÅori names of local mountains Hikurangi and Arowhana. In 1967, the construction of a third block, Raukumara was completed, followed by a new library in 1969. During Mr. Wilson's eight years as principal, the school roll increased to 923 and the number of full-time staff increased from 8 to 43. The school continued to grow steadily until reaching its highest roll of 1,232 students in 1978. In 2002, the Te Whare Whai Hua young parents unit was established at the school to cater for teen parents. On 20 October 2008, then Governor-General Anand Satyanand officially opened the school's new outdoor gymnasium and sports centre. Lytton celebrated its 50th jubilee in January 2011 with an estimated roll of 810 students.Lytton High School at TKI School principals * J. C. Wilson, 1961 ‚Äì 1968 * T. M. Sharp, 1969 ‚Äì 1975 * R.

Ibold (August 1, 1936 ‚Äì August 20, 2010) was an American naval architect.  Biography  At the end of the last century, naval architecture saw the traditional look come back in force. Peter Ibold is one of the founders of this trend, with one of the earliest examples being his 1970 design for the Endurance-35, drawn the year he founded his naval architecture office in Paris. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ibold grew up in Connecticut. His study of civil engineering, town planning, and economics took him successively to the University of Maine (BSc), University of California at Berkeley, and Stanford University (MSc). An around-the-world trip in 1964‚Äì65 aboard a 12-meter trimaran, a first for that time period, was an adventure and a revelation for Ibold. It led to a contract with National Geographic. Starting out as a hobby, naval architecture became a passion for Ibold. In 1970, his design for the Endurance 35 won competition. Encouraged by an enthusiastic press, he put together his own design office. The office moved to Monaco in 1977 and then back to the French Riviera in 1990 before he finally settled back in Paris in 1993. Over the years, Ibold has designed more than fifty vessels, including powerboats, sailboats, yachts and workboats. They have been built in a number of yards, such as Belliure in Spain, Stratimer in France, and Colvic Craft in Great Britain. His collaboration with Belliure has been most fruitful. His greatest successes continue to be the Endurance series, with more than one hundred and fifty 35-footers, forty 40-footers and about thirty 30-footers launched to date by Belliure alone. For several years, Ibold lived on a Dagless Fleur de Lys, an English motoryacht. He has designed the motoryacht Albacore series (7 to 10 meters) as well as many other motoryachts. Ibold retained a love for all things concerning the sea, including his involvement with several foundations and maritime associations - a happy legacy of his round-the-world trip. Ibold died on August 20, 2010 in Paris, France. * Reproduced with the permission of The Encyclopedia of Yacht Designers, edited by Lucia del Sol Knight & Daniel Bruce MacNaughton, W.W.

The government was made up of members of the Barisan Nasional. Following the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Najib sworn in to become the sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia on 3 April 2009. Najib announced his inaugural Cabinet on 9 April 2009. First 100 days Najib entered office with a clear focus on domestic economic issues and long-standing political reform questions. On his first day as Prime Minister, Najib announced as his first actions the removal of bans on two opposition newspapers, Suara Keadilan and Harakahdaily, run by the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim-led People's Justice Party and the Pan Islamic Party, respectively, and the release of 13 people held under the Internal Security Act. He pledged to conduct a comprehensive review of the much- criticised law which allows for indefinite detention without trial. In the speech, he emphasised his commitment to tackling poverty, restructuring Malaysian society, expanding access to quality education for all, and promoting renewed \\"passion for public service.\\"PM Najib's maiden speech: 'One Malaysia. People First. Performance Now'. The Star, 3 April 2009 In a speech given to the media on 6 April 2009, Najib stated that Malaysia must establish \\"a new national discourse,\\" based on the principles of \\"transparency and accountability\\", \\"service to all\\"; and \\"respect and fairness in the public dialogue\\", in which \\"world-class, fact based reporting\\" including the new media led to better governance through \\"vibrant public dialogue.\\" CabinetPolicies=Economy= In his first month in office, Najib announced two packages of economic reforms, the first focused on the services sector, and the second on the financial services sector. Services sector On 23 April 2009, Najib announced immediate liberalisation of 27 services sub- sectors, covering health and social services, tourism services, transport services, business services and computer and related services accounting for 57 per cent of the total employment in Malaysia. Najib announced that the liberalisation was designed to attract foreign investment, and technology to create what he termed \\"higher value employment opportunities,\\" and to enhance Malaysian competitiveness. The liberalisation included scrapping a 30 per cent Bumiputera ownership requirement for investment in some services sector to help boost the country's flagging economy, with immediate effect. Najib also announced that five foreign law firms would be allowed to offer services in Islamic finance. Independent analysts described these actions as a positive move that needed to be accompanied by further action to move beyond historic preferences for Malays to have a substantial impact on the economy.PRESS STATEMENT, Liberalisation Of The Services Sector, 22 April 2009 Associated Press, ‚ÄúMalaysia scraps ethnic equity rule in some sectors‚Äù , 22 April 2009 Financial sector On 27 April 2009, Najib a package of measures to liberalise the financial sector including raising the equity in investment and Islamic banks and insurance and Takaful firms to 70 percent from 49 percent. Najib said two new Islamic banking licenses and two new commercial banking licenses would also be offered to foreign players with specialised expertise. He stated that the government would offer up to three new commercial banking licences in 2011 to world-class banks that can offer significant value propositions to Malaysia. The liberalisation measures were described as providing a mechanism to attract foreign capital by allowing foreign institutions to obtain up to 70 percent of the equity in any of these types of financial institutions in Malaysia. He also announced the liberalisation of rules on investment banks, insurance companies, and takaful operators, to give them the flexibility to enter into foreign strategic partnerships to enhance international linkages and business opportunities. He further stated that a higher foreign equity limit beyond 70 percent for insurance companies would be considered on a case-by-case basis for players who could facilitate consolidation and rationalisation of the insurance industry. These additional steps were characterised by independent analysts as a significant liberalisation of previous rules designed to promote Malay control of the country's financial services sector, and as likely to strengthen Malaysia's ability to participate in global financial services developments, although some criticised Najib for not raising the foreign equity participation for the country's commercial banks beyond the existing 30%.‚ÄúMalaysia opens financial sector but banks constrained,‚Äù‚ÄúMalaysia takes big step in finance liberalization‚Äù. Associated Press, 27 April 2009. =Human rights= One of Najib's first acts as Prime Minister was to release a few Internal Security Act detainees. On 8 May 2009 it was announced by the Malaysian Home Ministry that the remaining three Hindu Rights Action Front leaders and 10 others are to be freed from detention under the Internal Security Act. Najib disputes allegations that the release of the Hindraf leaders was to counter negative public opinion over the Perak state assembly crisis. LGBT Rights Razak stated in a speech in August 2015 at an international Islamic moderation seminar in Selangor, that he believed Malaysia should not support LGBT rights. Razak stated that his administration will do its best to uphold human rights but only within the confines of Islam and that Malaysia cannot defend the more \\"extreme aspect of human rights\\", such as gay, lesbian and transsexual rights. This prompted Human Rights Watch to suggest that Malaysia withdraw from the United Nations if the government was not serious about upholding human rights for all. =Education= On 14 April 2009, Najib announced initiatives on early childhood education, emphasising accessibility and affordability. He stated that the government would continue to support incentives for providing such education, such as by granting a 10 per cent tax reduction per annum to employers who set up childcare centres at the workplace on the cost of establishment of the centre for a period of 10 years. In addition, he said the government would provide RM 80,000 grants to government agencies to provide childcare centres at agency workplaces for renovation and furnishing such centres. He announced that the government had formulated a National Policy for Early Childhood Education and Care developed by the country's Permata program, and had accepted Permata's curriculum as the guiding principle for a national curriculum for early childhood education. He stated that the government had allocated an additional RM 145 million to facilitate the building of 150 childcare centres by Permata. There have been disagreements about the scrapping the use of English to teach maths and science in all schools which will begin in 2012 by Barisan Nasional partner parties MCA and Gerakan. They have called for the policy to be retained in secondary schools. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who opposes the move, used his blog to run a poll on the government's decision where out of the 26,000 who voted, about 80 per cent said they were against the reversal. Another poll on the issue, as part of the independent Merdeka Centre's survey on Prime Minister Najib Razak's first 100 days in office, showed that 58 per cent of the 1,060 respondents wanted the policy of teaching maths and science in English to continue. =Civil service= On 28 April 2009, Najib proposed structural reforms in the civil service to allow top posts in the public sector to become opened to persons from the private sector and government-linked companies (GLCs) in addition to existing personnel in the administrative and diplomatic service. He said his proposal for a multi-level entry system for the civil service would benefit from the cross-fertilisation between the talents of the public and private sectors and the GLCs. He also proposed an open-door policy whereby civil service officers can be loaned to the GLCs and vice versa for mutual acquisition of knowledge. He announced as government policy four paradigm shifts for modernising the civil service, including (1) recognition that wealth was created in the private sector, requiring government to ensure that its regulations promoted private sector capacity to generate wealth, rather than block it; (2) to move beyond evaluating success based on output to one based on outcome,\\" he said, citing as example education where emphasis should be given not only to having enough schools and laboratories but also the overall success, including the students' welfare and morale; (3) moving from bureaucracy which made things difficult to one which made things simple and easy for the people; and (4) moving from a focus on productivity to one that combines productivity, creativity and innovation.‚ÄúNajib Proposes Multi-Level Entry System For Civil Service‚Äù. Bernama, 29 April 2009 =Government reform= On 10 April 2009, Najib introduced a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge the performance and achievements of his Cabinet to provide a mechanism for the evaluation of each ministry of government, with a system for six-month reviews to assess effectiveness. He promised to review any Minister who failed to meet KPI standards, which Najib said would focus on impact, rather than inputs, and outcomes, rather than outputs, to ensure effective public service delivery. Najib stated that each of the government's 40 deputy ministers would be given specific tasks, and required each minister to establish KPIs complete with job specifications for themselves and their deputies within 30 days. Initial KPIs were established by mid-May 2009, described as \\"preliminary,\\" with a second round to follow based on a six-month assessment in November 2009.‚ÄúTricky task of fine-tuning KPIs\\". New Straits Times, 24 May 2009 =Minority outreach= In his first days in office, Najib visited the offices of a major Chinese-language newspaper and emphasised the importance of the Chinese community to Malaysia, before undertaking other direct outreach to Indian-origin communities of Malaysia including the Tamils, Malayalees and Sikhs. At the same time, he called for all Malaysia's ethnic communities to reach out beyond what he termed their \\"ethnic silos\\", stating on 15 April 2009 that Malaysians must \\"stand together, think and act as one people under the '1Malaysia concept'.\\" Najib urged Malaysians to \\"break away from operating in the ethnic prism as we have done over so many years\\", and to \\"go beyond tolerance and build trust among each other and build trust between various ethnic groups.\\"\\"Najib urges Malaysians to discard ‚ÄòEthnic Silo‚Äô Mentality\\". Bernama. =Foreign policy= Najib's initial actions as Prime Minister focused on economic stabilisation and domestic reforms, and did not visibly change long-standing Malaysian foreign policy. Najib's initial actions on foreign policy involved undertaking low-profile bilateral meetings with local counterparts. These included Indonesia, where the discussions involved heightening co-operation on tourism, oil and gas, and high-technology industries as well as electricity supply; Singapore, where the governments reviewed co-operation on enhanced transportation links, including a possible third bridge between Singapore and Malaysia; and Brunei, where Najib focused on border issues. In his first months in office, Najib has left broad policy statements to his new Foreign Minister, Datuk Anifah Aman, whose initial focus has been to re-emphasise Malaysia's long-time demand that the Israeli government agree to and act on a two-state solution that creates an independent Palestine, plus a new focus on counter-proliferation, including endorsement of new policies undertaken in the United States by the Obama Administration relating to reducing existing nuclear arsenals.\\"Statement By Hon. Datuk Anifah Aman, Minister Of Foreign Affairs Of Malaysia, Before The Ministerial Meeting Of The Coordinating Bureau Of The Non-Aligned Movement\\". Government of Malaysia 29 April 2009 =National Security Council Bill 2015= In December 2015, the National Security Council Bill 2015 was passed in Parliament after a marathon six-hour debate. The bill provides the Prime Minister of Malaysia with unprecedented powers, such as the ability to define what constitutes a security issue as well as deem any part of Malaysia a security area. Within that area, authorities may make arrests, conduct searches or seize property without a warrant. The bill was criticized by rights groups as inviting government abuse. The Malaysian Bar called it a \\"lurch towards an authoritarian government\\". The government defended the bill, with cabinet minister Shahidan Kassim saying the law is necessary to enable better coordination and a uniform response in the event the country is faced with security threats, and that the law does not contravene the basic human rights guaranteed under the federal constitution. 1Malaysia On 17 September 2008, Najib launched his personal website at www.1Malaysia.com.my in an effort to increase communication with the people. As Prime Minister, he has used the site as a communications portal to highlight his political and policy initiatives and to provide a location to solicit the opinions and policy goals of any Malaysians who choose to take part in the site. While Najib has personally emphasised the meaning of 1Malaysia as an effort to unify that which is common to all Malaysians, during the initial days of his new government, the 1Malaysia concept has become subject to a broad range of interpretations and discussion, both by those in favour of and opposed to particular government policies, and involving different elements of Malaysia's major ethnic groups.

History In 1885, The Saturn Club was founded by thirteen young men who wanted to congregate in a less formal setting than their father's traditional clubs. The first three founders were: Carlton Sprague, William F. Kip, and Francis Almy. They recruited the ten others including John B. Olmsted and Ansley Wilcox. They first congregated on Saturdays, hence the name, to socialize and play cards. Dues were a month, and the initiation fee was a chair. With a nod to the many \\"University Clubs\\" of the time, Saturn's founders patterned their board of directors after that of a small college, including: *Faculty *Dean *Registrar *Bursar Initially, the members met in a house owned by Sprague's grandfather but by 1886, the members decided to rent three rooms at the rear of a dwelling at 640 Main Street. In 1887, they moved to another rented house, a small Second Empire style home at 331 Delaware Avenue, before relocating to a larger, Italianate cottage at 393 Delaware Avenue, opposite the Buffalo Club. In 1889, the club and its 150 members formally incorporated in Erie County and decided to construct their own building. By February, the directors had purchased a lot, 417 Delaware Avenue, at the southeast corner of Delaware Avenue and Edward Streets, not far from the Buffalo Club. On this site, they constructed a three-story brick building, designed by the Marling & Burdett firm of Buffalo. The building was dedicated on December 13, 1890. Beginning in the 1890s, the club added baseball games, lectures, costume balls, and vaudeville shows to the club's programming. A library was initiated and debates were held on the important issues of the time. These debates often included participation with other area clubs, including the Buffalo Club, the University Club, and the Garret Club. In 1900, then Gov. Theodore Roosevelt visited and had dinner at the club during his visit to Buffalo. In 1985, women were officially admitted as full members, however, in the immediate years preceding the change, women had full use of the club, through a relationship with the Garret Club, as well as through their spouses or other connections. =1922 building= In December 1920, only 30 years after the original buildings dedication, a new building committee suggested selling the existing clubhouse and erecting a new building elsewhere. Club member Duane Lyman, of Bley & Lyman, was asked to develop new plans for a clubhouse along with Ralph Plumb, a club member. The club purchased property at 977 Delaware Avenue and approved Lyman's plans for the present day Tudor style building, by February 1921. On October 21, 1921, the cornerstone of the new building was laid and exactly one year later, on October 21, 1922, the clubhouse was dedicated. The Tudor Revival structure featured an enclosed open courtyard. Note: This includes and Accompanying eight photographs By completion, the project ended up totaling . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. =Renovations= In 2002, the club underwent a $1 million () renovation that added two squash courts as well as general upgrades to its athletic facilities. The Saturn Club already had one international regulation doubles court and two singles courts. The new courts allow the club to host competitions. The other renovation work includes improvements to both the men's and women's locker rooms and the addition of exercise equipment. Hamilton Houston Lownie Architects, PC designed the additions and Integrated Realty & Development Corp. served as construction manager. In 2014, the interior was remodeled by Michael Donnelly Interiors and focused on two rooms: The Delaware Room and The Red Room. The Red Room features a fireplace and is accented by dark wood paneling along with a rich red covering. Panel draperies with 12-inch-wide, red fabric bands were added to frame the leaded windows. New furniture, chandelier covers and brown paisley carpeting with a red background were also added. The Delaware Room has a more clean look showcasing the oversized historic wall panels that depict seaside life. The fabrics are striped with blues and beiges that are intended to complement the murals. Prohibition Front page of the Buffalo Courier from August 29, 1923During the early years of Prohibition, Saturn had a bar and a bartender, but did not provide drinks. On advice from its lawyers, members could keep items, unquestioned, in private lockers and order all the ingredients for a drink, without spirits, to be passed into the club's rooms through a small sliding door. On August 29, 1923, Federal agents under William J. Donovan, who himself was a member of the club, raided both the Saturn Club and the Country Club of Buffalo. Agents found at least sixty quarts of whisky, a similar amount of gin, five gallons of moonshine, bottles of champagne, vermouth, and other liquors inside the organization's lockers, according to court documents. The chair of the club's house committee told reporters the night of the raid that the liquor ‚Äúevidently was smuggled in by bootlegging employees of the club.‚Äù A listing of those charged with dry law violations was published in the newspaper After the names were published, the members and the club had little option but to agree to a settlement and do away with the sliding doors.

There were eighteen editions, broadcast in three series of six episodes. The format for the programme was that Singleton would interview one celebrity guest, who would also face questioning from the audience of children assembled in the studio, after a short 'fly-on-the-wall' film introduced each guest. Guests came from different areas of public life, including politics, explorers, sports, pop music and entertainment. The best remembered edition of the show (and the only one ever to be repeated on BBC television) featured Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education and Science in the British Government. When asked by a child in the audience if she wanted to be Prime Minister, Thatcher responded that she did not have enough experience and (to an earlier question) that there would not be \\"a woman Prime Minister in my lifetime\\" (see external links). Two years later, she was elected leader of the British Conservative Party and became Prime Minister in May 1979. All three series were produced by Jill Roach. For the last series only, each edition was billed individually in the Radio Times as \\"Val Meets Guest Name\\" (ie Val Meets Susan Hampshire), but the show's titles were always \\"Val Meets... The VIPS\\". A later series, In The Limelight With Lesley, ran on BBC1 in 1980, and followed the same format, but Lesley Judd presented.

His middle name Cappelen is from the family of his paternal grandmother, Marie Severine Cappelen (died 1900) married to Peder H√∏egh Smith (died 1881).Haugen, Lambrecht: Cappelen-slekten 1627-2008 (2008), page 41. He grew up as the eldest son among nine children and attended the Trondheim Cathedral School. He was educated as a chemist at , now the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, taking his final exam in 1893. The same year he emigrated to the United States.Elias Anton Cappelen Smith ‚Äì utdypning (NBL-artikkel) (Norsk biografisk leksikon) Career Cappelen Smith was employed in the metallurgical industry working from 1895 to 96 for Chicago Copper Refining Company, during 1896‚Äì1900 for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and from 1901 to 10 as head metallurgist for Baltimore Copper Smelting and Rolling Company in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. It was while at this company, that he and William H. Peirce developed the , which revolutionized the Manh√®s-David process. Peirce-Smith converter Longitudinal and cross sections of a Peirce-Smith converter. The Peirce-Smith converter, introduced in 1908, improved significantly the copper converting process. Before this improvement, the converter was a long cylindrical vessel, lined with sand and clay. It was developed by two French engineers, Pierre Manh√®s and from 1880 to 1884. Their copper-converting process, named the Manh√®s-David process, was directly derived from the Bessemer process. In this horizontal chemical reactor, where air was injected into copper matte, a molten sulfide material containing iron, sulphur and copper, to become molten blister, an alloy containing 99% copper. But the basic slag produced during the blowing combined with the acid silica refractory lining, thereby causing a very short lifetime of the lining. By developing a basic refractory material adapted to the matte refining process (in magnesia bricks), Cappelen Smith and William H. Peirce found a way to drastically increase the lifetime of the lining. It has been stated that, in some cases, the process allowing an increase from 10 to 2500 tons of copper produced without relining the converters.William Peirce and E.A. Cappelen Smith and Their Amazing Copper Converting Machine Larry M. Southwick. JOM: The Member Journal of TMS . International Peirce-Smith Converting Centennial. October 2008 Volume 60, NO.10 A reduction of the cost of copper converting from 15 to US$20 to 4‚Äì5 USD has been stated.Saga in Steel and Concrete, Kenneth O. Bjork, Norwegian-American Historical Association, 1947, pp. 249-250 The Peirce-Smith converter replaced quickly the Manh√®s-David Converter : by March 1912, the Peirce-Smith Converting Co claimed that \\"over 80% of the copper produced in [the U.S.] is being converted either in P-S type converters or on basic lining, under license, in the old acid shells\\". It is still in use today, although the process has been significantly improved since then. In 2010, with 250 converters working in the world, the Peirce-Smith converters refine 90% of the copper matte. Guggenheim process The Guggenheim process is a method of chemical precipitation which employs ferric chloride and aeration to prepare sludge for filtration. Cappelen Smith improved the leaching technology and applied it to the low grade copper ore deposits of the Guggenheim family mining interests in the Chuquicamata open pit copper mine in the north of Chile. The Guggenheim process first the exploitation of poor quality copper ore in the Chuquicamata mine starting in 1915. This mine is still today one of the world's largest copper resources. Honors In 1920 Cappelen Smith was honored with the gold medal of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America for distinguished service in the art of hydrometallurgy. In 1925, he was made a commander 1st Class in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. He was made a member of the Royal Norwegian Scientific Society during 1926. He was also commander of the Chilean Al Merito-order and was awarded an honorary doctorate at Drexel Institute of Technology. In 1930, Cappelen Smith helped finance the installation of the Steinmeyer organ in the Nidaros Cathedral for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Stiklestad.

It is situated to the west of Durham, a short distance to the south of Bearpark. Ushaw Moor falls within the Deerness electoral ward in the City of Durham constituency whose MP since 2019 has been Mary Foy. Etymology It seems most likely that the name 'Ushaw' comes from Scandinavian origin which, when translated, means 'wolves' wood'. With the addition of moor we get 'the moor near the wood of wolves'. History Parish registers suggests that the settlement dates to a least the sixteenth century. The village existed in a largely agricultural state, with a windmill being its one feature up till the nineteenth century. Ushaw collegeIn 1804 Bishop William Gibson ordered the building of St Cuthbert's College, later named Ushaw College, which opened in 1808. A chapel was added in 1847, followed by a library and exhibition hall. This closed in 2011 as a seminary and opened in 2014 as a visitor attraction and is known as Ushaw Historic House, Chapels & Gardens. In 1858 a drift mine was established at Ushaw Moor Colliery selling coal on the landsale system. This was purchased in 1879 by Henry Chaytor of Witton Castle. During his tenure there was a large strike, following the deliberate sacking of an elected union leader in 1881. The strike was ended when a number of policemen were brought into the village to evict the strikers and their families; such treatment was not uncommon in those times. Mr Chaytor, sick of the years of industrial unrest, sold Ushaw Moor colliery to Pease & Partners in 1883. From this time, the workmen and community had an easier life, the new owners helping rather than opposing them. However, Ushaw Moor colliery closed in 1960, as part of the collapse of the Durham coal fields. In the last thirty years it has grown and become the centre of the Deerness Valley, becoming unusually prosperous where most pit villages have struggled. Good links with Durham and Newcastle and good local schools and amenities has meant it is very popular with first time buyers. Geography Ushaw Moor is approximately 2 miles west of Durham and 14 miles south of Newcastle upon Tyne. The Deerness Valley Railway Path, an 8-mile stretch of scenic woodland pathway converted from the former tracks of the Deerness Valley Railway, runs through Ushaw Moor.http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Deerness+Valley+Railway+Path Education Ushaw Moor is the location of Silver Tree Primary School and St Josephs Roman Catholic Primary School. Durham Community Business College is the main secondary school for the village, with Durham Studio Sixth Form opening in 2011 on the same site. Ushaw College, until its closure in 2011,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wear-11504840 was a Roman Catholic seminary and one of the constituent colleges of the University of Durham. The college is currently being used by Durham University Business School whilst its own site is redeveloped. Ushaw College also hosts the annual Ushaw Jazz Festival.

K. Srinivasan was an Indian radar officer who founded a pre-school for deaf children.  Early life and background  Srinavasan was the second of two children to Krishnaswami Iyengar and Mythiliamma. His older sister was born in 1920, also in Madras. He graduated from high school two years early with honours. However, when he was 19, tragedy struck when his father died due to an undiagnosed ulcer.  Education  Srinavasan spent three years (1942‚Äì45) at Madras Presidency College (now known as The Presidency College, Chennai) where enrolled in the Physics (Honors) graduate programme. He was not only successful in his academic studies, but he also excelled in athletics, becoming the College's mile-running champion, taking part in championship boxing tournaments and being named College Athlete of the Year. he also excelled in the University Officers Training Core (U.O.T.C.), where he rose to be named an Under-Officer, the highest rank open to student cadets. After university, he worked in private industry, marketing Japanese industrial products. After a serious train accident in 1950, he switched careers and joined the Indian Air Force as a commissioned officer in the engineering services in 1951.  Air force career He entered the Indian Air Force on 6 Oct 52, as a commissioned officer in the Technical Branch as an Aeronautical Engineer. He was rapidly promoted to the position of Instructor at the Air Force Technical College. There, he moulded Trainee Officer Engineers with civil career experience Engineers into defence staff following appropriate discipline and regulation. He was then promoted to Commanding Officer of Signals units for two successive terms. In his second term, he officiated as Commanding Officer of a Ground Training School with more than 1000 trainees. Before retiring he was on the Directing Staff of the Management Faculty for the Technical Officers Management Course. He served in three wars, the Indo- Chinese war in 1961, the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistan- Bangladesh war of 1971, and retired from the Air Force on 30 October 1975 having risen to the rank of Wing Commander.  Deaf education  Wing Commander K. K. Srinivasan Preschool for the Deaf When his son Raja was found to be deaf, Srinavasan decided to take premature retirement from the Air Force and learn more about deaf education so as to give maximum support and growth opportunities for Raja. Initially, Raja was enrolled at the Bala Vidyalaya school in Madras (now Chennai), but then decided to move to Mysore to get services from the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing. He then realised that there was an immediate need for a school which was not expensive and would add to the demand for hearing-impaired education schools. He started a pre-school for the hearing impaired children which he named Helen Keller Pre- school for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, after the famous deaf-blind author, activist and lecturer Helen Keller. The school was initially started in Mysore at the first floor of Srinivasan's house in the International Year of the Handicapped in 1980. In the 1990s, he successfully applied for City government (Mysore Urban Development Authority) grants to get land and build a school and dormitory for deaf children and their parents, which became the institute for the Mother and the Deaf Child. By the 2000s, he had semi-retired from school administration, but guided and often came to school during festivals and visits by important dignitaries, and gave speeches urging the parents to keep focused and dedicated. Subsequently, the Institute for the Mother and the Deaf Child has been renamed as 'Wing Commander K. K. Srinivasan Institute for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing'. Personal life Srinavasan was nicknamed 'Cakes' by his close friends whilst at university. He married Rathna Janardhana Iyengar (daughter of Indiramma Iyengar and H. R. Janardhana Iyengar) in a grand marriage ceremony in Mysore on 22 March 1954. He had two sons, Raja, born 1970 and Vivek, born 1974.

Sunday services are held in English at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. On the first Sunday of the month there is choral evensong (except for July and August). History Although there has been an Anglican priest in Vienna, acting as honorary chaplain to the British ambassador and ministering to the Anglican resident community, at least since the late 17th century, there has only been a permanent building since 1877. Previously services were held in the embassy, from 1831 until 1874 in the Schenkenstrasse and later demolished to make way for the new Burgtheater, thereafter in the new purpose-built embassy in the Metternichgasse. From the middle of the 19th century there was a considerable increase in size of the British community living in Vienna, due especially to the establishment of ever more British businesses in Vienna as a result of closer economic ties between the United Kingdom and Austria. Following the building of the new embassy it soon became apparent that an Anglican church in Vienna was also required. The establishment of a permanent place of worship for the British community was proposed to the Austrian Government in 1874 by the British ambassador Sir Andrew Buchanan, but the plan was initially thwarted by a political obstacle. In 1855 Pope Pius IX had concluded a concordat with Austria guaranteeing the prime recognition and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church throughout the Austrian Empire (and thereby maintaining a certain influence on Austrian politics). By 1870, however, following Italian unification, the Vatican had lost most of its temporal power in Italy and was attempting to increase its authority outside its limited sphere. This the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph objected to, and in 1874 Confessional Laws were passed annulling the Concordat of 1855 and regulating the relations of the Roman Catholic Church with the State. One of these laws limited the right of public worship in the imperial capital to the Roman Catholic Church and the two recognised Protestant Churches: the Augsburg (Lutheran) and the Helvetic (Calvinist) Confessions. Furthermore, there was an absolute condition that the officiating priest must be an Austrian subject. This naturally left the British community in a difficult position although the law did allow members of a non-officially recognised religion (such as the Church of England) the right to private worship. There is evidence that the Emperor came to regret the effect these laws had on various foreign communities living in his capital, and especially the British, with whom he was keen to encourage good relations in the hope of wooing the United Kingdom away from her German allegiance. The British ambassador wrote to raise objections to the laws, in particular to the condition on the nationality of the priest, and received the reply that this condition could not be relaxed but that the Austrian Government would not oppose the building of an Anglican church in Vienna by the British residents themselves, so long as it came under the protection and jurisdiction of the British Embassy. In this way the legal impasse could be bypassed, and negotiations began to acquire a plot of land across the road from the newly completed embassy building. In January 1876 the plot was registered as the property of the bishop of London, and building commenced. Land and architect The land occupied now by several embassies between the Rennweg and the Neulinggasse was originally owned by the Chancellor Clemens Prince Metternich. Following his death in 1859, his son Richard inherited the whole area including the palace his father had built shortly before his downfall after the liberal revolution of 1848 (since 1908 Italian Embassy). Richard Metternich (the former name of the Jaur√®sgasse, Richardgasse, commemorated him) suffered financially in the financial crisis of 1873 and sold his extensive garden to a property developer, who saw the benefits, given the building boom in Vienna at that time following the demolition of the City Walls and construction of the Ringstrasse, of reselling the land divided up into building plots. To add value to his plots he encouraged the Great Powers to move out of the overcrowded Inner City and to create an Embassy District. The British and German Governments were the first to see the advantages of such an investment. The architect Viktor Rumpelmayer (1830‚Äì1885) was born in Pressburg (now Bratislava), the son of a stonemason. He studied in Munich and Paris before moving to Vienna in the late 1860s when he worked in the studio of August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der N√ºll, the architects of the Vienna Opera (completed 1869). In 1872 he set himself up as an independent architect and designed a town palace for Count Sigray on the corner of Reisnerstrasse and Jaur√®sgasse (now the Iranian Embassy). This was possibly how he came to the attention of the British ambassador and received the commission to design the new British Embassy. The building, on the corner of the Jaur√®sgasse and the Metternichgasse, was begun in 1873 and completed the following year. The French influence on Rumpelmayer's style is very apparent, particularly in the interiors. To build the new church Rumpelmayer was again chosen as the architect in 1876. In the meantime the British community had been active raising money for the new church. More than ¬£1000 was raised from British businesses that had exhibited at the World Exhibition held in Vienna in 1873. A commemorative board at the back of the Church lists the main subscribers: these include Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, several businessmen and private individuals, as well as a number of Austrians who employed British subjects. The Ambassador and members of the embassy staff also contributed to the fund, as well as the Minister (ambassador) of the United States, indicating the early involvement of American Episcopalians in the existence of Christ Church. In total contrast to his recognised preference for French-influenced Neo-Baroque, Rumpelmayer chose a restrained, sober, more Protestant Gothic style for the church, possibly at the request of the British community (reflecting the taste for Neo-Gothic church building in England at the time), or even for reasons of cost (by reducing added expense for superfluous ornament). The decision to use brick rather than stone was certainly a financial one (for most Viennese building at the time the brick would be covered in stucco to hide the cheapness of the material), but brick too for many would conjure up an image of English architecture. Nevertheless, the bricks were to be handmade, and the stone and woodwork was to be of the highest quality available. The church was also provided with a modern coke- fired heating system, gas lighting and, remarkably for the time, a lavatory. The character of Christ Church is defined by careful detailing ‚Äì the pews, the pulpit, the organ loft and particularly the impressive hammer-beam roof ‚Äì as well as good lofty Gothic proportions. The nave is 18 metres long and 15 metres high to the apex of the roof. Rumpelmayer later adapted his designs for Christ Church, adding a tower and stone cladding, for his Maria Himmelfahrtskirche in Berndorf (Lower Austria), commissioned by the Krupp family and completed in 1883. The church was opened by the Chaplain at that time, the Rev. George Liddel Johnston, on Sunday 8 July 1877 in the presence of the British ambassador at which time the plaque at the back of the church was unveiled proclaiming that the church had been built \\"in Conformity with an order in Council of His Imperial Majesty Francis Joseph I, permitting the erection of a place of worship in which Divine Service shall be conducted according to The Rites of the Church of England\\" and stating that \\"the site is registered as the property of The Right Honourable and Right Reverend The Lord Bishop of London [and] is under the jurisdiction of Her Britannic Majesty's Embassy.\\" At that service, however, no bishop was present, and Christ Church was not officially consecrated until 11 June 1887, possibly because of hitherto outstanding bills for the construction. Interior The interior of the church. =East window= The east window. The windows of the church were originally planned to be glazed with plain glass with ornamental geometric tracery. Over the years these were replaced by some modest coloured stained glass panels commemorating worthy members of the resident community. The East Window originally showed Christ the Good Shepherd and was installed to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. All the windows were destroyed at the end of the Second World War. The present East Window was designed by Frederick W. Cole, who had served during the war as a captain in the Royal Engineers designing camouflage, but was in fact a member of the Royal Society of Arts and the British Society of Master Glass Painters, and chief designer for the renowned Westminster firm of stained glass-makers William Morris and Co. which made the window. The Royal Engineers were responsible for repairing the war-damaged church for use as the Garrison Church (including removing shrapnel from the pews and rewiring the church). As the inscription at the bottom of the central panel shows, the window is \\"Dedicated to the Glory of God by the British Troops in Austria 1945-1948\\". It commemorates the presence of British troops in Austria and the part played by the British 8th Army in the liberation of the country. =Marble relief= The marble relief of Queen Victoria. A marble relief in the centre of the south wall commemorates Queen Victoria. It was erected after her death in 1901 and is an early example of the work of the sculptor Anton Hanak (1875‚Äì1934), whose more typical work can often be seen adorning the fa√ßades of Vienna Council tenement blocks of the 1920s. =Organ= The organ was built by the Quebec- based organ builders L√©tourneau, to replace the original organ of 1897. It was installed in 1987 after the congregation had raised 2 million Austrian Schillings. It is known among organists as a particularly fine instrument, especially for smaller works. Chaplains There have been 16 chaplains of Christ Church since its foundation of which two must be mentioned: =William Hechler= The Reverend William Hechler was Chaplain from 1885 to 1910. The son of a German-born missionary to the Jews in Germany and France, Hechler was raised with an intimate knowledge of Jewish tradition and history and developed a passionate belief in prophecies to be found in the Books of the Old Testament. He had previously been tutor to the son of the Grand Duke of Baden, and through this contact this shambling white-bearded eccentric, often wearing a huge cape made with pockets designed to hold Bibles and cushions, became a popular figure in the Courts of Germany. When serving in Vienna, he spent much of his time travelling across the continent lecturing European royalty on the latest archaeological finds from the Holy Land. His study in Vienna became a museum overflowing with archaeological treasures from the Holy Land, models of the Temple and over a thousand rare Bibles. His lifelong interest in the Jewish people complemented his fascination with Bible prophecy and Hechler became convinced that the years 1897-98 would see the return of the Jews to their ancient homeland. In 1896 he got to know Theodor Herzl, who hoped through Hechler to get access to the German Emperor Wilhelm II, whom Herzl saw as his great hope in establishing the Jewish State. Hechler was indeed able to put Herzl in touch with the Emperor in 1898. Although the meeting gave legitimacy to Herzl's movement, it soon became clear that support would not come from Germany, but one of the results of the Zionist-German contacts was to awaken Britain to the aspirations of the Jewish people. Hechler continued to serve as Herzl's adviser, envoy and translator until Herzl's death in 1904. As Herzl's trusted friend and confidant, Hechler was a frequent guest in his home and was the last non-family member to visit him on his deathbed. =Hugh Grimes= The Reverend Hugh Grimes was Chaplain from 1934 until 1938. He too had a fascination for Judaism and soon after his arrival in Vienna he was befriended by a number of Jewish families prominent in the considerable Jewish community of the city. With the arrival of the Germans in Austria in March 1938, Grimes realised the full horrific implication of the annexation for the Jewish population of Vienna. Although many assimilated Viennese Jews, and indeed Grimes himself, failed to grasp at first the full significance of the racial aspect of Nazi policy towards Jews, from the very beginning Grimes felt that he was obliged to help his Jewish friends, despite official British complacency towards the problem. From the day after the Anschluss Grimes began baptising Jews in the belief that an Anglican baptismal certificate would give Jews some sort of ‚Äì albeit temporary ‚Äì protection (the Church of England being an established State Church and Christ Church being an Embassy Chapel, and Grimes having diplomatic status), thereby at least gaining time to put their affairs in order before emigrating, or even to enable Jews to obtain transit visas through neighbouring countries. Over the following weeks word got round the Jewish community and by July 1938 Grimes had baptised some 900 Jews, mostly from the most prominent Viennese Jewish families, holding the hasty ceremonies 6 days a week. In July Grimes returned to London to explain his actions to the suspicious and disapproving authorities, and his place at Christ Church was taken by a retired Anglican priest from Cologne, the Reverend Frederick Collard, who continued the baptisms, sometimes carrying out over 100 a day. In August, the verger of Christ Church, Fred Richter, himself a converted Austrian Jew, was arrested by the Gestapo on the charge of aiding espionage; he had been recruiting spies for the Passport Control Officer at the British Consulate, Capt. Thomas Kendrick, who, as well as issuing visas for the United Kingdom, was also head of British Secret Services on the Continent. Kendrick, the Gestapo's main target, was also arrested. The Gestapo used this opportunity to look into the activities at Christ Church and arrested Collard (who, unlike Grimes, had no diplomatic immunity). He was released, severely shaken, after several days in the notorious Gestapo headquarters, the Hotel Metropole, but went on to carry out another 800 baptisms until he was recalled to Britain in September 1938. In all some 1800 Jews had been baptised. Of these only some 100 did not survive the war years, and most of these were arrested in other countries where they had fled partly through Grimes' and Collard's help. Fred Richter was used as a scapegoat by the British government to secure Kendrick's release before he revealed too much about the British Secret Service's activities in Europe. He was sentenced by the Germans to 12 years imprisonment for aiding espionage, but was later moved to Auschwitz where he was murdered. =Today = Today the congregation of Christ Church, Vienna which also serves Klagenfurt, Ljubljana (Slovenia), Zagreb (Croatia) and Bratislava (Slovakia) is a multi-generational, multi-ethnic congregation serving Anglicans from around the world. The church's present Chaplain is the Venerable Patrick Curran who is also the Archdeacon of the Eastern Archdeaconry in the Diocese of Europe. There is a prison-visiting team. The church also runs a second-hand shop (Salesianergasse 20).

However Kutsch and Riemens report that some other sources have given the year of her birth as 1862 She was a Kammers√§ngerin of the Dresden Royal Opera where she sang for 25 years and was known for the power, vibrancy and dramatic quality of her voice.Sadie (1992) p. 1168 She created the leading female roles in the world premieres of several operas, most famously, the title role in Salome by Richard Strauss. The novelist E. M. Forster, who saw her 1905 Dresden performance as Br√ºnnhilde in Der Ring des Nibelungen, wrote: \\"She towered. She soared. Force, weight, majesty! She seemed to make history.\\" Forster (1963) Vol. 14, Biography Marie Wittich was born in Giessen and studied singing in W√ºrzburg with Frau Ober-Ubrich, a sister of the prominent soprano Asminde Ubrich.The spelling of her teacher's surname is given as \\"Ubrich\\" in German sources, e.g Kutsch and Riemens (1994) p. 3222, as well as in Warrack and West (1992). However, Sadie (1992) p. 1168 and Kuhn (2000) give the spelling as \\"Ubridz\\" She made her stage debut in 1882 in Magdeburg as Azucena in Il trovatore and went on to sing in Basle, D√ºsseldorf, Dresden, and Schwerin, where in 1886 she sang the title role of Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Aulide for the inauguration of the Mecklenburgisches Staatstheater. In 1889, she became a permanent member of the Dresden Royal Opera (Hofoper). Amongst her early performances, there were Lenore in Fidelio and Senta in The Flying Dutchman. While at Dresden, she also sang in several world premieres, including Penelope in August Bungert's Odysseus' Heimkehr (Odysseus' Return) (1896), Ulana in Paderewski's Manru (1901), and most famously the title role of Richard Strauss' Salome (1905). During the rehearsals for the premiere of Salome, several members of the cast became dismayed by the demanding and complex nature of their parts, none more so than Wittich, who was reluctant to sing a role which Strauss described as \\"a sixteen-year old princess with the voice of Isolde\\".Strauss quoted in Puffett (1989) p. 5 Her reply to him was, \\"One just does not write like that, Herr Strauss. Either one thing or the other.\\"Wittich quoted in Fisher (2005) p. 33 She and most of the cast nearly withdrew from the production, but eventually relented and continued with the rehearsals. However Wittich, who was 37 with a somewhat matronly figure (Strauss referred to her as \\"Auntie Wittich\\"), flatly refused to perform Salome's Dance of the Seven Veils or to kiss the severed head of John the Baptist. Her oft-quoted remark to Strauss in this respect was: \\"I won't do it; I'm a decent woman.\\"Wittich quoted in Malik (2008) p. 149. See also, Time Magazine, \\"May Bugs & Spice\\", 12 December 1949 In the end, the opening night on 9 December 1905 was a triumph with the singers taking 38 curtain calls.Puffett (1989) p. 5 A ballerina from the Dresden company performed the Dance of the Seven Veils. A distinguished Wagnerian singer, Wittich appeared regularly in Bayreuth from 1901 to 1909 where she sang Sieglinde, Kundry, and Isolde. She made her Covent Garden debut in 1905 as Br√ºnnhilde in a performance described as \\"one of the most sympathetic and womanly Br√ºnnhildes we have seen here.\\" Rosenthal (1958) p. 308. She continued to sing there through 1906 in four other Wagner roles ‚Äì Elsa, Elisabeth, Isolde, and Sieglinde. Other theatres where she sang as a guest artist after 1900 were the Prague State Opera (1902), the Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels (1907), and the National Theatre in Munich (1906 and 1907). In 1914, she made her farewell to the stage in a performance of Tristan und Isolde in Dresden, and taught singing there following her retirement. Marie Wittich died in Dresden on 4 August 1931 at the age of 63. References Notes Sources *Fisher, Burton D, Strauss's Salome, Opera Journeys Publishing, 2005, . *Forster, E.

Location  The b√∂rde landscape is located in the pentagon of land between Hanover - Peine - Brunswick - Salzgitter - Hildesheim and is dominated by arable countryside with no large towns or cities. The natural boundaries of the area are: to the west the Leine, to the north the Burgdorf-Peine Geest, to the south the Innerste Uplands and Hildesheim Forest. To the west is the Calenberg Loess B√∂rde of Calenberg Land. To the east in the direction of Brunswick it transitions gradually into the Magdeburg B√∂rde. These B√∂rde landscapes are part of the Central European loess zone, which lies north of the Central Uplands and stretches from Belgium in the west to Western Ukraine in the east. Based on the type of land surface and drainage situation, the Hildesheim B√∂rde is further divided into five areas: * Hildesheim B√∂rde * G√∂dringen Hills * Ilsede B√∂rde * Nettlingen Ridge * Lebenstedt B√∂rde  Soils  The Hildesheim B√∂rde region is almost entirely covered by a layer of ice age loess to a depth of up to 2 m. Its soils are the most fertile in Germany and it has been cultivated for 4,000 years. Today the soils of the b√∂rde secure annual record harvests for the local farmers. This enables demanding crops such as sugar beet and wheat to be grown. The land produces an average of 0.8 kg of wheat or 5.5 kg of sugar beet. The dark soil raises the temperature of the ground which extends the annual growing period.  Woods and settlements  The region has a gently undulating landscape with low hills. Large areas are used for arable farming and woods are rare in the B√∂rde due to the intensive way in which the land is used, so much so that it is sometimes referred to as a 'wheat or sugar beet steppe'. Most of the trees are isolated and only hedges and bushes along the roads and streams break up the scene. Most of the settlements are clustered villages (Haufend√∂rfer). Their houses were built close together in order not to waste valuable farmland.  Soil value  After the Second World War the farmland at Eickendorf in the Magdeburg B√∂rde, where German soil values were measured in 1934, was no longer available for West German comparison testing due to the division of Germany. As a result, a federal facility for testing soil values was established at Harsum, part of Machtsum, which was located within the Hildesheim B√∂rde. This has fixed the agricultural comparator (Landwirtschaftliche Vergleichszahl or LVZ) at a value of 100. Machtsum lies 10 kilometres northeast of Hildesheim. On later measurements a still higher LVZ value of 102.8 was obtained near M√∂lme, the highest value recorded in Germany to date. M√∂lme lies about 20 km east of Hildesheim and is part of the municipality of S√∂hlde.  Transport  The AB 7 autobahn crosses the western part of the Hildesheim B√∂rde. From the motorway services of Autobahnrastst√§tte Hildesheimer B√∂rde, situated on a rise a few kilometres southeast of Hildesheim, there is a view of the landscape up to about 20 km away towards the north. The Mittelland Canal runs north of the B√∂rde in an east-west direction. The river Fuhse crosses the area from southeast to north.  Literature  * Hildesheimer and Kalenberger B√∂rde.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 830 Walker and Battersby were augmented by a drum machine, and specialized in space rock/post-rock guitar instrumentals. At times the duo were joined by others including David Wrench (synthesizer/piano/cello). The band's first release was the track \\"Floating around in the bubblebuzz\\", which was released on the Voyage to the Cosmic Underworld: Volume One EP in 1995 on Ochre Records. The following year, they released two tracks on a split 12-inch EP with The Bass Cadets, and in January 1998 they released another split single with Ectogram. The band's first dedicated release was a four-track 10-inch EP in July 1998, which was followed in February 1999 by the debut album, Translucent. The band then released an album a year until 2003's Colli De Pedona. Their 2001 mini-set Mont Ventoux was themed on the Tour de France; The title track is a reference to one of the highest summits in the race, \\"Anquetil\\" was named after five times Tour winner Jacques Anquetil, and \\"Sommet\\" featured the voice of Eddy Merckx. In March 2003, the band recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. The band also recorded a session for the B-92 radio station in Yugoslavia, these tracks included on the US compilation Reality Channel. In the same year they contributed four exclusive tracks to the Seasons compilation album on Ochre Recordson which featured interpretations of the seasons of the year, with other tracks by Longstone, Lakescene (Walker's side-project), 90¬∞ South, and Stylus. The Land of Nod headlined the Cheltenham 'John Peel Night' in October 2005, which is the last time the band performed together. Walker is also the leading figure in the band Pulsar. Musical style The band's music is generally described as post-rock or space rock, but has also been described as shoegazing and \\"ambient instrumental rock\\".Couture, Fran√ßois \\"[ Translucent Review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision CorporationRaggett, Ned \\"[ Mont Ventoux Review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision CorporationHopkin, Kenyon \\"[ Reality Channel: An Introduction To The Land Of Nod Review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation While the band have cited bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen (particularly Will Sergeant's guitar playing) as an influence, comparisons to Krautrock band such as Faust (band), Neu!, and Popol Vuh have been common.

The Other Way) is a former Yugoslav rock band.  Band history = 1970s and 1980s = In the first half of the 1970s Branko Po≈ægajec (vocals, keyboard, flute), Halil Mekiƒá (guitar) and Vjekoslav Poldrugac (bass guitar) performed in the reformed Novi Akordi (trans. New Chords). After Mekiƒá left the band due to his army obligations, Ismet Kurtoviƒá (vocals, guitar, flute) joined the band. This lineup released single with songs \\"Opet\\" and \\"Odlazak\\" and went on a tour. In July 1974 they were joined by Boris Turina (drums), who decided to leave a career of a table tennis player and dedicate himself to music. Turina previously wrote lyrics for several songs of Crveni Koralji and performed with Crveni Koralji and the first lineup of Zlatni Akordi. As this lineup of the band did not feature any original member of Zlatni Akordi, the members decided to rename themselves to Novi Akordi (New Chords), and in October 1974 adopted the name Drugi Naƒçin (The Other Way). The band members chose their name after a poem by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and the band's logo was designed by comic book author Igor Kordey. The band started to hold regular concerts at the music club Big Ben in Zagreb, and at the end of 1974 they recorded their debut album. The record label Jugoton from Zagreb did not want to sign the band, and the members broke the contract with another Zagreb-based record label, Suzy, because of disagreement about the album cover. Finally, the band signed for PGP-RTB from Belgrade, only because one of the editors liked the album artwork and decided to offer Drugi Naƒçin a contract without even listening to the album. Drugi Naƒçin, released in 1975, was a concept album with music influenced by Wishbone Ash, Deep Purple and Free and lyrics dealing with solitude. The music was written by Po≈ægajec and Kurtoviƒá and the lyrics were written by Turina. And the end of 1976 Po≈ægajec left the band due to his army obligations, and during his absence guitarists Kurtoviƒá and Mekiƒá left Drugi Naƒçin and formed the band Nepoƒçin. After Po≈ægajac returned from the army Drugi Naƒçin continued their activity with guitarists Branko Bogunoviƒç and Nikola Geƒçeviƒá. This lineup released several singles, before Turina, Bogunoviƒá and Geƒçeviƒá left the band. Having left Drugi Naƒçin Geƒçeviƒá formed ≈Ωuta Minuta and later a better-known band Regata. Drummer Miroslav Budanko and guitarist Robert Krkaƒç joined Drugi Naƒçin, and soon after Ismet Kurtoviƒá returned to the band, bringing bassist Bo≈æa Iliƒá. After Krkaƒç joined Film, Danijel Veliƒçan became Drugi Naƒçin's new member. In 1982 this lineup released album Ponovo na putu (On the Road again) which did not gain the popularity of the band's previous album, but the band continued to perform actively until the second half of the 1980s when the band went on hiatus and performed occasionally only until 1990. = 1990s and 2000s = In 1992 Branko Po≈ægajec, with Iliƒá, Davor Senƒçar (a former Legija member, guitar) and Dra≈æen Kovaƒç (a former Regata member, drums) rerecorded some of the old Drugi Naƒçin songs and released them, with two new songs, on the compilation album Drugi Naƒçin. Guitarist Ernest Vinkoviƒá and keyboardist Branko Bardun also participated in the album recording. Debut albums of Drugi Naƒçin and Nepoƒçin were reissued on the CD Drugi Naƒçin + Nepoƒçin. In May 2000 Drugi Naƒçin performed as the opening act on the Jethro Tull concert in Zagreb, after which they disbanded once again. In 2008, the band reunited in the new lineup, consisting of Branko Po≈ægejac (flute, vocals), Bo≈æa Iliƒá (bass guitar), Damir Vuk (keyboards), Mladen Palenka≈° (drums), and Mario Domazet (guitar).\\"Drugi naƒçin i Svremena≈°i u DOB-u\\", b92.net In 2011, Davor Senƒçar died at the age of 52, after illness.

The area of the former Bridge Without ward today forms part of the London Borough of Southwark. It existed between 1550 and 1899.Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section City of London wards It was so called to distinguish itself from the Ward of Bridge Within which was on the Northern Bank of the Thames (and so within the Walls of the City of London) and is now simply called the Ward of Bridge. History In 1550 the new ward of Bridge Without was created to cover the City's area of control in Southwark (the three manors of the Guildable Manor, King's Manor and Great Liberty), the Court of Aldermen appointing its alderman; there were never any members of the Court of Common Council elected there as the three Courts Leet of the Manors fulfilled that representative role. The existing ward north of the river became Bridge Within. London Bridge viewed from Southwark: the Great Stone Gateway at the very southern end of the bridge formed the boundary between Within and Without. However, the City's administrative responsibility for the Without ward had in practice disappeared by the mid-Victorian era as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. St. Magnus-the-Martyr church. A 1720 map showing the wards of Bridge Within and neighbouring Billingsgate. Despite the fact that the area of Bridge Without had been removed completely from the City's boundaries in 1899, the ward continued to de jure exist and the Court of Aldermen continued to appoint an alderman for the ward by co-option, usually the senior emeritus Lord Mayor (or father of the City) until as late as 1978Barry One Off The Wards, or Aldermanries, in the Square Mile ‚Äî Bridge Without was then merged with Bridge Within, to become the present day Bridge ward. This is, in a sense, a return to the situation prior to 1550. However the ward is still officially referred to as \\"Bridge and Bridge Without\\" as a result of the 1978 amalgamation.Bridge Ward Club History of the Ward This had no practical effect in terms of representation on the Court of Common Council because Without had never had Councilmen. \\"Without\\" and \\"Within\\" denote whether a ward, or a division of one, fell outside or within the London Wall ‚Äî this is still the case for the wards of Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without ‚Äî though in this instance Bridge Without fell beyond the gates on London Bridge, rather than London Wall itself. The full span of London Bridge was for many centuries lined with buildings, including many houses, and they formed part of the ward of Bridge Within. Indeed, so numerous were the dwellings on the bridge that at one time it constituted three of the 14 precincts (a former sub-division of the wards) of Bridge Within.A Topographical Dictionary of England, Samuel Lewis, 1831, p 134 The present day Bridge ward was historically (1550-1978) known as Bridge Within. Relationship with Southwark Southwark was outside of the control of the City of London and was a haven for criminals and free traders, who would sell goods and conduct trades outside the regulation of the City Livery Companies. In 1327 the City obtained control from Edward III, of the manor next to the south-side of London Bridge ' the town of Southwark' (called latterly 'Guildable Manor', i.e. the place of taxes and tolls). The Livery Companies also ensured that they had jurisdiction over the area. From the Norman period manorial organisation obtained through major lay and ecclesiastic magnates. Southwark still has vestiges of this because of the connection with the City of London. In 1327 the City acquired from Edward III the original 'vill of Southwark' and this was also described as \\"the borough\\". In 1536 Henry VIII acquired the Bermondsey Priory properties and in 1538 that of the Archbishop. In 1550 these were sold to the City. After many decades of petitioning, in 1550 Southwark was incorporated into the City of London as 'The Ward of Bridge Without'. However, the Alderman was appointed by the Court of Aldermen and no Common Councilmen were ever elected. This 'Ward' was constituted of the original 'Guildable Manor' and the properties previously held by the church, under a charter of Edward VI, latterly called the 'King's Manor' and 'Great Liberty' manor. These manors are still constituted by the City under a Bailiff and Steward with their Courts Leet and View of Frankpledge Juries and Officers which still meet - their annual assembly being held in November under the present High Steward (the Recorder of London). The Ward and Aldermanry were effectively abolished in 1978, by merging it with the Ward of Bridge (Within). These manorial courts were preserved under the Administration of Justice Act 1977. Therefore, between 1750 and 1978 Southwark had two persons (the Alderman and the Recorder) who were members of the City's Court of Aldermen and Common Council who were elected neither by the City freemen or by the Southwark electorate but appointed by the Court of Aldermen.

They are located in the Garhwal Himalayan region in Uttarakhand, India. They are the subject of many legends that directly link their creation to Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The five temples designated in the strict pecking order to be followed for pilgrimage for worship are the Kedarnath () at an altitude of , the Tungnath (‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ó‡§®‡§æ‡§•)(), Rudranath (‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§®‡§æ‡§•) (), Madhyamaheshwar (‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§π‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) or Madmaheshwar () and Kalpeshwar (‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) (). The Kedarnath is the main temple, which is part of four Chota Char Dhams (literally 'the small four abodes/seats') or pilgrimage centers of the Garhwal Himalayas; the other three dhams are the Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri. Kedarnath is also one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The Garhwal region is also called the Kedar-Khanda after Kedar ‚Äî the local name for Lord Shiva. The region abounds in emblems and aniconic forms of Shiva sect of Lord Shiva, much more than the Vaishnava sect. The western part of this region in particular, which constitutes half of Chamoli district being known as Kedar-Kshetra or Kedar mandala, encompasses in its ambit all the five temples constituting the Panch Kedar. Visitors to Kedarnath shrine, the first of the Panch Kedar temples for which records are available, was an impressive 557,923 in 2007 as against 87,629 in 1987, a quantum jump in 20 years. History It is said that the Panch Kedar Yatra (pilgrimage) could be directly related to the Gorakhnath Sampradaya (recognized for their pilgrim traditions) of Nepal. As a proof, it is stated that the culmination of the pilgrimage was at Pashupatinath temple in Nepal, rightly where Lord Shiva's head is worshipped and not at Kedarnath where the hump is venerated. A further supporting fact mentioned in this regard is that the emblem used in Kedarnath temple dome is the same as displayed in the Pashupathinath temple dome in Kathmandu. Legends Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated. A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins ‚Äî the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and BrƒÅhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins ‚Äî the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Shiva temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region. Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (‚Äúhidden Kashi‚Äù ‚Äî the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tunganath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar, the face showing up at Rudranath and the hair and the head appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal. A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation. After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva. ;Worship rights The priests and pundits who worship in the Panch Kedar temples are from South India, except in Tungnath. Namboodiri brahmins hailing from Malabar, in Kerala officiate as chief priests at Badrinath temple and they are known by the name Rawals. Jangamas who are pure Veerashaiva Lingayats from Chitrakal in Mysore are the chief priests at the Madhyamaheswar temple. Dasnami Gosains founded by Adi Shankaracharya are the chief priests in Rudranath and Kalpeshwar temples. The Tunganath temple is served by the Khasi Brahmins. In the case of Tungnath, it is also said that the local Brahmins from Mokumath officiate as priests. ;Kedarnath Teerth Purohit Kedarnath Teerth Purohits (Panda) are ancient Brahmins from the Himalayan region of Kedarkhand. They have been in existence since the end of Treta Yuga and start of Kali Yuga. When Pandavas came to Himalaya seeking moksh and then went to Mahapanth, their grandson King Janmejay came to Kedarnth and granted the right of worshiping of Kedarnath temple to these Brahmins. The Brahmins live near Guptakashi and at the beginning they were 360 in numbers.

Kedarnath ranges drain into the Mandakini River that emerges from the steady edge of the Churabre glacier and forms the picturesque Mandakini valley. The Dudhganga, Madhuganga, Swargaduari and Saraswathi are the streams that flow in the valley behind the Kedarnath temple. Also seen close to the temple are four sacred ponds called Retah, Udak, Rudra and Rishi. Tunganath has an impressive backdrop of the peaks of Panchulli, Nanda Devi, Dunagiri, Kedarnath and Bandar Poonch. The Vaitarani stream flows near Rudranath. Kalpeshwar is located in the Urgam valley in a dense forest area. Urgam Valley has apple orchards, terraced fields where potato is grown extensively.

While it was one of several small communities formed in Lyme Township during the early years of settlement, the area long languished: many of the earliest landowners were speculators who refused to sell land to would-be settlers, many of the remaining tracts were long embroiled in probate lawsuits, and the lower sale price of federally owned lands farther west retarded interest in the acreage of this township, given its location on the western edge of the Firelands. Although the township's first sawmill was built on Levi Sutton's property, later industry was concentrated in other parts of the township.

The other trek starts from Mandal which is 12 km from Gopeshwar. This trek goes through Anusuya devi temple. Trek is very hard with a distance of approx 24 km. View from Naola PassView of Nanda Devi Legends and worship The Rudranath temple is believed to be established by the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Legend has it that the Pandavas came to the Himalayan mountains in search of god Shiva, to redeem them of the sins of killing in the epic Kurukshetra war. God Shiva did not want to meet them and left in form of a bull in the ground and re-entered in parts in the Panch Kedar places: the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tunganath, the navel and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheswar, the face showing up at Rudranath and the hair and the head appearing in Kalpeshwar. In winter, a symbolic image of Shiva is brought to Gopinath Mandir in Gopeshwar for worship. The Doli Yatra starts from Gopeshwar via Sagar. The Doli Yatris cross Lyuti Bugyal and Panar and finally reach Pitradhar. The worship of ancestors is done here. Then, after crossing Dhalabni Maidan, the Doli or the symbolic image of Shiva, reaches Rudranath.Here first the Vandevi is worshipped. The local belief is that Vandevi protects the area. The Kheshtra is protected by Vandevi or Vandevatas. The temple celebrates an annual fair on the full moon day in the Hindu month of Sravan (July‚ÄìAugust) that is mostly on the day of Rakshabandhan. The fair is attended mainly by locals. The priests at the Rudranath temple are Bhatts and Tiwaris of Gopeshwar. At Nandikund (), on the trekking route to Rudranath (if coming via Madhmaheshwar), devotees worship old historic swords protruding from the rocks, believed to be of Pandavas. Geography There are numerous sacred water tanks (\\"Kund\\") near the temple. These include Surya-kund, Chandra-kund, Tara-kund, Mana-Kund etc. Nanda Devi, Trishul and Nanda Ghunti are the famous mountain peaks, which provide the backdrop to the temple. The holy river Vaitarani or Baitarani or Rudraganga flows near the temple, which has a grey stone idol of Rudranath. The river is identified with the \\"river of salvation\\", where souls of the dead cross to reach the other world. Thus, devotees visit Rudranath to perform rituals of the dead, such as performing a pind offering. Some believe that offering a pind to ancestors here equals offering a hundred million at the holy city of Gaya. The mountain peaks of Trisul, Nanda Devi, Devasthan, Hathi Parbat and Nanda Ghunti are visible from Rudranath. The name \\"Rudranath\\", literally means, \\"Him who is Angry.\\" The mountain cave of Rudranath was modified into the temple we see today. Access Rudranath is sometimes considered as the toughest Panch Kedar temple to reach. Map of Rudranath The nearest airport is Jolly Grant, Dehradun (). The nearest railway station is Rishikesh (). Most trekking routes to Rudranath are from Gopeshwar or nearby places. A motorable road is present up to the village Sagar that's a hotel rudra for stay ‚Äî from Gopeshwar, beyond which a trek has to be undergone to reach Rudranath. The trek winds through tall grass, oak and rhododendron forests. The trek path is stated to be slippery. Other routes include: an uphill, trek from Gangolgaon ‚Äî from Gopeshwar ‚Äî through the forest and Panar and Naila shepherd settlements. Another trek route from Gopeshwar to Rudranath passes via Mandal () and then additional to the Anusuya Devi Temple and then another to Rudranath. The Anusuya Devi temple is home to goddess Anusuya, who is believed to help devotees in distress. A trek path is available from Joshimath via Helang too (considered a strenuous trek). There's also a trekking route to Rudranath from Kalpeshwar, via Dumak, Kalgont Kimana and Palla. The route meets at Urgam village, a little ahead of which is Kalpeshwar.

History The castle was founded in the 12th century by Renaudin de Bussy. It was rebuilt in the 14th century, and the Renaissance galleries were added in the 1520s. It was altered during the reigns of Henri II (1547‚Äì1559) and Louis XIII (1610‚Äì1643). Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy (1618‚Äì1693), fell into disgrace for allegedly having taken part in an orgy at the Ch√¢teau de Roissy, near Paris, during Holy Week. Bussy was ordered by Louis XIV to retire to his estates, where he passed the time by composing his Histoire amoureuse des Gaules. This account of various courtly love affairs caused further scandal, and he was eventually sent to the Bastille on 17 April 1665, where he remained for more than a year. Bussy only obtained his release on condition that he retired once more to Bussy-Rabutin, where he lived in exile from court for seventeen years. Although he briefly returned to court in the 1680s, he soon returned to Bussy-Rabutin, dying there in 1693. During his exile he amassed a collection of portraits, which remains in the ch√¢teau. Restoration works were begun in the 19th century by the comte de Sarcus, and the property was listed as a monument historique in 1862. It was purchased by the French state in 1929, and is currently managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux. Further restoration has been carried out since the 1970s. As a film location The ch√¢teau has been used as a scene for historical movies, including The Gallant Lords of Bois-Dor√©, La reine et le cardinal and La marquise des ombres.

Situated at an elevation of , Ukhimath is winter seat of Madmaheswar, It is the Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit, comprising five Shiva temples in the Garhwal region. The other temples in the circuit include: Kedarnath, Tungnath and Rudranath to be visited before Madmaheshwar and Kalpeshwar to be visited after Madmaheshwar. The middle (madhya) or belly part or navel (nabhi) of the Shiva, is worshipped at this temple, believed to be built by the Pandavas, the survivors of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Legend Early morning view of the temple in foggy weather The legend of Madhyamaheswar is an integral part of the legend of Panch Kedar, which is a captivating narration of the efforts of Pandavas to atone for the sins of their fratricide (gotra- hatya) act of killing their cousins, the Kauravas, and BrƒÅhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins - the priest class), during the epic Mahabharata war. On advice from sages and their trusted benefactor god Krishna they sought Lord Shiva to pardon them and bless them to attain salvation. Since Shiva was annoyed with them for their conduct during the Kurukshetra war, he tried to avoid them by assuming the animal form of a bull or Nandi and left for the Himalayan Garhwal region. But the determined Pandavas, after sighting Shiva in the form of the bull grazing in the hills of Guptakashi, tried to forcibly hold the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull disappeared into the ground to reappear later in his original self of Lord Shiva at five places; in the form of a hump at Kedarnath, in the shape of bahu (arms) at Tungnath, with his face at Rudranath, his nabhi (navel) and stomach at Madhyamaheswar and his hair (locks) called jata at Kalpeshwar. Pandavas, pleased with the revelation of Lord Shiva at five places in different forms, built temples at these five places, worshipped him and attained salvation with blessings of Shiva. Structure The temple in the north Indian style of architecture, is situated in a lush meadow, just below a high ridge. The older, so-called 'Vriddh-Madmaheshwar', temple is a tiny blackened shrine on the ridge, which looks straight up at the commanding Chaukhamba peaks. In the current temple, a navel-shaped Shiva-lingam, made of black stone, is enshrined in the sanctum. There are two other smaller shrines, one for Shiva's consort Parvati and the other dedicated to the Ardhanarishwara, a half-Shiva half-Parvati image. Bhima, the second Pandava brother is believed to have built this temple and worshipped Shiva here. To the right of the main temple there is a small temple where the image of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, made of marble is installed in the sanctum. Worship Madhyamaheshwar idol is worhsipped at Ukhimath during winter months The water from the temple precincts is considered so highly sacred that even a few drops are stated to be adequate for ablution. The worship at this temple starts with a specified time period from the beginning of the summer months after the winter and lasts till October/November from start of the winter season when the temple precincts are not accessible due to snow conditions. During the winter period, the symbolic idol of the god is shifted with religious formalities to Ukhimath for continued worship. Priests at this temple, as in many other temples in the state, are from South India and at this particular temple they are called Jangamas of the Lingayat cast who hail from Mysore in Karnataka state. This induction of priests from outside the state enhances the cultural communications from one part of the country to the other, with language becoming no barrier. It is one of an important sacred pilgrimage centres of Shastrik (textual) importance categorized as Panchasthali (five places) doctrine. This doctrine has been determined on the basis of sectarian association, fairs and festivals, offerings to the deity, sacred declarations made by devotees and specific blessings sought from the god through prayers at different temples. 2 km. away is a small temple called Bura Madhyamaheswar.

The temple's ancient legend linked to the Pandavas, heroes of epic Mahabharata eminence is the fifth temple of the Panch Kedars (five temples) of Shiva's five anatomical divine forms; the other four temples in the order of their worship are Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples; all in the Kedar Khand region of the Garhwal Himalayas. Kalpeshwar is the only Panch Kedar temple accessible throughout the year. At this small stone temple, approached through a cave passage, the matted tress (jata) of Lord Shiva is worshipped. Hence, Lord Shiva is also called as Jatadhar or Jateshwar. Earlier it was approachable only by trek from the nearest road head of Helang on the Rishikesh-Badrinath road but now the road goes up to Devgram village from where the trek now is just 300 metres. This road is good for bikes or cars with good ground clearance as it is half kuccha road which may get damaged during monsoons. Small cars can be taken except in monsoons. Legend The epic legend narrated on the creation of the Panch Kedar temples is that Pandavas of Mahabharata epic history, while chasing Lord Shiva to seek his pardon for the fratricidal sins committed by them during the Kurukshetra war, realized that Shiva, in order to distance himself from the Pandavas, took the incognito form of a bull. But when this form of Shiva was discerned by Bhima, the second of the Pandava brothers, tried to hold on to the bull's tail and hind legs. But the bull vanished underground at Guptakashi. Subsequently, it reappeared in five different forms: His hump appeared at Kedarnath, his bahu (arm) was spotted at Tungnath, his head surfaced at Rudranath, the stomach and navel were traced at Madhyamaheswar and his jata (tress) was divined at Kalpeshwar. Another legend states that this place was much preferred by sages of folklore for meditation. Particular mention is made of sage Arghya who through his austere penance created Urvashi, the famous apsara (nymph) at this place. Durvasa, an ancient sage, son of Atri and Anasuya, considered an incarnation of Shiva, known for his short temper did penance and meditated under the Kalpavriksha, the wish fulfilling divine tree in the precincts of the temple. Further, it is said that Durvasa had given Kunti, mother of Pandavas, a boon that \\"she could invoke any of the forces of nature and they would appear before her and grant whatever she desired\\". Once, when Pandavas, were in exile here, in order to test them Durvasa visited them along with his disciples and desired to be dined by them. Unfortunately, there was no food available within the house to feed the surprise guests. Draupadi, wife of Pandavas, sought Lord Krishna's help. Krishna materialised on the scene and solved the problem. ;Worship The temple priests at this temple also are the Dasnamis and Gossains, disciples of Adi Shankara. At Tungnath also the priests are Khasiya Brahmins. These priests hail from South India; the Namboodiri brahminfrom Kerala sect who worship at Badrinath. at Kedarnath, the Jangamas are lingayats from Mysore. in all these temples the pooja is designed by adi sankara. these priests also are supposed to be appointed by Adi Shankara. The priests at the Rudranath temple are Dasnamis and Gosains. Geography An evening view of snow peaks seen in Garhwal Himalayas View of nanda devi Peak The Kalpeshwar temple is located in the Urgam valley of the Himalayan mountain range near Urgam village ( short of the temple).
