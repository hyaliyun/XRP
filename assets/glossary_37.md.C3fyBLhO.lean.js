A log splitter is a piece of machinery or equipment used for splitting firewood from softwood or hardwood logs that have been pre-cut into sections (rounds), usually by chainsaw or on a saw bench. Many log splitters consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate. The higher the force rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split. The log splitter consists of all four major hydraulic components. Most log splitter models for home use have a rating around 10 tons, but professional hydraulic models may exert 30 tons of force or more. There are also manual log splitters, which use mechanical leverage to force logs through a sharpened blade assembly; and screw or 'corkscrew' types that are driven directly from an agricultural tractor's power take-off shaft where the splitter is mounted on the three point linkage. Power source A Croco log splitter attached to a Kobelco excavator in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland. A simple log splitter may be powered by an electric motor driving a hydraulic pump or by gasoline or diesel engine with or without a tractor. The non-electric versions can be used remotely where the splitter can be moved to the location of the cut wood source. Split logs can then be loaded into trucks, trailers or bulk bags. No matter what the power source, a log splitter either uses a hydraulic piston to drive the log through a stationary blade or a rotating cone shaped screw mandrel that pulls the log up over a wedge. Some models have attachments that prevent the split logs from falling to the ground allowing the operator to reposition the logs quickly for a second pass on the log splitter. Some cone or screw splitters are mounted on steel platforms mounted on a 3-point linkage that allow the log to be repeatedly split into smaller pieces without putting the wood down and up again. Uses Although smaller firewood splitters are intended for home, there are now many commercial units available. Some commercial splitters are part of a 'firewood processor' that saw logs of timber into lengths, split them, and then carry the wood up an inclined conveyor onto a pile or into a bag, truck or trailer. Specialty producers such as those producing maple syrup use units that split 4 foot lengths. Machines that split and point wood for fence post also exist though they are few in number as it is generally safer and more convenient to saw the posts. The rising cost of domestic heating gas oil has reawakened a desire for alternative fuel sources and burning wood is carbon neutral. Modern wood-burning stoves are efficient and safe. Many consumers that would not have considered splitting their own logs a few years ago are now burning wood fuel for both ecological and economical reasons. Safety Video of a vintage steam-powered log splitter in Germany Although a good log splitter can save the operator hours of labor, it is not possible to make it completely safe. Only trained users should operate a log splitter, since anything caught between the log and the splitting blade will be subjected to a force of at least 10 tons. Most hydraulic machines now have 'two handed operation' for safety which means that both of the operator's hands are needed to actuate the splitter thus keeping them out of the way of the moving blade. The behavior of each log cannot be predicted, so a safety zone should be established around the splitter to prevent injury from flying splinters of wood. Helpers can pick up the individual pieces of firewood, but should not stand near the log splitter while it is in operation.

The discussions led to the agreement of terms that later became the basis of the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. By 1746, the War of the Austrian Succession had effectively become a proxy contest between Britain and France, with French victories in Flanders offset by British naval success. Both sides were concerned by the financial costs, although the French position was significantly worse, with the Royal Navy blockade causing severe food shortages. The intention was to agree terms between France and Britain and end the Austrian War of Succession by presenting them to the other parties, who were not consulted. The British deliberately extended discussions, hoping to improve their position, but defeat at Lauffeld in July 1747 and the loss of Bergen op Zoom in September led them to agree terms. These were imposed by France and Britain on their allies at Aix-la-Chapelle with minimal consultation. In the long-term, it marked the point at which the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy began moving closer to France, after over 300 years where conflict between them was the dominant theme of European politics. Background Lord Sandwich the chief British negotiator for much of the talks. When the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, Britain was focused on the 1739-1748 War of Jenkins' Ear with Spain; fought mostly in the Caribbean, by the end of 1742, this had largely reached stalemate. France declared war on Britain in March 1744, while Spain joined the conflict in Europe, hoping to regain possessions in Northern Italy lost to Austria and Sardinia in 1713. With the help of British subsidies, they repulsed Spanish troops from Northern Italy in late 1746; France was unable to continue funding Spain, while Maria Theresa of Austria wanted peace in order to restructure her administration. Despite the victories of de Saxe in Flanders, the British naval blockade was strangling French trade, while their own had recovered from the post 1739 decline and was expanding once again. This negated a key French objective of reducing the post-1713 expansion of British commercial strength, which they viewed as a threat to the European balance of power. Declaring war on the Dutch Republic made the immediate situation worse, since the neutral Dutch had previously been the main carriers of French imports and exports. By 1747, the French financial system was on the verge of collapse, accompanied by severe food shortages. The Congress was an attempt to reach agreement between the two main protagonists and end the war but doing so was delayed by internal debates within the British government. They were also finding the financial burden hard to sustain, but the pro-war party led by the Duke of Newcastle argued Dutch support provided an opportunity to recover the Austrian Netherlands. Instead, it revealed the extent of their decline since 1713 while hopes of building an alliance with Spain after the death of Philip V in July 1746 also proved incorrect. Congress French victory at Lauffeld in July 1747 ended British hopes of regaining Flanders Discussions began in August 1746, led by Lord Sandwich and the Marquis de Puisieux. Sandwich and the British delegation were based near Breda Castle lent to them by William IV, Prince of Orange. Negotiations proceeded slowly, since the British wanted to extend discussions long enough for their position in Flanders to improve. On the other side, France wanted to reach agreement immediately, the terms including making the Low Countries neutral territory in future conflicts; these were drawn up by Gabriel de Mably, who shortly afterwards fell from favour. Unsatisfied by his performance, the French recalled Puisieux and replaced him, giving Sandwich an opportunity to delay by demanding his replacement prove his accreditation. There were further delays when a Spanish delegate turned up, claiming to represent Ferdinand VI, new king of Spain. The British were kept informed of French negotiating strategy, as letters to the French delegates were intercepted and copied by postmasters in British pay. Second Cape Finisterre, October 1747; defeat forced France to suspend naval operations, putting their entire colonial empire in jeopardy Sandwich also played a key role in the coup that brought William of Orange to power in the Netherlands. Previously neutral, Newcastle viewed Dutch entry into the war as a way to boost the anti- French coalition in Flanders but it soon proved otherwise. The Dutch required massive British financial support, while the Allied position further deteriorated with defeat at Lauffeld in July and the loss of Bergen op Zoom in September. Newcastle berated himself for his \\"ignorance, obstinacy and credulity\\" and fully expected to be forced from office as a result. Despite previously insisting negotiations must include all parties, the British delegation now agreed to settle terms with France prior to confirmation by their allies. They arguably underestimated the impact of victory at Second Cape Finisterre in October, which effectively ended French naval operations and put their entire colonial empire at risk. The North American fortress of Louisbourg, captured by Britain in 1745, was exchanged for Madras, India, captured by France in 1746; France agreed to withdraw from the Low Countries, while both parties recognised Prussian control of Silesia. Aftermath A Congress was held at Aix-la-Chapelle for all belligerents to confirm terms agreed between Britain and France at Breda. Peace was formally concluded with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Maria Theresa was outraged at British acceptance of the Prussian conquest of Silesia without any Austrians being present, a major element in the breakdown of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. Sandwich was rewarded by being made First Lord of the Admiralty, although both he and Newcastle were attacked for giving up Louisbourg so easily. In France, there was enormous disquiet about returning their territorial gains in Flanders, which cost so much, in return for so little. The phrase \\"as stupid as the Peace\\" became popular to express contempt for the terms agreed at Breda and Aix-la-Chapelle. In general, the Treaty satisfied no one and failed to resolve the issues that led to war in 1740.

It is regarded as one of China's three golden ages (the other two being the Han and Tang periods). The period was marked by the increasing political influence of the merchants, the gradual weakening of imperial rule, and technological advances.  Currency  The early Ming dynasty attempted to use paper currency, with outflows of bullion limited by its ban on private foreign commerce.. Like its forebears, the currency experienced massive counterfeiting and hyperinflation. (In 1425, Ming notes were trading at about 0.014% of its original value under the Hongwu Emperor.). The notes remained in circulation as late as 1573 but their printing was ended in 1450. Minor coins were minted in base metals, but trade mostly occurred using silver ingots. As their purity and exact weight varied, they were treated as bullion and measured in tael. These privately made \\"sycee\\" first came into use in Guangdong, spreading to the lower Yangtze sometime before 1423, the year it became acceptable for payment of tax obligations. In the mid-15th century, the paucity of circulating silver caused a monetary contraction and extensive reversion to barter.. The problem was met through smuggled, then legal, importation of Japanese silver (mostly through the Portuguese and Dutch) and Spanish silver from Potos√≠ carried on the Manila galleons. Provincial taxes were required to be paid in silver in 1465; the salt tax, in 1475; and corv√©e exemptions, in 1485. By the late Ming, the amount of silver being used was extraordinary: at a time when English traders considered tens of thousands of pounds an exceptional fortune, the Zheng clan of merchants regularly engaged in transactions valued at millions of taels. However, a second silver contraction occurred in the mid-17th century when began enforcing laws limiting direct trade between Spanish South America and China at about the same time the new Tokugawa shogunate in Japan restricted most of its foreign exports, cutting off Dutch and Portuguese access to its silver. The dramatic spike in silver's value in China made payment of taxes nearly impossible for most provinces.. In extremis, the government even resumed use of paper currency amid Li Zicheng's rebellion. Manufactures=Privatization= Another key feature of the Ming manufacturing industry was privatization. Unlike the Song, in which state-owned enterprises played a large role, the Ming reverted to the old laissez faire policies of the Han by privatizing the salt and tea industries. By the middle of the Ming dynasty, powerful groups of wealthy merchants had replaced the state as the dominant movers behind Chinese industry. =Emergence of wage labor= The Ming government abolished the mandatory forced labor by peasants used in early dynasties and replaced it with wage labor. A new class of wage laborers sprung up where none had existed before. In Jingde alone, it was reported that there were no less than 300 pottery factories, all operated by wage laborers.Li Bo, Zheng Yin, \\"5000 years of Chinese history\\", Inner Mongolian People's publishing corp, 2001, , pp. 994‚Äì997. Early encouragement of agriculture under Hongwu In order to recover from rule of the Mongols and the wars that followed them, the Hongwu Emperor enacted pro-agricultural policies. The state invested extensively in agricultural canals, reduced taxes on agriculture to 1/30 of the output, and later to 1.5% of agricultural output. Ming farmers also introduced many innovations such as water-powered plows, and new agricultural methods such as crop rotation. This led to a massive agricultural surplus that became the basis of a market economy. =Emergence of commercial plantations= The Ming saw the rise of commercial plantations who produced crops suitable to their regions. Tea, fruits, paint and other goods were produced on a massive scale by these agricultural plantations. Regional patterns of production established during this period continued into the Qing dynasty. The Columbian exchange brought crops such as corn with these foreign crops. During the Ming, specialized areas also popped up planting large numbers of cash crops that could be sold at markets. Large numbers of peasants abandoned the land to become artisans. The population of the Ming boomed; estimates for the population of the Ming range from 160 to 200 million. =Rural markets during the Ming= Ming agriculture was much changed from the earlier areas; firstly, gigantic areas, devoting and specializing in cash crops, sprung up to demand from the new market economy. Secondly, agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, help to create a gigantic agricultural surplus which formed the basis of the rural economy. Besides rice, other crops were grown on a large scale. Although images of autarkic farmers who had no connection to the rest of China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties, this was certainly not the case for the Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops. Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside, where goods were exchanged and bartered.Twitchett, Denis; John K.Fairbank. the Ming dynasty part 2 (May 1987), The Cambridge History of China, , pp. 497‚Äì498. A second type of market that developed in China was the urban-rural type, in which rural goods were sold to urban dwellers. This was particular the case when landlords decided to reside in the cities, and use income coming from rural land holding to facilitate exchange in the cities. Another way this type of market was used was professional merchants who bought rural goods in large quantities. The third type of market was the \\"national market\\" which was developed during the Song dynasty but particularly enhanced during the Ming. This market involved not only the exchange described above, but also products produced directly for the market. Unlike earlier dynasties, many Ming peasants were no longer producing only products they needed; many of them produced products for the market, which then they sold at a profit. Trade and investment 1584 Japan- Ming trade ship flag, inscribed with the signatures and ka≈ç, or stylized signatures, of three Ming merchants; to be raised the following year upon arrival in what is now Shimonoseki (Yamaguchi Prefectural Archives) In the early Ming, after the devastation of the war which expelled the Mongols, the Hongwu Emperor imposed severe restrictions on trade (the \\"haijin\\"). Believing that agriculture was the basis of the economy, Hongwu favored that industry over all else, including that of merchants. After his death, most of his policies were reversed by his successors. By the late Ming, the state was losing power to the very merchants which Hongwu had wanted to restrict. The Ming dynasty also engaged in a thriving trade with both Europe and Japan. The amount of silver flowing into the Ming dynasty was estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels, which is equivalent to more than 190 billion dollars in today's money. In addition to silver, the Ming also imported many European firearms, in order to ensure the modernness of their weapons. Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy, and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. The Ming saw the rise of several merchant clans such as the Huai and Jin clans, who disposed of large amounts of wealth. The gentry and merchant classes started to fuse, and the merchants gained power at the expense of the state. Some merchants were reputed to have a treasure of 30 million taels. China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade. Trade with Japan continued unobstructed despite the embargo, through Chinese smugglers, Southeast Asian ports, or Portuguese. China was entirely integrated in the world trading system. European nations had a great desire for Chinese goods such as silk and porcelain. The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit. Spaniards at the time of the Age of Exploration discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the Potos√≠ silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it, producing 40,000 tons of silver in 200 years. The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80% of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China. In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting silver heavily into China. Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east. Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. The city of Manila served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, Indian, Indonesia and China. However, there was a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well. Trade with Ming China via Manila served a major source of revenue for the Spanish Empire and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port.Schurz, William Lytle. The Manila Galleon, 1939. P 193. The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of Fujian who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, processed silk cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain. =Taxation= Ming taxation was light. Taxes on agriculture were only 1/30 of agricultural produce, and were later reduced to 1/50 of produce. Taxes on commerce amounted to 1/30 of commerce also, but was later reduced to 1.5%. These low taxes spurred trade, but severely weakened the state. Salt, as in earlier dynasties, was an important source of state revenue, but required constant and competent management. With the coming of the Little Ice Age in the 17th century, the state's low revenues and its inability to raise taxes caused massive deficits, and large numbers of Ming troops defected or rebelled because they had not been paid. =Weakening of the state= During the Ming, the controls imposed on the economy were gradually relaxed. State monopolies on salt and iron ended as these and other industries were privatized. Taxes were reduced from the high levels under the Mongol Yuan, and the Ming had one of the lowest tax rates (per person) in the world. The entire foreign trade, which was estimated at up to 300 million taels, provided the Ming with a tax of only about 40,000 taels a year. When the Wanli Emperor sought to increase the salt tax, his measures were opposed by violence and the eunuchs he sent to collect the tax were beheaded by local officials. =Sprouts of capitalism= Investment and capital moved off the land and were poured into ventures. Continuing the trend from the Song, Ming investors poured large amounts of capital into ventures and reaped high profits. Many Chinese scholars believe the Ming was the dynasty in which the \\"sprouts of capitalism\\" emerged in China, only to be suppressed by the Qing Dynasty. This theory was widely promoted by Communist scholars during the Maoist period, and suffers from that period's general condemnation of the Manchu Qing, who were accused of mis- managing the Chinese state in the face of foreign encroachment.

The park's main activities include community outreach, biological research and tourism development. The national park was established by the Presidential Decree No. 99-136 on 14 August 1999, it covers an area of 5,049.5 km2 and located in the Kouilou Department, straddling the districts of Nzambi-Madingo and Kayes. It is located near the villages of Cotovindou and Loul√©ma along the border between Congo and Gabon, at the point of intersection with National Route 5. Conkouati-Douli National Park is managed by the Ministry of Forest Economy and Durable Development (MEFDD) in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). The responsibilities of both partners are outlined in an agreement protocol. In 2014, park coordination was assured by the conservator/coordinator of MEFDD and a Principal Technical Advisor of WCS. They are assisted by an assistant conservator (MEFDD) and an administrator/accountant (WCS). The park employs 70 permanent employees of whom 95% are recruited locally. The park surveillance team consisted of 36 guards in early 2014. During the annual marine turtle nesting season between October and March, an additional 30 people are recruited locally to monitor the beaches. The park is divided into three zones: # An integrally protected zone that is only legally accessible for park staff, guided paying tourists and researchers with valid permits; # An eco- development zone containing all legal human habitations, in which residents are allowed to use natural resources sustainably for subsistence, and in which industrial exploitation is allowed with the agreement of the appropriate government institutions; # A 5 km wide buffer zone around the park designated for environmental education, sensitisation efforts and socio-economic activities. History The Conkouati-Douli National Park was established on August 14, 1999, however the park has been part of an active area of conservation since at least 1980 and includes areas of the former old reserve of Conkouati. This reserve covered nearly 300,000 hectares but was reduced down to 144,294 hectares by a legal provision in 1989. From 1994 to 1999 the IUCN recognised that the area was critically endangered and collaborated with PROGECAP-GEF Congo with financing from the World Bank in agreement with the Congolese authorities until June 1999. After being promoted to a national park, Conkouati-Douli has been managed by the Ministry for National Forestry Commission in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) since 1999. The park is an important part of native local culture. In 2014, some 7,000 people lived in and around the park: 3,500 people spread across 14 villages along the coastal road and 3,500 people in 14 villages along the forest road. The coastal residents are mainly Vili people, an ethnic group of fishers and traders that settled there in the 13th century. The villages along the forest road contain a mix of over 30 different ethnic groups who came with the industrial forestry sector and settled fewer than 100 years ago. Geography, flora and fauna Conkouati-Douli National Park is the most bio diverse park in the country and includes the only marine-protected area in Congo. Home to fauna typical of forest ecosystems of the Congo including elephant, buffalo, gorillas, leopards, chimpanzees, red river hogs, sitatunga and mandrill. The park also has a number of endangered turtle and dolphin populations. The Noumbi River flows through the park, which is characterised by dense forests, mixed with wetlands, floodplain forests and lagoons. Rhizophora racemosa and Avicennia nititta are common mangroves in the park and aquatic vegetation in lakes and lagoons is composed of Vossia cuspidata and Ctenium newtonili. Savannahs of the south-west are dominated by Ctenium newtonili, Elytonrus brazzae and Pobeguinea arrecta, while those of Cotovindou in the north-east are made up of Hypparrhenia diplandra, Panicum phragmitoides, and Pobeguinea arrecta. It is a priority site for great apes in the IUCN great ape conservation action plan as it is home to around 8,000 central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 2,000 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The park also houses some 1,000 forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and is a Ramsar site for its importance for migratory and wetland birds. Its beaches are among the most important in the world for nesting of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). The marine park also includes a group of around 50 humpback dolphins (Sousa teuzsi). Threats to conservation Local ecosystems are vulnerable to industrial threats from logging, mining, petroleum production, and commercial fishing. Additionally, poachers commonly use the coastal and south-east forest roads traversing the park to gain access to rare animals such as elephants. The local human population is low but the nearby city of Pointe-Noire (150 km from the park) fuels natural resource exploitation to feed the growing demands for bushmeat and wood. Chinese-owned trawler boats are a serious threat to the marine park. Local threats include unsustainable fishing, hunting and agriculture techniques.

Braz also wrote the English language libretto for the opera which was composed for the centenary of Georgia Southern University. It premiered on April 20, 2007 in Statesboro, Georgia. Historical background and synopsis The opera takes as its subject the historic confrontation between Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge and Marvin Pittman who was president of Georgia Teachers College which later became Georgia Southern University.Cook (2002) This episode in Georgia history is sometimes known as the \\"Cocking affair.\\" In brief, Talmadge fired Walter Cocking who was dean of the College of Education at the University of Georgia. Talmadge accused Cocking of championing integration, in this case the admission of African American students to historically all-white educational institutions. Talmadge flamboyantly declared that he would fire anyone who stood for \\"communism or racial equality\\". Talmadge fired Pittman for supporting Cocking against Talmadge. As a result of the firings, the teacher's college lost its accreditation. Students rallied, and Pittman and Cocking were eventually rehired. A Scholar Under Siege closely follows this story line with fictional dialog added for narrative effect. Pittman emerges as the hero and moral center of the opera which takes on overtones of its World War II political backdrop when Pittman sings ‚Äî referring to Talmadge, \\"One Hitler anywhere is one too many\\".Bynum (April 19, 2007) The cast of characters features only slightly fictionalized versions of many historic characters including not only Talmadge, Cocking, and Pittman, but also Atlanta Journal Constitution editor Ralph McGill, Georgia Teachers College custodian Mose Bass, and Georgia Southern University alumnus and benefactor Jack Averitt. In Braz's libretto, Averitt is reimagined as the leader of the student movement that resulted in the restoration of Marvin Pittman to his post as university president. In real life, Averitt was a friend of the Pittman family, but did not lead the charge to have the president reinstalled.Hamilton (Fall 2007) Composer Michael Braz, the composer of A Scholar Under Siege, is Professor of Music at Georgia Southern University. For nine years, he was also the principal keyboardist for the Augusta Symphony Orchestra. His previous compositions include his 1975 chamber opera, Memoirs from the Holocaust.Augusta State University (2004) Performance history The Georgia Southern University Performing Arts Center where A Scholar Under Siege premiered on April 20, 2007 Braz spent three years researching the historical background of A Scholar Under Siege and credits conversations with Georgia Southern colleagues, including retired Professor Dr. Del Presley, whose centennial history of Georgia Southern University was completed at the time of the opera's production. The opera premiered on April 20, 2007 at Georgia Southern University's Performing Arts Center, conducted by Rodney H. Caldwell. The production, which ran for three performances was produced and directed by Sarah Hancock with set design by Gary Dartt, costume design Brenda Dartt, lighting design by Kelly Berry, and choreography by Mallory Lanier.Georgia Public Library Service =Premiere cast= The principal roles were sung by: *Kyle Hancock (Dr. Marvin Pittman) *Pedro Carreras (Eugene Talmadge) *Jarrad Howard (Robert F Wood) *Stephen Faulk (Jack Averitt) *Russell Watkins (Ralph McGill) *John Wolters (Dr. Walter Cocking) *Jaime White (Anna Mary Terrell Pittman) *David Poulian (Mose Bass) The cast also included: Daniel Scofield (Dr. Alois Hundhammer), John Marshall (Jurt Feyer), Megan Otte (Mae Michael), Violet Martin (Maime Veazey), Shawn Tupper (Ernest Cannon), John Bressler (Dr. R.

Sanford). Score The Savannah Morning News said that it mirrored Braz's influences which are cited as Benjamin Britten, B√©la Bart√≥k, and Leonard Bernstein. Jim Galloway in the Atlanta Journal Constitution described Braz as using \\"a bluesy, flat-noted tune to suggest the rather corrupt insider nature of Georgia‚Äôs state politics in the 1940s.\\"Galloway (April 8, 2007) Critical reception A Scholar Under Siege received considerable media attention probably because it encapsules a race struggle from which the southern United States are still recovering today. In an Associated Press article about A Scholar Under Siege, Russ Bynum wrote, \\"Talmadge's defeat proved Georgia voters had limits to how far they would go to defend racial inequality.\\" Braz said in an interview with the Savannah Morning News that political thinkers were noticing his opera because they saw parallels between the administrations of Eugene Talmadge and George W. Bush.Stoehr (April 19, 2007) \\"Most attention to the opera so far has been from political writers who are fascinated with the text more than the music,\\" Braz said. In the same interview, Braz described his opera as \\"a study of two conflicting views of power. Talmadge aimed to keep people afraid so that they would vote for him. For him, power was in the numbers. For Pittman, power was in education, in the heart and mind.\\" That his opera would be viewed as a political allegory pointing to the theater of current events was not an outcome that Braz specifically sought, he said in an interview for Eyrie, a Georgia Southern University internal publication, but he conceded that he did hate bullying, adding, \\"If it‚Äôs not stood up to, we‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs okay.\\" ReferencesSources *Augusta State University, Biography: Michael Braz, Cullum Speaker Series, 2004.

It is connected by a gravel road to Qaarsut and is northwest of Uummannaq.  History  Air Greenland passengers transfer between Bell 212 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in Qaarsut Qaarsut airport was inaugurated on 29 September 1999,explorenorth.com with the purpose of serving the much larger neighboring town of Uummannaq, southeast of the airport, located on an island of the same name in the south-central part of Uummannaq Fjord. The island‚àímerely away in a direct line across Sarqarput Strait‚àíis too small and rocky to host an airport of sufficient size to accommodate fixed-wing aircraft of Air Greenland.

Bottlenecks  Air Greenland Bell 212 helicopter shuttling passengers between Qaarsut and Uummannaq The decision to build the airport in Qaarsut was intended to solve the bottleneck on the Ilulissat-Uummannaq route (164 km), until then operated by Air Greenland with Sikorsky S-61N helicopters. Acquired in 1965, they are the oldest machines in the fleet of the airline,Air Greenland, 50th anniversary website still in operation year- round in southern Greenland and during wintertime in the Disko Bay area south of Qaarsut. The bottleneck problem is considered unsolved, since passengers must still be shuttled between the airport and Uummannaq Heliport. The primary function of the airport as a local hub has unintended consequences for communities of northern Greenland. All flights to Qaanaaq Airport include a stopover in Upernavik Airport. In order to avoid an overnight layover in Upernavik, all Qaanaaq-bound passengers must travel via Qaarsut. Flights on the Ilulissat-Qaarsut route are often sold out, which given a single weekly flight to Qaanaaq leaves passengers unable to travel to or from the northern communities, resulting in resentment. As of 2017, it is possible to travel Ilulissat‚ÄìQaanaaq or opposite within a day with only one plane change in Upernavik without touching Qaarsut.

Levine, Edition: 2, Yale University Press, 2005, pp. 274ff In its earliest form, the synagogue featured a main hall with benches along three walls; a propylaeum or monumental gateway featuring four marble columns; and a triclinium or dining room with couches along three walls. There was a water well and basin near the entryway for ritual washings. The main door of the synagogue faces the southeast, towards Jerusalem. An aedicula, to serve as a Torah Ark, was added in the 4th century AD. A donor inscription implies that it replaced an earlier wooden platform donated in the 2nd century AD, which itself had been replaced by a newer Ark donated by one Mindus Faustus in the 3rd century AD.

The research and development of this vehicle was funded by the United States Office of Naval Research (ONR), and it became the US Navy‚Äôs first autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The navy used a total of 7 SPURV vehicles until 1979. Construction The original engineers of SPURV were Bob Van Wagennen (mechanical) and Wayne Nodland (electrical). Terry Ewart calculated the hydrodynamics design on a Berkeley EASE analog computer. SPURV was machined by Boeing from a forging of 7078-T6 aluminum. Capability SPURV had an operating depth of at least 3000 meters and a maximum depth of 3600 meters. It could go about 4-5 knots for about 4 hours. A propulsion battery consisting of 2 sets of 16 silver zinc cells connected in a parallel through diodes was the primary power source for SPURV. The battery provided a 24-volt, 200 ampere-hour supply. Secondary power came from 4 solid-state converters. Acoustic signals from the accompanying research vessel guided SPURV in moving below the surface of the water. SPURV then generated models of underwater physical properties such as ocean currents and temperature. Operations SPURV was first operated from the ATA-195, the Navy Seagoing Tug Tatnuck in a 1957 cruise to Cobb Seamount. A tracking system had been built for the Tatnuck by Stan Murphy and Terry Ewart that could plot the range to SPURV on a strip chart recorder and the x-y position on a chart plotter. The later SPURVS were utilized on 1-2 cruises per year by Terry Ewart and the Applied Physics Lab's Ocean Physics Department Engineers and Research Scientists, conducting about 20 month-long cruises in total to study small scale ocean variability including internal wave and fine-structure data, point source release dye diffusion at 1000 meters, and oceanographic data for acoustic transmission experiments. In a few operations, two SPURVs were run at once in lock-step, 1 above the other or one beside the other at constant spacings. This was to study spatial coherences of the small scale ocean structure. Most of the SPURVs operated with a vertical rake of temperature and conductivity sensors using what later became the Seabird sensors. In all cases, they could be tracked from the ship‚Äîusually with the capability of using a bottom or other reference system, and pitch, roll, and heading corrections for the ship. The last operation of SPURV was in 1979 in the submarine wake study experiment. APL still has all 5 hulls, but they have not been used since then.

Life Dudai was born in Israel to a family most of which perished in the Holocaust in Lithuania and Poland. After working as a professional journalist and news editor for a leading Israeli daily, and reading philosophy and middle eastern studies at Tel-Aviv University, he switched to study biochemistry and genetics, with supplements in modern history, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He received his B.Sc. (with honor) from the Hebrew University and his Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science, where he studied protein chemistry and biophysics, and conducted his postdoctoral studies at the California Institute of Technology, where he was on Seymour Benzer's team that pioneered the neurogenetic analysis of memory mechanisms. Over the years he has been a Scholar in Residence at the National Institutes of Health, and a Visiting Professor at Columbia University, Harvard University, Yale University, University of Edinburgh, Coll√®ge de France, Boston University, and New York University (NYU). He served in a number of academic and public positions, including an advisor to the President of the State of Israel and to the National Council of R&D;, a member of the Planning and Grants Committee of the Universities in Israel, Dean of the Faculty of Biology and Chair of the Department of Neurobiology and head of the Brain Research Centers at the Weizmann Institute of Science. He is also the Scientific Director of the Israel Center of Research Excellence (I-CORE) in the cognitive sciences. Research Yadin Dudai's research interests encompass the neurobiology of learning and memory, memory as a concept and as a brain faculty, and the interrelationships among the two. He is also interested in collective memory, and in the evolution of 'cultural organs', such as the cinema. He has contributed to our understanding of brain and behavioral mechanisms of learning and memory, particularly those related to the consolidation and persistence of the memory trace, and of the evolution and role of concepts of memory in science and culture at large. Among the contributions made by Yadin Dudai and his coworkers: identification of the first learning mutant, using Drosophila, which was a critical proof of concept for the neurogenetic analysis of memory; discovery of consolidation in the fruit fly, rendering it amenable to genetic analysis and demonstrating the universality of consolidation; dissociation of the effect of single gene mutations on encoding vs. consolidation; elucidation of the molecular machinery of memory encoding, memory consolidation and experimental extinction in the mammalian neocortex, using taste associations as a model; discovery of the rule that guides stability of associative memories after their retrieval (the \\"dominant trace\\" model); and the data-driven hypothesis that consolidations linger long after they have been considered to end, accounting for ongoing changes in the stability and veracity of memory. He has over 210 professional publications in the field of brain and memory. While he is mostly known for his work on learning and memory, he is also one of the founders of the field of neurogenetics of behavioural plasticity when he was in the group of Seymour Benzer. Awards and honors Dudai received the IPSEN Prize 2013 for outstanding achievements in memory research, together with Richard Morris and Timothy Bliss. He was elected member of EMBO in 2014 and the same year became a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, of which he is chairing the Science Division since 2019.

It is the only extended, narrative work of prose fiction written by Lindsay. Written from 1904 to 1918 and published in 1920, it has historically been classified as a work of utopian fiction. The Golden Book of Springfield is a story about Lindsay's hometown of Springfield, Illinois in 1918 and in 2018, when residents of the city work to transform the city into a utopian paradise-city. In Lindsay's narrative, social and religious awakenings initiated by the citizens and spiritual influences lead to the transformation of Springfield - and more broadly, America - into a \\"practical City of God.\\" Writes Lindsay, \\"This reasonable, non-miraculous millennium is much in the mind of my neighbor, and he tells me again and again of a vision that he has of Springfield a hundred years hence.\\" In a May 1918 letter to his then- married former sweetheart, Sara Teasdale, Lindsay expressed the importance of what he had inscribed into The Golden Book: :The Golden Book will probably be ready by Christmas. That is, written. That means it will not appear before next spring. I hate to be so slow, but my prose will not be hustled. I am making it the one thought of my life, and hope when it is done, it will be the one book of my life.  Plot  The Golden Book of Springfield is framed as a series of visions of the future, experienced both by members of \\"'The Prognosticators' Club\\"', and later by Lindsay, who shifts to writing in the first person. It reads much like a dream journal throughout; Lindsay was well known to experience intense religious visions throughout his life. = The Prognosticators' Club = The book opens in 1920 with a gathering of the Prognosticators‚Äô Club, which consists of, among others, a Campbellite minister, a Jewish boy, a black woman, and a skeptic, who offer a vision of Springfield in 2018 in prose derived from such varied sources as the Bible, Swedenborg, and Marx. The Prognosticators meet to discuss their visions of a modern Springfield achieving improvements in areas such as education, civility, technology, and spirituality. = The Arrival of The Golden Book of Springfield = The Golden Book of Springfield describes in many different voices the arrival of the fictional The Golden Book of Springfield, first describing this event through the eyes of David Carson, the Campbellite minister of the Prognosticator's Club who imagines himself \\"reborn three or four generations in the future.\\" :We behold with him how a book of air, gleaming with spiritual gold, comes flying in through the walls as though they were but shadows. It is a book open as it soars, and every fluttering page is richly bordered and illuminated. It has wings of black, and above them wings of azure. Long feathers radiate from the whirring, soaring pennons. The book circles above the heads of the congregation. From the sky comes music incredibly sweet. The book flies toward the altar, where St. Friend finds himself standing. The wings fade. This day moves with rapid breath. The congregation has been trooping in as the visitant from the world of spirit- wonder has been settling into its own holy place on the altar. = The Flying Machine Riots = Drawing by Vachel - the first page of the Golden Book. UFOs? The major conflict in The Golden Book of Springfield revolves around the \\"Flying Machine Riots\\" Lindsay summarizes the conflict as such: :\\"Chapter IX: Tempest in a Teapot over whether People with Buried Gold Shall Monopolize the Flying Privilege\\" Lindsay tells the story of the monopolization of \\"flying machines,\\" (Note: see Lindsay's poem The Empty Boats.) and the quick resolution of the issue by means of cooperation and peaceful discourse. St. Friend, among others, leads the public through the hidden conflict, and tells the people of their future - in which they travel to the stars in \\"airships of the mind.\\" = St. Friend and the Church of Springfield = St. Friend is known as the \\"Giver of Bread,\\" and is the religious reformer who unites all the religions of the world into \\"The Church of Springfield\\", or \\"The Church of the Plant and the Flower.\\" :In the capital of Illinois, in this year of grace, St. Friend is a healer of the body and soul. He is more of a philosopher than the fuming Black Hawk Boone, that is, he has a cooler disposition. Yet Boone heals by hard maxims, given with that lovely fruit, the Amaranth-Apple. St. Friend heals by sermons and prayers and the pictured parables, the rituals envisaged and illuminated in the celebration of the Office of the Blessed Bread. The Church of Springfield is incarnated as a \\"blessed community of faith\\" with no \\"fences of creed.\\" St. Friend describes it as such: :\\"The Church of Springfield has come. It is the sunlit grass of this park; it is this Illinois sky... It will begin with sheltered faiths and will not contradict or undermine any.\\" In the same speech St. Friend delivers his vision of the events occurring, and the bright future he envisions for Springfield: :\\"The voices of the children will be as noble as the discourses of the prairie winds that catch our tree boughs at sunset. Every house will be as delicate and subtle as the ferny hollows of the Sangamon. The convert will name many birds that will come at this call and he will feed them crumbs of this Blessed Bread in friendship. When Springfield has partaken of this manna for a generation, all things will become new. Leavening thoughts will come from all the street corners. Novel fancies will come from the coffee houses. The conferences and colloquies of fallible men will take on something of the aspect of the meetings of the inspired souls of Heaven. We walk our plain path! We eat our plain bread in a rare fellowship! Therefore all things become eternal. The Church of Springfield, the church of this sunlit grass, the church of a million days and nights, is proclaimed from the steps of the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul this day.\\" = Redemption = In Chapter 3, Lindsay mythologizes the history of Springfield, Illinois, describing Hunter Kelly's pact with the Devil: :At last, when the lads returned from the war with Germany, and the girls returned from Red Cross work, and the like, in the summer of 1919, and the city began to take on glory both visible and invisible, Hunter Kelly said to the Devil: \\"I will now trust my town to go on. At last they are eating of the Apple Amaranth, which they thought was poison. They are even transplanting it.\\" Thereupon Hunter Kelly drove the Devil away with the great pickaxe and spade, the same which had often dug the hunter from the ground. From this pickaxe on, the story was entirely new to the screen, and much of it new to the audience. Kelly then built himself a cell in Heaven out of old and broken fragments of forgotten palaces in the far jungles. There he wrote The Golden Book for our little city far below. By day he lived as that boy of Springfield who grew up as Saint Scribe of the Shrines, and established the discipline and ritual of The One Hundred Shrines of the World. He was rumored among a few of us to be the reincarnation of Hunter Kelly. He became the first teacher of St. Friend, who wore his mantle well after him. And now he is pictured, in many a dazzling flame-like color, throwing down from the window of his cell in heaven, this very hour of All Saint's Day, The Golden Book of Springfield. All this is the first intimation to Gwendolyn Charles that stranger things than we know may happen in heaven and on earth. = Ascension = In Chapter XV Lindsay describes how \\"when I am my American self the Thibetan boy takes me beyond the North Star and shows me the true Buddha.\\": This tale describes the experience of cosmic consciousness, a focal point of the New Age, or Golden Age movement, and the central tenet of Tibetan buddhism. This experience is, according to Lindsay, the means by which \\"the body of Christ, the whole human race, will be raised from the dead.\\" :July 13: ‚Äî Today I meet the Thibetan Boy in Coe's Book Store. \\"We are both rather aimlessly turning over the magazines, and, after I have observed his idleness awhile, I take him out for a walk and say: \\"Why do you look at me when you pass, with your eyes a story untold? All the while I have walked the streets of this New Springfield, you have looked at me so. He answers slowly, almost whispering: ‚Äî \\"Your fathers came from the ancient Christian world. My fathers came from the more ancient Buddhist world. Christ is my master but I cannot deny that Buddha is my friend. This is the hour for friends. Come with me. We walk north on Mulberry Boulevard, past the House of the Man from Singapore, and then west on Carpenter toward a little highway that finally joins the great Northwest Road. But we have not gone far on the Great Northwest Road till we flash past the Gothic double walls of our city. The Thibetan Boy takes me, in one instant, to the far edge of Space and Time, way beyond the North Star and its dandelions. And as we stand on the shaking shore of Space and Time we see and hear, rolling in from Chaos, endless smoke and glory and darkness and dissolving foam. Standing be side us, like a superb Gandhara sculpture that has taken on life is that Prince Siddartha who was the founder of Buddhism. He stands in that aspect he had, while still a citizen and householder, and twenty-four centuries before his green glass libel cursed mankind. Before us is, indeed, a vision of Buddha the dreamer, superb, thoroughbred, in all the jewels of his tribe. It is the hour before he took chariot and drove forth from home. We are back in that hour when he looked upon all things, and saw them as a dissolving foam, the hour before he set forth for his victory over this crumbling universe. His eyes are fixed upon those waves that roll in forever, that keep their forms an instant, and are gone for all time: some of men, some of wraiths and gods, some of planets and comets and suns. He turns around and beckons and over the sand comes Channa, the superb charioteer, and the horses of that chariot are nobler than the horses of the sun. Prince Siddartha is in the chariot in an instant and they drive out into that sea and the wheels of that chariot ride the waves. Those horses are like lightning, climbing waves that are like hills and mountains, till chariot, horses, and men all are veiled by the endless smoke and glory and darkness and dissolving foam. The Thibetan boy says to me: \\"It is the 'Great Going Forth from Home,' and thus Buddha becomes a conquerer, and Chaos and the Universe are put beneath him.\\" But the star chimes behind us are ringing new tunes and we are back in our city again, leaving Prince Siddartha to conquer what he will.  Context  Vachel Lindsay (1879‚Äì1931) is often referred to as the most intensely romantic American poet of his generation. Notably, Lindsay‚Äôs career and personal life took a downturn after publication of The Golden Book in 1920. After rising in popularity during the 1910s for his rhythmic, musical brand of poetry performance, the poet published his utopian vision and expected his career to turn in a similar direction. Though British critics praised the work, The Golden Book received little to no critical attention in the United States, as American readers dismissed the work as ‚Äútedious and incomprehensible.‚Äù Lindsay was forced to continue performing his poems across the country to support his family. Vachel‚Äôs inability to turn his audiences‚Äô focus towards the future, along with his deteriorating health and personal life, led to a severe decline that culminated in Lindsay‚Äôs suicide in 1931. In 1999, the Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company reprinted The Golden Book, along with a preface by William Furry and an extended introduction by Ron Sakolsky. The Kerr Company‚Äôs synopsis is as follows: :Vachel Lindsay (1879‚Äì1931) was the most intensely romantic US poet of his generation. Less well known is the fact that Lindsay was also a radical critic of the white supremacy, greed, misery, brutality, ugliness and emptiness inherent in US capitalist culture. His only novel, The Golden Book - now back in print after over 80 years of shameful neglect - is a relentless dreamer's all-out assault on the stupidity and bigotry of Main Street USA. Lindsay's Luciferian lyricism, incantatory and even shamanic; the carnivalesque enthusiasm and humor that he called the 'higher vaudeville'; and of course that zany, jubilant, self-contradictory mysticism that was all his own are amply evident in this radically nonconformist dream of the future. In The Golden Book, the coffee houses, movie theaters, streets and parks of Springfield in the 'Mystic Year' 2018 are the setting for a valiant struggle to transform a village dominated by shady politicians, lynch-mobs, commercialism and cocaine into a new paradise. Ron Sakolsky's superb introduction, the most detailed examination yet of Lindsay's 'Johnny Appleseed utopianism', explores The Golden Book as a radical response to the Springfield Race Riot of 1908; relates the book to the utopias of Fourier, Ruskin, Bellamy, and others; and traces Lindsay's involvement in Chicago radicalism in the 1910s, as well as his affinities with anarchism, feminism, Black liberation, World War I, and such poet radicals as Blake, Lautreamont, the surrealists, Langston Hughes and the Beats.  Thematic elements = Religious message = The overarching messages of both The Golden Book of Springfield and the fictional The Golden Book of Springfield are that of religious unity. The book opens with mention of the \\"Early Campbellites\\", followers of Thomas and Alexander Campbell. :Campbell, in our eyes, was the American pioneer theologian. He was devoted to the union of the churches of Christendom. He pleaded that all disciples of Christ call themselves \\"simply\\" Christians, and unite on those symbols and ordinances which Christendom has in common. Throughout the book, Lindsay incorporates aspects from nearly all the religions of the world. He promotes the \\"Pilgrimage of the Hundred Shrines of the Hundred Religions\\" and writes of the influence of \\"Thibetan\\" philosophies on St. Friend and the Church of Springfield, noting the importance of these teachings in the ascension of humanity to Heaven. = War with Singapore = A major conflict in The Golden Book of Springfield is a war of the United States against Singapore, a nation incriminated for its worship of the Green Glass/Cocaine Buddha, but more broadly, their focus on materialism and cocaine.

It belongs to the municipality of Quarten. As there are no roads leading to Quinten, it is only reachable by boat or on foot. Geography Quinten consists of two main villages (Quinten and Au) and a large number of weekend houses that can be found throughout the villages. Au is the smaller of the two parts of Quinten and lies about one kilometer to the east of the main village. Quinten is an incredibly steep part of Switzerland and reaches from 419m above sea level (mean level of the Walensee) to 2193m above sea level. The horizontal distance between the main village and Sch√§ren (highest point) is about 2 kilometers. The rock in and around Quinten mainly consists of limestone which is responsible for the near-vertical cliffs towering above Quinten. Due to the sheltered location at the foot of the Churfirsten mountain range, Quinten has one of the mildest climates known north of the alps. This is an important factor in the local wine growing industry. History The name of the hamlet probably goes back to early medieval times and the administration of the bishopric of Chur. It follows the pattern of other villages along the Walensee which are called Terzen and Quarten (based on Latin ordinal numbers, tertius, quartus, quintus). The hamlet of Quinten belonged to the Abbey in Pf√§ffers from the 9th century AD before it became part of the Austrian dominion of Windegg. After 1438 it became part of the Gaster.Swiss Historic Lexicon http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D7673.php The small local church was built in 1765. It contains some 20th-century frescos.

Kubli http://www.hls-dhs- dss.ch/textes/d/D5361.php moved to Quinten and the stately house to the west of the village that is still known as the Kublihaus. Kubli is primarily remembered for his role in the witch hunt process against one Anna G√∂ldi in 1782. The secret process which was outrageous even by the standards of 1782, ended in the execution of the victim. Kubli is believed to have passed on secret documents regarding this process to German journalists who proceeded to publish them and caused a public outcry that was heard throughout most of Europe at the time.Sarganserl√§nder, July 3, 2007, page 19 In the 19th and 20th century, Quinten did not change much, as the absence of road connections made industrialization and commerce very difficult. One major change was the construction of the walking track that connects Quinten and Au in the early 20th century which made the life of the children of Au much easier, as they no longer had to climb steeply up and then down into Quinten, but could use the lovely and flat new track on their way to school. In the early 1930s it looked like Quinten's fate was about to change, when the construction of a road from Weesen at the western end to Walenstadt at the eastern end of the Walensee was discussed. Two projects were discussed, one along the northern side of the lake through Quinten, the other along the southern side. In the end the road was built on the southern side and Quinten was left to stay the quiet place it still is.Schweizerische Bauzeitung (Swiss Construction Journal) 'Die rechtsufrige Walenseestrasse' http://retro.seals.ch/digbib/view?rid=sbz-002:1936:107:108::1661 In the 1950s electrical mains power reached Quinten which led to the arrival of weekenders who built their houses in Quinten starting around the same time. In 1960 the excursion boat service took up its operation. The village school ceased to exist in 1972. Economy Agriculture, dominated by vineyards, is still an important factor in Quinten's economy. The locally grown wines, predominantly Pinot Noir which accounts for about 75% of the total harvest, enjoy a very good reputation among connoisseurs. Other varieties grown in Quinten include: Pinot Blanc, Baco Noir, Chardonnay, Chasselas, Merlot, Seyval Blanc and Syrah. In 2008 vineyards covered more than 76000 square meters, and more than 47 tonnes of grapes were harvested.Wine growing statistics for 2008. Refer to the numbers for Quarten. http://www.landwirtschaft.sg.ch/home/landwirtschaftliches/Beratung/Pflanzenbau/Weinbau.Par.0022.DownloadListPar.0010.File.tmp/Weinlese%20pro%20Gemeinde%202008.pdf Other forms of farming are on the retreat though, as the very steep terrain makes agricultural work very hard. Thanks to the mild climate, exotic fruit, like figs and kiwifruit, thrive in Quinten in a way that is unique north of the alps. These crops, however, are of little economic value and are mainly grown for the use of the locals. Tourism and transport are two other major sources of income for the local population. The population was 41 as of 2008.Population numbers for Quinten and other villages in the area Books about Quinten Quinten plays the starring role in the crime novel below.

It hosts a living history museum run by the state Department of Marine Resources. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Burnt Island Light Station on November 23, 1977. History Burnt Island lies at the western entrance to Boothbay Harbor, a large natural harbor with the town of the same name at its northeastern corner. The island took its name from the practice of burning the island's vegetation in order to keep the land clear for sheep grazing. Funds for building a light for Boothbay Harbor were appropriated in March 1821, and a petition by town officials and pilots for a lighthouse on the island met with purchase of the island within a few days. A granite rubble tower, lined with brick, was erected, together with a stone keeper's house, and late that summer the light was first exhibited, using the system of whale oil lamps and parabolic reflectors typical of the time. The original keeper's house was replaced in 1857 with the frame house that survives today; a covered walkway joined the house and the tower. At the same time a fourth order Fresnel lens was installed, the first of many changes in the lighting and characteristic of the beacon. The original characteristic was a fixed white light; the intent of the light was to attract traffic to the harbor, not to warn of danger. In 1888, the light was blocked in sector to the southwest to prevent it from being seen by traffic coming up the coast from the south until they had cleared the Cuckolds, a pair of rocky islands at the mouth of Booth Bay. A year later the characteristic was changed again, this time to fixed red with two white sectors indicating the safe channels to either side of Squirrel Island. This brought about confusion with the Ram Island Light (built in 1883), and in 1901 the fixed light was removed and replaced with a rotating beacon consisting of a square box with a lens on each face. This lens served until 1962, when it was retired to a museum and replaced with an electrified beacon. It was the last lighthouse in Maine to be converted from kerosene. A pyramidal wooden tower was constructed in 1895 to hold a fog bell. This was demolished in 1962 when the bell was moved to a metal frame and rung with an electric striker instead of clockwork. The station was automated in 1988, one of the last Maine stations to be manned. Museum In 1998 the island and light station were transferred to the State of Maine Department of Marine Resources as part of the Maine Lighthouse Program. The buildings have been restored, as far as possible, to their 1950s condition, and in 2003 a living history program was inaugurated.

Paul Coates in 1978. Since then, BCP has published original titles by notable authors including Walter Mosley, John Henrik Clarke, E. Ethelbert Miller, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, and Dorothy B. Porter, as well as reissuing significant works by Amiri Baraka, Larry Neal, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edward Blyden, Bobby Seale, J. A. Rogers, and others.  History  W. Paul Coates (father of Ta-Nehisi Coates) founded Black Classic Press in 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland, originally working from the basement of his house. The company is one of the oldest independently owned Black publishers in operation in the United States. The primary mission of the press is to publish obscure and significant books by and about people of African descent. John G. Jackson, John Henrik Clarke, and Yosef Ben-Jochannan were major influences in defining the mission and early direction of the press. The company publishes about six titles annually; most are out-of-print historical books that the company brings back into print. The first books published by the company were pamphlets printed on a photocopier that Coates purchased. In the same vein, he established BCP Digital Printing in 1995 as an affiliated company of Black Classic Press.Reid, Calvin, \\"Printing and Publishing at Black Classic Press\\", Publishers Weekly, May 22, 2015. The printing company, a million-dollar business, serves as the printer for the publishing company as well as for other companies and organizations in the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area.  Imprints  Black Classic Press has three imprints: * Black Classic Press: Historical reprints that deal with the African diaspora * W.M. DuForcelf: Currently defunct since 1994, a statement and a call for self- sufficiency in the African-American community * INPRINT EDITIONS: Serves academic books and titles that fall outside the primary mission of Black Classic Press list  Notable authors and titles = Walter Mosley = The press gained national attention in 1996 when best-selling author Walter Mosley chose Black Classic Press to publish Gone Fishin‚Ä≤ (1997), the prequel to his popular Easy Rawlins mysteries. Mosley decided to publish a book with a small Black publishing house because he felt it was important \\"to create a model that other writers, black or not, can look at to see that it's possible to publish a book successfully outside mainstream publishing in New York.\\" The result was so successful that in 2003 the press collaborated again with Mosley to publish What Next: An African American Initiative Toward World Peace (2003), part memoir and part call to action for African Americans after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. The Tempest Tales (2008), Mosley's homage to Langston Hughes' character Jesse B. Semple, was the third collaboration between Mosley and Black Classic Press. * Gone Fishin': An Easy Rawlins Novel.

Proponents of the theory alleging the Committee's existence believe it to be an international council that organizes politics, commerce, banking, media, and the military for centralized global efforts. Background The theory dates to a statement made by German politician Walther Rathenau in a 1909 article \\"Gesch√§ftlicher Nachwuchs\\" in Neue Freie Presse:Rathenau, Walther, 1867-1922 Zur Kritik der Zeit Berlin, S. Fischer 1922 p.207 > Dreihundert M√§nner, von denen jeder jeden kennt, leiten die wirtschaftliche > Geschicke des Kontinents und suchen sich Nachfolger aus ihrer Umgebung.

Levy, ed. > Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution Santa > Babara, California; ABC-CLIO 2005 p.705 In context, Rathenau was actually deploring the oligarchic implications of this statement, and did not suggest that the \\"Three hundred\\" were Jewish. However, by 1912 Theodor Fritsch had seized upon the sentence as an \\"open confession of indubitable Jewish hegemony\\" and as proof that Rathenau was the \\"secret Kaiser of Germany.\\" The idea became more popular after the World War I, and the spread of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Rathenau addressed the issue in a 1921 letter, stating that the three hundred referred to were leaders in the business world, rather than Jews.Swartzburg pp.705-6 After Rathenau's assassination in June 1922, one of his assassins explicitly cited Rathenau's membership in the \\"Three hundred Elders of Zion\\" as justification for the killing. This prompted the Reichstag to pass a Law for the Protection of the Republic making propagation of the myth a prosecutable offense. Nevertheless, it was still used by the Nazis before and after they took power.Swartzburg p.706 Later theory  Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich wrote that the group may also be known as the \\"Hidden Hand\\", which is headed by the Rothschild family of international financiers and based loosely around many of the top national banking institutions and royal families of the world. Dr. John Coleman has written several books about the same subject. Most notably the document stored in CIA library.

Bauman was instrumental later in establishing the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points regulations used for food safety. Bauman and his team were instrumental in creating the first solid food consumed by a NASA astronaut: small food cubes eaten by Scott Carpenter on board Aurora 7 in 1962. (John Glenn had consumed the fruit-flavored drink Tang in space three months earlier aboard the Friendship 7.) Space food cubes were followed by other space-friendly foods created by Pillsbury's food engineers, such as non-crumbly cake, relish that could be served in slices, and meat that needed no refrigeration. In 1970, Pillsbury filed for a trademark for a \\"non-frozen balance energy snack in rod form containing nutritionally balanced amounts of carbohydrate, fat and protein\\" which they dubbed \\"Space Food Sticks\\". (No basis for use of the term \\"nutritionally balanced\\" was provided.) A forerunner of energy bars, Space Food Sticks were promoted by Pillsbury for their association with NASA's efforts to create safe, healthy and nutritional space food. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions, Pillsbury marketed Space Food Sticks as a \\"nutritionally balanced between-meal snack.\\" Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box, and came in six flavors such as peanut butter, caramel, and chocolate.A Brief History of Space Food Sticks In 1972, astronauts on board Skylab 3 ate modified versions of Space Food Sticks to test their \\"gastrointestinal compatibility\\".

It is part of the royal winter palace complex built by the Hasmoneans in the warm desert oasis of Jericho, west of the town proper. It dates from between 70 and 50 BCE, and if it did indeed serve as a synagogue, it would be one of the oldest synagogues ever found.Oldest Synagogue Found in Israel, March 29, 1998. Associated PressIsrael's Oldest Synagogue, Archaeology, Volume 51 Number 4, July/August 1998, by Spencer P.M. HarringtonEhud Netzer,\\"A Synagogue from the Hasmonean Period Recently Exposed in the Western Plain of Jericho\\", IEJ 49 (1999): 203‚Äì21. The synagogue was discovered during a dig led by Ehud Netzer. The synagogue was a modest building of stone and sun-baked brick. It included a ritual bath and a small courtyard surrounded by seven or eight rooms with a rectangular main hall measuring 53 by 37 feet. The hall was bordered by a colonnade, the platform of which was nearly two feet above the floor of the nave. This provided seating for nearly 70 people. In the northeastern corner, Netzer found a niche that may have served as a Torah Ark. A lower compartment, mostly intact, is thought to have possibly functioned as a genizah or storage compartment where old or unused scrolls were stored. Adjacent to the western side of the main hall was a triclinium, or dining hall, where public meals could be held, and a small, triangular space that may have been used as a kitchen. The triclinium was added some years after the main hall was built. Diners reclined, Roman style, on benches against three walls of the chamber while eating. The floors and walls were covered with white plaster.

Yuile, along with his brother William, owned and operated various glass manufacturing companies through his life. He also served as the president of the Dominion Textile Company. David was born February 20, 1846 in Glasgow, Scotland. His parents, William Pollock Yuile and Margaret Rattray had one son and one daughter already. His father was a wine merchant, and around 1857 his family emigrated to Upper Canada, settling around Ingersoll. David attended school there, later moving with his family to Montreal in 1869, where William Yuile, the family's eldest son, became a general merchant. David was hired on by William in 1870. As the business continued to prosper, the brothers also began to act as manufacturer's agents and wholesale druggists. In 1875 they were hired to act as the manufacturer's agent for the newly formed St Johns Glass Company of Saint-Jean, which they acquired on June 1, 1878 to cover debts owed to them, after the company's losses had forced its closure. Yuile married Margaret King in June 1878 in Montreal. The Yuile brothers set to work restoring the St Johns Glass Company of Saint-Jean to operation, and it resumed manufacturing in April 1879 under the name Excelsior Glass Company. Although the business did well, the location in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu was inconvenient, and the brothers sold the building and land in 1880, and moved the manufacturing equipment and workers to Montreal. Two glass furnaces were erected at the Montreal site, one for flint glass and one for green glass, and the company made prescription bottles, fruit jars, telegraph insulators, and some pressed glass pieces. The brothers also acquired the Foster Brothers Glass Works the same year, and moved its operations to their Montreal factory. The company was reorganised in 1883 to finance further expansion and the hiring of expert European glass blowers. As part of the reorganisation, it was renamed the North American Glass Company. At this point, the company had a capital of $10,000. David and William Yuile, along with Ralph King, the secretary-treasurer of North American Glass, and King's brother in law John Watt founded the Diamond Glass Company Limited in 1890. The company did not manufacture glass, but acquired glass producing companies in a plan to control the Canadian glass market by purchasing the glass manufacturing companies. The first company they acquired as their own North American Glass Company, and they also acquired the Nova Scotia Glass Company of New Glasgow, Nova Scotia in 1890. The company managed to increase its capital to $500,000 by 1891, and purchased the Hamilton Glass Company and the Burlington Glass Company. After this acquisitions slowed until the takeovers of the Lamont Glass Company and the Dominion Glass Company Limited in 1897 and the Toronto Glass Company Limited in 1899. During the 1890s, Yuile served as president of the Chanteloup Manufacturing Company Limited, a Montreal-based brass foundry and ironworks. William Yuile retired in 1903, and the Diamond Glass Company was reorganised to allow further expansion. A new ownership group of previous owners David Yuile and Ralph King, as well as new owners Norman MacLeod Yuile (son of William Yuile), James Watt King (Ralph's brother), George Arthur Grier, and David Alexander Gordon started the new Diamond Flint Glass Company Limited, with David acting as the secretary-treasurer from February onwards and president from August onwards. The Diamond Flint Glass Company bought the Diamond Glass Company for $1,938,309. At this time the Diamond Flint Glass Company was the largest glass manufacturer in Canada, employing some one thousand people. Yuile helped organise the formation of the Dominion Textile Company in 1905 from several smaller cotton mills, and was elected the president of the firm upon its creation. In 1906 the Diamond Flint Glass Company obtained exclusive rights to the use of the Owens automatic bottle machine in Canada. Yuile was made a member of the Montreal Board of Trade in 1908. Yuile remained president of the Diamond Flint Glass Company until his death on June 21, 1909 in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, where he had travelled to undergo an operation.

Retrieved on 18 January 2015. \\"6, El Dokki St. Dokki / Giza\\" It is operated by the German Protestant community of Cairo.  History  The initiative for a school was established by the Protestant congregation of Cairo. The school was built along with a rectory in the spring of 1873 on land given to the Prussian consul von Theremin by the Khedive Ismail. The language of instruction was French with 15 students attending. On 2 February 1878, there was a dispute about the school's ownership between the church and the school, which resulted in the school's becoming community owned and adding optional Arabic lessons. In 1880, the school further expanded to include 89 students in three classes. There were students of different nationalities with 28 Turks, 19 Egyptians, ten Italians, five Germans, five Swiss, five French, four Syrians, three English, three Scots, three Levantines and one each Austrian, Greek, Persian and Armenian. The school had students of different religions: 41 Muslim students, 19 Protestant, 14 Roman Catholic, seven Jewish, seven Coptic and one Greek Orthodox. After the English conquered Egypt in 1882, English courses were added to the school's curriculum. In 1908, the school was relocated to Boulaq with primary and secondary education facilities. A year later, their first \\"Einj√§hrigenexamen\\" (a German secondary education exam) was made before the German examination committee. Due to the First World War, students stopped going to school and by November 1914 the school was shut down. In 1920, England liquidated all the German properties including the community properties in Egypt. On 17 February 1930, the school was reopened with five students attending. In July 1933, the school was relocated to its old location. By 1939, the school had 13 classes with 130 students, but had to be closed again due to the start of the Second World War. On 12 January 1953, the school was reopened with 18 students attending and the addition of a newly established kindergarten. The first director of the school was Artur Hachmeister. The school was than moved to Dr.-Mahmoud-Azmi-Stra√üe 2 in Zamalek. The first \\"Reifepr√ºfung\\" (high school exam) was done by three female and three male students. On 1 October 1956, an Islam course was added to the school's curriculum which was required by the Egyptian government as of 26 June 1956. In 1957, Arabic was made a compulsory course for all students attending the school. The graduates of the school were eligible to attend Egyptian universities by January 1958. In 1959, the school's first Arabic division director, Auni Abder Rauf, was appointed. On 1 March 1977, the school was relocated to Dokki. In 2001, the school added a new course called \\"koeducative\\" religion for Muslim and Christian students.  Traditions  Every year, a sports competition between the DEO and the Deutsche Schule Athen (DSA) takes place. The schools compete in the following sports: swimming, track and field and either basketball, football or volleyball. Every year, one school flies to the country of the other for this event. Other traditions include the Christmas bazaar, the Klaus-Heller-Lauf and the annual \\"Brotaktion\\", where food and supplies are gathered for the homeless and sent to charity. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule also organizes an annual \\"Pyramidenlauf\\", which is an event at the Pyramids of Giza every February where students, teachers and others run for 5 kilometers. The start and finish line is located at the third pyramid of Menkaure. The marathon has been an annual event since 1976. The DEO also takes part in the annual \\"Jugend musiziert\\" competition held between German schools around the area of the Mediterranean Sea, which students travel to Germany to participate in.

He served as Royal Society Research Professor, and a Principal Investigator (PI) at the Engineering Design Centre at the University of Cambridge. He is known for his contributions in Materials Science in the field of material selection. Education Ashby is the son of the leading botanist and educator Lord Ashby. He was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and the University of Cambridge where he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos as a student of Queens‚Äô College, Cambridge. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Metallurgy in 1957 (First Class Honours); his Master of Arts degree in 1959 and his PhD in 1961. Career and research By conducting numerous studies on the active deformation mechanisms under different temperature conditions, M.F. Ashby developed a graphical approach for determining these mechanisms. He generalizes this approach to the broader field of material selection by developing the software CMS(Cambridge Materials Selector)in collaboration with David Cebon, with whom he co-founded Granta Design Limited. He also collaborated extensively with Yves Br√©chet (CNRS Silver Medal). He continued to work on the software to improve its pedagogical value across Materials Education ( CES EduPack ‚Äì used at more than 1000 universities worldwide and value to industry (CES Selector). This software is currently available from the company Granta Design, of which he is the chairman. Ashby has revolutionized the approach to the selection of materials to take into account four aspects: feature, material, geometry, and processes; moreover, he worked with the division in classes and subclasses. In doing so he has developed a comprehensive approach that associates to the expected mechanical functions of an object a performance index that has to be optimized. These indices allow to better take into account all the properties required of a material, such as specific stiffness (ratio between the elastic modulus and density) instead of single elastic module. His approach allows one to rationally choose the most suitable materials for each application. In practice, this approach firstly asks to identify the performance index starting from the expected function and geometry. Then it is possible to select thresholds for certain properties in order to select the most useful materials from those present in a database that has some 80,000 materials. The division into classes allows pre-selecting representative materials and therefore working only with certain classes of materials. Finally, the selected materials are shown in a 2-dimensional chart, called the Ashby diagram, in order to view those with the highest performance index. These diagrams often contain also nanostructured materials and composites. * Materials Selection for Mechanical Design ‚Äì standard text used around the world. * Materials and Design ‚Äì book ‚Äì Aesthetic attributes as well as technical attributes of materials, making products delightful as well as functional. * Materials Processing Science and Design- introductory textbook ‚Äì trying to motivate engineers to learn about materials by starting with design. In more recent years he has concentrated on materials and the environment and sustainability, writing award-winning textbooks and pioneering teaching methods to get this complex topic across to engineering students. He has been honored by the American Society of Engineering Education by having a teaching prize named after him. Ashby has achieved a remarkably innovative work in the areas of materials, design, and sustainability as well as in that of pedagogy.

Walpola was an accomplished musician adapt at playing the flute, harmonium, violin and tabla.  Biography = Early life = Walpola's father Palis Ayya worked with costumes for the Tower Hall theater. Walpola had to forgo his education at a young age to support his family and for a time built masks for the Sri Lankan army. At that time he won a role in Sirisena Wimalaweera's play Amma singing a virindu. He subsequently acted and sang in the play Wessanthara as well. To master the flute, Walpola began taking lessons from Eddie Master and then attended R. A. Chandrasena's Academy. Chandrasena was impressed by Walpola's ability to sing and after auditioning several songs with harmonium accompaniment, sent a good word to the Radio Ceylon broadcaster Thevis Guruge. Guruge gave Walpola a sarala gee programme with a duet partner G. S. B. Rani Perera. =Playback singing (1953-1965)= Walpola debuted as a playback singer in the 1953 film Prema Tharangaya alongside his future wife Rita Jenevi Fernando. Around 1956, Walpola married Fernando who subsequently adapted the name Latha Walpola. From his debut to the early 1960s, Walpola dominated male playback singing in Sri Lankan cinema providing a counterpoint to the harsh Carnatic style of Mohideen Baig with his softer more melodic voice which lend itself to love songs. His best known work from this period include \\"Seeya Manamalaya\\" from Asoka (1955), \\"Amu Pitisareyeki\\" from Seda Sulang (1955), \\"Upatha Labaa\\" and \\"Suba Aasiri (Hanika Yamang)\\" from Mathalang (1955), \\"Surathalee\\" from Surathalee (1956), \\"Katey Kiri Suwanda\\" from Sandesaya (1960), \\"Oya Belma\\" and \\"Waththe Wetunu Pol Athu\\" from Kurulu Bedda (1961) and \\"Man Mula Wela\\" from Deepashika (1963). Walpola's dueting partners included Vivienne de Silva Boralessa, Chitra Somapala (\\"Pem Suwandai\\") and Rukmani Devi in addition to Latha. = Later life = Walpola successfully returned to Radio Ceylon with \\"Uthama Muni Dalada\\" (lyrics by Ajantha Ranasinghe and music by Sanath Nandasiri.) Walpola served as a music teacher later on in his life. He died on December 25, 1983.  Personal life  Dharmadasa Walpola is married Latha Walpola and has five children Amith Walpola, Dhammika Walpola, Chaminda Lolitha Walpola, Suneth Walpola, Sumith Walpola, have already entered the music industry  Dharmadasa Walpola ‚Äì Golden Voice of the Silver Screen  By T. K. Premadasa (The writer is the retired former Head of Corporate Affairs and Communications - Sri Lanka Export Development Board. )''' Dharmadasa Walpola incontrovertibly dominated the Sinhala Cinema in 1950s & 60s as the best play-back singer. The melodious and romantic voice of Dharmadasa Walpola, a household name, resonates even today in the hearts of music fans over the island. This is a commemorative appreciation of the 30th Death Anniversary of this versatile musician on December 25, 2013. Born on 27 November 1927 in Deiyannewela, Kandy, this future play-back singer displayed his innate talents of musical virtuosity since his boyhood. His mother was Mrs Karunawathie and father Mr Charles Appuhamy, a dressmaker by profession, tailored costumes to the Tower Hall artists. His father‚Äôs close association with them paved way for him to know the leading artists on the stage. By 7 years of age he started singing Nadagam songs and his father took him for support work behind the stage. Acquaintance with Tower Hall staff opened the rare opportunity of playing a character on the stage. Later he played the main role of Prince Dhanapala in Samudra Devi. He displayed his skills in \\"Amma\\", the stage-play produced by Veteran Producer/Director Sirisena Wimalaweera, reciting Virudu gayana. In \\"Wessanthara\\" he availed of the opportunity to show his colors on the stage. Influenced by Mr. Jamis Perera from Kandy, Dharmadasa turned to music furthering his talents under Musicians Lionel Perera, Eddie Master and R.A.Chandrasena. He mastered the flute as his favorite instrument. In early 1950s he joined Radio Ceylon orchestra. He was a superb player of harmonium, violin, tabla and flute. It lends high degree of credence to M. Ariyadasa, tablist who encouraged Dharmadasa with fullest support to succeed in his musical career. Mr.Thevis Guruge, the then Director of Radio Ceylon, opened the opportunity for him to display his inborn talents of singing in Sarala Gee Program broadcast by Radio Ceylon. Dharmadasa joined popular Radio Artist G. S. B. Rani Perera in her Sarala Gee Program to sing his first duet, the favorite song \\"Thotiyo thotiyo\\" in 1951. Since then he became a popular artist with many number of solos and the most popular duet \\"Nidi Yahane Aida\\" recorded with Vivienne de Silva Boralessa. His first solo is \\" Asaray Prema Sepatha\\" song on Buddhist values. Dharmadasa acclaimed zenith of his popularity overnight as a play-back singer by his first film \\"Prema Tharangaya\\" screened in 1953. \\"Honda hondama weya lowa kisima thenaka nehe\\" a highly popular duet for decades was sung with (Latha) Rita Jenavi Fernando who later became Latha Walpola by marriage to Dharmadasa. An interesting story heard about his entry to play-back singing is worthy of mention. Aruna Shanthi who played the main role in Prema Tharangaya was scheduled to sing this song. But a difficult situation arose since Aruna Shanthi failed to satisfy the required quality of singing. At this decisive moment, M. Ariyadasa of the orchestra voluntarily rushed to Dharmadasa‚Äôs home, brought him in the midnight and introduced him to the Producers. This made a landmark of his musical career with his adorable voice to become a popular play-back singer overnight. He sang for films in Sujatha as second film followed by Ahankara Sthree. Contribution of his scintillating voice to over 120 films during a period of thirty years from 1952 to 1983 was remarkable. Mathalang, Surathalee, Sukomali, Surangani, Asoka, Suhada Sohoyuro, Suraya, Surasena, Sundara Birida, Sithala Watura, Deevaraya, Veera Vijaya, Radala Piliruwa and Dostara (Doctor) were a few among hundreds of movies that captured hearts of the people with his exhilarating voice. Unfortunately this golden voice withered away with his final song \\"Asha Mal Pawan\\" in film \\"Samanmalee\\" released in January, 1979 to the Sinhala Cinema. The everlasting memories of favorite hits like ‚ÄòMae Saumya Rathri‚Äô in Sirimali, \\"Satnaki Jeevithe\\" in Asoka ‚ÄòOya Belma Oya Kelma in Kurulu Bedda, Kate Kiri Suwanda in Sandesaya, Mangalad dinye in Sithal Watura Jeevithe Jeevethe in Kolaba Hadayo will be etched in the minds for another millennium. Kavi gayana in Dingiri Menika, Kurulu Bedda has influenced the listeners with highest admiration even today. He was also the play-back singer not only for leading Sri Lankan actors like Gamini Fonseka, Joe Abeywickrama, Ananda Jayaratne, Herbi Senavitratna, Roy De Silva et al, but also Indian actors like Jemini Ganeshan. The songs recorded by this great play-back singer in Jeevithaya and Samanalayo are highly popular even today though the two films were never screened. The song \\"Kowlan Handaine\\" and \\"Amba Damba Sevanali\\" sung with Sydney Attigala for the film \\"Jeevithaya\\" are still a hot favorite among the public. As far back as the latter part of 1950s and 1960s dubbing Sinhala dialogue into Hindi and Tamil movies became highly popular with fully packed audience. Dharmadasa Walpola was adjudged the best play-back singer for his pre-eminent golden voice over the world acclaimed Indian singers. Pathiwatha, Veeravikrama, Ahinsaka Prayogya, Angulimala, Sudu Nangi, Ley Kandulu, Shimbo, and Anjalee are clear testimony to his masterly vocal performance. Initially, since film industry in Sri Lanka was not equipped with technical resources, producers were compelled to go to South India in early 1950s to film their production. This prompted them to hire Indian singers at a lower charge. But Latha Walpola and Dharmadasa Walpola broke the South Indian monopoly and became indomitable duo in Sinhala Cinema. Dharmadasa Walpola was not only the leading play-back singer but also the indisputable singer in ballet radio and stage drama music. His masterly performance of singing in Bari Sil, Kela Mal and Nawarella, famous ballet music composed by Musician Dr Premasiri Khemadasa captured the fully packed spell bound audience at every presentation. Seegiri Gala Musapath Kala and \\" Sirikatha Ena Maga\\" are highly popular songs even today as well as the lovely song Uttama Muni Dalada Balan Saki from Dalada Watha Radio Drama lyrics by Dr Ajantha Ranasinghe and melody by Prof. Sanath Nandasiri. In addition to play-back singing Dharmadasa sang for HMV and Columbia Records. It was a privilege to sing for both those commercial branding labels at the time. Among the songs recorded were \\"Sansare Duka Nesu Shakya Raja\\", \\"Ananda Javanika\\", \\"Ase Gethe Madura Geethe\\" with Rukmani Devi, \\"Sri Lankave Shantha Sobana\\", \\"Dakina Dakina Wele\\", \\"Manike Manike Run kande\\", \\"Suwanda Gange Adere Ape\\" with Latha and solo like \\"Me Prema Kathawe\\" These songs became highly popular overnight. He shared his golden voice with Latha, G.S.B.Rani Perera, Rukmani Devi, Viviene de Silva Boralessa, Chitra Somapala, Nanda Malini, Sujatha Aththanayake, Jikki, Jamuna Rani et al. He has sung under the directors Mohammed Gausse, R. Mutthusami, B. S. Perera, Sunil Shantha, R. A. Chandrasena, P. L. A. Somapala, Premasiri Khemadasa, Sarath Dassanayake and Sanath Nandasiri. Also he recorded songs under the direction of famous Indian musicians as Dakshina Murthi, S. S. Weda, T. R. Papa, R. Sundaram, Raja Thangendra, Gowradanam and Jayadev. In the 1960s and 1970s he conducted Dharmadasa Sangeethayathanaya, School of Music in Maradana. He married (Latha) Rita Jenevi Fernando of Galkissa in 1959, the Nightingale of Sri Lanka. A ceremonial wedding was held at Siri Kotha, Kollupitiya with a huge gathering of guests and artists. Policemen had to be deployed to control the massive crowd gathered outside Siri Kotha. They have three sons and a daughter. His fans and friends, including Vernan De Silva, organised a Commemorative Death Anniversary Celebration in Kandy as a tribute to this versatile play-back singer with meritorious deeds of blood donation program, Sangika Dana, launch of a book written on Dharmadasa‚Äôs biography and issue a commemorative stamp to coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of his death. Dharmadasa Walpola was a gentleman who strictly adhered to his principle of safeguarding the dignity of singing despite it might have caused disadvantage to him. However, the bold decision taken by him has benefitted the future generation involved in music to maintain the distinction of their musical career. In spite of his inestimable contribution of musical brilliancy, he was never recognized with awards except a limited number of articles written particularly in English media. This article is an attempt to reminisce with honor the immeasurable contribution made by him to national music. It behooves all Sri Lankans to salute this great musician as a mark of gratefulness in recognition of his musical excellence to the nation..

Though only pre-production variants entered service, the Hs 122 led on to the Hs 126 which was produced in large numbers. Development The Hs 122 was the Henschel company's second aircraft, its first, the Hs 121 not being intended for production. It was designed in response to a Reich Air Ministry call for a multi-role army co-operation aircraft to replace the ageing Heinkel He 46. The design emerged as a single-engine two-seat parasol wing machine with a fixed undercarriage. The wing centre section was carried above the fuselage on a series of short struts and the swept outer sections were braced to the lower fuselage with V struts. The wings were built around two metal spars and had metal-covered leading edges and upper surfaces with fabric elsewhere. The fuselage was an elliptical metal monocoque, with a metal-structured tail also metal covered apart from fabric control surfaces. The tailplane was mounted about halfway up the fin, supported by a parallel pair of struts. The spatted mainwheels were each mounted on V struts to the fuselage. The cockpits were open, with the pilot sitting below a cut-out in the wing trailing edge and the second crew member in a separate cockpit aft. The first prototype, registered D-UBYN, was powered, like several other German aircraft of the time including the Messerschmitt Bf 109, by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12-cylinder water-cooled engine; but the next prototype (D-UBAV) had a 460 kW (610 hp) Siemens Sh 22B 9-cylinder supercharged radial. There were at least three prototypes, followed by a small number of pre-production Siemens-powered Hs 122B-0 aircraft which entered service in 1936. These were followed on the Henschel production lines at Sch√∂nefeld by the more powerful Hs 126.

It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow on the forest floor or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L. vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia. Taxonomy Lactarius vietus was first described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus vietus in his Systema Mycologicum. In his 1838 work Epicrisis systematis mycologici, Fries reclassified the species as a Lactarius, giving it its current name. Subsequent attempts to reclassify the species have been unsuccessful. In his 1871 work Der F√ºhrer in die Pilzkunde, Paul Kummer reclassified the species as a member of Galorrheus, and in Otto Kuntze's 1891 Revisio generum plantarum, the species was placed in the genus Lactifluus. Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) of Lactarius vietus. The specific epithet is from the Latin vietus, meaning shrunken. It is commonly known as the grey milkcap. Description L. vietus gills with milk Lactarius vietus typically has a cap of across, with a flattened-convex shape. At times, the cap becomes widely funnel-shaped, and sometimes features a broad or pointed umbo, though the centre of the cap is typically depressed. The cap is coloured grey, sometimes with violet, flesh- coloured, pale yellowish-brown or red tints, though it is paler towards the cap margin in young mushrooms. Very pale specimens have also been recorded in the United States, though they are not true albinos. The cap's margin is curved inwards in younger specimens, and wavey. The cap surface is smooth, and can be slimey or sticky when wet. The stem measures by , and is generally cylindrical in shape. Sometimes the stem narrows downwards, or is club-shaped. In colour, the stem whitish or greyish, paler at the top, and is rather weak and easily broken. The flesh is a whitish-buff colour, and is often absent in the stem, leaving it hollow. The crowded gills can be decurrent (with the gill running down the stem) or adnate (with the entire depth of the gill connecting to the stem), and in colour are whitish to a dirty buff. They are thin and flaccid, and there are three to four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem from the cap margin). The gills produce white milk, which dries a brownish or greenish grey after about 20 minutes. The mushroom flesh will slowly stain a greyish colour if a drop of FeSO4 solution is applied to it as a chemical colour test. =Microscopic features= The spore print is typically a creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge, but it has been observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density, meaning that it is not a useful means of identification. Individual spores are a buff-white, amyloid (staining blue in Melzer's reagent) and hyaline. In shape, the spores are elliptic, with a moderately well-developed network of ridges, measuring between 8 and 9.5 by 6.5 to 7.5 micrometres (Œºm). The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gills) are shaped like narrow spindles, typically measuring between 40 and 75 Œºm long, but sometimes reaching 86 Œºm in length, by 6 and 11 Œºm wide at the widest point. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are leaf or spindle shaped, measuring between 30 and 52 Œºm long by 4 to 7 Œºm wide. The basidia are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring between 36 and 42 Œºm in length by 8 and 12 Œºm wide. =Similar species= Lactarius uvidus is similar in appearance. In colour, it is a pale pink-buff, and its flesh turns a violet-lilac colour when cut. The white milk has a mild taste. Lactarius mammosus, a species described by Fries but not often mentioned by the mycological community for some time after his death, is also similar. Meinhard Moser, examining the identity of L. mammosus, concluded that it \\"is certainly more closely related to L. vietus than to L. fuscus, but differs in habit and colour. The spores are slightly longer and the sculptures are less pronounced in L. vietus.\\" Edibility Lactarius vietus milk has a very hot taste, and the mushroom lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is a defining feature of the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes. Distribution, habitat and ecology Lactarius vietus is fairly common, and can be found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among Sphagnum moss. Though it strongly favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.

He played parts of two seasons in the majors, for the Milwaukee Brewers and for the Philadelphia Phillies. He played 13 games, twelve as a pinch hitter and one as a designated hitter. Amateur career Stanicek was drafted out of Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois in the 16th round of the 1979 MLB Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He opted to play collegiate baseball for the University of Nebraska. In 1981, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected in the first round of the 1982 MLB Draft by the San Francisco Giants. Professional career In a Sept. 16 game at Yankee Stadium, with the visiting Brewers trailing in the seventh inning, Steve Stanicek came to bat for the first time, pinch-hitting. He reached safely against Yankee pitcher Tommy John on an error, and Milwaukee rallied for three runs in the inning and a 5-4 victory. Two nights later, Stanicek got his first big-league hit. He was a pinch-hitter again, this time in the ninth inning of a game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit that the Brewers were losing 7-1. After a two-run Dale Sveum home run, Stanicek was sent up against Willie Hernandez with a teammate on base and delivered a single. Next batter Paul Molitor hit a three-run homer to make it 7-6 and knock Hernandez out of the game, but that's how the game ended. Personal life Steve is the brother of fellow former major leaguer Pete Stanicek. The brothers made their Major League debuts 15 days apart in 1987. Stanicek has been a successful high school coach in the Chicago area and is currently head coach at Glenbrook South High School in Glenview, Illinois.

The siege was a part of an English civil war fought from 1264 to 1267 by the forces of Simon de Montfort against the Royalist forces led by Prince Edward (later Edward I of England). The siege was one of few castle attacks to take place during the war. Castle defences The Castle of Kenilworth's structure was unique and contributed to the longevity of the siege. The castle was a formidable structure due to its heavy defences.Page, W., ed. The Victoria County History of the County of Warwick, vol. 1 (London, 1904), p 380 The most notable defence was a dam to the south of the castle, across which a causeway led from the entrance to the bailey and keep. Behind the dam was an artificial lake along the south and west sides of the castle, protecting it from a land approach. Ditches along the north side and a second pool on the east side of the causeway extended the water protection to surround the castle. They would also pour hot tar on the soldiers below. Siege The feudal summons for the siege was pushed back from December 1265, finally occurring on 21 June the next year. From that point on, the siege occurred in earnest. The castle's garrison was large, over a thousand, usually estimated at twelve hundred men, and active in defending themselves.Blaauw, W. H., The Barons' War (London, 1871), p. 307 Outside of the castle was the feudal host of England as summoned by Henry III, along with his sons, the Lord Edward and Edmund, who had been attempting to contain the garrison since the prior autumn. The attack on Kenilworth Castle began on 21 June. It was the largest siege to ever occur in England. A lot of the attackers were forced to join as they knew how well defended the castle was. The royal forces tried all manners of devices. Numerous stone-throwing devices, presumably trebuchets, were brought to the siege, as well as \\"turres ligneas\\", or wooden towers. An \\"ursus\\" or \\"bear\\" was built, with separate compartments for archers.The Chronicle of William de Rishanger of the Barons‚Äô Wars, ed. J.O. Halliwell (Camden Society, 1840), p 51.Powicke, F.M. King Henry III and the Lord Edward (Oxford, 1947), p 531. Archbishop William Freney tried to negotiate with the garrison, but was refused entry. Barges were sent from Chester to attempt an attack via the lake; this did not work.M.C. Prestwich, Edward I (Berkeley, 1988), p 56; Time, however, was the only weapon left at their disposal, and the patient waiting finally paid off; with the garrison running out of food and suffering from disease, they finally surrendered on 13 December 1266.‚ÄòChronicles of the Mayors and Sheriffs of London, 1259-66‚Äô, in English Historical Documents, 1189-1327 (London, 1975), p 193 and accepted the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth.

The mills are part of the Dundee Canal Industrial Historic District. Botany Mills was a Passaic, New Jersey, manufacturer of textiles, which was organized in 1887.Obituary Notes, The New York Times, February 21, 1912, pg. 11. It merged with Continental Textile Co., Ltd., in January 1927. Botany Mills continued to have a controlling interest in both Botany Worsted Mills and Garfield Worsted Mills. The company was a key target of the 1926 Passaic Textile Strike, which lasted almost a year. The business is significant for having survived the Great Depression while continuing to be a leader in its field in the decades afterward. Corporation history Botany Mills' stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange reached a low for 1929 in late September, a month prior to the 1929 Stock Market Crash. The company's net loss of $2,768,904 for 1929, exceeded the 1928 deficit which totaled $1,461,783. In June 1932 Botany Mills formed an independent bondholders protective committee which called for immediate deposits of bonds. The firm had descended into receivership after defaulting on the payment of interest on its bonds on April 1, 1932. The Empire Trust Company served as depositary for the committee. In October 1948 Botany Mills announced that it would absorb higher raw material and labor costs without raising prices on goods. They maintained prices on wool shirts and pants as well as on their swimming trunk line. However their gabardine boxer shorts increased in price from $6.95 to $7.50 retail. In August 1954, Daroff and Sons, a Philadelphia clothing manufacturer which had produced worsteds for Botany under contract for several years, purchased a controlling interest in Botany Mills. In late 1955, Botany left the textile business and transferred its Passaic plant to an affiliate company, Clarence Worsted. Botany transitioned into real estate, product licensing and cosmetics.

Typical seating capacity is 96 passengers in the motor cars and 112 passengers in the end cars.Aspenberg (2001): 170 The class was delivered in four versions, named A through D. After the initial delivery of fifteen 69As in 1970 and 1971, twenty 69Bs were delivered in 1974 and 1975. These were designed to operate on longer sections and were equipped with only one door per car. This turned out to extend stopping time too much, and the C and D versions were delivered with two doors per car. From 1975 to 1977, NSB took delivery of fourteen 69Cs and from 1983 to 1993 thirty-nine 69Ds. The latter is distinguishable because of its different front. NSB operates both two- and three-car sets, and up to three units can be run in multiple, allowing NSB to operate any train length from two to nine cars.Aspenberg (2001): 170‚Äì177 Eighty-two units remain in service; although they have been retired from the J√¶ren Commuter Rail, NSB still uses them on the Oslo Commuter Rail, the Bergen Commuter Rail and the Arendal Line. History The J√¶ren Line passing a windmill in H√• in 1912. At the time, the railway was narrow gauge and nonelectrical. The J√¶ren Line opened as a narrow gauge railway between Stavanger and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the Flekkefjord Line. On 21 December 1924, the J√¶ren Line's only branch opened, the √Ölg√•rd Line from Ganddal to √Ölg√•rd.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 44 On 1 March 1944, the J√¶ren Line became part of the S√∏rland Line, when the line opened between Sira and Kristiansand and the J√¶ren Line was converted to standard gauge.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 45 The S√∏rland Line from Egersund to Stavanger was opened as electric on 3 June 1956.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 34 This resulted in Class 65 and Class 67 electric multiple units being used on local trains on the line.Aspenberg (2001): 139 In 1960, the services were replaced by Class 68 units.Aspenberg (2001): 157 The section from Stavanger to Sandnes became the first part of the Norwegian railway network, after the Ofoten Line, to be centrally controlled. The centralized traffic control opened from Stavanger to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 37 The whole line received partial automatic train control on 31 December 1986.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 40 The commuter rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after an agreement between NSB, Rogaland County Municipality and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new Class 69 multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services. The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from Stavanger to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes. In addition, NSB started with a half-hour headway between Stavanger and Sandnes. A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes at the time the new service started. NSB stated that the goal was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994. The stations were also upgraded, including new sheds. The Scanet train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996. Klepp Station The service was a success, and NSB received a 112% increase in ridership the first year. This resulted in the company introducing a similar service between Trondheim and Innherred, the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail, in 1993. In 1993, NSB won Statens Byggeskikkpris, among other things for the new sheds on the J√¶ren Line. By 1995, ridership was up 150% from before the service started. In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the J√¶ren Commuter Rail. The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years behind schedule. In April 2004, the rail administration opened J√•tt√• Station, which was located close to Viking Stadion, the new home ground of Tippeligaen side Viking FK. By 2005, ridership had increased to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% market share in the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillev√•g Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, J√•tt√•v√•gen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and was estimated to be completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the last part of the upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes. In October 2018, Go-Ahead Norway entered into an agreement with Norwegian Railway Directorate to deliver train services on S√∏rlandsbanen, Arendalsbanen and J√¶rbanen from 15 December 2019 (a service titled S√∏rtoget, \\"Southern Train\\"). The company sought to increase the frequency of trains on the J√¶ren Commuter rail. Future The √Ölg√•rd Line, here at Foss-Eikeland, has been closed for passenger traffic since 1955, but is proposed as a new service on the J√¶ren Commuter Rail The National Rail Administration has developed a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 31‚Äì35 taking back into use the √Ölg√•rd Line, which branches off at Ganddal,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 52‚Äì56 and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 57‚Äì58 An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, which may or may not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes. The √Ölg√•rd Line is a long railway which branches from the S√∏rland Line at Ganddal. It runs via Foss-Eikeland and Figgjo to √Ölg√•rd,Aspenberg (1994): 227 and was opened on 20 December 1924.Thime (1999): 13 Passenger services were terminated on 1 November 1955, making it the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to be closed. Freight trains operated until 1988.Aspenberg (1994): 230 The first are used for freight trains to access a cement factory. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation. The annual traffic potential for the √Ölg√•rd Line is 600,000 passengers. Plans call for stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and √Ölg√•rd. It is possible to operate the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to √Ölg√•rd without new infrastructure investments to the S√∏rland Line. However, the line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. √Ölg√•rd is also a good location for a park and ride for European Route E39. A branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the S√∏rland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers. J√•tt√•v√•gen Station opened in 2009 along the new double track section Plans have been made that would either double or triple the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to N√¶rb√∏ terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the J√¶ren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between . However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds. When the J√¶ren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the S√∏rland Line, the station was moved north of the city center. Egersund Station has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of- way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new S√∏rland Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 61 Rogaland County Municipality is in the planning process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, J√•tt√•v√•gen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.

Goldenberg is a meteorologist with NOAA/AOML's Hurricane Research Division in Miami (Virginia Key), Florida. Goldenberg received his associate degree from Miami Dade College and a bachelor's degree in 1978 and a master's degree in 1980 both in meteorology from Florida State University. One of his main graduate advisors was James O'Brien, one of the world's leading experts on El Ni√±o. Goldenberg has specialized in climate studies and hurricanes. Stan's hurricane-related research has included developing and implementing significant improvements to one of the earlier numerical hurricane-track prediction models used by the National Hurricane Center and more recently, examining the various climatic factors which influence the variability of hurricane activity in the Atlantic from intraseasonal to multidecadal time scales. He has done extensive research into the physical mechanisms responsible for the connection between El Ni√±o and Atlantic hurricane activity. He was the first author of the research report published in Science establishing the fact that the Atlantic hurricane basin has entered a multidecadal-scale era of greatly increased hurricane activity. The paper concluded that the increase in hurricane activity was due to natural climate fluctuations rather than from any long-term temperature trends (which some attribute to anthropogenic global warming). (This paper was recognized with the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Outstanding Scientific Paper Award.) He is one of the lead authors of NOAA's Seasonal Hurricane Outlooks for the Atlantic basin and was a co-recipient of NOAA's Bronze Medal for that work. Goldenberg has participated in numerous research flights into and around hurricanes on NOAA's WP-3D and Gulfstream IV aircraft, including flights into Hurricane Katrina (2005) as it made landfall on the Louisiana/Mississippi coast. Goldenberg's interest and experience in hurricane disaster preparedness was greatly increased when his South Florida home was destroyed as he and his family experienced the full force of Category 5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992. His family's personal experience, as well as his scientific expertise, have been featured in numerous TV specials such as Cyclone! (National Geographic/PBS), Storm Stories (The Weather Channel) and Savage Skies (PBS). Goldenberg has published a number of scientific papers, is frequently interviewed by local, national and international media and has been a regular speaker at scientific, insurance, and hurricane preparedness conferences. He has also been a research scientist at the University of Washington from 1986‚Äì1989 and for a short time taught Mathematics and Science at a Messianic Jewish academy. ReferencesWorks 1.

The narrative consists of five distinct parts which assiduously link together to produce a narrative that is on the one hand disjointed and on the other produces, as a whole, a kind of hidden centre while negotiation the Romanian relationship to time and place, state and nationalism, communism and community, the rural and the capital with a neurotic, hallucinatory fervor that itself seems an exhalation of all of these anxieties. First appearing in Romania under the name Visul (\\"The Dream\\") in 1989 with Cartea Rom√¢neasca Publishing House, having been mangled by censors, it appeared in its full form as Nostalgia in 1993 under Humanitas. It was thereafter translated into French, German, Hungarian, Spanish and other languages, and was nominated for literary prizes across Europe. In 2005, the novel was translated to English by Julian Semilian and published by New Directions. While sharply distinct from the realist narrative mode typifying North American literature, it was received with rave reviews by critics across the United States. Plot The first section, which is itself the prologue describes the world of a pre-war Bucharest, as narrated by an aging, potentially dying, author while focusing on the improbable and explicitly impossible story of a homeless young man who serves as the stubborn center of progressively more absurd games of Russian Roulette which become progressively more peopled by the wealthy upper-crust of the capital. The second section brings alive a universe of children through a magical realist writing style that focuses upon a prepubescent messiah who has begun to lose his magical powers while working wonders for his young followers. Which has a famous scene that makes the reader feel voyeur into the world of Proust when the main character falls into \\"unbearable nostalgia\\" by virtue of a bright pink lighter. The third section is a bizarre exploration of gender boundaries and youthful angst narrated by a crestfallen young man who cross-dresses and goes down the road of suicide at the same time while overwhelmed by the memories of a highschool girlfriend. The final part of the main portion of this book is centered around Nana, a middle aged woman engaged in an affair with a college student, as well as her memories of being 12 years old, when she was visited by a mother and son pair of gigantic skeletons. The last portion of this novel focuses on a man who becomes obsessed with his car horn, the repercussions of which spiral far beyond his control. The last part of the central portion of the book Reception In the introduction, Andrei Codrescu, writer, critic, and National Public Radio host, described the English translation as an introduction to \\"a writer who has always had a place reserved for him in a constellation that includes the Brothers Grimm, E.

Symptoms  Symptoms of laurel wilt include wilted stems and leaves and dark streaking in the wood.Redbay Ambrosia Beetle-Laurel Wilt Pathogen: A Potential Major Problem for the Florida Avocado Industry Laurel wilt can spread in at least two ways: one is via the beetle's natural reproduction and migration. A second way is through the sale and transport of beetle-infested wood, a result of redbay's use as firewood and for outdoor grilling. http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/00000000/opmp/Redbay%20Laurel%20Wilt%20Recovery%20Plan%20January%202015.pdf  History  Laurel wilt has been found in South Carolina, North Carolina,Map - Current known distribution of Laurel Wilt in North Carolina Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. But its appearance is most notable in Florida, where it has reached as far south as Miami-Dade County and as far west as Bay County.USDA Forest Service, Forest Health Protection, Southern Unit: Laurel Wilt Distribution Map The redbay ambrosia beetle was detected in Savannah, Georgia's Port Wentworth area in spring 2002; however, it is likely to have been established in the area prior to 2002 when the three adult specimens were trapped at the port. The beetle likely entered the country in solid wood packing material with cargo that was imported at Port Wentworth. Redbay trees began dying in Georgia and South Carolina near the Savannah area in 2003. By early 2005, officials with the Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC), South Carolina Forestry Commission (SCFC), and USDA Forest Service began to suspect the newly discovered ambrosia beetle was associated with this mortality.Georgia Forestry Commission, Laurel WIlt Disease Associated With Redbay Ambrosia Beetle. April, 2009. June, 2009. Consequences The redbay (Persea borbonia), a tree particularly abundant in maritime forests of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida, has been the primary species affected by the wilt. Sassafras, a less common tree in the coastal plains of the Southeast but with a more extensive range than redbay, has also been affected by the disease but to a lesser extent than redbay. The wilt fungus has also been isolated from dead and dying pondspice (Litsea aestivalis) and pondberry (Lindera melissaefolia), however the redbay ambrosia beetle has not been found in either of these species.

Another conceptualization describes it in psychodrama as \\"the representation of absentees, individuals, delusions, symbols, ideals, animals, and objects\\" that make the protagonist's world real and tangible.  Technique  As role-playing can include more than one protagonist, each may be operating in the role of auxiliary ego to each other as the exploration of each role changes with the entrance of new situations. The director of the role-play, often a teacher or counselor, can also be an auxiliary and typically is when clients are in the position of protagonist. It is also noted that the role of the auxiliary ego is crucial because in the course of the role-playing, its behavior provokes the protagonist into a deeper involvement in the drama. Auxiliary ego is also used as a technique in psychotherapy, offering a way to treat personal and interpersonal problems at the same time. It creates a triangular neurosis, which involves interpersonal disturbance between three persons so that the patient can get started in identifying the psychological level he is most spontaneous. Here, a person takes on the role of another person and act as if he is this person in therapeutic session. In the process, a protagonist's life (past, present, future) can be recreated with others in the group assuming roles that complete the psychodrama. Members of the group do not necessarily need training and participate out of their desire to help.  Children  For infants, the auxiliary ego is ideally provided by the mother (also called instinctive auxiliary ego), who is often able to anticipate his needs and to consolidate his gains in his development. There are also psychoanalysts who hold that caregivers can provide infants with auxiliary ego since this said to enhance their ability to survive. The idea is that it contributes in the ego's experience, helping shape the child's psychic organization and achieve the optimal psychic development.

Research Within the study of grammar in the Generative linguistics approach, Choueiri's research interests follow three lines of inquiry: # the application of formal grammars to the study of human language, # the comparative syntax of Semitic languages, and # the status of the syntactic component of the grammar with respect to the other components (i.e. phonological and semantic). The empirical domain of her research revolves around the notion of 'displacement' and the relationship between pronouns and their antecedents in constructions like questions and relative clauses.

Simpson received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Chicago, and did post-doctoral work at Dartmouth College. Simpson was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and taught and researched meteorology at numerous universities as well as the federal government. Simpson contributed to many areas of the atmospheric sciences, particularly in the field of tropical meteorology. She has researched hot towers, hurricanes, the trade winds, air-sea interactions, and helped develop the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Academia Her teaching and research career at universities includes time at the University of Chicago, New York University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, UCLA, the Environmental Satellite Services Administration (ESSA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), University of Virginia, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Research In 1958 Malkus collaborated with Herbert Riehl and calculated the average moist static energy and how it varied vertically throughout the atmosphere. They noted that at altitudes up to approximately 750 hPa the moist static energy decreased with height. Above 750 hPa, the moist static energy increased with height which had neither been observed or explained before. Riehl and Malkus realized that this must be due to moist convection that started near the surface that continued rising relatively adiabatically to near . They called these clouds \\"undiluted chimneys\\" but they would later be commonly referred to as hot towers. They estimated that it would take less than 5,000 of these towers daily throughout the tropics to result in the moist static energy profile they observed. By 1966 she became the director of Project Stormfury while chief of the Experimental Meteorology Branch of the Environment Satellite Services Administration's Institute for Atmospheric Sciences. She eventually became NASA's lead weather researcher and authored or co-authored over 190 articles.

It is the southernmost building which remains of the Inca Empire. As such it is an important landmark on what is known as \\"The Chilean Inca Trail\\", and has been declared a National Monument by the Chilean government.  History Qullasuyu, Inca suyu where the pukara was located. There are three main historical periods during which the site was occupied: *Between the years 1380 and 1450 A.D., the hill was apparently occupied by local promaucaes or picunches during their resistance to the Inca invasion. *Most of the structures and remains of the hill date to the Inca occupation, namely between the years 1430 and 1450 A.D, approximately. *Once again the local indigenous population occupied the fortress during their resistance to the Spanish conquest. The evidence of this event is its documentation in Spanish chronicles which later guided archeologists there, allowing them to rediscover the Pukara only a few decades ago.  Architecture = Description = The remains of the pukara consist of the bases of 7 circular structures, a major construction and other nearby buildings that may have been observation posts. In addition, the flat summit of the hill is surrounded by defensive perimeter walls. = Current situation = Pukara La Compa√±ia was declared a Chile National Monument by Decree No. 1191, dated 11 March 1992. Nonetheless, the site lacks suitable access for tourists, and is neither maintained nor adequately protected by the authorities. This lack of respect for the archaeological heritage of the pukara is the evident in the installation of a large antenna of cellular telephony on the summit of the hill. The installation of this antenna, carried out in 1997, consisted of building an access road and movement of earth, which destroyed of one of the defensive walls. As of 2012, O‚ÄôHiggins Tours had enlisted the skills of graphic designer Eduardo Galdames for an archaeologically-based digital reconstruction of the site. The project is ongoing, will be for educational purposes and was partially funded by the Chilean government.

Since then, BIBM has extended its scope to include providing Masters in Bank Management (MBM) and Evening MBM (EMBM) degrees, carrying out research in banking and finance, holding seminars and round table discussions, and aiding financial institutions in their recruitment. Even with these activities, which are somewhat complementary with one another, training still occupies the centre- stage of BIBM operation. But BIBM now imparts training to only mid-level and senior officials of banks and financial institutions and generally in areas where all its members have common interest.

Premier League The league was originally supposed to begin in autumn of 2006, but wrangles between two factions led to a parallel league situation. One of them, the Kenyan Premier League, had only seven teams, but were backed by FIFA. Remaining teams formed the KFFPL, supported by the Kenyan government. Teams affiliated to KPL were private clubs and company teams, such as Tusker, and teams owned by non- governmental organizations, like sister clubs Mathare United and Mathare Youth, while teams affiliated to KFFPL were traditional community clubs like Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards and Shabana Kisii, or teams belonging to government-owned organizations. However, in March 2007, the two leagues were finally united into an 18-team league, though two teams, Mumias Sugar and Kangemi United, disbanded halfway through. The two relegated teams, A.F.C. Leopards and Shabana Kisii were not readmitted, although there were some calls for a larger 20-team league. This was in light of the equally controversial inclusion of Gor Mahia who had been expelled mid-season from the league in the previous season, and Mathare United, which had been relegated for fielding an ineligible player in ten matches. The season finished in November 2007 with Tusker as the champions and Homegrown and Coast Stars relegated.Daily Nation, November 22, 2007: Mahakama survive relegation in league Bandari and Western Stima gained promotion for the following season.Daily Nation, November 18, 2007: Brilliant brewers clinch crownKenyafootball, Dec 18, 2007: Panpaper lose out to Western Stima in promo battle Coast Stars appealed against the relegation to their financier Mohamed Hatimy, who also doubled up as the chairman of Kenya Football Federation.

The mount name appears as Banu-l-Qatil in the work of Muslim geographer Al-Idrisi in the 12th century, but it is possible that this is an error of transcription (Arab names like \\"beni\\" are abundant on the peninsula; the name means \\"family tree\\") because it does not make a lot of sense in Arabic (it would be \\"the family of the murderer\\"). Compared with other names in Valencian Community, the mount name is more likely to be derived from the word \\"benna\\", Arabic transcription of \\"pinna\\", which is \\"rock\\" in Latin; combined with the adjective \\"laqanti\\", which comes from \\"Laqant,\\" the Arabic name of the city. Therefore, we obtain a half Roman, half Arabic toponym, \\"Benna Laqanti\\".Paul GUICHARD, \\"Un toponyme historique de l'ancienne Kura de Tudmir: Benicadell\\", Mvrgetana, Murcia, ed.

He was professor of Landscape Engineering at the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, where he was responsible for establishing Syracuse University's lacrosse program. Cox later became the President of New England College. Early life Born in Londonderry, Nova Scotia, Canada, Cox attended high school at Bellows Falls High School in Vermont. Following high school he returned to Canada, attending Acadia University where he would receive a degree in 1903. Cox then attended Harvard University where he graduated magna cum laude in 1908 with a Landscape Architecture degree. While at Harvard, Cox played lacrosse, basketball and ice hockey. On September 7, 1910, Cox married Gretchen Smith. Career=Landscape architecture= Cox was one of the leading landscape architects in the United States. Following his studies at Harvard, Cox worked for four years with the Los Angeles Parks Department. While working there, he designed the exterior landscapes of both the Lincoln Park and Griffith Park, and called for the creation of a city parkway that would \\"add to the health and happiness of its citizens.\\" His plan was only partially implemented. With funding from John D. Rockefeller, in 1915 Cox performed the first census of trees in New York City. In his report, A Street Tree System for New York City, Borough of Manhattan, Cox found that most street trees in Manhattan to be in poor condition. One of his recommendations was to plant 200 trees per square mile on the island. Cox advocated for a new kind of park in the US National Park system that balanced the desire for recreation and preservation. In 1934, Cox surveyed Vermont's Green Mountains with the intent of creating a national park in the state. Cox's vision of a Green Mountain Parkway (later Green Mountain National Forest) included moving parts of Vermont's Long Trail to allow the trail and the park intersect. Cox's vision also included a concept of a \\"skyline drive\\". Revolutionary at the time, Cox recognized the changing American culture and the automobile and included many \\"windshield\\" views throughout the park length. In 1929, the Administration Building at Green Lakes State Park, near Fayetteville, New York, was built according to plans by Cox, who was active in the design of several New York state parks. =Academic= In 1915, Cox was appointed an associate professor of Landscape Engineering at the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. He served a Head of the Department from 1915 to 1947, during his entire tenure at Syracuse. After leaving Syracuse University, Cox served as President of New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire from 1947-1950 and then again from 1952-1955. He was also a Fellow of the American Institute of Parks and an executive and a life member of the Board of Directors of the National Conference on State Parks. Lacrosse Outside of academics and landscape architecture, Cox is recognized as one of the greatest contributors to the game of lacrosse in the United States. His impact on the sport was dramatic, both locally in upstate New York, and nationally. Founding one of the most recognized collegiate programs in the country, Cox was dedicated to the integrity and growth of the game. Known for his excellent stick handling as a player, Cox was able to play any position on the field. Once Cox was established as a professor at Syracuse University, he recruited forestry students to start a lacrosse team at the school in the spring of 1916.http://photos.syracuse.com/post- standard/2011/07/suny_esf_celebrates_100_years_3.html Later that fall, the University recognized lacrosse as a \\"minor sport.\\"Fisher, p. 81 Cox served as head coach of the Syracuse lacrosse team until 1932.Fisher, p. 135 Cox thought of field lacrosse as a gentleman's game that could rise to prominence among collegiate sports. His advocacy of the game lead some to refer to him as the \\"father of American lacrosse.\\" The sport grew quickly in intercollegiate ranks shifting the game from a primarily Canadian game to one that garnered elite amateur status among affluent Americans. As a matter of principle and respect for the amateur tradition of the game, Cox accepted no salary for his coaching responsibilities.Fisher, p. 127 Cox viewed the introduction and spread of box lacrosse with negativity. He abhorred the commercialism of the new version, and thought it was a \\"peculiar\\" hybrid sport. His insistence, and the respect he garnered from fellow coaches and contributors, kept the field game the prevalent version played in America.Fisher, p. 100Fisher, p. 161-164 In 1922, Cox organized an \\"All-American\\" team to travel to Europe to play against British teams. This trip was deemed successful, and a return trip in 1923 was scheduled. Cox envisioned an informal international championship. He would go on to coach the American teams in International competitions in 1930, 1935, and 1937. Cox's \\"All-American\\" team consisted mostly of Syracuse players, earning Cox some criticism.Fisher, pp. 142-143 Cox, along with William C. Schmeisser and Charles Lattig, helped develop the uniform code of operation for college lacrosse and established early lacrosse athletic conferences. From 1922 to 1933, when the first lacrosse All-American committee was established (which Cox would serve as Chairman), he would select the honorees and even designed and furnished the certificates to the players. Later, when he became president of the New England College, he would start a lacrosse program there and served as the head coach. Cox was elected to the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame in its inaugural class in 1957. In 1966, the New England College elected Cox into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame.

According to Corry Guttstadt, a \\"crucial factor\\" behind the events was the 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law passed by the Turkish Assembly on 14 June 1934.  History  Members of the nationalist and antisemitic community brought to trial in 1944. Prominent members of the community were: Cevat Rƒ±fat Atilhan, Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z, Nejdet San√ßar, Mehmet Emin Yurdakul, Emin Cemal Suda, Halil Sezai Erkut and Cahit Sƒ±tkƒ± Tarancƒ±. The pogroms occurred in Tekirdaƒü, Edirne, Kƒ±rklareli, and √áanakkale, and were motivated by anti-Semitism. Some have argued the acts were initiated by the articles produced by Pan-Turkist ideologists like Cevat Rƒ±fat Atilhan and Faik Kurdoƒülu in Mill√Æ ƒ∞nkƒ±l√¢p Rifat Bali, 1934 Trakya Olaylarƒ±, 2008 (National Revolution) magazine and Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z in Orhun magazine. It was followed by vandalizing of Jewish houses and shops. The tensions started in June 1934 and spread to a few other villages in Eastern Thrace region and to some small cities in Western Aegean region. At the height of violent events, it was rumoured that a rabbi was stripped naked and was dragged through the streets shamefully while his daughter was raped. Over 15,000 Jews had to flee from the region. The government of Mustafa Kemal failed to stop the pogrom.AGE OF TERROR UNDERMINING TURKISH JEWS By HENRY KAMM and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES SEPT. 10, 1986 In the context of the 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law, foreign diplomats of the time saw the government as implicitly supporting the Thrace pogrom in order to facilitate the relocation of the Jewish population. Haaretz reports that according to the historian Corry Guttstadt, ‚Äúthe Turkish authorities had apparently opted for the strategy of putting the Jews under such pressure with boycott activities and anonymous threats ‚Äòfrom the population‚Äô that they would leave the area ‚Äòvoluntarily.‚Äô‚Äù Further, according to historian Rifat Bali that the incitement against Jews was common in the press at the time and this contributed to the violence.

When they eventually started to sell parts of Liding√∂ in 1774, the farm was bought by the auditor Johan Falkson who earlier had leased the farm from the Ban√©rs. In 1920, Hersbyholm was bought by the farmer Karl Lindbom (1787-1849), one of the first men who had gotten the epithet \\"King of Liding√∂\\". The country state was rebuilt by the then \\"King of Liding√∂\\" Jan Zetterberg (1810-1878) who also named the farm Hersbyholm. The farm was inherited by his children, while the agriculture region was rented out. Great areas of the land were sold out in the early 19th century to AB Liding√∂ Villastad which were divided and sold it as plots of land. Hersbyholm was bought by Carl von Heidenstam in 1921, and was nine years later bought by the artist Einar Nerman (1888-1983).

Ladi Kwali was born in the village of Kwali in the Gwari region of Northern Nigeria, where pottery was an indigenous female tradition. She learned to make pottery as a child by her aunt using the traditional method of coiling. She made large pots for use as water jars, cooking pots, bowls, and flasks from coils of clay, beaten from the inside with a flat wooden paddle. They were decorated with incised geometric and stylised figurative patterns, including scorpions, lizards, crocodiles, chameleons, snakes, birds, and fish. She would impress patterns on top of the figures by rolling small roulettes of twisted string or notched wood over the surface of the clay, sometimes as horizontal banding and sometimes in vertical panels. The wooden roulettes consisted of small cylinders of hard wood, two or three inches long and a half-inch in diameter, notched with straight, oblique, or parallel patterns. The earthenware vessels and decorative techniques have been dated back to neolithic period. Following the region's traditional method, they were fired in a bonfire of dry vegetation. Her pots were noted for their beauty of form and decoration, and she was recognised regionally as a gifted and eminent potter. Several were acquired by the Emir of Abuja, Alhaji Suleiman Barau, in whose home they were seen by Michael Cardew in 1950.  Early life  She was born in the small village of Kwali, present Kwali Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, in 1925 (Other historians indicate her date of birth is actually 1920). She grew up in a family that kept up with the folkloric female tradition of pottery making. Mallam Mekaniki Kyebese, Ladi Kwali's younger brother, stated: ‚Äúeven in the early years of pottery making, Ladi Kwali excelled in the crafts and her wares were often sold even before they were taken to the markets‚Äù. During her first professional years, the traditional cultural environment moved her to produced pottery pieces that were influenced by the Gbagyi tradition and accentuated with personal idioms. Her approach to clay was echoed by mathematical undertones, made visible by the continuous display of symmetry. Hand-built pot by Ladi Kwali with incised figures; W.A. Ismay Studio Ceramics Collection, York Art Gallery  Career  Michael Cardew, who was appointed to the post of Pottery Officer in the Department of Commerce and Industry in the colonial Nigerian Government in 1951, established the Pottery Training Centre in Suleja (then called \\"Abuja\\") in April 1952. In 1954, Ladi Kwali joined the Abuja Pottery as its first female potter. There, she learned wheel throwing, glazing, kiln firing, production of saggars, and the use of slip, eventually assuming the role of instructor. She made bowls with sgraffito decoration, which involved dipping vessels in red or white slip and then scratching the decoration through the slip to the underlying body, using a porcupine quill. By the time Cardew left his post in 1965, the Centre had attracted four additional women from Gwari: Halima Audu, Lami Toto, Assibi Iddo, and Kande Ushafa. These women worked together in one of the workshops, which they called Dakin Gwari (the Gwari room), to hand-build large water pots. They would shape and scrape the insides of the pots with the shell of a snail, a hard seed pod or a calabash rind. Then, they adapted their traditional incised designs, by inlaying them with a white kaolin and feldspar slip, which would gravitate into the depressed decorations. After these pots were fired with a translucent celadon glaze, the areas with slip would appear pale green in contrast with the dark green or iron red stoneware body of the vessels. Because the hand-built, ornately decorated pots were glazed and fired in a high-temperature kiln, they represent an interesting hybrid of traditional Gwari and western studio pottery.Ladi Kwali ‚Äì http://www.studiopottery.com/cgi-bin/mp.cgi?item=251 The quintessential Ladi Kwali pot was coiled in a stoneware clay, decorated with lizard patterns and fired with a dark shiny glaze. For Western viewers and collectors, the dark glaze was a metaphor for the pots' \\"Africanness.\\" From her cultural tradition, where females were primarily responsible for pottery, Ladi Kwali's ceramics became \\"art objects\\". Ladi Kwali's pots were featured in international exhibitions of Abuja pottery in 1958, 1959, and 1962, organised by Cardew. In 1961, Kwali gave demonstrations at the Royal College, Farnham, and Wenford Bridge in Great Britain. She also gave demonstrations in France and Germany over this period. In 1972, she toured America with Cardew. Her work was shown to great acclaim in London at the Berkeley Galleries. The Abuja Pottery was renamed the Ladi Kwali Pottery in the early 1980s.  Awards and achievements  Kwali was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 1962. In 1977, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. In 1980, the Nigerian Government (from the Cabinet Office of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) invested on her with the insignia of the Nigerian National Order of Merit Award (NNOM),\\"Nigerian National Order Of Merit Award\\", Frontiers News, 5 December 2013. the highest national honour for academic achievement. She also received the national honour of the Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) in 1981. Her picture appears at the back of the Nigerian N20 Naira bill.

History  The first station on the site was opened on 11 August 1862 by the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway, and was named Clarkston. It was renamed Clarkston (Lanarks) on 8 June 1953 by British Railways, who closed it on 9 January 1956. In 2005, the Scottish Executive announced that the closed section of line between the 1989 Drumgelloch station and would be rebuilt as a double-tracked electrified railway termed the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link. This resulted in the closure of the 1989 Drumgelloch station to be replaced by the new station 550m to the east on the site of the former Clarkston station. When the 1989 station opened, although in the Clarkston area, it took the name Drumgelloch to avoid confusion with the station on the East Kilbride Line. It connects the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line at Bathgate to the North Clyde Line at Airdrie and opens up a fourth rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Since 1990 Lenz has painted portraits of Americans. Lenz won the grand prize in the 2006 inaugural Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition organized by the National Portrait Gallery. Lenz's winning entry was entitled Sam and the Perfect World. Sam and the Perfect World, David Lenz, 2005, oil on linen, 44\\" x 46\\". Collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum Biography The grandson of painter Nic Lenz, and the son of an art dealer, Lenz received a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee in 1985. In the spring of 1989, after four years in publishing and advertising as an art director, Lenz left commercial art to become a full-time fine artist. At first he painted landscapes based on his travels to northern Wisconsin and Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada. These early paintings were influenced greatly by Tom Uttech, a professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, and by the luminous light quality of Hudson River School artists Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Church, and Sanford Gifford.Hayes, Jeffery R. David M. Lenz: Urban and Rural Paintings of Wisconsin. Charles Allis Art Museum, Milwaukee, 2004 p. 7 After moving to the east side of Milwaukee, Lenz began to paint the neighborhoods and people of the central city. The city's children, mostly African-American, very quickly became the focus of his paintings. In these works, completed between about 1990 to 2000, the hope and vitality of the children's faces contrasts starkly with the worn down reused sidewalks, streets, and houses of the central city. In 1999, Lenz embarked on a series of paintings depicting the lives of Wisconsin dairy farmers Ervin and Mercedes Wagner. The never-ending work of dairy farming, the toll it takes on the body, and the cultural isolation of rural life are themes of this series. Between 2000 and 2005 Lenz almost exclusively painted pictures of the Wagners and their farm. This series has been exhibited extensively in regional museums throughout the Midwest. Thistles, completed in 2001, is perhaps the most widely reproduced and celebrated painting of the Wagner Farm series. The third area of interest for the artist, paintings depicting the lives of people with intellectual disabilities, was inspired by the birth of his son Sam, who was born with Down syndrome. Lenz contemplated the series for eight years until, in the summer of 2005, he entered the first major painting of the series in the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The work From a short distance Lenz's paintings appear to be strikingly realistic, even to be photographs perhaps, upon closer inspection however, they are seen to be made up of thousands of brushstrokes. Lenz starts a new painting by initially working out ideas in small pencil ‚Äúthumbnail‚Äù drawings. The artist then photographs all the various elements of the image individually. These are used as the main reference material for the final painting. For a major work, he also completes an extensive array of color sketches. After the composition is fully developed, the image is drawn out carefully with pencil on a stretched canvas or board. Lenz's painting technique is quite traditional; straight oil paint is applied using small round sable brushes over a primed and warmly tinted linen canvas. Lenz's subjects are people who society has taken for granted, forgotten, or overlooked. These unsung people are portrayed in an empathic way, and the extensive landscape surrounding the subjects tells much about their lives and the community beyond. Lenz incorporates various elements as metaphors to deepen the meaning of what, on the face of it, looks very straightforward and naturalistic.Hayes, 2004 p. 9. Sometimes Lenz takes dramatic liberties with reality, and the use of metaphors occasionally drives the scene decidedly toward the surreal.Schumacher, Mary Louise A different Lenz; Son forces local artist to see the 'perfect' world with new eyes Milwaukee Journal Sentinel July 18, 2006 Lenz seems to have no interest in art world trends. He paints people and places in which he feels a direct connection. One reoccurring theme in Lenz's work is that life's limits can be transcended with perseverance, personal heroism, and divine oversight.Seed, John David Lenz: The Egalitarian Realist The Huffington Post November 16, 2012 In ‚ÄúSam and the Perfect World,‚Äù the lush and idealistic rolling hills of Wisconsin are a metaphor for a modern civil society that values perfection. Humankind has transformed the landscape for their own use, altering this Garden of Eden, and erected a barbed wire fence; poignantly separating Sam for the rest of the world. A halo around the sun is said to represent a deity looking down upon the handwork of humankind. Without idealization or sentimentality Lenz portrays his son with an enigmatic and endearing expression, his red shirt and Oshkosh overalls giving us clues that he is like any other boy, and yet he is not. ‚ÄúNevertheless,‚Äù the artist says, Sam has ‚Äúsomething very important to say.‚ÄùMoss, Dorothy ‚ÄúHere's What It Takes To Win the Smithsonian's Boochever Portrait Competition. Smithsonian.com, November 21, 2014 Lenz is influenced by the isolated figures of Edward Hopper, the regionalist sensibility of Grant Wood, and by the symbolic meaning infused in the people and objects of Andrew Wyeth.Hayes, 2004 pp. 8-14. The Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition first place award also entitled Lenz to paint a portrait of a remarkable American for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery's permanent collection. On May 9, 2009, the Gallery unveiled Lenz's historic portrait of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the first portrait the Gallery has ever commissioned of an individual who had not been a U.S. President or First Lady. The portrait depicts Mrs. Shriver with four Special Olympics athletes and one Best Buddies participant on the beach near her Cape Cod home. In the painting from left to right are Airika Straka (Special Olympics Wisconsin), Katie Meade (Best Buddies Iowa), Andy Leonard (Special Olympics Ohio), Loretta Claiborne (Special Olympics Pennsylvania), Mrs. Shriver, and Marty Sheets (Special Olympics North Carolina).Dell, Carole Honoring a Lifetime of Advocacy: National Portrait Gallery unveils Eunice Kennedy Shriver portrait Potomac Almanac, May 20, 2009 In 2010, his commission \\"Wishes in the Wind\\", depicting three disadvantaged Milwaukee children blowing soap bubbles, was hung in the Wisconsin Governor's Mansion.

Built in the early 15th century, it was used as a farmhouse by about 1600, passing through various owners and sometimes being used for other purposes. Since 1929 it has been in commercial use‚Äîfirstly as a tearoom, then as a bank, and since 1994 as a public house. When built, it was one of at least five similar hall-houses in the ancient parish of Crawley; it is now one of the oldest and best-preserved buildings in Crawley town centre. History The most important industries in the early history of Crawley were farming and iron smelting. The latter had taken place since the Iron Age in northern Sussex, where iron ore, lime and wood (for charcoal) were readily available. By the 15th century, the industry had declined to some extent but was still locally significant. Although there is no direct structural evidence, a building used in the industry may have occupied the site before the present structure; slag remnants have been unearthed on the land outside it. Furthermore, the site is very close to the ancient junction of the east‚Äìwest and northeast‚Äìsouthwest trackways and rudimentary roads which ran between the main furnaces and forges in the area, at places such as Ifield and Bewbush. These ancient tracks were superseded by the High Street, on a north‚Äìsouth alignment, after the Norman Conquest in the 11th century. The present building is known to date from the early to mid-15th century. Little is known about its earliest history‚Äîfor example, its name was not recorded until the mid-16th century. Its original layout is believed to have consisted of four bays under a single roof of straw, with the centre bays laid out as an open hall and the outer pair each having a staircase leading to first-floor level. The upper floor was jettied, giving an overhanging appearance. A timber skeleton would have been surrounded by walls of wattle and daub containing plenty of clay, which is the main component of the soil in the Crawley area. All of these characteristics were typical of \\"Wealden\\" houses‚Äîa mediaeval style whose name reflects their prevalence in the Weald, the area of southeast England in which Crawley is situated. A fifth bay, with a crown post roof, was added at the north end in the early 16th century. The building originally occupied , but its landholding gradually expanded as the owners acquired more land in Crawley, Ifield and Worth parishes. By 1600, several barns and similar buildings‚Äîall with thatched roofs‚Äîsurrounded it, and the property had become a farm called Bristows Meads, nominally owned by a member of the wealthy Stydolf family from Headley in neighbouring Surrey. Ownership and tenancy was very complex at that time, however, and the Stydolf family did not occupy it. Instead it was let to various occupants. By the 1670s, a farmer called John Wybourne occupied Bristows Meads (also known as Bristow Meads by this time). He expanded the farm by renting more land, and one field later became known as Wybourne Field. The property passed out of Stydolf ownership in the early 18th century, and entered local ownership for the first time in 1785 when an Ifield family acquired it. Soon after this, John Mitchell took up the tenancy, stayed for several decades and became an important part of Crawley life in his role as a tax officer. By the early 19th century the property had become known as Mitchells Farm, superseding its previous name. The variants \\"The Mychells\\" and \\"Mychells Farm\\" were also known. North end, showing the early-20th century chimney In the late 19th century, the building was divided into two houses, and was sometimes described as \\"The Old Houses\\" in commercial postcards. One of these houses was opened up to form a shop by its tenants. Meanwhile, the landholding had risen to throughout Crawley and Worth parishes, and the farm was at one point the largest dairy farm in the area. The condition of the main building deteriorated in the early 20th century as it passed through more owners. In 1929, a Mrs E. Messer and her husband bought the two houses in quick succession, and also acquired the farmyard, barns and associated buildings. They converted the main building into a single entity again, and oversaw a wide-ranging restoration which brought much of the old timber-framing into view again. Urgent structural repairs were carried out as well. Later in 1929, the Messers sold the building to a Captain L. Young, who applied to change its function from residential to commercial use. Significant work was undertaken to alter the building and its surroundings to create a tearoom with a rural ambience. The interior was opened out, a single entrance door was created, the old barns and outbuildings were either removed or integrated with the main building, and of ornamental gardens were planted. The large chimney breast which now dominates the north face of the building was also added as part of these alterations, which took place in 1930. During that year, it reopened as \\"Ye Olde Punch Bowle\\" tearoom. The tearoom had a short life but was successful and popular, especially during the Second World War when it doubled as a military mess, dance-hall and YMCA meeting place. It was sold for ¬£2,500 in 1952 to National Provincial Bank, who refurbished it and converted it into a bank branch. The alterations were sympathetic to the building's style: wood from an ancient demolished church at Treyford near Midhurst was used for internal fittings, and the entrance doorway and an extension at the rear were built of local stone. The extension, a large single-storey office, was built in 1963 and looked out over the remaining section of what used to be the tearoom's gardens and ponds. The bank attempted to maintain the character and ambience of the building by filling the rooms with rare antiques; staff often had to rebuff tourists who wanted to buy them. National Provincial Bank and Westminster Bank merged in the 1960s to form National Westminster Bank, and the branch was renamed accordingly. Although a larger branch was opened a short distance away on The Boulevard, the original branch stayed open until 1992. The freehold of the property was then bought by Greene King Brewery, who converted it into a public house and reinstated the name \\"The Old Punch Bowl\\". Internal and external alterations were made, including the removal of the bank's stone-built extension; this was replaced by outside seating and a patio area. The Old Punch Bowl was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 21 June 1948; this defines it as a \\"particularly important building of more than special interest\\" and of national importance. It is one of twelve Grade II* structures, and 100 listed buildings of all grades, in the Borough of Crawley. Architecture The building was originally a four-bay hall-house. The Old Punch Bowl is considered a \\"good example\\" of a Wealden hall house; and Viscountess Wolseley's 1930s review of the historic houses of Sussex identified it as one of the county's two publicly accessible (rather than privately owned) mediaeval hall-houses, along with Alfriston Clergy House. It has therefore been the subject of several architectural studies. As originally built, the structure was a partly open-plan hall-house with four bays. The bays at the north and south ends had joists to support exterior jettying, which originally extended about over the floor below. The overhang was lessened by later building work. A fifth bay was added at the north end before 1550. This has a different roof profile and more prominent jettying, and may even have been a separate building at first. The recessed central bays forming the main hall are still intact and clearly visible. The roof is now tiled, although Horsham stone was used previously and straw may have been used in the building's early history. It is hipped on the south side and gabled at the north, behind the modern chimney. The internal roof structure uses crown posts and queen posts throughout, with a mixture of flat and arched tie-beams. Except in the south bay, all of the internal timbers are original, albeit with some reconditioning, and the 20th-century work uncovered them for the first time in many years. The windows are small and, on the upper floor, are just under the eaves. Two have 16th-century mullions, and one in the west face still has triangular holes in which metal bars were mounted to provide some security before window-glass became common. Hall-houses predated the invention of chimneys, and a wattle-and-daub smoke hood was used until the first chimney was added to the central bay in around 1600. This has been described as a \\"fine example of a [late] Tudor chimney\\".

Models Contrary to industry convention, each model's \\"number\\" does not refer to the engine capacity. Instead, each bike in the F-series range uses essentially the same engine, but with different power outputs and equipment levels. The parallel-twin engine was first used in the F800S, and is also used in the F800GT, F800R and F800ST, although these bikes are tuned to deliver peak power at a different RPM from the GS models. The GS models have longer suspension travel, needed for offroad use. The F650GS name causes further confusion as it was previously used for a BMW bike fitted with a single-cylinder Rotax engine. It was produced from 2000‚Äì2007, then relaunched in 2009 as the G650GS, fitted with a Chinese-assembled engine of the same 652 cc capacity. Although all bikes use the same basic engine, the F800 produces , which is more power than the F700 and more than the discontinued F650. Engines on both the F800 and F700 can be modified to deliver a reduced power output of for European riders on restricted Category A2 licences. The F800 and F700 are fitted with twin brake discs on the front while the F650 was fitted with one disc. Both bikes had anti-lock brakes (ABS), which were optional on the F800 before 2013 models and all years of the F650. Previously, only the F650 had the option of lowered suspension, which was not available on F800 models up to 2012. From 2013, both the F800 and F700 can be specified with a low seat and/or lowered suspension, the combination of which reduces seat height to (F800) or (F700), and makes the bikes suitable for shorter riders.

Plot summary Twenty-one-year-old Lucilla Finch, the independently wealthy daughter of the rector of Dimchurch, Sussex, has been blind since infancy. Shortly after the narrator, Madame Pratolungo, arrives to serve as her paid companion, Lucilla falls in love with Oscar Dubourg, her shy and reclusive neighbour, also wealthy, who devotes himself to craftsmanship in precious metals. After being attacked and knocked unconscious by robbers, Oscar is nursed by Lucilla and falls in love with her, and the couple become engaged. Their plans are jeopardized by Oscar's epilepsy, a result of the blow to his head. The only effective treatment, a silver compound, has the side- effect of turning his skin a permanent, dark blue-grey. Despite her blindness, Lucilla suffers a violent phobia of dark colours, including dark-complexioned people, and family and friends conceal Oscar's condition from her. Meanwhile, Oscar's twin brother, Nugent, returns from America, where he has dissipated his fortune pursuing a career as a painter. Oscar is devoted to his brother, who is as outgoing, confident and charming as Oscar is diffident and awkward. Knowing of Lucilla's blindness, Nugent has arranged for her to be examined by a famous German oculist, Herr Grosse. Herr Grosse and an English oculist each examine Lucilla but disagree on her prognosis. Lucilla elects to be operated on by Herr Grosse, who believes he can cure her. After the operation, but before the bandages are taken off, Madame Pratolungo pressures Oscar into telling Lucilla of his disfigurement, but his nerve fails and, instead, he tells her it is Nugent who has been disfigured. Nugent is secretly infatuated with Lucilla and now manipulates her into believing that he is Oscar. As Lucilla gradually regains her sight, Herr Grosse forbids family and friends from undeceiving her, since the shock might imperil her recovery. Oscar goes abroad, resigning his fianc√©e to his brother in despair. Madame Pratolungo intervenes decisively with Nugent, appealing to his conscience and threatening him with exposure if he continues with his plan to marry Lucilla under Oscar's name. He promises to go abroad to find his brother and return him home. Nugent soon returns to England and tracks Lucilla to the seaside, where, on Herr Grosse's orders, she is staying with her aunt, away from her immediate family. He pressures her to marry as soon as possible, without her family's knowledge, and works to poison her trust in Madame Pratolungo, who is away in Marseilles attending to her wayward father. Detecting but not understanding the change in her supposed fianc√©, Lucilla becomes distraught, over-strains her eyes and begins to lose her vision. In the novel's denouement, Madame Pratolungo locates Oscar with the help of a French detective. His experiences have revealed an unexpected strength of character, and she conceives a new respect for him. The two of them race home to England to stop the marriage while there is still time. Held virtually prisoner at a Dubourg cousin's house, Lucilla is again totally blind. With the help of a kindly servant, she escapes to meet them, immediately recognizes the true Oscar, and is told the full story by Madame Pratolungo. A penitent Nugent returns to America, where he later dies on a polar expedition. Lucilla and Oscar settle in Dimchurch to raise a family, with Madame Pratolungo as her companion. Perfectly content in her blindness, she refuses Herr Grosse's offers to attempt another operation.

Geismar (born July 15, 1931)Marquis Who's Who on the Web is an American graphic designer.  Biography  Thomas H. Geismar was born on July 15, 1931 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Geismar studied concurrently at the Rhode Island School of Design and Brown University. He received a master's degree in graphic design from Yale University, School of Art and Architecture. After school, he joined the army for two years. Geismar met Ivan Chermayeff in Yale and in 1957, they founded the firm Brownjohn, Chermayeff & Geismar (now Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv) along with Robert Brownjohn. Geismar has designed more than a hundred corporate identity programs and established abstract corporate symbols. The unifying element in his work is the repetition of symbols which gives new life to the form. In 1960, he proposed a radical mark for Chase Manhattan Bank which was the repetition of four shapes around a square to form an octagon. It was met with resistance but stood out from competition, leading other corporations to create abstracted corporate logos. His designs for Xerox, Chase Manhattan Bank, Best Products, Gemini Consulting, PBS, Univision, Rockefeller Center and, most notably, Mobil (1964) have received worldwide acclaim. Geismar has also had major responsibility for many of the firm's exhibition designs and world's fair pavilions. His projects include such major tourist attractions as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the Statue of Liberty Museum, the Truman Presidential Library, and the redesigned Star-Spangled Banner exhibition at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. He has received major awards in the field, including one of the first Presidential Design Awards for helping to establish a national system of standardized transportation symbols. Geismar was awarded the AIGA medal in 1979. In 1998, he was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was awarded the National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement along with Chermayeff and the School of Visual Arts‚Äô 26th Masters Series Award recipient.

It is often just called the Scapular of the Passion or simply the Red Scapular but it should not be confused with other similarly- termed scapulars described below.Hilgers, Joseph. \\"Scapular.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 Nov. 2014 The Red Scapular The Red Scapular of the Passion is a popularSt. Michael Online scapular and forms the uppermost portion of the Fivefold Scapular.Devotion to the Fivefold Scapular Fivefold Scapular Origin=Apolline Andriveau= Louise-Apolline Andriveau was born on 7 May 1810 in Saint-Pour√ßain-sur-Sioule (Allier) to Leonardo, and Apolline Grangie Andriveau. Her father was a notary who saw to it that she received a good education. The family moved to Paris when her father received a promotion. Upon the death of her mother, it was decided that she should complete her studies at the convent of Saint Elizabeth. In 1833, she joined the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and was sent to the convent in Troyes. She had a particular devotion to the Passion of Christ. In 1830 Catherine Labour√© had reported a vision of the Blessed Virgin, which she had experienced in the chapel of the motherhouse of the Daughters of Charity in Paris, which led to the development of the Miraculous Medal. Ten years later, in 1840, Sister Justine Bisqueyburu disclosed a vision of the Blessed Virgin she had purportedly experienced in the Daughters of Charity house in Blangy. This gave rise to the Green Scapular. Sister Apolline Andriveau Sister Apolline revealed that from 26 July 1846 to 14 September 1846 visions of Jesus and Mary appeared to the sister in her convent in Troyes, France and promised her that those who wear the scapular faithfully and contemplated the Passion of Jesus Christ would be granted a great increase of faith, hope and charity every Friday. The sister described her visions as extremely specific and vivid. In letters to her spiritual director she wrote that Christ's face was so pale \\"that it threw me into a cold sweat. Our Lord's Head was bent forward. I thought that the long thorns that encircled His sacred Brow had induced this painful posture.\\" She also described a scene reminiscent of the Piet√†: > One Sunday evening, I was making the Stations of the Cross...then at the > Thirteenth Station, it seemed to me that Our Blessed Lady placed the Body of > our Divine Lord in my arms, saying as she did so, \\"The world is drawing down > ruin upon itself because it never thinks of the Passion of Jesus Christ. Do > your utmost to bring it to meditate thereon, to bring about its salvation.\\" In describing a vision on the eve of the octave of the Feast of St. Vincent (July 26, 1846) the nun described Christ: > ...clad in a long red robe and blue mantle. Oh! Love of Jesus Christ, how > You filled my heart at that moment! Oh! How beautiful He was! It was no > longer the painful expression, the sorrowful face worn with suffering that I > had seen in Pilate's hall a few days before during Mass. It was beauty > itself! In his right Hand He held a scapular upon which was a crucifix > surrounded by those instruments of the Passion which caused His Sacred > Humanity to suffer most. I read around the crucifix: \\"Holy Passion of Our > Lord Jesus Christ, save us.\\" At the other end of the red woollen braid was a > picture of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the one surrounded with > thorns, the other pierced by a lance, and both surrounded by a cross. Sister Apolline described how she \\"shuddered\\" upon seeing Jesus \\"rudely struck against the wood of the cross\\" and quoted the Blessed Virgin Mary as saying that the \\"world is hurrying to its perdition because it considers not the Passion of Christ...Do all you can to bring and consider His sufferings. Do all you can to save the world.\\" According to the revelation claimed by Sister Apolline, to wear the blood-red scapular was to be \\"clad in the livery\\" of Christ's passion and that it \\"will prove to us a strong armor against infernal assaults, an impenetrable buckler against the arrows of our spiritual enemies and, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all who wear it with faith and piety it will be a pledge of pardon, a source of grace.\\" Sister Apolline also described a vision she received on the Feast of the Blessed Trinity in which she saw a beautiful river representing Christ's mercy in which those immersed glowed with bright light and \\"sheaves of diamonds and gold\\" while those refusing immersion \\"were covered with a dark vapor.\\" The redemptive theme of the apparitions and its promises regarding the wearing of a sacramental featuring the Immaculate Heart of Mary are similar to two other Marian apparitions that took place in France earlier that century: the Miraculous Medal apparitions of 1830 and the Green Scapular apparitions of 1840. Approval Sister Apolline's spiritual director, Father J. B. Etienne, made a trip to Rome the following year. The Holy See accepted the nun's claims with unusual alacrity and Blessed Pius IX sanctified and approved the use of this sacramental by a rescript on June 25, 1857. The pope granted various indulgences to the wearing of this scapular and granted to the Lazarists (priests of the Congregation of the Mission) the faculty of blessing the scapular and investing the faithful with it. The Superior-General of the Lazarists was allowed to communicate the faculty of blessing and investing the scapular to priests outside the Lazarist order and such a scapular can now be invested by any Catholic priest. Promotion In the United States of America, between 1953 and August 2008, the Red Scapular was officially promoted by the Marian Center operated by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (a branch of the same order to which Sister Appolline belonged).Gifts of Graces, , accessed 2 January 2012. Description The scapular and its bands must be made of red wool and unlike most scapulars it is adorned with specifically described images which are essential to it. One side of the scapular shows a crucifix, some of the Instruments of the Passion, and the words \\"Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ Save Us.\\" The other side depicts a small cross above the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary plus the words \\"Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, protect us.\\" In the example shown above right, a red segment representing the Precious Blood is placed below the two hearts, although other examples omit that non-essential element and include others, such as angels.

Ancestry and early life  Marian Shields was born in Chicago in 1937, the fourth of seven children‚Äîfive girls, followed by two boys‚Äîborn to Purnell Nathaniel Shields, a house painter and carpenter, and his wife Rebecca Jumper, a licensed practical nurse. Both parents had multi-racial ancestry. Her mother's grandfather, Dolphus T. Shields (c. 1860‚Äì1950), was the direct descendant of slavery, with his mother enslaved and his white father the heir of the slavemaster; he had moved from rural Georgia to Birmingham, Alabama, where he established his own carpentry and tool sharpening business. His descendants would eventually move to Chicago during the Great Migration.  Personal life  Shields married Fraser Robinson III on October 27, 1960 in Chicago. They had two children together, Craig Malcolm and Michelle LaVaughn, named after Fraser's mother. She worked as a secretary for mail-order retailer Spiegel, the University of Chicago, and a bank. In the late 60's, Shields lived with her family in a rented second floor apartment of a brick bungalow - in the South Side of Chicago - that belonged to her aunt Robbie and her husband Terry. This is where she raised her two children, Michelle and Craig, and continued to live till she eventually moved to the White House with the Obamas. Michelle Obama, in her book Becoming, describes her mother's strong attachment to her Chicago home and her commitment to raising her children as a stay at home mother. Shields resumed work as an executive assistant at a bank when her daughter Michelle started high school.  Relationship with Michelle Obama  Obama describes her mother as forthright and honest, and speaks of her implacability and her silent support for Obama throughout her childhood and beyond. Shields used to take her daughter Michelle to the library long before she started school and used to sit beside her as she learned to read and write. Usually the kind of mother who expected her children to settle their own disputes, Shields was quick to see real distress and stepped in to help when needed. For example, when Michelle was in second grade and was distressed because of being devalued by a teacher, Shields advocated for her and was instrumental in getting her daughter better learning opportunities at school. Shields encouraged her children to communicate with her about all subjects by being available when needed and giving practical advice. She entertained Michelle's school friends when they visited and enabled her to make her own choices in important matters.  Obama campaign and life in the White House  While Michelle and Barack Obama campaigned for his candidacy as president in 2008, Robinson helped them by providing support to her granddaughters, Malia and Sasha Obama. During Barack Obama's presidency, Robinson was living in the White House in support of the First Family. ReferencesFurther reading *Swarns, Rachel L. (2012).

It covers World War II in the Pacific between the Japanese Empire and the Allies, which include the United States, the British Empire, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Philippines, and China. The main map of the game stretches from north of the Aleutians to southern New Zealand and Australia, and from the eastern coast of India to the West Coast of North America. It includes aircraft carrier operations, amphibious assaults, surface bombardments/engagements, strategic bombing, kamikazes, and the submarine war against naval and merchant shipping. In 2004, Pacific War received a follow-up under the title War in the Pacific. Gameplay The role of the player is that of high level command. Players decide what will be attacked or defended, appoint commanders, and provide the resources (aircraft, ships, and land combat units) to accomplish the goals. The lowest level of player control is roughly equivalent to that of a theater commander. Details of combat depend on commanders appointed by the player. Players exercise control at higher levels, roughly equivalent to having influence in the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the UK Imperial War Cabinet, or the US Joint Chiefs Of Staff. Players have the ability in most cases to impose an overall strategy and require shared goals and cooperation between, as examples, the Japanese Army and Navy, UK and the US, or the US Army and USMC. The game places some restrictions on imposing non-historical strategies and cooperation. The Japanese player cannot abandon China (the Imperial Japanese Army's main goal). The Allied player has land combat units that must remain in the US for its defense and (in the SSI version) land combat units that must remain in Australia. The Allied player is subject to Royal Navy ships being temporarily removed from the game as a simulation of the Royal Navy's global responsibilities. The Allied player can not accelerate the transfer of USN ships to the Pacific theater. USN ships arrive in the Pacific on the historic dates. The ability of each side to overrun China is limited. The game runs on Preparation Points. Most events in the game consume Preparation Points. The Japanese player receives Preparation Points based on Japan's oil reserve. This means the Japanese player must capture bases with oil early in the game. While early in the game, the Japanese player has superior combat capability, the player cannot exploit this superiority without Preparation Points. The Allied player receives Preparation Points based on the game date. Available Allied Preparation Points increase as the game progresses. The Allied player has a higher maximum number of Preparation Points per HQ than the Japanese player. =Scenarios= The game is a turn-based setup, each turn covering one week. It can be played as a solo player against the AI; or by two players, either on the same computer, or by email play. A solo player can choose to play either Japan or Allies. Game balance can be adjusted to give one side or the other 'help' or 'maximum help', resulting in that side getting more replacements, improved production, and faster reinforcements. Matrix has scenarios developed specifically for play against the computer and others developed for two human players. There are provisions for fighting shorter campaigns: the Japanese offensive period; Coral Sea - Midway period; Guadalcanal; the Marianas landings; or the Leyte Gulf battles. Alternately, players can select the entire war from December 1941 Pearl Harbor, or a slightly shorter version from 1942 to surrender. Matrix includes a non-historical scenario which starts after a hypothetical Japanese victory at Midway.  History  The game was originally designed and programmed by Gary Grigsby, produced by George MacDonald, and with game development by Joel Billings, David Landrey and James Young. SSI did not ship the game with a printed map for cost reasons. Computer Gaming World in March 1994 published a map from SSI as part of about 30 pages of supplementary material, including an index, improved table of contents, checklists, and playing suggestions. Reception In 2004, SSI founder Joel Billings wrote that Pacific War \\"sold between 15,000 and 20,000 units at full price, and many more as part of multi-product wargame bundles.\\" Computer Gaming World stated in April 1993 that \\"Here it is, the game Grigsby fans have been waiting eight years for! The whole of World War II in the Pacific, from Seattle to Calcutta! Awesome!\\" The magazine stated that \\"Pacific War is a milestone in computer wargaming‚Äîit's the first true computer 'monstergame'\\". It warned that the game's difficulty, user interface, and lack of a tutorial or paper map made it appealing only for dedicated wargamers willing to learn \\"ten to twenty hours just learning to play\\". A survey of wargames that year in the magazine gave the game four stars out of five, calling it \\"The simulation of the Pacific ... I find it overwhelming, but I can recognize quality when I see it. Highly recommended for retirees, or for those for whom the expression \\"Get a life!\\" means something\\". The magazine named Pacific War the 1993 Wargame of the Year, and in 1994 wished that Great Naval Battles Vol. 2 had its \\"solid game design\\". Legacy In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Pacific War the 109th-best computer game ever released. A smaller-scale follow-up to Pacific War, entitled Uncommon Valor: Campaign for the South Pacific, was released by Grigsby and 2 by 3 Games in 2002. In 2004, they launched a full successor of Pacific War under the name War in the Pacific. =Matrix Games version= In September 2000, publisher Matrix Games launched an updated version of Pacific War entitled Pacific War: The Matrix Project, released as freeware. Grigsby had joined Matrix earlier that year. Matrix credited Richard Dionne and Jeremy Pritchard with making the changes that resulted in the Matrix edition. The game followed Matrix's freeware updates of two other Grigsby titles, Steel Panthers and Gary Grigsby's War in Russia.

The Grafton Centre is situated just outside the city centre, however it boasts large shops such as Debenhams which the Lion Yard does not have, due to its confined location. For many years a central feature of the atrium was a large white pillar with the statue of a large very red lion on the top of it, safely out of easy reach. This recalled the Red Lion pub which had occupied the site until demolished in 1969.Wikimapia, Wikimapia: Lion Yard shopping centre, Wikimapia: Lion Yard shopping centre. The lion statue is now at the Cambridge University R.U.F.C. ground on Grange Road. Lion Yard was significantly refurbished in the late 1990s/early 2000s. A recently constructed covered mall, Grand Arcade, adjoins Lion Yard on its south side; the two are interconnected. The main shopping mall is centred around an atrium which benefits from four entrances and exits. The retail element is concentrated on the ground floor; however, the Central Library can be accessed from the first floor of Lion Yard along with retailers Ellis Brigham, The North Face and New Look. The Centre consists of a three- storey office block (Lion House and St George House), an undercover external colonnade taking up one half of Petty Cury, external boutique shops opposite St Andrew the Great Church, many high street retailers internally along with housing the seventh busiest library in the UK. Although it is the smallest and oldest of the three shopping centres, continual investment in the scheme has ensured that the Centre continues to draw in the crowds.

They were discovered shot to death inside Donerson's home in Chicago, Illinois. The victims were the brother and mother of singer Jennifer Hudson. Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description. Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to \\"multiple gunshot wounds.\\" A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police. Investigation On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 27, into custody but did not file charges against him. Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered. After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation. At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred. Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board. Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing. Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime. =Arrest and Conviction= On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first- degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion. At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man. Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes. Balfour was indicted on December 30. On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years. Legacy In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation \\"to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,\\" according to a statement released to the press.

Life He became a blacksmith like his father. In 1812, he moved to New Hampshire. After a short time, his employer sent him to Brownsville, New York, to supervise the installation of machinery at a cotton factory, and Whitney remained in New York. About 1830, he was hired by the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad to make machinery and railway carriages, and after a few years became superintendent of the line. In February 1840, he was elected by the New York State Legislature as one of the Erie Canal commissioners, and remained in office until 1842 when the Democratic majority removed the Whig commissioners. In 1842, he formed a partnership with Matthias W. Baldwin to manufacture steam locomotives in Philadelphia. Two years later he left Baldwin, and worked for the reorganized Morris Canal Company. In 1846, he opened his own factory to manufacture wheels for railway carriages. In 1847, he took out patents for the corrugated-plate carriage wheel and the curved corrugated-plate carriage wheel, and the following year for the process of annealing carriage wheels. This consisted of placing the wheels, soon after they were cast, in a heated furnace, where they were subjected to a further gradual increase of temperature, and were then slowly cooled for three days. The discovery of this process of annealing, as applied to chilled cast-iron wheels, marked an era in the history of railroads. It enabled trains to safely increase both loads and speed. Previous to this discovery it was impossible to cast wheels with solid hubs, and therefore impossible to secure them rigidly to the axle. Now the whole wheel was easily cast in one piece, and capable of being forced securely upon the axle at a pressure of 40 tons. In 1850, he patented the tapered and ribbed corrugated wheel. Whitney was for a short time president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, but retired in 1861 because of ill health. He gave $50,000 to found a professorship of dynamical engineering in the University of Pennsylvania, $12,500 to the Franklin Institute, and $20,000 to the old men's home in Philadelphia. He died in Philadelphia and is interred at The Woodlands Cemetery. After Whitney's death, the factory, which had been once the largest carriage-wheel manufacturer in the United States, was taken over by his three sons: George Whitney (d. 1885), John R. Whitney and James S. Whitney. In 1891, the company was in financial trouble and going bankrupt.

He had the overall responsibility for security in the Army Group Rear Areas, and thus bore responsibility for the war crimes committed by the rear-security units in the occupied areas under the army's jurisdiction. He was born in Kirchenlamitz, Upper Franconia. After service in World War I he was a member of the Reichswehr. In World War II he served as the quartermaster-general from 1941 to 1944 and was promoted to General der Artillerie on 1 August 1943. On 24 July 1939 he drew up regulations that allowed German soldiers to take hostages from civilian population and execute them as response to resistance. He personally welcomed the idea of future invasion of Poland, writing that he looked to it \\"gladly\\". He had a central role in the death sentences for ten Polish prisoners taken in the Defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig. In May 1941, he drew up the regulations with Reinhard Heydrich that ensured that the Army and Einsatzgruppen would co-operate in murdering Soviet Jews. On the Eastern Front he had a role in ensuring that suitable winter clothing was supplied to the German forces and on 27 November 1941 he reported that \\"We are at the end of our resources in both personnel and material. We are about to be confronted with the dangers of deep winter.\\" In the summer of 1942, before his visit to inspect the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad, he informed Hitler of the \\"lack of sources of fuel.\\" By that time, \\"all the generals avoided contradicting Hitler\\" as \\"all feared the hysterical outbursts of this lofty dictator.\\" After the war, Otto Br√§utigam of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories claimed in his book that in February 1943 he had the opportunity to read a personal report by Wagner regarding a discussion with Heinrich Himmler, in which Himmler had expressed the intention to exterminate about 80% of the populations of France and England by special forces of the SD after the German victory. He became a conspirator against Adolf Hitler. When Claus von Stauffenberg sought approval for an assassination attempt on 15 July 1944, he was cited as being definite that the assassination of Hitler should only be attempted if Heinrich Himmler was also present. On 20 July 1944, he arranged the airplane that flew Stauffenberg from Rastenburg back to Berlin after the bomb believed to have killed Hitler had exploded. After the failure of the coup attempt, he feared that his arrest by the Gestapo was imminent and that he might be forced to implicate other plotters. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the head at noon on 23 July 1944.

Theological life The Church Missionary Society (CMS) brought about the Gospel in Machilipatnam. With the formation of the Church of South India (CSI) in 1947, the CMS got merged into the CSI. From 1950, Ananda Rao pursued a graduate degree in divinity (BD) at the United Theological College, Bengaluru as a candidate of the Church of South India, Diocese of Krishna-Godavari. Soon after returning from Bengaluru in 1953, he was ordained on 14 June 1953 and made a Presbyter in Machilipatnam during the Bishopric of Yeddy Muthyalu.Mar Aprem, Indian Christian who is who, Bombay Parish Church of the East, Bombay, 1983.

In 1955, he was sent to the Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York where he earned an S.T.M. in Pastoral Counselling. Professorship During the academic years 1949‚Äì1950 and 1954‚Äì1955, Ananda Rao lectured English Literature at the Andhra- Christian College, Guntur. After Ananda Rao returned from the Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York in 1956, he began tutoring at the Andhra Union Theological Seminary, Dornakal.

As Bishop and Moderator of the Church of South India, he brought about the topic for discussion and debate at synodical platforms. In 1980, the CSI passed a resolution granting ordination for theologically- trained women. The formation of the Joint Council of the Church of South India, Church of North India and the Mar Thoma is attributed to Ananda Rao. In Andhra Pradesh, Lutherans and Baptists could not join the Church of South India due to Lay leadership. However, Ananda Rao had been instrumental in trying to negotiate for their inclusion.

Until 1998 as Tegernsee-Bahn (Tegernsee Railway) it operated the railway line from Schaftlach via Gmund to Tegernsee. The company is listed in the share index, MDAX.

April 1905 The company emerged from what was originally called the Eisenbahn- Actiengesellschaft Schaftlach-Gmund (Schaftlach-Gmund Railway Company Ltd), founded in 1882, which built the 7.6 km long railway line between these villages. It is suspected that Ferdinand von Miller, amongst others, played a decisive role. From 1896 the line was extended by 4.8 km to Tegernsee; in 1902 the first train ran to Tegernsee and the company was renamed the Eisenbahn- Actiengesellschaft Schaftlach-Gmund-Tegernsee or EAG (Schaftlach-Gmund- Tegernsee Railway Company Ltd). In 1942 the name was shortened to Tegernsee- Bahn Aktiengesellschaft (Tegernsee Railway Company Ltd) and, in 1983, running powers were transferred to the new subsidiary Tegernsee-Bahn Betriebsgesellschaft mbH or TBG (Tegernsee Railway Operating Company Ltd). The operation of the line has been rented out since 1998 for 15 years to the Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB), that previously had the state concession for the operation of railway services in the Bavarian Oberland. The BOB has continued to use the railway infrastructure of the Tegernsee-Bahn. The running and rolling stock was given up by the Tegernsee-Bahn in 1999 as they no longer needed it. Since 2002 the TBG has once again had its own locomotive, the TAG 15.Website of the Tegernsee-Bahn with information about the vehicle fleet This former DB Class K√∂f III is used for snow plough runs and construction train work. The Tegernsee-Bahn Betriebsgesellschaft is a member of the Fare Association of Federal and Private Railways in Germany (Tarifverband der Bundeseigenen und Nichtbundeseigenen Eisenbahnen in Deutschland or TBNE). History of the property and holding company Following the cessation of its railway operation in 1998, as a result of the concession being given to a competitor, the business of the TAG AG became limited to the maintenance and rental of property and land that belonged to the railway (trackage, stations at Gmund and Tegernsee) as well as land no longer needed for railway operations and the cash assets. An investors group including investor, Rolf Hauschildt, and property manager, Lutz Ristow, initially took over a share and posts on the board of directors; later Ristow was also the Vorstandsmandat for a short time. The firm was reorganised into a property and holding company, and was renamed in 1999 to TAG Tegernsee Immobilien und Beteiligungs-AG. In January 2001, as part of its expansion into property, the TAG bought 75% of the non-public Berliner JUS AG, which had specialised in refurbishing and modernising property under historical protection orders. Its manager, Michael Haupt, joined the TAG's board. Its share was increased in 2002 to 94%. In June 2001, 44% of the public Bau-Verein zu Hamburg AG was bought; through a swap action and further purchase its share rose in early 2002 to 88%, but fell again afterwards to today's 69%. Likewise, in 2001 the non-public project development and preservation company AGP AG Munich was taken over.

Cash transfers are either unconditional cash transfers or conditional cash transfers. They may be provided by organisations funded by private donors, or a local or regional government. Targeting Cash transfer programmes in developing countries are constrained by three factors: financial resources, institutional capacity and ideology.Rachel Slater and John Farrington (2009) Cash transfers: targeting London: Overseas Development Institute Governments in poorer countries tend to have restricted financial resources, and are therefore limited in the amount they can invest both directly in cash transfers and in measures to ensure that such programmes are effective. The amount invested is influenced by ‚Äòvalue for money‚Äô considerations, as well as by political and ideological concerns regarding ‚Äòfree handouts‚Äô and ‚Äòcreating dependency‚Äô.Sony Pellissery and Armando Barrientos (2013) Expansion of Social Assistance: Does Politics Matter? As random allocations are not particularly effective, there are two main forms of targeting: * means tested * universal (everyone in a designated social, geographical, age or other such category) Means testing potential recipients of cash transfers is the more politically acceptable, as money is not perceived to be wasted by including those who do not have a desperate need for the money (\\"leakage\\"). This can either be achieved through a screening process of potential recipients, or else by making the benefits of the transfers so low only the most desperate will apply. Yet there are also many problems associated with this method as the transaction costs of screening are very high, due to the need to pay for assessment, the travelling cost of candidates to and from the assessment and also the potential risks for corruption. There also may be a negative effect on social capital as resentment develops of those who receive support by those who do not. A universal approach, i.e.selecting all the under 5s, or pensioners, disabled, female led households, etc., does have many advantages as it increases social unity amongst a section of society benefitting from the programme and avoids the transaction costs of screening. A universal approach requires carefully selecting a target group as some groups may cover a greater number of poor families, but include the less needy. Similarly a more narrow recipient group risks excluding many of those who do actually need support. Lump sums One method of managing a cash transfer is to provide all the money at once in a lump sum, rather than in small regular amounts. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute carried out a study on the effectiveness of the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation's experiments with lump sum cash transfers and came out with the following six findings:John Farrington (2009) Cash transfers: lump sums London: Overseas Development Institute # Lump sum transfers work better in post-emergency than developmental contexts as their potential to be rapidly transferred to the recipients suits the urgency of post-emergency requirements. # Success of lump sum transfers greatly depends on the local market and whether there are long-term income generating investments to be made. Areas affected by illness (e.g. HIV/Aids) or other such problems are likely to benefit more from regular small payments. # Economic conditions other than limited markets or limited investment opportunities are also important, for instance, if the scale of the transfer greatly exceeds several years of local incomes recipients are unlikely to be able to know how to prudently invest the cash. Where there is a clear investment potential, care should be made to support the recipient while lump sum investment matures, e.g. someone who buys a cow still needs to eat while waiting for the long term benefits (calf, milk) and so must be helped in order to ensure s/he doesn't sell the cow. # While business planning, skills enhancement and training support is useful, if a clear investment opportunity (fishing boat, cow, etc.) is available, that is normally enough. # Context must be considered, e.g. people cannot build a house if they have no access to land. # Large cash transfers risk creating corruption or being used as a tool to gain political support for the government. Wider economic, political and social implications Many governments in poorer countries, where cash transfers could potentially have the most impressive impact, are often unwilling to implement such programmes due to fears of inflation and more importantly, dependency on the transfers.Anna McCord (2009) Cash transfers and political economy in sub-Saharan Africa London: Overseas Development Institute Quite often it is NGOs who encourage the schemes. If introduced, these schemes are often directed at the non-working poor (although the DfID backed Hunger Safety Nets Programme is a notable exception). In sub-Saharan Africa transfer values are normally limited to 10 to 30% of the ultra poverty line, though donors are now recommending the provision of a transfer level equivalent to 100%. Whether due to the cautious approach or not, studies have shown that inflation is often avoided as traders increase their stock in anticipation of the schemes.Rebecca Holmes (2009) Cash transfers in post-conflict contexts London: Overseas Development Institute Furthermore, the projects have often helped to build the state's legitimacy as it helps ensure citizens survival and programmes are targeted at marginalised groups and support their integration (e.g. in Nepal successive governments have used cash transfers to help integrate marginalised groups and reduce the risk of conflict). =Monitoring and evaluating cash transfer programmes= Ensuring the participation of poor communities in the monitoring and evaluation (M&E;) of social protection programmes ‚Äì and cash transfer programmes in particular - is gaining support from donors and governments who see potential gains in efficiency, legitimacy and satisfaction. ‚ÄòParticipatory monitoring and evaluation‚Äô (PM&E;) techniques and mechanisms are particularly effective at giving a voice to the people who receive the money, and, when they work well, they serve increase the accountability of governments, local officials and programme implementers. Qualitative and participatory research carried out by the Overseas Development Institute (in Kenya, Mozambique, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Uganda and Yemen) investigating individual and community perceptions of cash transfer programmes reveals that the money has a number of positive, and potentially transformative, effects on the lives of the individuals and families that receive them, including: ‚Ä¢ People prefer to receive cash than other forms of assistance (food aid, public works, etc.) because it gives them the freedom to spend the money on the things they feel they need. ‚Ä¢ People experience an increase in their quality of life e.g. they are able to construct permanent shelters, have three meals a day and pay health-related costs. ‚Ä¢ More children are going to school as a result of receiving the transfer. ‚Ä¢ Particularly vulnerable or excluded beneficiaries felt that they were now able to meet the basic needs of their families, giving them greater economic freedom, security and enhanced psychological well-being. Examples *Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) *Social Security *Children's Allowance *Newborns' Allowance *Worker's Compensation = Humanitarian cash transfers = As of 2015, only approximately 6% of humanitarian aid is provided in the form of cash transfers and vouchers, even though evidence indicates that it is more cost-effective, better for recipients and more transparent than in-kind aid.High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers (2015) Doing cash differently: how cash transfers can transform humanitarian aid Overseas Development Institute A High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers was convened in 2015. It found that in many cases, cash transfers were better for people in humanitarian crises. For example: * A study in Ecuador, Niger, Uganda and Yemen found that 18% more people could have been helped if everyone was given cash, not food. * In Iraq, 70% of Syrian refugees resold large parts of their food aid, in order to purchase what they needed more urgently. * In Somalia, 2.5 times more of aid budgets went directly to aid recipients when given cash rather than food aid. In order to scale up cash transfers in humanitarian aid, organisations need to: * Increase amount of unconditional cash transfers; * Invest in planning and preparedness; * Explore delivering cash transfers through private sector systems, longer-term social protection systems and digitally; * Improve coordination in the humanitarian system. =Case Study: Sierra Leone= Research has been carried out by the Overseas Development Institute into the challenges of implementing cash transfers in Sierra Leone and in ensuring their success. After a decade of conflict over 70% of the population lives in poverty and over 25% in extreme poverty (defined as being unable to achieve the bare minimum nutritional food intake).Rebecca Holmes and Adam Jackson (2008) Cash transfers in Sierra Leone: Are they appropriate, affordable or feasible? Overseas Development Institute Given the poverty and the high levels of fragmentation in society, cash transfer schemes have been small scale to date, but include: * Meeting immediate income needs; * Putting cash into the community and stimulating the local economy; and * Empowering people by enabling autonomous decision-making over expenditure. Any expansion of the system has to take into account: * The risk (both real and perceived) of dependency * Infrastructure * Institutional capacity * Risk of corruption * Affordability Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute found that the perceived risk of dependency was very high and that transfers of tools, sewing machines, or agricultural inputs have proved to be more popular. Furthermore, organisations such as the World Food Programme were of the belief that giving food, instead of cash, in payment for public works was more culturally relevant, in an area where workers had traditionally been paid this way. Yet the actual risk of dependency proved to be far less than feared. The research has also shown that despite poor infrastructure, administering cash transfers has not presented as great a challenge as expected. Informal networks have ensured cash is flowing from the urban to rural areas, even if by hand, and local councils and schools far from the capital are now also receiving payment through bank accounts and not in cash. The same goes for institutional capacity which is widely believed to be improving. Corruption in Sierra Leone continues to pose a serious challenge and the country ranked only 142 out of 163 in Transparency International's 2006 rankings. Cash transfers are no more prone to corruption than other sources of government spending, yet specific parts of the process of implementation must be carefully monitored. Affordability is argued to be low. Total government expenditure on social protection was budgeted at around US$1.5 million in 2006 and US$2.8 million in 2007 and social protection expenditure is estimated at around 1.5% to 2.5% of non-salary, non-interest recurrent government expenditure, 0.3‚Äì0.6% of total government expenditure and a small fraction of a percentage of GDP. =GiveDirectly= GiveDirectly is a non-profit organization, headquartered in the United States and currently operating in Kenya, that aims to help people living in extreme poverty by making unconditional cash transfers to them via mobile phone (through m-Pesa). It is the first charity dedicated exclusively to cash transfers. It claims that 90% of donor funds are utilized in the form of the actual cash transfers, with the remaining 10% being split between fees for money transfers and recipient identification costs. Their model is closer to the \\"lump sums\\" transfer model than the \\"regular income supplement\\" model that has historically been used more by governments.  Impacts on health  The first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of unconditional cash transfers included 21 studies, of which 16 were randomized controlled trials. It found that unconditional cash transfers may not improve health services use. However, they lead to a large, clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are more likely to attend school, and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.

Also they describe associations of these buildings with the astronomy. The back part of this feline, presents openings of doors, corridors and separations between walls, which allow the step of the first beam of the Sun in solstice and equinox. The step of the first beam of the Sun in the winter solstice on (June 21) across four doors crosses a sense. During the dawn of the summer solstice (December 21) a months later, the last beam of the Sun crosses the inverse way.

Magazine CIMIN (Construction, Industry and Mining industry), 1996, N ¬∞ 61. It approached a new offer of interpretation, according to which the pucara might be a ritual site and an astronomic observatory not a fortress. The abundant specialized literature indicates that the Inca astronomers realised observations of high precision and were constructing observatories along the territory that they were occupying. These observatories were necessary for elaboration of calendars with agricultural, religious, civil purposes, etc. Boccas,Boccas M., Bustamante P., Gonz√°lez C., y Monsalve C. 1999 Promising archaeoastronomy investigations in Chile\\", En: actas del Congreso OXFORD VI and SEAC -99, Astronom√≠a y Diversidad Cultural, Organismo Aut√≥nomo de Museos del Cabildo de Tenerife, Tenerife. Vol 1: 115 ‚Äî 123SciELO Boccas et to., 1999 and Boccas 2004 penetrates into this line of analysis.  Calendar  Due to the big distances that normally existed between villages and the need to cross them afoot, makes presume that every accession of relative importance, was relying on an observatory that was allowing the inhabitants, your own and one handled calendar. The Inca accession that the Spanish found on having come to the valley of Santiago surely was not the exception.Bauer Brian, Dearborn David, Astronomy and Empire of the Andes, Center of Andean Studies Bartolom√© of The houses, Cuzco, Peru, 1998.Sullivan William, The Secret of The Incas, Grijalbo, Barcelona, Spain, 1999. The date in which the Sun passes for nadir (antizenith) also was known, and a temporary axis was forming with the step for zenith. In the Inca city Wanuku Pampa Aveni discovered two important buildings which orientation is glaringly different from the rest of the city: they align with the axis( zenith - anticenit, which names later \\" standard time of Cuzco \\", since he suggests that the Incas, on not having been able to apply the same temporary criteria in all your empire (s passed the tropics, the Sun never passes for the zenith - Chena's case-), had to support a calendar coherence between remote places of your empire and the capital. In Chena, we have not seen this type of alignment towards \\"Cuzco's time zone\\". = Skills of observation = June 21 is the holiday of Inti Raymi, new year Inca. If the Inca was stopping in the beginning of the most short red line, he was observing the first beam of the Sun went out across a groove between two walls. The Sun was rising after Ushnu or altar. During the celebration of the Inti Raymi of 2006 in the pucara, the young archeologist and mountaineer Ricardo Moyano observed the exit of the Sun and recognized hills the depression in where the Sun goes out, as the so-called Portezuelo del Inca. Up to this moment this name did not have explanation. From this observation, in Stehberg's opinion, it might be a question of the first line of ceque found in Santiago. In Cuzco, the ceques were consisting of imaginary lines that Coricancha was departing from and they were going towards every huaca, shaping a whole of 328 huacas. They were fulfilling functions of political, social and religious order. The Coricancha was the principal temple of the Inca culture. To the dawn of the equinox, the Sun crosses the door of the enclosure orient and then crosses the corridor. To the late afternoon it realizes the inverse way. The diagonal of the corridor of access indicates the line North - South. By means of this simple method, and using mud and stones as materials of construction, the astronomers Incas were achieving observations of great precision. = Determination of geographical North - South Axis = For example, to determine the astronomic or geographical north, is enough to observe the point of exit and the point of putting of the star Vega (Lira's Alpha), Urcu Chillay or macho calls for the Incas, about the winter solstice. Then to look for the average point, this represents the north. Probably this simple method allowed to the former astronomers to determine the axis North - South. The following scheme, product of more than one decade of observation in situ of astronomic events, shows the system of astronomic observation to simple sight, probably used by the Incas astronomers to design the pucara and then to realize your observations of the apparent movement of the stars. =Winter solstice= The surrise of the winter solstice occurs in a \\"key\\" point from Chena's ushnu: the intersection of the most nearby horizon (Chena's cord) and of the most distant (mountain chain of the Coast). In addition, in this precise direction one finds the summit of the highest hill (1.166 msnm) that reaches to the south of the Cuesta Zapata.map IGM Santiago 3300-7030 to scale 1:250.000 This detail might not be a coincidence, but a topographic important requirement, due to the association known about the high hills with the worship to the water in several culturesBroda, J. 1991 Cosmovisi√≥n y observaci√≥n de la naturaleza: el ejemplo del culto de los cerros en Mesoam√©rica.

The Huaca de Chena  A huaca (Quechuan Wak'a) is a sacred place, a space of ritual use. The previous descriptions seem to indicate that Chena's Pucar√° was and it is a huaca. The reasons that they support this place as ceremonial and not as military compound: * During the excavations weapon was not found, the water is to 2,5 km from distance, the housings for 6 persons were insufficient for the garrison that is supposed it should have defended the extensive walls perimetrales; * The pucara has a form zoomorfa (he looks like a \\"puma\\"\\") and this it is a characteristic of the ceremonial centers Incas; * If it is observed, the pucara consists of three separated spaces (the first wall perimetral, the second wall perimetral and the central enclosures), which can interpret as the typical one \\"Tripartici√≥n Inca of Pachacuti Yamqui\\" (A low zone, a terrestrial zone and a celestial zone); * Finally, it is possible to observe in the principal enclosure the existence of one Ushnu (Place of observation). Curiously, it is possible to plan a perfectly straight line between Chena's ushnu and the place where the Sun puts on all the winters solsticio (in the Mountain chain of the Coast)  Pre-Hispanic cemetery  At basement of the mount, they found also two cemeteries, presumably diaguita, separated one of other one for approximately .

QuechuanAymar√° distinguishes the community from Santiago, which realizes negotiations with the authorities in order to recover the Huaca de Chena as a ritual space for the new generations of descendants from the original Andean etnias. The communities estimate importantly that the descendants from the Andean villages could recover this sacred place (nowadays in virtual abandon), to possess a ritual own space inside the city. This would allow them to establish a physical and spiritual link with your cultural inheritance.

Othery was a chapelry of Sowy parish with its own chaplain from 1203, but the church of St Michael was dedicated before that time. In 1515, when Sowy was divided, Othery became a separate parish with its own parish church and vicar. The church, perpendicular in style, was remodelled in the 15th century, and partly rebuilt after 1844. Its typical Somerset tower was restored in 1849 and in 1853, when pinnacles and niches were built; sculptures of heads and angels were added in the following years. There are five bells in the tower; the oldest dates to the 1650s and was made by Robert Austen. The other bells date from between 1692 and 1815.

Sara Alexandra Lima Tavares (born 1 February 1978) is a Portuguese singer, composer, guitarist and percussionist. She was born and brought up in Lisbon, Portugal, where she still lives. Second-generation Portuguese of Cape Verdean descent, she composes African, Portuguese and North American influenced world music. She composes in Portuguese and Portuguese-based creole languages. Although Portuguese is the main language of her songs, it's not rare to find in her repertoire multilingual songs mixing Portuguese with Portuguese creole and even English in the same song (e.g.\\"One Love\\"). Tavares won the 1993/1994 final of the Endemol song contest Chuva de Estrelas (performing Whitney Houston's \\"One Moment in Time\\"), which helped her win the Portuguese Television Song Contest final in 1994, consequently earning a place in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, with the song \\"Chamar a M√∫sica\\" reaching 8th place. She's also known for singing the European-Portuguese version of \\"God Help the Outcasts\\" for the Disney movie \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" which won a Disney award for the best version of the original song. She also won a Portuguese Golden Globe for Best Portuguese Singer in 2000.  Early life  Tavares' parents were immigrants from Cape Verde that settled in Almada in the 70s. While still a child, she was left in the care of an old woman when her father left the family and her mother moved to the south of the country with her younger siblings. Tavares showed great musical promise from a young age; in 1994 she won the national television song contest Chuva de Estrelas, performing Whitney Houston's \\"One Moment in Time\\". That same year, she won the Festival da Can√ß√£o, that earned Tavares a slot in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest at the age of 16. Her winning song, \\"Chamar a M√∫sica,\\" was featured on her debut EP, Sara Tavares & Shout (1996), where Tavares mixed gospel and funk with her native Portuguese influences. Her debut album Mi Ma B√¥ was produced by Lokua Kanza and released in 1999. In 2017, eight years after Xinti, Tavares released Fitxadu. The album was inspired in Lisbon's different African sounds and cultures and features a more electronic and urban sound than Tavares' previous works. The album received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Portuguese Language Roots Album. Artistry Sara Tavares has named Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin as her favorite childhood artists.

He began his art studies with Thomas CoutureDictionnaire B√©n√©zit and was originally a watercolorist as well as a painter. He concentrated on religious themes before becoming interested in military art. In 1858, he was legally authorized to add his mother's maiden name to his, becoming Armand-Dumaresq. He was a member of the jury at the painting exhibition of the Exposition Universelle (1867). Shortly after, he exhibited his monumental tableau Cambronne at Waterloo, for which Napol√©on III awarded him the Cross of the Legion of Honor. Later, the painting was purchased by Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt. In 1870, the Ministry of National Education dispatched him on a mission to the United States to study various methods of teaching drawing for industrial applications. He had recently completed a similar study in the Netherlands. During his investigations, he interacted with the art community in the eastern part of the country, as well as making contacts at West Point and the United States Naval Academy. He concluded that the superiority of French methods was recognized there; citing the employment of several French citizens in the engraving and printing department of the United States Treasury. He painted and sketched very little during his trip, but created numerous American-themed works upon his return. Towards the end of his career, he worked with the Belgian painter, Louis Van Engelen (1856-1940), to create a panorama of the Battle of Bapaume from the Franco-Prussian War; now preserved in the Town hall of Bapaume. His works may be seen at the Ch√¢teau de Versailles, the print collection of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and in the \\"Mus√©e national de la coop√©ration franco-am√©ricaine\\" at the Ch√¢teau de Bl√©rancourt.

His parents encouraged him to play an instrument, but he became interested in turntables and songwriting. He began participating in competition when he was 16. One competition misprinted his nickname \\"Tydi\\" as \\"tyDi,\\" which led to the stylization of his stage name. Tydi graduated from Queensland Conservatorium of Music with a Bachelor of Music Technology. In 2006, he entered Junkee's Australian Top 50 DJs at No. 12, and No. 4 the following year. In 2008, he reached No. 1, becoming the youngest person to top the chart. =2009‚Äì2011: Look Closer and Shooting Stars= In 2009, TyDi released his debut album Look Closer, which reached No. 2 in the Australian Dance Charts. It featured 15 predominantly trance tracks. A review from Junkee's In The Mix stated, \\"Look Closer is an absolute belter of a debut, and displays a musical maturity way beyond Tydi's years.\\" Electronic music website Trance.nu wrote that Look Closer was \\"of world class quality the likes of some of the best trance and progressive artist albums out there.\\" A few months later he mixed a disc for the annual Ministry of Sound Trance Nation release and continued at No. 1 for the 2009 Junkee DJ chart. During 2009 and 2010, Tydi released singles such as \\"You Walk Away\\" (featuring Audrey Gallagher), \\"Good Dream\\", \\"Vanilla\\" (featuring Tanya Zygar), (again featuring Audrey Gallagher) and the anthem \\"Half Light\\" (featuring Tanya Zygar).

It featured collaborations with vocalists such as Tania Zygar, Brianna Holan, Audrey Gallagher and DJ Rap. Talking Reviews said \\"For want of a better description, this musical journey is nothing short of astounding and breath taking\\". Meanwhile, Beat Magazine described the final track, \\"Ariana,\\" \\"could be rated the best album outro of 2011.\\" About half of the tracks have been released in extended club mixes or remixes. After the album release, TyDi continued touring, playing many shows a year in London, Macau, Sydney, and his hometown of Brisbane. =2012‚Äì2014: Hotel Rooms, label change, and Redefined = tyDi performing at Sutra in California, 2012 In October 2012, TyDi released, \\"Glow in the Dark\\", a collaboration with Ultra Records artist Kerli, which played on over 10 Top 40 radio stations.

His third album, a chillout album called Hotel Rooms, was released 22 November 2013. TyDi worked with American producer and DJ BT to collaborate on two tracks on BT's ninth album A Song Across Wires: \\"Tonight\\" (with JES) and \\"Stem the Tides\\" (with Tania Zygar). In August 2014, he released \\"Stay\\" with Dia Frampton, the runner up in The Voice's debut season. TyDi's fourth album, Redefined, was released on 30 September 2014. The project features vocals by Chris Carrabba and Jordan Witzigreuter. The album reached No. 5 on both the US and Australian iTunes dance charts on day of release. According to TyDi, Redefined represented a change in his approach to music creation, focusing more on songwriting rather than just hooks and rhythms. The album took three years to write and produce, during which time approximately 300 songs that were started were whittled down to the final 20. The album was not genre specific with house, progressive house, pop (ish), trance and chillout tracks all making the final cut. The title track, \\"ReDefined\\", reach number one on the dance airplay charts in the US in April 2015. Following the making of the music video for the song, it was revealed that Redefined was the final piece in a planned sequence. The trilogy begins with \\"Live This Lie\\" and ends with \\"Stay\\" but \\"Redefined\\" was the missing middle piece completing the story. On 20 November 2014, TyDi announced that he had made a promise to all of his trance fans and would be producing an EP in time for Christmas with all money being donated to children in need. That EP, The Promise, was released on 14 December 2014.

According to the post, Wish I Was was his \\"darker\\" side. The post also suggests, Wish I Was came about because Tyson had entered an extended creative block when trying to write songs as TyDi. However, after writing about half the tracks that eventually came out on the debut Wish I Was EP, internet publications began to report on the producer, at first suggesting it might be the work of Galantis before TyDi eventually owned up to the project himself. On 6 May 2016, the first Wish I Was EP was released on iTunes featuring 15 tracks. Collide is TyDi's sixth feature album and is a collaboration with composer Christopher Tin. Released 8 March 2018, it took 3 years to create. The album featured 12 tracks. TyDi stated in July 2018 he had been asked to work on some songs in the worldwide Disney on Ice production.

The organization provides guidance and legal counsel for LGBTQ and HIV-positive immigrants, particularly those seeking asylum from countries where they face persecution. In 2017, it provided over $33 million in free legal services for low-income LGBTQ and HIV-positive immigrants. It wins 99% of its cases. Direct legal representation and clients Immigration Equality represents LGBTQ and HIV-positive immigrants seeking safety, fair treatment, and freedom in the United States. Its clients include asylum seekers, binational couples and families, detained individuals, and undocumented people. In over 80 countries worldwide, it is a crime to be LGBT. Due to their sexual orientation, gender identity, or HIV status, clients are persecuted in their country of origin and flee to the United States. The fear of further abuse, torture, and death prevents their return. Without legal immigration status in the United States, they can be detained by immigration officials and deported. Immigration Equality helps clients to win asylum or release from detention so they can live safely and freely in the United States. Clients detained in detention centers have reported abuse by fellow detainees and guards. They often report spending a majority of their time isolated in solitary confinement, particularly transgender woman who are housed in male facilities. Historically, Immigration Equality's largest source of clients has come from Jamaica, with Mexico trailing right behind. In 2013, with Russia's \\"anti-gay propaganda\\" law, the organization's number of Russian clients surpassed the amount of Mexican clients. Over the last 20 years, the largest percentage of Immigration Equality clients has come from the Caribbean and Latin America. As more countries worldwide pass anti-LGBTQ laws, the number of individuals coming to Immigration Equality from Russia, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa has increased. Immigration Equality has a remarkable 98% win rate for their clients in asylum offices and immigration court. In 2013, the organization represented approximately 354 clients. Immigration Equality maintains a list of LGBTQ and HIV-competent private immigration attorneys to provide legal representation for those who contact them. They also provide technical assistance to attorneys who are working on sexual orientation, transgender identity, or HIV status-based right of asylum applications, or other immigration applications where the client's LGBTQ or HIV-positive identity is at issue in the case.Gay Refugees Seek Asylum in U.S.: Tell Me More - Behind Closed Doors National Public Radio, August 13, 2007. Advocacy efforts Immigration Equality advocates for client-driven policy priorities such as creating comprehensive immigration reform, implementing LGBTQ- inclusive legislation and policy, and asking for accountability from decision- makers in Washington. According to Immigration Equality, the following policy changes are still needed to advance the LGBTQ immigrant community: stop deporting LGBTQ immigrants, repeal the arbitrary one-year filing deadline for asylum, include LGBTQ people in administrative relief and immigration reform, improve conditions in immigration detention, increase the use of alternatives to detention, decrease asylum backlogs by hiring the appropriate number of officials, recognize 'families' to include those without access to marriage equality, and utilize group-based protection mechanisms for LGBTQ people trapped abroad. In September 2014, Immigration Equality rallied before the White House to call for immediate action after President Obama announced a delay on his executive action on immigration. Members of the organization traveled to D.C with clients to tell their stories and protest in the offices of House representatives, including John Boehner (R-Ohio), House Judiciary Committee Chair Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), but they refused to meet with the activists. History The organization was founded in 1994 by Suzanne Goldberg, Noemi Masliah, and Lavi Soloway as the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Rights Task Force. In 2004, the organization officially changed their name to Immigration Equality. In May 2006, in conjunction with the Human Rights Watch, Immigration Equality released their report - \\"Family, Unvalued: Discrimination, Denial, and the Fate of Binational Same-Sex Couples under United States Law,\\" which was based on research conducted from 2003-2006 to \\"emphasize and spotlight the plight of same-sex binational couples\\".Report spotlights GLBT immigration challenges: House bill seeks to allow U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign same-sex partners, Anthony Baldman, May 18, 2006, Gay and Lesbian Times. The report documented the cases of couples who hid the fact they were in a same-sex relationship when reporting to the 2000 U.S. Census because they feared anti-LGBTQ bias in the immigration process, as well as cases of couples who failed to participate in the census because their foreign partners were living in the United States illegally. The report also cited couples who were affected by U.S. immigration policies that overlook same-sex bi-national couples completely and outlined facts about the U.S.'s current visa and immigration system explaining how LGBTQ people either fit into the system or do not. Immigration Equality campaigned to lift the ban on travel and immigration into the U.S. on the part of those with HIV, which had been enacted in 1987 and strengthened in 1993. In July 2008, President George Bush signed legislation to permit the lifting of the ban. President Obama announced in October 2009 that the Department Health and Human Services was publishing rules that would end the 22-year ban by removing HIV from list of \\"communicable disease[s] of public health significance\\" that the Immigration Service relied on.New York Times: Julia Preston, \\"Obama Lifts a Ban on Entry Into U.S. by H.I.V.-Positive People,\\" October 30, 2009, accessed April 2, 2012.

Immigrants Now History, Relief and Revision,\\" March 19, 2010, accessed April 2, 2012 In 2008, Immigration Equality opened their Washington, DC office, shortly after Congress repealed the HIV immigration and travel ban, fulfilling one of the organization's founding objectives. During the same year, Immigration Equality, in conjunction with the Transgender Law Center, drafted Immigration Law and the Transgender Client, a manual published by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the first LGBTQ publication that the latter organization has issued.[18] Immigration Equality also won over fifty political asylum cases where the potential deportees feared persecution if returned to their homeland.Gay Filipino professor wins political asylum after revealing a 30-year secret of sexual abuse Jessie Mangaliman, San Jose Mercury News, 8 June 2009. In 2009, the group created the Immigration Equality Action Fund, a 501(c)4 organization devoted to federal lobbying. In 2015, Immigration Equality provided more than 32,704 hours of free legal service by their legal team and partners. In October 2016, Immigration Equality welcomed their new executive director Aaron C. Morris. In May 2015, Immigration Equality's website was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress' historic collection of Internet materials related to public policy topics.

The word was coined by a radical feminist Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and privileged in others. It is an intersectional extension of the idea of patriarchy beyond gender. Kyriarchy encompasses sexism, racism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, xenophobia, adultism, adultcentrism, economic injustice, prison-industrial complex, ephebiphobia, gerontophobia, colonialism, militarism, ethnocentrism, anthropocentrism, speciesism and other forms of dominating hierarchies in which the subordination of one person or group to another is internalized and institutionalized. Etymology The term was coined by Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza in 1992 when she published her book But She Said: Feminist Practices of Biblical Interpretation. It is derived from , \\"lord, master\\" and , \\"authority, domination, sovereignty\\". However, the word kyriarchy (), already existed in Modern Greek, and means \\"sovereignty\\", i.e. the rulership of a sovereign.  Usage  The term was originally developed in the context of feminist theological discourse, and has been used in some other areas of academia as a non‚Äìgender-based descriptor of systems of power, as opposed to patriarchy. It is also widely used outside of scholarly contexts. The Kurdish- Iranian asylum seeker Behrouz Boochani has described the Australian-run Manus Island Australian detention centre prison as a kyriarchal system: one where different forms of oppression intersect; oppression is not random but purposeful, designed to isolate and create friction amongst prisoners, leading to despair and broken spirits. He elaborates on this in his autobiographical account of the detention centre, No Friend But the Mountains. Structural positions Sch√ºssler Fiorenza describes interdependent \\"stratifications of gender, race, class, religion, heterosexualism, and age\\" as structural positions assigned at birth. She suggests that people inhabit several positions, and that positions with privilege become nodal points through which other positions are experienced. For example, in a context where gender is the primary privileged position (e.g., patriarchy), gender becomes the nodal point through which sexuality, race, and class are experienced. In a context where class is the primary privileged position (i.e., classism), gender and race are experienced through class dynamics. Fiorenza stresses that kyriarchy is not a hierarchical system as it does not focus on one point of domination. Instead it is described as a \\"complex pyramidal system\\" with those on the bottom of the pyramid experiencing the \\"full power of kyriarchal oppression\\". The kyriarchy is recognized as the status quo and therefore its oppressive structures may not be recognized. To maintain this system, kyriarchy relies on the creation of a servant class, race, gender, or people. The position of this class is reinforced through \\"education, socialization, and brute violence and malestream rationalization\\". Tƒìraudkalns suggests that these structures of oppression are self-sustained by internalized oppression; those with relative power tend to remain in power, while those without tend to remain disenfranchised. Structures of oppression also amplify and feed into each other.

Eudontomyzon hellenicus and E. graecus (if separate from E. hellenicus) also possibly belong in this genus. This species is a non-parasitic lamprey that feeds on animal carcasses. Description The Caspian lamprey is a slim-bodied, eel- like fish that grows to a length of about . The longest recorded specimen was long and weighed . Like other lampreys, it has no jaws, but it has a round oral disc surrounding the mouth. Inside this it has several radiating rows of tiny, backward-facing teeth. There is a single nostril near the eyes. There are no gill covers and the seven gill openings are visible just behind the head. The fish has no scales or paired fins, but has two elongated dorsal fins, the hindmost of which nearly joins onto the small tail fin. The Caspian lamprey is a silvery-grey colour. Distribution The Caspian lamprey is an anadromous fish which spends its adult life in the Caspian Sea and migrates up the Volga, Sura, and other rivers to spawn. It was at one time a common fish caught in nets and fish traps in the lower Volga for extracting fish oil and making candles and later for human consumption. In the early 1900s, 15 to 30 million fish were harvested annually from the lower Volga. It is now an uncommon fish because its migratory routes have been disrupted by dams and construction projects and it can no longer reach its spawning grounds. Status The Caspian lamprey is listed as \\"Near Threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Damming of rivers in the mid-20th century has caused it to be cut off from its traditional spawning sites, but new sites have been found below the dams. The chief threat more recently has been the drying up of these streams caused by drought.

He was one of the original Governors of the Federal Reserve System, appointed in 1914, and served in that capacity for 22 years. He was a notable benefactor of the University of California, Berkeley, of which he was a graduate. Early life Miller was born in San Francisco on January 7, 1866. After receiving his degree from the University of California, he studied abroad in Paris and Munich Miller served as an instructor at Harvard University, and then spent one year each as an assistant professor at his alma mater and at Cornell University before being hired as a full professor of finance at the University of Chicago. While in Chicago, in 1895, Miller married Mary Sprague, daughter of a prominent Chicago businessman. University and political career In 1902, Benjamin Wheeler, President of the University of California, persuaded Miller to return to Berkeley as Flood Professor of Finance, and to take charge of the College of Commerce, predecessor of today's Haas School of Business. Miller remained there until 1913. In that year, Miller's classmate and friend, Franklin Knight Lane was appointed as Secretary of the Interior by Woodrow Wilson, and Lane persuaded Miller to come to Washington to serve as Assistant Secretary. In May 1913, Miller was also appointed as Director of the Bureau of National Parks. In 1914, Miller was appointed one of the original governors of the Federal Reserve System, which had been established late the previous year. The terms of the initial governors were staggered, and Miller received the longest initial term, ten years. Miller was the sole economist on the Board during World War I, and he supported policies which would reduce spending by the public, principally through higher taxes. He served 22 years in that capacity before retiring in 1936. He remained a significant benefactor to the University of California, and its Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science was both endowed by money left to the University, and named for him. His house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington DC, designed in 1924 by Baltimore architect Hall Pleasants Pennington, still stands at 2230 S Street NW.

Lenny is a shy and quiet film expert who works with his and Leo's mutual friend Kitjo, in a video store that rents out art films as well as a huge collection of pornographic films. As a subplot, we follow Lenny, who is trying to build a relationship to Lea, a girl that works in a local grill bar. Lenny asks Lea out to see a movie, but he chickens out when he sees her at the theatre. Lenny spends most of his time both at home and at work watching films. When Leo finds out that Louise is pregnant and wants to keep the baby, he becomes more and more aggressive. After witnessing a beating at a club he gets himself a gun. During a normal film night, Leo pulls a gun on Lenny and Kitjo. Leo berates Lenny for his life style, and expresses his disdain for his own life, feeling trapped in a dead end. Later Leo, in despair, hits Louise, and is threatened by her brother, Louis. When it happens again, Louise loses the baby. Louis takes a gruesome revenge by injecting HIV infected blood into Leo's body. Leo retaliates in an equally gruesome manner, shooting Louis in the stomach, then shooting off his own hand and letting the blood drip into Louis' wound. Leo then commits suicide. Kitjo brings Lenny to Leo's funeral but Lenny can't bring himself to go. Life continues, and Lenny casually tells Kitjo that he has been offered a job in another store, but does not think he will accept as he has to change his routine. Lenny seeks up Lea again. They both seem shy towards each other, and have trouble communicating. Lenny asks Lea out a second time; the final image of the film shows them alone in the grill/bar where Lea works thus ending the film on a hopeful note. Cast Bleeder features a relatively small ensemble cast, where the most of the actors, except Corfixen and Andersson, previously starred in Refn's debut film Pusher. Jensen only had a small role in Pusher, his role in Bleeder is more developed. Strangely, all of the lead roles have names beginning with L, except for Buric's role, Kitjo. * Kim Bodnia - Leo * Mads Mikkelsen - Lenny * Rikke Louise Andersson - Louise * Levino Jensen - Louis * Liv Corfixen - Lea * Zlatko Buriƒá - Kitjo * Claus Flygare - Joe * Marko Zecewic - Marko * Gordana Radosavljevic - Mika * Dusan Zecewic - Dusan * Ole Abildgaard - Video shop customer * Karsten Schr√∏der - R√∏de * Sven Erik Eskeland Larsen - Svend Soundtrack Music is used heavily throughout the entire film.

The episode was written by Peter Elkoff and directed by John Terlesky. Plot We open on the Suarez household at breakfast time. Betty and Hilda are shocked at how happy their father seems, they credit the rapid improvement to his nurse, Elena. Betty gets a phone call from Claire: It turns out that she has been shoplifting and she wanted Betty to bail her out by paying the $24.00 she owes the store. Betty does so and being concerned talks to Daniel about the incident, Daniel tells Betty Claire is about to turn 60. Betty suggests a surprise party to commemorate it. After seeing past home videos of an Angela Bower-like Claire celebrating the family while drinking at Christmas, Betty gets the idea taping a video tribute for Claire's 60th birthday by putting together a collection of clips from people who know her saying nice things, and some carefully clipped portions of these old home videos. Unfortunately, Betty's pet project would turn into a fiasco; first by confessions from Liz Smith and two of Claire's friends, followed by Amanda's not-so-happy congrats to Claire. Betty accidentally leaves the camera on at home and discovers some revealing footage about Ignacio, when Daniel is rewinding the tapes. In the footage Ignacio grabs Elena's butt. At home later that same day, Betty tells this to a very incredulous Hilda about what happened. The sisters are concerned that Elena might quit or even sue them due to harassment so they split up and talk to Ignacio and Elena separately with Betty walking with Ignacio while Hilda spent time at home with Elena. However the two assure the sisters that nothing was going on. Later that evening at the Suarez home during dinner, Hilda asks Betty to get Ignacio and Elena to come downstairs to eat and when Betty looks out the front door window she sees Ignacio and Elena kissing! It turns out that Ignacio has fallen for Elena and they are now a couple. This revelation not only upsets Betty and Hilda, but also causes Elena to end this romance, resulting in a devastated Ignacio blaming his daughters for not allowing him to do something he has not done since Rosa died - to start dating again. Claire asks Betty to go shopping with having discovered what Betty was planning for her birthday, she tells her that for once that she would like to spend more time with Daniel. After that conversation, Betty discovers that Claire was planning to shoplift again, but this time its Betty who gets caught after she grabbed the item out of Claire's hands. Claire would then return to clear up the mess with the store manager and Betty is free to go but this time around it would be Daniel who would pay the store after Claire was forced to stay there. After a long mother-son conversation, Daniel surprised Claire with a birthday dinner as a way to spend some time together, which included reliving those home videos featuring the two along with Alex. Later that afternoon, Betty goes over to Elena's place to explain why Elena dating Ignacio shocked her and Hilda. Betty then returns to the Suarez home with Elena that night to apologize over not letting Ignacio date another woman who would replace Rosa. A surprised Ignacio told his daughters that even though they still think of their mother, he assures them that Elena will not replace their memories of Rosa. Despite this, Hilda, who thought of Elena as a friend, feels slighted over Ignacio dating his nurse. Meanwhile, Daniel and Wilhelmina have difficulty adjusting to the new significant others in their lives. At the Rockefeller Plaza skating rink, the rivals, along with Connor and Molly, run into each other. After the foursome talk about what has happened after the events of the previous weeks, Daniel and Wilhelmina discover Connor and Molly talking about their past relationship, thus leading to Daniel and Wilhelmina to come up with a way to keep the new love lives with them. For Daniel, he hoped that doing something for Molly that Connor didn't do for her would work in his favor. Since she has always wanted to go to Tibet, he tries to book a trip there. That doesn't work out but he does find a nearby Tibetan restaurant. Unfortunately, it turns out that Molly and Connor were regulars there and all of the staff knew them and question who Daniel is and where Connor is. However, Molly later tells Daniel that despite this, the only person she wants in her life is Daniel. As for Wilhelmina, Connor prepares to take a business trip and asks Wilhelmina to keep an eye on his parrot, \\"Olivia Newton-Bird\\" (named after his childhood idol). Wilhelmina is not so keen about keeping the bird around and when Marc asked her about her true feelings about Connor, she blurts out \\"I Love Connor\\" and the parrot begins repeating it, upsetting Wilhelmina. In the end, when Connor returns from London, she says those same words, and Connor plants a long kiss on her.ABC Medianet.com- Retrieved on 01/26/09.

Axel Aubert (11 December 1873 ‚Äì 16 December 1943) was a Norwegian chemical engineer who served as Director-General of Norsk Hydro. Biography He was born in Kristiania (now Oslo, Norway). He was the son of Otto Benjamin Andreas Aubert (1841‚Äì98) and Hilda Thaulow (1846‚Äì1923).He studied engineering, with specialization in chemistry. He first studied at the Oslo Technical College. He studied engineering at the University of Berlin and earned a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Basel in 1895. He became the managing director of Engene Dynamitfabrik and Norsk Spr√¶ngstofindustri. In 1926 he was hired as Director-General (CEO) of Norsk Hydro. In 1940, while Norway was still neutral in World War II, Aubert was contacted by agents from French military intelligence regarding Norsk Hydro's production of heavy water (deuterium oxide) at its Vemork hydroelectric plant. Heavy water was an important material for Germany's nuclear weapon project and was only produced in any quantities at Vemork. He agreed to 'lend' Norsk Hydro's entire existing stock of heavy water to France for the duration of the war, observing that if Germany won the war he was likely to be shot. The French agents transported of heavy water secretly to Oslo, to Perth in Scotland, and then to France. Aubert retired as Hydro president in late 1941, but took over as the company's chairman and held this position until his death in 1943. Aubert emphasized the scientific and technological research. He was a member of the Executive Board of the Norwegian Industry Association from 1926 to 1934. Aubert was appointed Knight of the 1st Class of the Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1928. He also held the Belgium Order of Leopold, the French Legion of Honour, the Danish Order of the Dannebrog and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta.

The term refers to the entire Sakha epic tradition as well as its central epic. There are over one hundred poem epics recorded of which a small number have been published - each can contain several tens of thousands of verses. As originally performed the epics were narrated/sung not written, with each character or principle indicated by the tone and musicality of the performer's voice. The poems contain numerous literary devices including metaphor, simile, etc. and contain fantastical elements and archaic concepts. They are thought to originate from times when the ancestors of the Yakuts lived further south. Oral performance of an Olonho contains both spoken (descriptions) and sung (dialogue) parts. The epics were first recorded by westerners after the Russian conquest of Siberia starting in the 18th century onwards. Western exiles to Siberia during the 19th century made major contributions to the recording of these epic, and after the formation of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, government-backed organisations took part in collating and archiving versions of the epics. The best known Olonho \\"Nyurgun Bootur the Swift\\", consists of more than 36,000 verses, and has been translated into several languages. Performance and presentation In their original form, Olonkho was an orally presented epic 'sung' by a narrator. Difference characters, male/female, good/evil etc. were distinguished only by the performer's voice using intonation and melody. They contain archaic language, complex grammar, fantastic and symbolic imagery, as well as metaphor, simile, epithets, and hyperbole. The Olonho poems vary from a few thousand up to forty thousand verses in length Typically an Olonkho performance would last 7‚Äì8 hours, starting at the beginning of an evening and continuing throughout the night, during which time approximately 7,000-8,000 lines of verse could be performed. Some Olonho may have taken over a month to complete. The beginning of a performance starts with a poetic recitation - other descriptive parts of the epic also take this form. Dialogue is sung. Gestures and facial expressions also form part of the performance. In the 1930s, P.A. Oyunsky created written versions of the Olonhos in his own words, which are more suitable for reading, in part because he divided them into separate parts and songs. The Olonkho is still performed in the Sakha Republic. Nyurgun Bootur the Swift Nyurgun Bootur the Swift is the most well known and widely disseminated of the Olonhos. Platon Oyunsky created a written version of the tale in the 1920s and 1930s. In terms of its impact, it is well known by most Yakut speakers, is used in teaching in the Yakut language, and is one of the few Olonhos to have been translated into a variety other languages. It is even considered to be a key part of the Sakha identity. Oyunsky made an addition to the story when he added Taas kiele ogo, a character who speaks about a core principle of the Sakha world view. This principle is rooted in the belief that there are three separate worlds - the upper world (\\"gods\\"), the middle world (\\"people\\"), and the lower world (\\"devils\\"). It is considered taboo to upset the balance between the three worlds, for example when an inhabitant of one world fails to carry out their traditional role. In Oyunnsky's story, Taas kiele ogo becomes involved in the narrative because of an imbalance in the worlds, and proposed that Oyunsky added the character to the tale to warn of contemporary and future threats to the Sakha (such as nuclear war). Vladimir Derzhavin published the first Russian version of the tale, which was published in 1975. A Russian translation with notes was produced by Egor Sidorov in 2012. The first English translation was produced in the 1990s from the Russian translation by Vladimir Derzhavin. A translation of Oyunsky's text into English was published in 2014 as Olonkho: Nurgun Botur the Swift. Other translations include: Slovak (Milo≈° Krno, 2012); Kyrgyz (2014); Evenki (Krivoshapkin-Nyimkalan, 1996-2003). A version for children was produced in French by Jankel Karro and Lina Sabaraikina. A recording of the work by Yakut Gavril Kolesov was made in 1954 - and 8 hour recording with Kolesov was published by Melodiya in 1968. =Derivative works= Tuyaryma Kuo was created by Platon Oyunsky in the 1930s as a drama based on Nyurgun Bootur the Swift - it was first performed in 1937 at the Yakut National Theater. The main character, Tuyaryma Kuo, is a symbol of female beauty and character. Prose versions of the story in Yakut were made by Elena Sleptsova-Kuorsunnaakh in 2007, consisting of 201 tales. The work has also been converted to cartoon form, in Yakut, as well as English and German voiced versions. Etymology and related terms Associated with the Turkish verb \\"Olmak\\", meaning \\"to be\\". The Old Turkic word √ñl√∂n also means \\"saga\\". Whilst the term Olonho refers to the saga/epic itself, an Olonhohut is the person/storyteller who performs the saga, and Olonholoo- is the act/art of presenting/performing the story in the form of words and sound. The Buryat- Mongol epic ontkno are thought to have the same name origin. History=Origins of Olonhos and Sakha= The origins of the Olonho epics is of interest not only in the context of Yakutian history, but also in the wider field of comparative Turkic mythology. The Yakuts (whose ancestors are thought to originate in southern Siberia/central Asia) were broadly isolated from the rest of the Turkic world for approximately 1000 years - the Olonhos are thought to have retained many archaic aspects of ancient Turkic myths. In the late 19th century, thought that the Yakuts had their origin somewhere to the south of the River Lena, an idea which informed contemporary attempts at explanation of the origin of the Olonhos. In 1927 P.A. Oyunsky inferred that the Yakuts originated in the Aral Sea area, moving via the Transbaikal to the Lena River basin, using the Olonhos as a source themselves. Ethnographer G.V. Ksenofontov (1888‚Äì1938) proposed a southern origin for the Sakha - part of the evidence of this was a supposed oral chronicle preserved in the Olonho. Historian Georgiy Basharin also supported the idea of a southern origin, and suggested that the Olonhos arose together with the northern migration, and the people's struggle for 'nationhood'. In the 1950s A.P. Okladnikov proposed the Olonhos represented a memory of the culture of the 'Sakha' before the northern migration to the Lena basin, and dates to a period when the Sakha's predecessors lived near the Altai and Sayans with the Mongol's predecessors. Okladnikov claimed there was linguistic evidence for an origin of the Yakut language not in the mid Lena basin, but somewhere where other Turkic and Mongol peoples lived. He linked their origins to the western Baikal region, where the Orkhon-Yenisei script using Guligans and Qurykans lived, and suggested that those tribes ancestors were the Yakut's ancestors - so-called \\"forest peoples\\", who lived east of the Yenisei Kyrgyz in lowlands around the Selenga River, on the banks of Lake Baikal, and around the Angara River. In the 1970s G.U. Ergis suggested that the 7th century Orkhon Turks had folklore that corresponded to the beginnings of the Yakut's myths. In the 2000s I.V. Pukhov made a comparative analysis of the epics of the Altain and Sayan peoples, and the Yakutian Olonho, finding similarity with the Altain Maaday- Kara epic, and commonalities with most epics of Turkic-speaking peoples in the Altai region. Ye.M. Meletinskiy stated that the historical conditions of epic creation were those of a nomadic cattle breeding lifestyle, coupled with migrations, and conditions of rapidly forming military unions, conflicts, and other violence in a system of 'military democracy'. state that the plots, characters, etc. of the Olonhos well match such conditions. = Olonho research and translation= The Russian Academy of Sciences played a key role in the collection and publication of Olonho texts - though their primary purpose was the geographic and geological analysis of Siberia they also collected information about the region's inhabitants, and their cultures and languages. Early collectors of Sakha culture included Gerhard Friedrich M√ºller and Yakov Ivanovich Lindenau in the 18th century. During an expedition of 1842-5 biologist Alexander von Middendorff also collated a short section of the tale Eriedel Bergen, published in 1878, becoming the first published Olonho. A summary of Ereydeeh Buruuydaah Er Sogotoh by A. Y. Uvaroskiy was published in German translation in 1851 in the work √úber Die Sprache Der Jakuten. P. K. Maak was an official in the B√ºl√º√º region (Verkhnevilyuysk) in the 1850s and compiled the Olonholoon Oburgu in his Vil√ºyskiy Okrug Yakutskaya Oblast (1887). Tsarist exile V. L. Serosevskiy compiled important information on the Onlonho tradition in his monograph Yakuti, though he did not record any Olonhos. A. Hudyakov also compiled some Olonhos and other oral material during his exile in Verkhoyansk between 1867 and 1874, including Haan Cargƒ±stay, which was compiled as it was performed, and so represents the earliest useful source for the tradition. E. K. Pekarsky was exiled to the region between 1881 and 1905, initially in Taatta (Tattinsky District), there drawing on the rich local oral tradition of olonhohutlar (epics), algƒ±s√ßƒ±tlar (prayers), and oyuunlar (games). Helped by the local populace his compilation work continued until his death, producing records of folklore that continue to be important to later researchers. An anthology of Sakha folklore Obraztsƒ± Narodnoy Literaturƒ± Yakutov [Examples of Yakut Folklore], the first volume of which was published in 1907, include work by Pekarsky as well as other researchers, including material from a research expedition of 1894-6 funded by gold mine owner Aleksander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov. This work focused mainly on the central region of Yakutia, including Taatta, Amma (Amginsky District), Uus Aldan (Ust-Aldansky District), Mene Hanalas, √áurap√ßƒ± (Churapchinsky District), and Cookuskay. Material from other regions remained essentially uncollated due to transportation difficulties. The publication of the series Obraztsƒ± Narodnoy Literaturƒ± Yakutov was a cultural turning point in the compilation and study of the Olonhos. A Slovar Yakutskogo Yazƒ±ka [Sakha-Russian Dictionary] was published in 13 volumes between 1905 and 1930, also edited by Perkarskiy - examples of word usage drew on folklore and especially Olonho texts. Another exile S. V. Yastremskiy also made contributions to the study of Sakha culture. Having learnt the Sakha language he took part in the work funded by Sibiryakov, and translated full texts of Er Sogotoh, Kulun Kullustur, and S√ºn Caahƒ±n into Russian in the 1929 volume of Obraztsƒ± Narodnoy Literaturƒ± Yakutov. P. A. Oyuunuskay also made a very important contribution to the wider dissemination of the Olonho scholars. However, unlike previous researchers he did compile his version of the tales from the oral tradition, but instead wrote the Olonho in his own words - written between 1930 and 1937 Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu in nine episodes totalling 36,000 words. A ban on the publication of his works was not lifted until after Stalin's death in 1953 - his works were published 1959‚Äì60 in seven volumes; the fourth, fifth and sixth volumes formed the Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu‚Äôna. The Saha Dili ve K√ºlt√ºr√º Bilimsel Arastƒ±rma Enstit√ºs√º [Sakha Institute of Language and Cultural Research] was formed in 1934, establishing folklore archives. In the late 1930s it began field expeditions to record oral culture in the region. After the great disruption of the Second World War the institute was renamed to Saha Dilini, Edebiyatƒ±nƒ± ve Tarihini Arastƒ±rma Enstit√ºs√º olarak degistirilir. in 1947. In the 1960s and 70s focus of the institute switch to textual analysis rather than collation, Important works during this period include the Yakutskiy Geroi√ßeskiy Epos Olonho - Osnovnƒ±e Obrazƒ± [Main Characters of the Yakut Heroic Epics - Olonho] (V. Puhov, 1962); as well as O√ßerki Po Yakutskomu Folkloru [Essays on Yakut Folklore] (Ergis, 1974). Important later publications include Cƒ±rƒ±bƒ±na Cƒ±rƒ±lƒ±atta Kƒ±ƒ±s Buhatƒ±ƒ±r (1981), an Olonho whose main protagonist is a woman; and Kuruubay Haannaah Kulun Kullustuur (1985) published in a free Russian translation alongside the Sakha with the aim of both being as close to the original as possible. In 1997, Olonhos were recognized as part of \\"Humanity's Oral and Intangible Heritage\\" by UNESCO. Since the 1990s Olonho have been used by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Sakha as teaching aids to primary school children - however some of the language of folklore (idioms, proverbs, riddles etc.) is considered too difficult, and simplified, shortened texts have been prepared. By 2003, around 150 full Olonhos had been collected of which 17 had been published. Around 300 Olonhos are thought to have been known to olonhosuts in the first half of the 20th century. As of 2009, only one Olonho, the Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur‚Äôdur had been translated into French and English. First translated into Russian in 1947, the French text was based upon the Russian translation, and summarised the tale. The text with Russian and English translations was published in 2002.

Its hydrolase activity is Mn2+-dependent with a conserved His-Asp (HD) motif. In E. coli, SpoT protein consists of 693 amino acids. SpoT belongs to the RSH protein family. It is bifunctional, has both hydrolase and synthase activities. When relA is deleted, E. coli still can produce (p)ppGpp by SpoT. SpoT can sense many sources of nutrient stress other than amino acid starvation and to respond by limiting hydrolase. The acyl carrier protein (ACP) binds to the TGS domain of SpoT; this binding is probably influenced by the ratio of unacylated ACP to acylated ACP in the cell. Fatty acid starvation leads to a shift in the balance of the two SpoT activities in favor of synthesis. Phosphate starvation is sensed by SpoT hydrolase to elevate (p)ppGpp, which induces IraP, a RssB antiadaptor that antagonizes RssB activation of RpoS turnover, thereby inducing RpoS.

He was known chiefly in the entertainment industry for his imitations in full costume of many famous actresses and other women, including Tallulah Bankhead, Mae West, Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, √âdith Piaf, and Carmen Miranda.\\"T. C. Jones, Impersonator Of Actresses\\", obituary, The Washington Post (Washington, D. C.), September 28, 1971, p. C4. ProQuest.Scheuer, Philip K. \\"T. C.

ProQuest Historical Newspapers, Ann Arbor, Michigan; subscription access through The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. In 1959, the American magazine 'Time described Jones as \\"probably the best female impersonator since vaudeville's late famed Julian Eltinge\\". Early life and education T. C. Jones was born in 1920 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Prior to his entertainment career, he attended Bethany College in West Virginia to study for the Campbellite ministry, but midway through his education there he was \\"bitten by the acting bug\\" after spending one summer performing in plays in a stock company.\\"Who's Who in the Cast: T. C. Jones\\", biographical profile in Playbill (New York City), program for Jones's Broadway show Mask and Gown, John Golden Theatre, September 23, 1957, pp. 35-36. That stage experience convinced him to leave Bethany and return to Pennsylvania to enroll in drama school at Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh. Soon, with the outbreak of World War II, Jones joined the United States Navy and served as a pharmacist's mate at naval hospitals in Philadelphia and in Jacksonville, Florida. Professional career After his discharge from naval service, Jones moved to New York City in the fall of 1943, hoping to resume his plans for a stage career. He secured a job as a \\"chorus boy\\" in Willie Howard's Broadway musical My Dear Public before obtaining more substantial parts in the productions Jackpot and Sadie Thompson.\\"T. C. Jones\\", Internet Broadway Database (IBDB), The Broadway League, Manhattan, New York. Retrieved September 2, 2020. During times when he was not being cast in additional plays, Jones served as an assistant stage manager, a position that afforded him many opportunities to observe and study closely the speech patterns, mannerisms, and costume choices of a variety of actresses.\\"T.C. Jones, 50, Impersonator of Famous Actresses, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, September 27, 1971, p. 38. ProQuest. Soon he began imitating those performers and impressing his theatre colleagues with his talent for mimicry, so much so that they encouraged him to display those abilities to audiences. By 1946 Jones began working professionally in New York as a female impersonator, first with the Provincetown Players in Greenwich Village.Senelick, Laurence. The Changing Room: Sex, Drag and Theatre. Abingdon-on-Thames, England: Routledge, 2000, p. 355. Cast as \\"Fat Fanny\\", he performed his first impersonations on stage in the Players' production of E. E. Cummings' play Him. He later recalled how simply his performance specialty started at that time: \\"One night...another of the players brought me some...material that was hilarious. The only catch was that it more or less required a woman to deliver it. He suggested I do an impersonation.\\" Public reaction to his performance was so positive that it led Jones to develop a nightclub act featuring his female characters. Jones next moved to the Jewel Box Revue in Miami,Wilmeth, et al, p. 2554 where he presented and refined his impersonations of stars such as Tallulah Bankhead, Katherine Hepburn, √âdith Piaf, Claudette Colbert, and Bette Davis.Senelick, pp. 355‚Äì358. Jones's performances, especially his portrayal of Bankhead, attracted the attention of theatrical producer Leonard Sillman, who cast him in New Faces of 1956, a revue directed by Paul Lynde. Although some people had strongly advised Sillman not to cast Jones, the producer stated, \\"I never think of T.C. as a female impersonator, as a man imitating a woman. T.C. on stage is simply an extraordinarily talented woman.\\"Quoted in Senelick, p. 356. Jones in the revue entered the stage by descending a staircase to the tune \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" and, as Bankhead, acted as mistress of ceremonies.Senelick, p. 356. The show proved to be a hit, running for 220 performances.Botto, et al, p. 285. The following year Jones starred in Mask and Gown, another Broadway revue. Jones toured with Mask and Gown nationally and internationally, but it was unsuccessful.Wallraff, p. 87. Jones in the latter half of the 1950s appeared in regional theatrical productions, including The Man Who Came to Dinner. He also played the nightclub circuit, performed in lounges of major Las Vegas hotels, and recorded two albums: the original cast recording of Mask and Gown (1958) and T. C. Jones ‚Äì Himself! (not released until 1961). Jones recorded too an album with the original cast for New Faces of 1956 (1956), and he released the single \\"Champagne Cocktails\\" b/w \\"Sunless Sunday\\" (1957). On television, after performing twice on The Ed Sullivan Show, he was cast in several television series in the 1960s. He portrays the psychotic serial killer Nurse Betty Ames in \\"An Unlocked Window\\", a 1965 Edgar Award-winning episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, as well as a similar type role in \\"Night of the Running Death\\", a 1967 episode of The Wild Wild West.Tropiano, pp. 57‚Äì58. Jones performed too in several Hollywood films in that period. He appears in a male role opposite Jayne Mansfield in the 1963 sex comedy Promises! Promises!, in the role of Henry with Mamie Van Doren in the 1964 comedy 3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt, and in dual male/female roles as Mr. and Mrs. Ace in The Monkees' 1968 satirical musical Head.Krafsur, et al, p. 461.Barrios, p. 329. Despite his additional work in films and on television, Jones in the 1960s continued his regular stage and nightclubs shows. The Los Angeles Times, for example, announces the following in its August 6, 1965 edition: \\"Wardrobe and wigs valued at more than $100,000 will be worn by T. C. Jones, female impersonator, when he opens Tuesday in his one- man revue, 'That Was No Lady,' at the Ivar Theatre.\\"\\"Impersonator Due\\", Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1965, p. C8. ProQuest. Personal life and death Jones in the 1950s married Connie S. Dickson, a former actress and competitive fencer, who owned a chain of beauty parlors in San Francisco.\\"A Top Female Impersonator And Mimic Coming\\", South China Morning Post (Hong Kong), June 13, 1962, p. 7. ProQuest. She, in fact, met Jones for the first time when he visited one of her parlors in search of a new wig for his performances. The couple maintained a home in San Francisco for many years, sharing it at one point with 19 Siamese cats. They later relocated to Covina, east of Los Angeles. where they were residing at the time of T.C.'s death. In September 1971, after being treated for cancer for two years, Jones died at age 50 at the City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, California. He was survived by his wife Connie and interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Three years after Jones's death, writing for Newhouse News Service, the correspondent and theatre critic William A. Raidy reflected on the entertainer's talent and shared a personal experience that underscored how effective and convincing Jones was in his performances: ReferencesBibliography * Barrios, Richard (2003).

(painted red in the style of the ET 65) The Umbau-Wagen or Umbauwagen was a type of German railway passenger coach operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) which appeared in the mid-1950s. The name means \\"rebuild coach\\" and they were made by rebuilding or converting former state railway (L√§nderbahn) compartment coaches, many of which were over 30 years old.  Origins  After the Second World War, the DB, like the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in East Germany, had a serious deficit of stock as well as a very aged fleet of coaches, a situation which lasted into the 1960s. In the 1950s the bulk of the fleet for local and Eilzug (semi-fast) trains was still made up of 22,345 four-, six- and eight-wheeled compartment and open coaches of the former Prussian and Bavarian classes from the period before and after the First World War. The few city coaches bought for Eilzug services at the beginning of the 1950s were nowhere near enough to replace and modernise the very outdated stock of passenger coaches and which was also costing considerably more to maintain. The levels of steel production and that of other raw materials of the newly formed Federal Republic did not permit a full replacement of the fleet in those days. Like the DR in the 1960s the DB was forced as early as 1953 to carry out a modernisation of pre-war coaches - plainly and simply called an Umbau or rebuild.  Six-wheeled coach, Class 3yg(e)  In summer 1953, the Bundesbahn Head Office tasked the Bundesbahn Central Office (Bundesbahn-Zentralamt or BZA) in Minden together with various coach building firms with designing a rebuild of the pre-war coaches, of which only the wheels and the undercarriage were to be used. The coach body was to be replaced by a completely new one. In 1953 the workshop (Ausbesserungswerk or AW) at Ludwigshafen built the first trials coach from an old L√§nderbahn wagon. In January 1954 the coach went into full production at the shops in Hanover, Karlsruhe and Limburg an der Lahn. From these wooden-bodied compartment coaches only the underbody (which was rebuilt to a common length of 13 metres), the running gear and the brake system was used. Four-wheeled coaches were given a third, centre axle and the wheelbase varied on individual coaches, depending on their original design, between 7,500 and 7,900 millimetres. The centre axle was given side-play in order to achieve good curve running qualities. The rebuilds were derived from four- and six-wheeled L√§nderbahn coaches as well as pre-war Reichsbahn stock. A corrugated steel floor (Wellblechboden) was eventually welded onto the old running gear. Apart from that a new steel coach body was manufactured, which extended as far as the buffer beam and was 3.2 metres wide. The doors at each end of the coach, designed as pivoting external doors, were inset towards the centre line of the coach. The windows were of the sliding window type, but they were not the same as the UIC standard design. One window section was reserved for the WC. The interior accommodation of the third class coach had plastic, cushioned seats. In second class, the seats were arranged in a 2+2 configuration and covered with fabric. Between the seating compartments was a small vestibule. All the coaches had steam heating equipment, the majority were also fitted with electric heating (this can be told from the suffix \\"e\\" in their class designation). Three coach classes were produced. The third class coaches (C3yg(e)) had seven windows per side and 66 seats arranged in a 2+3 configuration. The mixed 2nd/3rd class BC3yg(e) had 20 third class seats and 18 second class seats. There was also a semi-luggage coach CPw3yg(e) with 26 seats and a luggage section. As a result of class changes in the 1956 summer timetable the coaches were regraded, resulting in B3yg(e), AB3yg(e) and BD3yg(e) units. As early as 1954 more than a thousand coaches had been placed in service. By 1958 the number grew to 6,500 units, or 25 per cent of the entire coach fleet in the Bundesbahn. Their permitted top speed was initially 90 km/h, which was then the standard for passenger trains; in the 1970s this was raised on several coaches to 100 km/h. The electrical system on the 3yg(e) coaches only permitted close-coupled pairs to be formed, albeit any combination was allowed apart from BD3yg + BD3yg. The permitted combinations were: AB + AB, AB + B, B + B, AB + BD, B + BD. The only requirement was that the close-coupled ends had to face one another. So the six-wheeled Umbauwagen coaches always ran in pairs. Numerous coaches were also equipped with a control cable for use in push-pull trains; this was indicated by adding the secondary suffix \\"b\\" (AB3ygeb etc.). Their use in push-pull trains was usually in combination with Silberling (e.g. BDnf) or centre door (BDymf) driving coaches, because no Umbau driving coaches were ever procured. These coaches were deployed in local passenger trains on main and branch lines. Not until the middle of the 1980s were the last coaches, which served commuter traffic at the BASF factory in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, taken out of service. Several have survived to the present day as construction train units. Other coaches may be found in the ownership of museum railways.  Eight-wheeled coach, Class 4yg Umbauwagen of Class B4yg, the Lippe State Railway Following the success of the six-wheeled Umbauwagen, the DB intended that the large numbers of eight-wheeled compartment coaches from the early L√§nderbahn fleets which were still available, should be converted on the same principles. To achieve this the undercarriages of the old coaches were converted to a standard length. In 1956 a trials coach was built - a mixed class BC4yg, which had a length of 19.5 metres. In 1957 two more prototypes of the later class AByg 402 already had Minden-Deutz bogies. The end doors and the special design was the same as the six-wheelers. There were also three classes: B4yg, AB4yg and BD4yg. Between the inset end doors were five windows (four in the first class section) and then a pair of pivoting external doors as a centre entrance, which was also inset. Full production began in 1957 with the B4yg-56 (Byg 515). The following series in 1959 were classed as the B4yg 58 and Byg 58a (later Byg 515 and 516). The coaches had 72 passenger cushioned, plastic- covered seats. The AB coaches were fitted with 24 first class and 36 second class seats and were built from 1958. They had a somewhat different floor plan with various locations for the WCs. These coaches were called the AByg-58 and AByg-58a (later AByg 503 and 504). The half-luggage vans were initially supplied as BPw4yg-56 (later BDyg 531). Further batches went into service as the BPw4yg-56a (BDyg 532) and BPw4yg-56b (BDyg 533). The basis of the first coaches even included those with Prussian standard bogies, although these were converted from friction bearings to roller bearings. The next 300 coaches were given the originally American Schwanenhals bogies, an amazing parallel with the 1964 eight-wheeled Reko-Wagen coaches of the Reichsbahn in East Germany. All the remaining yg class coaches were then equipped with Minden-Deutz MD 36 bogies. All the coaches were cleared to run at up to 120 km/h. The 4yg coaches were preferred for semi-fast services (Eilzugverkehr). Not until their later years were they cascaded to branch lines. The last coaches were retired in the early 1990s, because it was no longer worth while converting the doors to automatic locking. The last areas of operation for these coaches were the Lahn Valley Railway (Lahntalbahn), the Cologne area and the Eifel. The coaches experienced one final highlight during the Wende, the period after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989/90, when they were used in a large number of extra express trains. It is of note that these coaches ran their entire lives in the bottle green or chromium-oxide green livery typical of the DB for the 1950s and 60s and were neither painted in ocean blue and beige nor in other colours (apart from e.g. those used with Class ET 65 multiples in Stuttgart suburban services ‚àí see below).  Trailer coaches  Several Umbauwagen ended up in the Tegernsee-Bahn for use in Eilz√ºge from Munich to Tegernsee. Some of the 3yge coaches were painted in red, the DB's standard colour for traction units, as trailer cars for ET 85 multiples and designated as EB 85 and 885. Some 4yg coaches were redesignated as Class EB 65 and 865 as trailers in Stuttgart suburban services coupled with ET 65 and 465 multiples. A special type of Umbauwagen was the prisoner transport coach of Class Z 56, which was developed along the lines of the 3yg, but with only four-wheels. Six coaches of this type were built (numbers 10 061 to 10 066). The coaches had 15 cells with 36 seats and an office for the guards. The coaches were retired in 1963 after the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) declared that the prisoner transport between prisons by rail was contrary to the constitution. At least 3 of the coaches were converted into a department vehicle. Sources *Weigert/Gress: Umbau- und Rekowagen von der DB und DR, Eisenbahnkurier Special 82, EK Freiburg.

It is a popular summer tourist resort for Spanish people. History There is archaeological evidence of a 7th-century Phoenician necropolis located in the farmhouse of Casa de la Vi√±a; there was also once a Punic-Roman city called Maenoba or Menoba (Cerro del Mar), at the mouth of the river Velez, which was a production and distribution centre for the famous Roman garum. Despite this, we can consider Torre del Mar a relatively new settlement, founded at the start of the 16th century, a settlement protected by a small castle from the Nasrid dynasty, known as Alcozaiba Tower. This was renamed \\"Torre de la Mar\\" (tower of the sea) in 1487 when it was taken by the Catholic Monarchs. At this time it was ceded to Ruiz L√≥pez de Toledo who refused the offering and donated it to the city of Velez-M√°laga, this was later confirmed in the year 1571 when King Charles I confirmed the permanent concession of the castle to Velez- M√°laga. During the 16th and 17th centuries, a deep re-modelling of the Islamic defence site was undertaken. However, it wasn‚Äôt until 1730 that important reformation of the castle was undertaken to adapt it for artillery, with the aim of relieving, as much as possible, the effects of the attacks from the British naval fleet. It was in this latter century, in 1704, that the waters of this coast witnessed a bloody naval conflict (the Battle of Velez-M√°laga) between Franco-Spanish and Anglo-Dutch fleets as part of the Spanish War of Succession. This battle was settled without a clear winner, despite the numerous casualties suffered on both sides. Throughout the 18th century, a gradual urban development was started, with the building of houses in the areas surrounding the castle. These were grouped around the farmstead of the Casa de la Vi√±a, where a small neighbourhood was built. As well as the building of new houses, in 1748, the hermitage of Our Lady of las Angustias was erected. The basic pillars of the economy of Torre del Mar was agriculture, fishing, and trade, this last one was facilitated by the enormous inlet, although the lack of port structures greatly limited activity since the goods had to be transported by barge. Despite the great efforts made by the council of Velez in this area, these efforts were fruitless due to a lack of money and the determined opposition of the city of Malaga where they tried to favour the sale of their own products. What is true is that Torre del Mar became the port of the Axarquia region and the majority of its agricultural produce (wines, raisins, oil, almonds, dried figs, citrus fruit etc.) was exported to the major ports in the north of Europe. The 19th century saw a decline in commercial growth due to the lack of necessary infrastructure, at the time of increased exploitation of sugar cane. The preindustrial activity in this area started in 1796, the year in which Jos√© Garc√≠a Navarrete asked for authorisation to build a sugar mill. Afterwards, Ram√≥n de la Sagra, philosopher and business owner, propelled the creation of the Sociedad Azucarera Peninsular (Peninsular Sugar Society) in 1845, with the objective of starting the industrialisation of the sector, and in 1846 he built a modern sugar factory in the old mill of Torre del Mar. However, this has to be sold to the Larios family due to financing issues. The Larios family ran the Factory Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen in Torre del Mar for 134 years, while holding great economic and political power throughout the whole county. From 1988, sugarcane production began to decrease drastically and in 1991 Torre del Mar had its last harvest. In the mid-19th century, Torre del Mar had a council, although this was for a brief period of 4‚Äì6 years (1842-1848), this is recorded in Pascual Madoz‚Äôs \\"Geographical, Statistical, Historical Dictionary of Spain and its overseas possessions\\". In those times the region had 739 people living in 174 houses. There were many stores, a large place for salting products alongside a salt store, a primary school, a church dedicated to the calling of Saint Andrew the Apostle, a hermitage dedicated to Our Lady of Las Angustias (to which the entrance has recently been recovered), a cemetery as well as a number of wells and mills. In those days Mar, Emmedio and San Andr√©s streets already existed. The Malaga-Almeria road was built around the year 1869; this determined the urban structure of Torre del Mar which was moved closer to the sea. In the first decade of the 20th century the railway station was built (the current bus station) and at the end of 1908 the train arrived for the first time, unfortunately this stopped running in 1968. Between 1864 and 1889, Torre del Mar had a lighthouse at the mouth of the river Velez, but this was destroyed for a while. Later, in 1930 another lighthouse was built in what is now Tor√© Tor√© Avenue; this lighthouse has a range of 12 miles. It had to be closed due to the urban boom, and another was built right next to the beach, but this was only used for a very short time as in 1976 a new lighthouse was built, right next to the previous one and measuring 25 metres in height. In the first years of the 20th Century, we see the beginnings of what will be the new economic direction of Torre del Mar. It is at that time that some spas were opened with the intention, cautiously at first, of attracting some of the emerging tourists. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the second half of that century that this phenomenon, now a mass activity, altered the physiognomy completely by making the number of inhabitants and built-up areas grow. This has encouraged a very high tourist population which suffers strong oscillations depending on the season. Tourism also caused a change in customs and ways of thinking as contact with tourists meant the Spanish population began to share the nonconformist and liberal mentality of Europe at this time, causing the rupture of the out-of-date, traditionalist, Spanish culture. Places of special interest=Torre del Mar train station= This compact train station from 1904 has a rectangular body and a single hall with two floors and two side sections running along the sides of the main building. It has an eclectic decoration, using neo-mudejar style brickwork for the edges of the doors, openings and corners. It also has overhanging eaves and gabled roofs with green glass tiles. The lower, central section has two doors on each side of the lower floor and openings over each door. The side sections are only one story high and have similar entrances. The building served as the railway station for the suburban line from Malaga to Velez-M√°laga. =Farmhouse Casa de la Vi√±a (House of the Vineyard)= This hundred-year-old house stands at the foot of the mount Monte de la Vi√±a in the original town centre of Torre del Mar, right next to the millenary channel of the fort house. The inhabitants abandoned this place to move to the vicinity of the old castle, which was out of service in the mid-19th century. The building is built around a central, quadrangular patio, which is communicated with the rooms and stores, the latter being situated in the east and south of the building. There is a three-floored pavilion on the north fa√ßade with a four-sided sloped roof. On the west side is the long, main facade which has two heights with uniform spaces and barred windows. =Boat Club= The building was designed by Francisco Estrada Romero, influenced by the organic architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. It is small-scale with two floors and two different areas: One social and one for boats. The floor is arranged around three circles of differing sizes and a number of rectangles. Of the many different elements the glass tower in the shape of an inverted cone stands out, its function was to control the races and auxiliary lights. The building is an example of the modern movement from the second half of the 20th century, and manifests the unique uses of a maritime town such as Torre del Mar. =The Old Castle of Torre del Mar= This is the castle-fort which is the original centre of what is now Torre del Mar. This coastal bastion was once small in size and its purpose was to watch the coast and protect the boats that docked in the natural port. Over time the fortification got further from the sea due to the progression of the ground. In 1730, an important reformation was carried out shaping it into what nowadays we know as the castle of Torre del Mar. In this reformation, they added a second front made up of two small curtains joined to the artillery battery which occupied the centre, and on the ends, two towers which already existed in the old space. The castle also boasted the military building and stores, its second great function being the storage of agricultural products from all over the county, (such as raisins, wine and citrus fruit) ready for export. The castle of Torre del Mar is an emblematic icon forming part of the current history of the town. =Entrance to the Hermitage of Las Angustias= All that is left of the hermitage is the entrance, which was erected by Pedro Gonz√°lez, founder of the brotherhood, in the early second half of the 18th century. It later disappeared at the end of the 19th century, and the space has been occupied by houses since then. The classic baroque entrance is made of stone slabs from Cerro del Pe√±√≥n. The structure is marked by two pillars composed of the base, shaft and capital. While being restored, a bare-brick lintel was added as well as a small alcove. The hermitage occupied the full length of the houses that now stand and was entered from the side. The entrance is both an historical and artistic element, and is testimony to the old hermitage in this place. =Home of the Virgin of La Victoria= This home was constructed by the Larios family, possibly around the year 1907. This building was once called 'The building of Ave Maria' and was dedicated to charity. Later, in 1936, it was given over for use as schools and given the name 'Home of the Virgin of La Victoria'. The building is reminiscent of types of hospitals at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. The main body is rectangular, where the door is found with steps leading to the main floor. It is made up of two floors and a semi-basement which lifts the building up. Behind the main body six parallel pavilions extend, joined together and to the main body by a corridor, with the centre free for a patio with vegetation, at the end of which is a small chapel. The whole place has large windows and large dimensions bringing light to the rooms. The building forms part of the contemporary history of Torre del Mar, and as such, the collective memory of the inhabitants. =House of Larios, Torre del Mar= The house of Larios dates from 1888 and also forms part of the sugar factory complex. It was used to house the offices of the personnel and the Factory engineer‚Äôs house. In the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs, the building was used by the sugar cooperative. This building is simple and functional, in a regional style with mudejar influences, it is characteristic of the end of the 19th century, and is very similar to the factory building. The building has two floors with two pavilions joined by a transverse nave. In these pavilions you can observe the overhangs with wooden, neo-mudejar footings and glazed tiles. Of particular note is its great height and large bays which were decorated with bare brick in the same style as the corners of the building which nowadays are covered but can be seen from outside. There is a small entrance porch with two iron poles and decoration, on either side is a set of tiles from Seville dating from the nineteenth century. These tiles make up the image of the Immaculate Conception, in the style of a small altar which comes from one of the villas of Paseo Larios street, which has since been knocked down. =Villa Mercedes= Located in Paseo Larios street, this is the only regionalist house in this area from the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Previously this street boasted a number of this kind of house, each enclosed by walls. This building has two floors and an attic in the regionalist, neo-mudejar style. It is made up of different sections with a tower rising on the left side, in the style of the 16th century towers. At the front there is a porch with two Tuscan columns with sculpted cyma, it also has a particularly interesting stucco border with a relief showing motifs of plants. The fa√ßade is decorated by the main balcony and windows with decorative forged iron barring. The tower is three storeys tall with twin bay windows. The roofs are edged with beams or corbels. This is an excellent example of a second home of a landowner from the industrial era towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. =lighthouse on the promenade= The lighthouse was built around the 1950s due to the distancing of the coast from the previous lighthouse. The building is industrial in style and has a square base supporting a rectangular prism with a number of windows opening to the outside of the lighthouse. It is topped by an entablature or moulding where the catadioptric system was kept. The lighthouse was built with polygonal stone slabs and the corners and windows were also edged with stone blocks. The inside is organised with an axis with a spiral staircase to go up to the top. Next to the tower is a small building which was used to house the electrical generator. This was a single-story rectangular building with a wooden, gabled roof and an inset window on one side. The corners and windows are edged with bare brick. It represents the fishing activity of a place which is closely linked to the sea. =Tor√© Tore Avenue Lighthouse= This was built in 1930, as you can see on the weather vane. The building is industrial in style and has a square base supporting a rectangular prism with a number of windows opening to the outside of the lighthouse, currently the lower windows are covered. It is topped by an entablature or moulding where the catadioptric system is kept. The lighthouse was built with polygonal stone slabs and the corners and windows were also edged with stone blocks. The inside is organised with an axis with a spiral staircase to go up to the top. Next to the tower is a small building which was used to house the electrical generator. This was a single-story rectangular building with a wooden, gabled roof and an inset window on one side. The corners and windows are edged with bare brick. =The sugar factory of Torre del Mar (The sugar refinery)= It was around 1796, when Jos√© Garc√≠a Navarrete started producing sugar in Torre del Mar, yet it wasn‚Äôt until 1846, under Ram√≥n de la Sagra, that the new Factory was built in the Cuban, industrial style using steam machinery. Consequently, due to an economic fiasco, it would be handed over to the Larios family under the name 'Factory of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen'. The factory was used commercially until 1991, which saw the final production season. It was a fundamental element in the socioeconomic development of our town for generations. The building ended up being converted into an indisputable icon which is emblematic of the industrial patrimony of the coast of Malaga. In 1993, the factory‚Äôs central building was restored to preserve it, this is the part that currently can be visited and is eminently for cultural use. Near this part are two original fireplaces which were part of the factory. There is also restored evaporation machinery and replica steam machinery used to obtain sugar. =Saint Andrew‚Äôs Parish Church= Due to the urban development and population increase of Torre del Mar at the end of the 1960s, the town outgrew the old neo-mudejar church, so the drastic decision to build a new temple was made. The new building was in the modernist style, in the shape of a basilica, the layout and decoration was as prescribed by the second Vatican council predominantly reflecting simplicity, austerity and good feeling. The interior is completely diaphanous with no columns or pillars obstructing the view of the single altar, this was possible due to the new possibilities of concrete. Traditional decoration and ornaments are considered obstacles to 'correct' worship, which led the Church to minimalism, in which the figures of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary should be focal and clear. The impressive size of the crucified Christ is a work of the master of religious painting, Francisco Buiza Fern√°ndez. =La Casa Recreo (recreational house, Tourist Office)= This is an ancestral home dating from the 19th century; it was a point of reference in the style of urbanisation in Torre del Mar. Nowadays, it is reformed and it sits between two infill buildings in the shape of a 'T' with a garden area in the front. The building has two floors and an original gallery has been preserved which was found in good condition prior to the reformation works. Currently, on the lower ground, the exhibition and help-desk are located. This leaves the upper floor for the department offices for tourism. As for the central part of the building, a glass covered patio was planned, around which the different departments are distributed. The standout features are the large wooden windows. There are views from the upper floor, looking out directly over the promenade and the sea. The building is clearly reminiscent of the kind of architecture of housing which is closely linked to areas of leisure for the bourgeoisie of the era, who enjoyed the rooms on the weekends and in summer for entertainment and relaxation.

He studied at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1810 and obtained degrees of BA in 1814 and MA in 1820. He was ordained before obtaining his MA, and was a curate in Avebury, Wiltshire before becoming rector of Bleadon and Kingston Seymour, Somerset, in 1820. He was elected as a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1828, writing papers between 1831 and 1849, mainly on the geology of the west of England, particularly Cornwall and Devon. He explored the caves of the Mendip Hills and helped with Banwell bone cave. In his parish life, he objected to music in church services and was criticised for the lack of a village school in Bleadon as well as for his scruffy personal appearance.

R. James. The story tells the tale of an introverted academic who happens upon a strange whistle while exploring a Knights Templar cemetery on the East Anglian coast. When blown, the whistle unleashes a supernatural force that terrorises its discoverer.Whistle and I'll Come to You on the Channel 4 film website The story was first published in 1904 in Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, the first collection of ghost stories that James published based on tales he had written as Christmas entertainments for audiences of friends and selected students at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he was provost.Pfaff, Richard W., \\"Montague Rhodes James\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Online Edition). Oxford University Press. September 2004. . Retrieved 15 August 2010. The first adaptation was made by the BBC in 1968. It was adapted and directed by Jonathan Miller and broadcast as part of the BBC arts strand Omnibus.David Kerekes, Creeping Flesh: The Horror Fantasy Film Book. London: Headpress, 2003. . 42‚Äì44. This production inspired a new yearly strand of M.R. James television adaptations known as A Ghost Story for Christmas (1971‚Äì1978, 2005‚Äì2006). A new adaptation of Whistle and I'll Come to You, written by Neil Cross and directed by Andy de Emmony, was made by the BBC in 2010. Both adaptations use James' story as a basis, but alter a number of aspects of the tale. 1968 adaptation Jonathan Miller adapted his 1968 version as part of the BBC arts strand Omnibus, which consisted mainly of arts documentaries so the dramatic adaptation was an unusual move; David Kerekes notes that this probably explains Miller's documentary-like introduction to the film. Ian McDowell notes that the adaptation itself changes a number of aspects of James' story, turning the academic, described as \\"young, neat and precise of speech\\" into a bumbling, awkward, middle-aged eccentric.Ian McDowell, \\"It Came from the BBC Vault\\", H.P.

James: Supernatural Storyteller, television documentary, BBC Four, Christmas 2005 Professor Parkin, a stuffy Cambridge academic, arrives for an off-season stay at a hotel somewhere on the English east coast. Preferring to keep to himself, Parkin spends his stay walking along the beach and visits a local graveyard, which has become overgrown and unkempt. While there, he spots a small object protruding from a grave which is partly undermined by the edge of the cliff. He uncovers it and finds it is a bone whistle, which he keeps. When walking back along the shore, he turns twice and sees a dark silhouetted figure standing still in the distance in front of a setting sun, appearing to watch him. Later, in the calm of his hotel room, he cleans and inspects the whistle, revealing a carved inscription: \\"Quis est iste qui venit\\" (\\"Who is this who is coming?\\"). He blows the whistle and a windstorm begins outside. Later that night, Parkin is kept awake by mysterious noises in his hotel room. At breakfast the following morning, another guest at the hotel, a retired Colonel, asks Parkin if he believes in ghosts. Parkin responds in a typically academic fashion, dismissing such beliefs as little more than superstition. However, that night, Parkin appears to have disturbing dreams of a spectre pursuing him on the beach. His nerves are not helped when, the following morning, he is informed by a maid that both of the beds in his room have been slept in ‚Äì even though Parkin only slept in one. Increasingly disturbed, he searches a book for answers. That night, he is awakened by a sound like flapping sheets. As he sits up in bed, the sheets from the other bed across the room move and then rise up into the phantom from the shore. The disturbance wakes the Colonel, who comes to his aid. Parkin sits in stunned terror at what he has just witnessed. = Cast and characters = * Michael Hordern ‚Äì Professor Parkin * Ambrose Coghill ‚Äì Colonel * George Woodbridge ‚Äì Hotel Proprietor * Nora Gordon ‚Äì Proprietress * Freda Dowie ‚Äì Maid =Reception= This version is highly regarded amongst television ghost story adaptations, and described by Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute as \\"A masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast.\\"Mark Duguid, Whistle and I'll Come to You on the British Film Institute website A BBC Press Release for its repeat showing in 1969 stated that it was an \\"unconventional adaptation...remarkable, both for its uncanny sense of period and atmosphere, and for the quality of the actors' performances.\\"Helen Wheatley, Gothic Television Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006. . 42. The performance of Michael Hordern is especially acclaimed, with his hushed mutterings and repetition of other characters' dialogue, coupled with a discernible lack of social skills, turning the professor from an academic caricature into a more rounded character, described by horror aficionado David Kerekes as \\"especially daring for its day\\". The stage journal Plays and Players suggests that Hordern's performance hints that the professor suffers from a neurological condition called the \\"idea of a presence\\".Plays and Players, Issue 16, Hansom Books, 14 Much of the script was improvised on location with the actors.  2010 adaptation  John Hurt in the remake of the same scene.

This adaptation removes the whistle of the original James story, but hints at Robert Burns' original Scottish folk song \\"Oh, Whistle, And I'll Come To You, My Lad\\", which Hurt's character recites at the beginning of the story to his wife and is played over the end credits.Whistle and I'll Come to You, imagedissectors.comOlly Grant, \\"John Hurt interview: Whistle and I'll Come to You, BBC One\\", Daily Telegraph, 23 December 2010 =Plot= In this version, retired astronomer James Parkin goes on a respite holiday after leaving his aged wife (who appears to be in the advanced stages of senile dementia) in a care home. When revisiting one of their favourite coastal towns during the off-season, he goes for a walk on the beach and discovers a wedding ring in the sand, which he keeps. As he is walking back along the desolate beach to his hotel, he senses he is being followed and sees a motionless white-clad figure in the distance behind him. However, as he walks further, the seemingly motionless figure gets closer to him each time he turns to look back. Nervous, he runs back to the steps that exit the beach, but as he turns around again, the figure has disappeared. Back at his hotel room, he cleans the ring he has found and sees it is inscribed with the Latin words for \\"Who is this, who is coming?\\", which he reads out loud. Later that night, he is awoken by noises. Initially this seems to be caused by a storm outside, but he then hears scratching noises inside his room. He goes back to sleep with his bedside lamp turned on, but when he awakens again later, the lamp is inexplicably off again. The next morning, he dismisses the scratching noises as a rat and the lamp as having a loose connection, both of which he asks the hotel receptionist to investigate. He begins to venture out to the beach again, but once he gets there he becomes hesitant and decides to spend the day elsewhere instead. That night, Parkin falls asleep while reading in bed. He is woken in the night again by strange noises, and finds his bedside lamp is once again turned off even though he fell asleep with it on. This time, someone tries to enter his hotel room. Though they are unsuccessful, he feels shaken by the incident. Eventually, he manages to fall asleep again, but has a disturbing dream that involves his wife, a young child, and the figure on the beach. Early the next morning, he tells the hotel receptionist that he believes one of the other guests tried to get into his room but she tells him that he was alone in the hotel all night with no other guests or even staff present. Though his scientific mind refuses to acknowledge the existence of the spiritual or supernatural (he refuses to believe in the idea of his wife's spirit being trapped in her almost functionless body like a \\"ghost in the machine\\"), he becomes increasingly uneasy during the remainder of his stay at the hotel. Later that day, he is again followed by the ominous white-clad figure on the otherwise empty beach. Panicked, he runs back to the hotel and decides to leave the following day. The night before he is due to depart, Parkin struggles to relax in his hotel room. He picks up the ring he found on the beach, but quickly tries to dispel any irrational thoughts he is having and eventually falls asleep. Later in the night, he is once again awakened by the scratching sounds and then something trying to enter his hotel room. This time, a spectral apparition enters his room from underneath the door. As his bedside lamp goes off again by itself, Parkin shuts his eyes in terror and implores the apparition to leave him alone, but as he opens his eyes he sees a figure sitting on the end of his bed. The figure appears to be his wife, who angrily says over and over again \\"I'm still here\\" as she crawls towards him. Parkin tries in vain to escape, his fingernails scratching on the wooden floor making a sound identical to the scratching noises he kept hearing. The following morning, the receptionist finds Parkin lying dead in his bed, while his wife seemingly vanishes from the care home.Whistle and I'll Come to You at BBC Online.

Route description SR 101 begins in the south at an intersection with US 1 in Kittery, just northeast of its intersection with SR 236, where US 1 Bypass meets its northern end. Near this intersection is the exits 2 and 3 interchanges from the Maine Turnpike. The route heads northwest, intersecting local roads as it passes east of the town of Eliot. SR 101 intersects with SR 236 and enters the southern tip of South Berwick. The highway continues a short distance northwest before crossing the Piscataqua River into Dover, New Hampshire. Upon crossing into New Hampshire, SR 101 ends and the road continues as unnumbered Gulf Road. Motorists following this road west will soon come across signage leading to New Hampshire Route 4 towards downtown Dover. No advance signage exists in the reverse direction, with Gulf Road simply transitioning to SR 101 upon crossing into Maine. History The SR 101 number existed as early as 1925, when New England Interstate Routes were still in place. Former SR 101 ran between Augusta and Rockland, from NER 20 (now US 201) to NER 1 (now US 1). When the New England road system was removed, SR 101 was redesignated as SR 17 and the number remained out of use until 1940. The current SR 101 was first designated in 1940, with the initial stretch following the modern alignment from Kittery to South Berwick, where it ended at SR 103, near the current intersection with SR 236.

He has called Cindy the most positive influence on him as a lacrosse player. Beginning early in his playing career, his maternal grandmother, Gene Waseigijig, encouraged him to play for ‚Äúa native team‚Äù and he has cited her as one of the reasons he chose to compete internationally with the Iroquois Nationals rather than with the Canadian national team.

A rebellious writer and Romantic lyricist poet that rejected despotism, UCD PRESS, The First Russian Political √âmigr√© his writings in his autobiographical notes and in his letters to other Russians provide a historical context to the evolution of Russian intellectual thought of the 1860s and 1870s. Pecherin's writings present the Russian Zeitgeist Partial Answers, Journal of Literature and The History of Ideas, Volume 2, Number 1 (June 2004) of the period artistically. Early years Pecherin was born in the town of Velyka Dymerka in the Russian Empire (modern- day Ukraine) on 27 June 1807. Peoples.ru He was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church. Taghmon Historical Society Vol. 4 Pecherin was attracted to the moral and religious ideology of Utopian Socialism. He entered Moscow University, as a student of classical languages, and he wrote manuscripts of poetry that circulated among his university companions. Pecherin was sent abroad for two years on a government scholarship to complete his education. In 1835, after returning to Moscow University from his travels, even before completing his degree, Pecherin was appointed as Professor of Greek Language and antiquities. After one term, in 1836, he left Russia to pursue radical politics in Europe. In a letter explaining to the authorities, Pecherin stated that he would never return to a country among whose inhabitants it was impossible to find the imprint of their Creator. He is considered by some to have been the first Russian political emigrant. Self-exile In 1840, after four years of exploring Europe, at times reduced to complete poverty, Pecherin unexpectedly converted to Catholicism and became a monk in the Redemptorist Order. The Order's mission was to work among the poor. He lived in a monastery in Clapham, near London and later in Ireland. In 1855, he was the last person to be tried for blasphemy in Ireland. The trial, which was a major public event, took place at Kingston (now D√∫n Laoghaire) for allegedly burning a bible. Despite many witnesses, the case was not proven. A referendum in 2018 finally removed blasphemy from the Irish constitution. Pecherin's philosophy influenced Fyodor Dostoevsky and it is believed that Dostoevsky's anti- materialist \\"one secluded thinker\\" in The Idiot is an allusion to Pecherin.Dostoevsky: The Miraculous Years, 1865-1871 by Joseph Frank, p. 201. In the movie The Russia House, starring Sean Connery, Klaus Maria Brandauer's character \\"Dante,\\" a Russian scientist, quotes Pecherin. Later life In 1862, after 20 years of service as a missionary, Pecherin left the Redemptorists. He spent the last 23 years of his life serving as a chaplain at the Mater Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. During his time in Dublin, he wrote his memoirs, Apologia pro vita mea (Notes from Beyond the Tomb). His memoirs were so controversial, critical of both the Russian government and the Catholic Church of the time, that they were not published in Russia until a hundred years after his death. They contain an account of his experiences in Europe, particularly in Belgium, after leaving Russia, and his fight against poverty. Pecherin died in Dublin on 29 April 1885.

The fortress was defended by Dutch, Austrians, British, Hanoverians and Hessians that supported the Pragmatic Sanction. After seven years of brutal war, both sides in this conflict were suffering from weariness of the war. Although tentative peace initiatives had been put forward, neither side was yet willing to make meaningful concessions.Browning. Austrian Succession, pp.317-319. The capture of Bergen op Zoom would be a signal defeat for the Dutch and would open the door for an invasion of the Dutch Netherlands. The siege was the center of attention in Europe and news of it followed eagerly in numerous reports with the Pragmatic allies confident that the fortress would withstand the French and the French determined it should fall.The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 17, London, 1747. pp. 328-329, 401-402, 409-412, 464-465.

Saxe calculated that his numerically inferior opponents would not be able to adequately defend two fortified cities at once.Browning: Austrian Succession, p. 318 Needing to protect Maastricht from the threat posed by De Saxe's forces, neither the British commander, the Duke of Cumberland, nor the Austrian commander, Batthy√°ny, felt able to move to support Bergen op Zoom. For the Dutch this proved the unwillingness of her allies to assist them in their time of need, while their British allies felt the Dutch demands for greater allied effort in this war was absurd - reasoning that the Dutch had not formally declared war on France.Browning: Austrian Succession, p. 321. Bergen op Zoom was a fortress town with a population of some 5,000 people and an initial garrison of 3,000 under the command of the 86-year-old, vigorous Governor General Cronstr√∂m. The circumference of the fortress ramparts was about three miles with ten bastions covered by five hornworks. The intervals contain twenty one ravelins which are covered by stone lunettes. Much of the surrounding country was marshland. Additionally, an entrenched camp at Roosendaal, defended by three forts: Moermont, Pinsen, Rovers, and trench lines connecting to the city on the northeast, were held by the Prince of Hildburghausen with 20 battalions of infantry and 14 squadrons of cavalry that could reinforce or relieve the garrison. Because of these lines and some lesser lines to the west, Bergen op Zoom could not be completely invested, or surrounded. Further, because of the low-lying ground, large areas fronting the defenses were inundated by the Dutch using various sluices and channels and this prevented any French approach in those parts of the field. The fortress was the chief work of the great Dutch engineer, Menno van Coehoorn. It was believed to be impregnabled' Espagnac, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Damarzit de Sahuguet. Histoire de Maurice, comte de Saxe, duc de Courlande et de Semigalle, Vol. 2, Paris, MDCCLXXV. p.283. and was considered the strongest fortification in Dutch Brabant.Cust, Edward. Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century, Vol.II, London, 1858, p. 120 Bergen op Zoom had withstood two previous sieges, the first in 1588 and a second in 1622. It could be supplied with munitions and provision by boats using two navigable canals each defended by its own fort.Skrine: Fontenoy, p.335. Bergen op Zoom was well- garrisoned and well-supplied, so the siege by French forces did not cause immediate alarm in the Netherlands.Lodge p.260‚Äì71 The fortress had access to the sea, and the Dutch navy supplied the fortress without serious interference by the French. The French, since they were the besieging force and controlled much of the surrounding area, were also well-supplied and reinforced. However, the allies had an army under Prince Waldeck nearby which posed a continuing threat to French supply lines.Skrine: Fontenoy, p.336 Siege Low Countries: War of the Austrian Succession. Bergen op Zoom is in the upper center. Ulrich Fr√©d√©ric Woldemar, Count of Lowendal The various bastions, ravelins and lunettes of the fortification were all named and would mount over 230 cannon and mortars during the course of the siege. The principal effort of the French concentrated on the bastions Coehoorn and Pucelle. Facing the French trench lines, the sides of Coehoorn were flanked on its right by the ravelin Antwerpen and on its left the ravelin Diden. Between the bastion and Antwerpen was the lunette Holland and between the bastion and Diden was the lunette Zealand. To the left of Diden was the lunette, Utrecht, and left of that the bastion Pucelle. The area between the bastions of Coehoorn and Pucelle was chosen partly because the ground was drier and partly because this was the only part of the fortress not directly covered by additional lines as was the northwest and south east sides of Bergen op Zoom. This area would witness the most continuous and fierce combat of the siege.Wittje, G.. Die wichtigsten Schlachten, Belagerungen und verschanzten Lager vom Jahre 1708 bis 1855. Leipzig und Heidelberg, 1861. pp. 270 to 275. =Laying the parallels= On the night of the 14 July the French opened the trenches using 2,400 workers supported by 10 companies of grenadiers and 5 battalions of infantry.d'Espagnac: Histoire, p.283. Lowendal used 12,000 of his troops to man the trench lines and deployed the other 18,000 as an army of observation.Browning: Austrian Succession, p. 319. The first parallel was laid overnight of the first day, 400 paces out from the fortifications. On 17 July the second parallel was dug and over the night of 22 July the third parallel was completed. Batteries were raised and the French artillery began to bombard the defenders on the 20 July. Each of the trench parallels were laid and their saps pushed forward by the French, drawing ever closer to the fortress. The fourth parallel was finished between 26 and 28 July and a fifth laid up against the works on 8 September.Wittje, G.. Die wichtigsten Schlachten, Belagerungen und verschanzten Lager vom Jahre 1708 bis 1855. Leipzig und Heidelberg, 1861, pp. 270 to 275. Various stormattacks followed on the outer works of the fortress, but the defences held firm. The French had also dug mines under the redoubts, ravelins and lunettes to blow them up. They were in their turn countermined by Dutch sappers. On 25 July Loudon's Highlanders, also known as the 64th Foot, made a sally from Fort Rover which took and destroyed a major French battery.Browne, James, A history of the Highlands and of the Highland clans, Volume 4, Glasgow, 1840, p.241.

Unfortunately for the French, the Dutch still possessed several lunettes in the area, which were used to bombard the French held covered way.

After two months of intense fighting French were finally able to bombard the main wall. Saxe sent Lowendal 12,000 reinforcements to make up for serious losses, while the garrison received reinforcement and reflief from troops within the lines of the fortified camp.Cust: Annals, p.120. On 8 August the allied army, formerly under Waldeck but now commanded by Prince Schwartzenberg, in conjunction with the corps of Hildburghausen, made a badly coordinated and poorly executed night attack on the French in an attempt to break the siege. Even so, the allies were repelled with difficulty and Schwartzenberg continued to harass and intercept French supply convoys taking a convoy on 14 August.Skrine: Fontenoy, p.336. =Storming the breaches= French soldier of the R√©giment de Normandie 1740s Taking and looting of the fortress of Bergen-op-Zoom. Lowendal felt an urgency to take the town because autumn rains were coming. The rains would cause certain failure of the siege. Lowendal, advised that several breaches in the defensive fortification were practicable,Cust, Edward. Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century, Vol.II, London, 1858, p. 121The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 17, 1747, London, p.410. stormed the city in a coup de main attack on the early morning of 18 September 1747. The Dutch commanders did not perceive the breaches as practicable and had taken no particular cautionary measures. The city garrison consisted of nine battalions: two Scots battalions, Colyear and Majoribanks; Waldeck and Saxe-Gotha, Lewe, Evertsen, Holstein-Gottorp, Deutz and van Rechteren.SHAT,A4 86 envoi Wagner, piece 9c -Copie des archive de la Haye. French columns accompanied by laborers to clear any obstacles were prepared for each breach. In the center were 14 companies of grenadiers supported by 13 battalions of the main body of infantry. On the French left the bastion Coehoorn would be assaulted by 6 companies of grenadiers and 6 battalions. On the right, 7 companies of grenadiers from the regiments of d'Eu, Coincy, Chabrillant, la Trasne and 50 dismounted Royal dragoons would assault the bastion Pucelle supported by the first battalions of the regiments of Normandie, Montboissier and d'Eu followed by 3 brigades of sappers, 20 gunners, 300 workers. In addition the first battalions of the regiments Montmorin, Royal de Vaisseaux and Beauvoisis would march in support of the attack.d' Espagnac: Histoire, p. 327. The Enfants Perdus, or Forlorn Hope, consisted of 200 volunteers, 2 companies of grenadiers supported by a battalion of infantry and were destined to attack Diden, the half-moon, or ravelin.The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 17, 1747, London, p.410, Lownedhal's account to Saxe. At 4 a.m. a brief signal bombardment of the ravelin was made and a contingent of French Grenadiers gained the fosse, penetrated the breaches and then opened a sallyport which allowed the rest of the troops inside where they formed up in the gorge of the ravelin and then gained the ramparts without opposition. The French then seized the gates and entered the city sword in hand. The garrison commander, Cronstr√∂m, and his officers had reportedly still been asleep in their beds when most of the officers were captured by the French.Lodge p.290 The brigade of Loudon's HighlandersBrowne: A history of the Highlands and of the Highland clans, Volume 4, pp. 240‚Äì241, \\" ...from 1450, are now reduced to 330 ...\\".

The Dutch and their allies suffered some 3,000 casualties during the storm and the sack while French losses were only 479.Skrine, p.337. Also, Browning: Austrian Succession, p.320. Some 200 fortress guns were captured and 17 fully loaded supply ships in the port were taken. After the fall of the town, the garrisons of the forts of Rovers, Pinsen and Moermant in the lines outside the city surrendered.The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 17, 1747, London, p.410. Following the coup de main, the French soldiers lost their discipline and sacked the town and, although the sack ended quickly, several thousand civilians were reportedly killed or injured. Lowendal declared his regrets but European opinion was outraged. Saxe defended Lowendal to Louis XV saying, \\"There is no middle course, either you must hang him or make him a Marshal of France.\\"Browning: Austrian Succession, p. 320 Aftermath Model of Bergen op Zoom in 1747 With the capture of Bergen op Zoom, the French now had control of the entire length of the river Scheldt.Cust: Annals, p. 122. The defeat caused a rift between the Dutch and British governments.Cust: Annals, p. 122. It now dawned on the British that they had demanded too much of the military capability of the Dutch Republic and that its ability to resist the French had been exhausted.Lodge p.290‚Äì92 The Dutch on the other hand were furious about the fact that her allies were unwilling to relieve the city. The city was key to opening up the Dutch Republic and Hanover to a potential French invasion. Lowendal was made a Marshal of France for his exploit. Along with the defeat at Lauffeld, the defeat at Bergen op Zoom forced the British to re-enter negotiations, and to take seriously the ongoing talks at the Congress of Breda, leading to a treaty in 1748.Browning: Austrian Succession, p.329.

Upon the Croatian populace's arrival on what is currently modern-day continental Croatia in the early 7th century, Croats used Slavic names and corresponding naming customs. With modernization and globalization in the last century, given names and surnames have expanded past typical Slavic traditionalism and have included borrowed names from all over the world. However, although given names vary from region to region in Croatia and can be heavily influenced by other countries' names, surnames tend to be Slavic. Croatian names usually, but not always, consist of a given name, followed by a family name; however certain names follow naming customs that diverge from the norm. Naming customs have been a part of Croatian culture for over 400 years. Historically, Croatian royalty were all given traditional titles of nobility designating them with certain privileges and social standing; the titles were usually followed by the full name or simply their surname. In modern-day society, families all over the country use honorific titles when speaking to family members who are older, or as a sign of general respect. Traditionally only close friends or direct family members address themselves by their first names.  Style and form of address = Nobility = During 925 - 1102, the Kingdom of Croatia's nobility had various titles and forms of address that varied from region to region and position to position. The King of Croatia was afforded the right of choosing his royal handle, for example in 1941, Prince Adimone, Duke of Aosta, took the name of King Tomislav II upon his succession to the Croatian throne. Titles were exclusive to members of the King's High Court and included the Queen consort and the following: # Duke (the highest ranking a noble could receive in his majesty's court) # Marquess (a lineage rank through European peerage) # Count (a successive rank to the Marquess) # Baron (title of honor bestowed on a civilian whose actions warranted the title) The titles were usually followed by the full name or more commonly by their surname. = Government = The Government of Croatia, which includes its executive branch and parliament, employ selected titles usually corresponding to position or powers. Titles are also bestowed on members of the Croatian Judiciary.  Prime ministerial style  # Premijer (Prime Minister (PM) of Croatia; the title is usually followed by the surname of the incumbent) # His/Her Excellency (For the preface of the PM on foreign travel or amidst diplomatic work)  Presidential style  # Predsjednik (President of Croatia; the title is also usually followed by the surname of the incumbent)  Parliamentary style  # Mister/Madam Speaker (Speaker of the Croatian Parliament; title followed by full legal name)  Judicial style  # His/Her Honor (For judges on the Judiciary of Croatia and Constitutional Court of Croatia) = Honorific titles = It is common etiquette in Croatia to address members of society with honorific titles as a sign of respect and societal distance. It is only with close friends or direct family members that first names are used. Honorific titles include the following and are usually followed by the surname of the addressed. # Gospodin (corresponding to Mr. or Sir in English and Monsieur in French) # Gospoƒëa (corresponding to Ms. or Mrs. in English and Madame in French) # Gospoƒëica (corresponding to Miss in English and Mademoiselle in French)  Croatian given names = History = Since their 7th century arrival in today's homeland, Croats have used Slavic names. Through the following centuries, foreign names were also accepted, especially those that mark Christian faith. However, Slavic names remained dominant until the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì63) when the Catholic church decided that every Christian should have Christian name instead of native one. This lasted until the 19th century, when Croats again started to use neglected traditional names‚Äîespecially those of medi√¶val Croatian kings and dukes. More recently, as a result of globalization, unusual and exotic names of various cultures have also gained in wide spread popularity. = Frequency = According to 2011 Census in Croatia, the most frequent male names are Ivan, Marko, Josip, Stjepan and Tomislav, and the most common female names include Marija, Ana and Ivana.http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/najcesca-imena-hrvatskoj-ivan-marija-a- prezime-horvat-clanak-589970 = Traditional Croatian names = Some common Croatian names of Slavic origin include: Feminine: Berislava, Blaga, Blagica, Bogdana, Bogomila, Bogumila, Borka, Borislava, Bo≈æena, Bo≈æica, Bo≈æidarka, Branimira, Branka, Buga, Cvita, Cvijeta, Danica, Davorka, Divna, Dragana, Dragica, Dragomirka, Dragomira, Draginja, Dragina, Draga, Dra≈æenka, Dubravka, Dunja, Hrvoja, Hrvojka, Jasenka, Jasna, Ljuba, Ljubica, Mila, Milica, Miljenka, Mislava, Mira, Mirjana, Mirka, Misirka, Mirna, Mojmira, Morana, Nada, Neda, Nediljka, Nevenka, Ognjenka, Ranka, Ra≈°eljka, Ratka, Ru≈æa, Ru≈æica, Sanja, Slava, Slavica, Slavenka, Smiljana, Spomenka, Srebrenka, Stanislava, Stana, Stanka, Snje≈°ka, Snje≈æana, Sunƒçana, Sunƒçica, Tjeha, Tihana, Tihomila, Tuga, Vedrana, Vera, Verica, Vjera, Vesna, Vjekoslava, Vlasta, Vlatka, Zdenka, Zlata, Zora, Zorica, Zorka, Zrinka, Zrina, Zvjezdana, Zvonimira, Zvonka, ≈Ωeljka, ≈Ωivka Masculine: Berislav, Berivoj, Blago, Bogdan, Bogumil, Bogoljub, Bogomil, Bojan, Boris, Borislav, Borna, Bo≈æetjeh, Bo≈æidar, Bo≈æo, Bratislav, Budimir, Branimir, Brajko, Branko, Braslav, Bratoljub, Cvitko, Cvjetko, ƒåaslav, ƒåastimir, ƒåedomir, Dalibor, Damir, Darko, Davor, Desimir, Dobroslav, Dobrovit, Domagoj, Dragan, Drago, Dragoslav, Dragutin, Dragomir, Dra≈æen, Dr≈æiha, Dr≈æislav, Godemir, Gojko, Gojislav, Gojslav, Goran, Grubi≈°a, Hrvatin, Hrvoj, Hrvoje, Hrvoslav, Kazimir, Ka≈æimir, Jasenko, Klonimir, Kre≈°imir, Kr≈°evan, Lavoslav, Ljubomir, Ljudevit, Milan, Mile, Milivoj, Milovan, Miljenko, Mirko, Miroslav, Miro≈°, Mislav, Mladen, Mojmir, Mutimir, Nediljko, Nedjeljko, Nenad, Ognjen, Ostoja, Ozren, Predrag, Pribislav, Prvan, Prvoslav, Prvo≈°, Radimir, Radomir, Rado≈°, Rajko, Ranko, Ratimir, Ratko, Rato, Radovan, Radoslav, Slaven, Slavi≈°a, Slavoljub, Slavomir, Smiljan, Spomenko, Srebrenko, Sreƒáko, Stanislav, Stanko, Strahimir, Svetoslav, Tihomil, Tihomir, Tje≈°imir, Tomislav, Tomo, Tvrtko, Trpimir, Vatroslav, Veƒáeslav, Vedran, Velimir, Veselko, Vidoslav, Vjekoslav, Vjenceslav, Vi≈°eslav, Vitomir, Vjeran, Vladimir, Vlado, Vlatko, Vojmil, Vojnomir, Vuk, Zdenko, Zdeslav, Zdravko, Zorislav, Zoran, Zrinko, Zrinoslav, Zlatko, Zvonimir, Zvonko, ≈Ωarko, ≈Ωelimir, ≈Ωeljko, ≈Ωivko = Christian names = The most frequent Croatian family names by county Aleksandar, Ana (Anna), Ante or Antun (Anthony), Andrija (Andrew), Danijel, David, Dominik, Edvard, Filip, Franjo (Francis), Fridrik, Grgur (Gregory), Henrik, Ilija (Elijah), Ivan (John), Jakov (Jacob), Josip (Joseph), Juraj (George), Karlo (Charles), Katarina (Catherine), Kristofor, Lav (Leo), Ljudevit (Lewis), Lovro (Lawrence), Luka (Luke), Marko (Mark), Marija (Mary), Matej (Matthew), Mihael, Mihovil, Mihajlo (Michael), Nikola, Nik≈°a, Niko, Mikula (Nicholas), Pavao (Paul), Petar (Peter), Pero (Peter), Rikard, Sebastijan, Silvestar, ≈†imun (Simon), Stjepan, Stipan, Stipe (Stephen), Toma (Thomas), Vasilije, Vilim (William), Vinko (Vincent). = Borrowed or foreign names = Due to globalization and remnants of historical significance (i.e. Croatia‚ÄìItaly relations, Illyrian Provincial nationalism, etc.) many people in Croatia have American, French, Swedish, Finnish, German, Italian and English first names (given names). However, due to the alphabetical limitation of the Croatian language many names take on new pronunciations, are respelled, or are restructured to comply with the country's naming customs. Uncharacteristic names are never declined in the Croatian language, and by nationality of origin include: (American): Thomas, Charles, Max, Jacob, William, Isabella, Emma, Madison, Matthew, Alexander; (German): Hans, Peter, Stephan, Gerhard, Edith, Gabriele, Monika, Wolfgang, Dennis; (French): Jean-Louis, Lucus, Marie, Cl√©ment, Camille, Baptiste, L√©onie, Julien, Fran√ßoise, Jeanne; (Italian): Alessandro, Andrea, Alessia, Claudia, Christian, Riccardo, Luca, Matteo, Leonardo, Sofia ...  Croatian family names  Family names started to appear among Croats in the 12th century. Since the Council of Trent, both the given and family names would be written down. =Origins= Croatian family names have five different origins: ; Given names, matronymics and patronymics : Aniƒá, Bla≈æeviƒá, Ivanec, Mariƒá, Stipanov ... ; Professional names : Kovaƒç (blacksmith), Klobuƒçar (hatmaker), Lonƒçar (potter), Tkalƒçiƒá (weaver), Stolar (carpenter) ... ; Nicknames : Debeljak, Crniƒá, Obad ... ; Toponyms : Duvnjak (from Duvno), Kupre≈°ak (from Kupres), Bosanac (Bosnian), Posavec (from Posavina), Zagorec (from Hrvatsko Zagorje), ... ; Ethnic designation : Hrvat, Horvat, Hrvatin, Horvatinƒçiƒá ... (Croat), ƒåerkez (Circassians), ƒåeh (Czech), Maƒëar (Hungarians) ... : = Frequency = The 2011 Croatian census registered the following as the most frequent Croatian family names: # Horvat # Kovaƒçeviƒá # Babiƒá # Mariƒá # Juriƒá # Novak # Kovaƒçiƒá # Kne≈æeviƒá # Vukoviƒá # Markoviƒá  Naming customs = Northern customs = Naming customs vary region to region in Croatia, and differ slightly from that of typical naming customs, such a Brazilian and Portuguese customs; Croatian naming customs closely mimic that of Roman naming conventions. For instance in the Brod-Posavina, Slavonski Brod, Dubrovnik, Pazin, Krapina, Osijek, and Karlovac regions, naming traditionally, but not always, follows this structure: Example: If \\"Darko Stevnich Horatio Horvat\\" is the full legal name of a resident of Brod-Posavina tradition would dictate that his family name would be \\"Horatio\\" and not the assumed \\"Horvat\\" (which is another given name, usually named after the family's patriarch); this person would go by \\"Darko (given name) Horatio (family name)\\". = Southern customs = In selected regions of Meƒëimurje and ≈†ibenik, naming custom diverge again. Many residents traditionally go by their middle names, and reserve the full declaration of their names for formal occasions such as court, marriage or death. Example: If \\"Kolinada Blaga Lonƒçar\\" is the full legal name of a resident of one of these regions, she could choose to go by, and legally declare her name as \\"Blaga Lonƒçar.\\" In this region of the country usually the following mechanism is used in naming, one that has been in practice for over four centuries: # The oldest son is named after the father's father. # The oldest daughter is named after the father's mother. # The second oldest son is named after the mother's father. # The second oldest daughter is named after the mother's mother. Other offspring of father are either named after favorite aunts or uncles or, sometimes, after the saint of the day they were born.

It is located in Berlin and Wernigerode. As an upper federal agency, it is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Health. It was founded in 1891 and is named for its founding director, the founder of modern bacteriology and Nobel laureate Robert Koch.  Tasks  The Robert Koch Institute monitors public health. Its core tasks include the detection, prevention and combatting of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases in Germany. The institute advises the specialist public and government, e.g. on preventing and tackling infectious disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in 2011. The institute is also in charge of health monitoring and health reporting in Germany, covering non- communicable diseases: in large monitoring studies, RKI monitors the health status of adults and children in Germany. RKI scientists regularly publish their results in scientific journals and in their own reports, e.g. the \\"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Annual Report\\", special reports on different diseases in Germany (influenza, tuberculosis, cancer), \\"Health in Germany\\". Apart from that, the Institute publishes several scientific periodicals, such as the monthly \\"Journal of Health Monitoring\\", \\"Epidemiological Bulletin\\" and the \\"Bundesgesundheitsblatt\\" (co-publisher). The institute is also home to various National Reference Centres and Consultant Laboratories. Around 15 scientific committees, such as the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) and the Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (KRINKO), are also based at the Robert Koch Institute. RKI staff are involved in various international research projects and programmes, helping to tackle urgent public health problems such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2011. RKI also cooperates closely with international partners like the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The institute hosts two WHO reference laboratories (polio and measles/rubella) and has been the WHO Collaborating Centre for Emerging Infections and Biological Threats since 2016. RKI is the only federal institute in Germany in the field of human medicine with a BSL-4 laboratory (which was opened in 2015 and has become fully operational in summer 2018).  Location and organisation  The Robert Koch Institute has its headquarters and two additional sites in Berlin (Nordufer, Seestra√üe, General-Pape-Stra√üe) as well as a site in Wernigerode/Harz region. RKI's focus is on research, some 450 of about 1,100 members of staff are scientists. The institute consists of the following units. * Department for Infectious Diseases * Department for Epidemiology and Health Reporting * Department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology * Centre for Biological Threats and Special Pathogens * Methodology and Research Infrastructure * Project groups (Immune Defense Mechanisms; Acinetobacter baumanii; Epidemiology of Highly Pathogenic Microorganisms; Epidemiological Modelling of Infectious Diseases; Virulence Factors in Salmonella and Campylobacter) * Junior research groups (Microbial Genomics; Metabolism of Microbial Pathogens) * Staff units (e.g. Global Health and Biosecurity; Genetic Engineering) * Central services (e.g. Human Resources) A museum presenting the life and work of Robert Koch as well as of the institute today is located at the main building at Nordufer site and open to visitors from Monday to Friday. The mausoleum with Robert Koch's remains can also be visited. History The institute's founding director and namesake, Nobel laureate Robert Koch The institute was formed by the later Nobel Prize laureate Robert Koch in 1891 as the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases. Koch lived until the age of 66, when he died of a heart attack in Baden-Baden, on 27 May 1910; his ashes were buried in a mausoleum in his institute on 10 December 1910. The director from 1917 to 1933 was Fred Neufeld who discovered the pneumococcal types. Neufeld's Deputy Director from 1919 to 1933 was Walter Levinthal. During the Third Reich, the Institute took part in atrocities committed in the name of national socialism, such as experiments into typhus vaccines at Buchenwald Concentration Camp in 1941, resulting in the deaths of 127 of the 537 inmates involved. The institute was renamed the Robert Koch Institute in 1942. Following the collapse of the regime, only few scientists ever had to face legal consequences, and their crimes were largely ignored for the remainder of the century. In 1952 the Institute became a subordinate agency of the Federal Health Agency. Following the German reunification in 1990, some former GDR health agencies were (partly) integrated in the Robert Koch Institute. One of them was the Institute for Experimental Epidemiology in Wernigerode/Harz region, which is still an RKI location today. In 1994, the Federal Health Agency was dissolved, and RKI became an independent federal agency within the portfolio of the German Federal Ministry of Health. Two of the former Federal Health Agency's institutes, the Berlin-based AIDS centre and the \\"Institut f√ºr Sozialmedizin und Epidemiologie\\" (Institute for Social Medicine and Epidemiology), were attached to the Robert Koch Institute. The RKI ‚Äì which until then was occupied with infectious diseases alone ‚Äì now had a second big topic: non-communicable diseases and their risk factors. In 2020, the institute was responsible for publishing contact tracing smartphone apps as part of the German government's to COVID-19. Presidents Since its inception in 1891, the RKI has had 15 individual presidents. * Robert Koch (1891‚Äì1904) * (1904‚Äì1913) * Friedrich Loeffler (1913‚Äì1915) * Fred Neufeld (1915‚Äì1933) * (1933‚Äì1934) * Richard Otto (1934‚Äì1935) * (1935‚Äì1945) * (1945‚Äì1949) * (1949‚Äì1952) * Georg Henneberg (1952‚Äì1969) * Hansj√ºrgen Raettig, Karl-Ernst Gillert, Hans Kr√∂ger, Wilhelm Weise (board of directors) (1970‚Äì1984) * (1985‚Äì1990) * Hans Kr√∂ger, Joachim Weltz, Hans Hoffmeister (acting) (1990‚Äì1996) * (1996‚Äì2008) * J√∂rg Hacker (2008‚Äì2010) * (2010‚Äì2015) * (2015‚Äìpresent) Notable persons * Robert Koch (1843-1919), German physician and microbiologist.

It is native to a wide region of Western Asia that includes Israel, Iraq, Iran and Turkey. It was first described by the taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It is unknown why he gave it the specific epithet indica, since the plant is not from India. While Salvia indica is classified as a herbaceous perennial, in cultivation individual plants often live no longer than two years. Description The native habitat of Salvia indica includes rocky limestone slopes between in elevation, where it flowers in April and May.http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj6%282%29/20.pdf The plant has an erect and stately habit, forming a clump of rich grassy-green, ovate leaves with scalloped margins. The leaves are covered in long, soft, straight hairs. Inflorescences are composed of specialized flowering stems growing from the plant's center, some two to four feet high. Widely spaced whorls of four to six flowers open slowly from the inflorescence. Individual flowers are two- lipped, with the one inch upper lip a shiny bright lilac color. The stubby lower lip has a trough with purple and brown spots on a white background. The flowers stay in bloom for quite a long time, nearly one month. The plant is typically propagated by seed, with seedlings often appearing near the plant. In the garden, the plant prefers full sun, loamy soil, and good drainage.

It is a typical English village with one school and one church (St Pauls). To the northeast of the village runs the main west coast railway line. Farington Moss includes School Lane, although the postal address is Lostock Hall. Proof of this fact can be found on the Council Tax Bill of 2010 which clearly states School Lane (F). Sources within South Ribble Borough Council have revealed that the (F) represents (Farington) as opposed to School Lane (B), which stands for Bamber Bridge, and School Lane (L), School Lane, Leyland. Farington Moss is also home to RAWS, the Residents Against Waste Site, which was formed by Judith England in 2007 as a protest group by the residents of Farington Moss. The Waste Site has now been built on land sold by Leyland Trucks (Leyland). In February 2016, councillors on County Hall's executive scrutiny committee voted to mothball the plant, which cost ¬£125m to build, and instead send the green and food waste they processed to landfill. The 160 workers at the plant were told of the plans to cut costs by the cash- strapped Preston Borough county council and a proposal was put forward to change the way waste was dealt with in the county. It is estimated that ¬£125m was invested in the site run by Australian firm Global Renewables.

The band have released five studio albums, a compilation album and five music videos since its formation. Their latest album Diluvium was released on 13 July 2018 via Relapse Records. History=Illegimitation (2002‚Äì2003)= Obscura was formed in late 2002 by Steffen Kummerer on guitar and backing vocals, Jonas Baumgartl on drums and cello, Armin Seitz playing guitar and vocalist / bassist Martin Ketzer with the name Illegimitation. Performing local shows, the band booked their own concept tour in Bavaria called \\"Blasting Bavaria Tour\\" in 2003, followed by editions in 2004, 2005 and 2007. The band recorded their first and only self titled demo in November 2003 with producer V.Santura (Triptykon, Pestilence, Dark Fortress). The demo contained four songs, received positive feedback within southern Germany and take a root in underground circles. In early 2004 both Martin Ketzer and Armin Seitz left the band. On second guitar Stephan Bergbauer joined to record their debut album in Summer 2004. =Retribution (2004‚Äì2007)= The band entered Mastersound Studios in Fellbach, Germany with producer Alexander Krull of Atrocity, Leaves Eyes who pushed the band within a three week lasting recording session. During the recordings the band was renamed after the Gorguts album Obscura. Finished in August 2004, Obscura self-released Retribution on 7 July 2005 and immediately started to work on a follow up release the same year. This is in debate because Raffo Torres from Jayuya, PR says that the self-released album was done in 2004 and not 2005. With the addition of Markus Lempsch on guitar and Jonas Fischer on bass the band re-released Retribution on their own label and toured alongside Suffocation within Europe in 2006. Performing at Brutal Assault Festival in Czech Republic, Mountains of Death Festival in Switzerland and Up From the Ground Festival in Germany, Obscura gained their fanbase and established a proper following in central Europe. In 2007 Obscura hot several festivals in Europe, followed by their first headlining tour in Southern and Eastern Europe with Agonize. The tour started in Athens, Greece and contained 22 shows in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Germany and France. While Markus Lempsch and Jonas Baumgartl left the band in early 2007, Obscura performed as a three piece with session drummer Matthias Landes of Dark Fortress and Noneuclid. Johannes Rennig (Profanity) entered Obscura on guitar in October 2007. In November 2007, drummer Hannes Grossmann (ex-Necrophagist) and fretless bassist Jeroen Paul Thesseling (ex-Pestilence) were recruited as new permanent members, followed by guitarist Christian Muenzner (ex- Necrophagist) in February 2008 to replace Johannes Rennig. =Cosmogenesis (2008‚Äì2010)= In September 2008 Obscura signed with Relapse Records and released its second full-length album Cosmogenesis in early 2009. The album sold around 900 copies in the USA in its first week and debuted at number 71 on the Top New Artist Albums chart. The band started their first-ever North American tour as part of the Cosmogenesis Worldtour in April 2009 alongside Cannibal Corpse. Within one year the band played more than 160 shows all over the world as support for Atheist, the Black Dahlia Murder and Cannibal Corpse. Their first headliner tour was in the USA. Obscura toured Japan as support for Nile and Triptykon in 2010. On February 16, 2010, Obscura reissued their debut album Retribution, remastered and repackaged with three bonus tracks. Obscura's official guitar tablature book for Cosmogenesis was released on January 5. Cosmogenesis was listed by Metal Storm as one the 100 most important death metal albums. =Omnivium (2011‚Äì2013)= Founder and frontman Steffen Kummerer with his seven-string signature Ran guitar Obscura released Omnivium on March 29, 2011. The record was written over a period of two years, with members writing songs and sending them to each other over the internet. On a lyrical basis the album dealt with religion and the evolution of humankind, with Kummerer taking significant influence from Friedrich Schelling's ‚ÄúOn Nature's Connection to the Spirit World‚Äù The album earned positive feedback around the world and entered US and German charts, selling 2,000 within the first week of release in the US. It debuted at number 11 on the USA's Top Heatseekers chart,Obscura's Omnivium Debuts On Billboard Heatseekers Chart bravewords.com. 2011-04-11.

The artwork for the album follows a specific color scheme as part of a four- album concept sequence. Orion Landau, who also published the artwork for the last two albums, was responsible for developing Kummerer's ideas for the cover art. Thesseling left the band due to scheduling conflicts between Obscura and Pestilence. Later, Thesseling cited economic reasons as being the motive for rejoining Pestilence. Thesseling was replaced with Linus Klausenitzer of the progressive death metal band Noneuclid, the band making the announcement in September 2011. Obscura started the 164 concert-long Omnivium Worldtour in their home town of Landshut, Germany, followed by a full European tour alongside Hate Eternal, Beneath the Massacre and Defiled. They also played a five-week tour supporting Children of Bodom and Devin Townsend within North America.

To promote Omnivium, the band played a first headlining tour in Japan alongside Beneath the Massacre and Defiled in June 2012. In 2013 Obscura embarked on a European Tour alongside Death, with most of the shows sold out. Guitarist Christian M√ºnzner left Necrophagist in 2006 before joining Obscura In late 2011 Obscura started an online crowdfunding scheme to pay for the release of a combination of their first demo, demos from the Cosmogenesis sessions and three cover songs from the bands Death, Atheist and Cynic. Within 60 days the band generated $14,600 in fan donations, almost five times their financial target. In celebration of their tenth year as a band, the band played a special anniversary show on the December 15, 2012, in Landshut, Germany, with support from Dark Fortress and Hokum. The show featured a reunion of the early members who recorded the first demo, Illegimitation. This show also marked the end of the Omnivium Worldtour. In March 2013, Obscura embarked on a European Tour supported by Aeon, Deadborn and Over Your Threshold. =Akr√≥asis (2014‚Äì2017)= In 2014, guitarist Christian M√ºnzner left the band due to creative differences and his inability to tour as a result of his focal dystonia muscle spasms. Additionally, Hannes Grossmann left at the same time, citing his own interests in forming a separate band. Obscura then hired guitarist Tom Geldschl√§ger and fusion drummer Sebastian Lanser of German jazz metal group Panzerballett. Obscura was scheduled to tour the US with the new line up as a part of the 2015 Summer Slaughter Tour, but despite early applications for visas they were unable to perform. Prior to releasing the band's fourth record Akroasis Obscura announced Munich Guitar Institute graduate Rafael Trujillo as their new permanent lead guitarist, replacing Geldschl√§ger who was released from his duties by Kummerer as of July 2015. Rafael Trujillo studies Jazz at the Conservatory of the Amsterdam University of the Arts. Obscura embarked on the \\"Akroasis World Tour\\" in Rome, Italy at March 30 alongside Death DTA. A Summer tour visiting major festivals such as Graspop Metal Meeting, Hammersonic Festival, Metaldays and many more followed in July and August. On June 20, Obscura announced their headlining European tour supported by Revocation, Beyond Creation and Rivers of Nihil. Obscura then performed as part of the \\"Akroasis World Tour\\" three shows in Mexico. Being part of Sepultura's Machine Messiah Tour 2018, Obscura supported the major act on a four-week long tour in Europe and the UK. Opening acts have been the US American bands Goatwhore and Fit for an Autopsy. With many shows sold out, this tour has been the biggest run in Europe for the band up to this date. In April 2018 the band returned to Japan, headlining the \\"Akroasis Japan Tour 2018\\", as part of the Akroasis World Tour. Due to great demand Obscura play two shows in Tokyo. =Diluvium (2018‚Äì2020)= In January 2018, the band announced that they have completed their fifth full-length album, Diluvium which was released on 13 July 2018 via Relapse. To promote the album, the band has announced a headlining tour in North America in September and October 2018 with Beyond Creation, Archspire, Inferi and Exist as support acts. Followed by the European leg with Fallujah, Allegaeon and First Fragment, Obscura went to Australia and New Zealand before returning to Japan to headline a row of tours under the banner Diluvium. =Line-up changes and the sixth album (2020‚Äìpresent)= In April 2020, they announced guitarist Rafael Trujillo, bassist Linus Klausenitzer and drummer Sebastian Lanser parting ways with the band due to musical differences. Shortly after the band announced that former fretless bass player Jeroen Paul Thesseling and former guitarist Christian M√ºnzner rejoined the band. The band also enlisted Austrian drummer David Diepold as their new drummer. Musical styles and lyrical themes Obscura are known for playing technically and compositionally complex music, with several band members having studied music theory. Founding member Kummerer devises the band's lyricism and imagery himself. Obscura's lyrics focus mainly on the writings of famous German philosophers. The band's second release, Cosmogenesis, presented their interest in philosophy, which Kummerer describes as being influenced by the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, with Omnivium showing a shift in interests, and being based solely on the work of German philosopher Friedrich Schelling. In describing these lyrics, Kummerer states: > Cosmogenesis started with the beginning of our existence, the big bang > theory if you want to say so, and deals with different layers and synonyms > on a philosophical basis. The second, Omnivium, takes part of the evolution > in many different layers such as the basic ape to human thought, religious > topics, how the human individuals evolve within their existence and uses as > its basic theme the novel On Nature's Connection to the Spirit World by > Friedrich Schelling.

As a sculptor, he adopted the name \\"Joseph Constant\\", as a writer he used the pseudonym \\"Michel Matveev\\".\\"Le Son de l'Est de Michel Matveev\\", an essay by Raffaele Zanotti in √âcrivains Franco-russes, edited by Murielle Lucie Cl√©ment, Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2008 Biography Joseph Constant House in Ramat Gan. Constant was born in Jaffa on 14 July 1892 to Russian Jewish parents. He spent his early years in Odessa. When still quite young, he took part alongside his father in the anti-Tsarist revolutionary activities of 1905. In 1914, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Odessa, and during the Communist Revolution of 1917 he was named an inspector of fine arts. In 1919, his father and his brother were killed in an anti-Jewish pogrom. That same year, Constant and his wife decided to quit Russia. They travelled to Palestine aboard the ship Ruslan which carried a number of other Jewish artists. In Tel Aviv, they formed an artists' cooperative that included the painter Yitzhak Frenkel. A year later, the ailing Constant travelled to Egypt. He arrived in Paris in 1923 after further travels in Turkey and Romania. In Paris, Constant frequented the district of Montparnasse, a favorite milieu of Russian Jewish artists. This served as the inspiration for his later novel La cit√© des peintres. Adopting the pseudonym of Michel Matveev, Constant was a late arrival to the literary scene. In his own words, it happened \\"un peu par hasard et pour gagner quelque argent\\" (a little bit by chance and to earn a little money). It was not until he arrived in France that he began to write, and he did so directly in French. His first book, on the subject of the 1905 Revolution, was published in 1928. In the 1930s, he gradually abandoned the medium of painting, focusing instead on sculpture. He also continued his activity as a writer and translator. In 1933, he published Les Traqu√©s, a tragic story of Jews travelling across Europe in search of a safe haven. This was translated into English by Desmond Flower under the title Weep Not for the Dead. In 1936, he won the Prix des Deux Magots for his collection of short stories √âtrange famille (Strange family). After the second world war, he gained greater renown as a sculptor both in France and abroad. From the 1950s onwards, he travelled frequently to Israel, staying at the kibbutz of Ein Harod. In 1962, the mayor of Ramat Gan invited him to take up residence in the artists' quarter in the heart of the city. From then on, Constant shared his time between his studio in Paris and that in Ramat Gan. The latter was converted into a museum upon his death.

The genus is monospecific, consisting of the species H. francisci, initially described in 1915 by Oliver Perry Hay as Equus francisci. Prior to its formal description, it was sometimes referred to as the New World stilt-legged horse. Haringtonhippus fossils have only been discovered in North America. Specimens have been found from southern Mexico to southern South Dakota and in Alberta, Canada, at sites such as Gypsum Cave and Natural Trap Cave, as well as eastern Beringia in Yukon A later study found that Equus cedralensis from the Late Pleistocene of Mexico also belonged to this species. The earliest species of the lineage appeared in North America during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, around 2 to 3 Ma. It became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene. Taxonomy Haringtonhippus is named after Charles Richard Harington. It was originally described as a new Equus species, E. francisci, in 1915. Dalquest (1979) considered Equus tau , described from teeth in Mexico, a senior synonym of E. francisci, while Equus quinni and E. arrelanoi were synonymized with E. francisci by Winans (1989).Winans, M. C. 1989. A quantitative study of the North American fossil species of the genus Equus. Pp. 262-297, in The evolution of perissodactyls (D. R. Prothero & R. M. Schoch, eds.), Oxford Monographs Geol. Geophysics, no. 15, 537 pp. The species Equus achates Hay and Cook, 1930 (synonymized with E. tau by Dalquest 1979) was synonymized with E. francisci by Hulbert (1995), who also declared E. tau and E. littoralis nomina dubia.Hulbert, R. C. 1995. Equus from Leisey Shell Pit 1A and other Irvingtonian localities from Florida. Bulletin of the Florida Museum of Natural History 37:553‚Äî602. Phylogenetics A 2017 paper placed Equus francisci outside Equus based on a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, leading to erection of the new genus Haringtonhippus. The genus is phylogenetically closer to Equus than to Hippidion. It is estimated to have diverged from Equus around 4.1‚Äì5.7 million years ago, during the late Hemphillian or early Blancan. A 2019 morphological study found H. francisci to be nested within Equus in a polytomy with E. conversidens and the plains zebra (E. quagga), supporting synonymization of Haringtonhippus with Equus. The genetic study had not included E. stenonis and E. simplicidens (which were recovered by morphology as outgroups of Equus, albeit closer to Equus than Hippidion, reassigning them to Allohippus and Plesippus, respectively) due to a lack of genetic data for these species, and so did not resolve their relationships to H. francisci. To further explore this, a second morphological analysis was performed in which H. francisci was constrained to lie outside of crown Equus. In this analysis, H. francisci was found to be a sister clade of either crown Equus or the clade comprising crown Equus + E. idahoensis, but with trees 6 steps longer than the most parsimonious unconstrained analysis. In addition to its phylogenetic position, the divergence times estimated from DNA sequences may suggest that Haringtonhippus, and possibly even Hippidion, should possibly be synonymised with Equus based on the divergence time criterion (i.e. that groups should be considered distinct genera only if they diverged long before the Miocene‚ÄìPliocene boundary) (Groves, 2001, 2004; Groves and Grubb, 2011), but this criterion is mainly designed for use with extant species and may not be suitable for clades which diverged close to the Miocene‚ÄìPliocene boundary.

Situated at from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it consists of a side platform along a section of single track. It is served by line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail and regional trains on line R30, both operated by Vy Gj√∏vikbanen, each operating every two hours. The station opened about to the north on 3 June 1984 and was originally named Furumo. In 2012 work started on building a new station, which would replace both the old Furumo Station and the old Harestua Station. The new Furumo Station opened on 9 December 2012 and took the name Harestua on 15 December 2013. History The Gj√∏vik Line through Lunner opened on 20 December 1900. The southern part of the municipality was originally served by Harestua Station, a station situated at from Oslo. The Furumo area started receiving new single dwelling residential construction through the 1960s. With the construction of Furumo II and III, it became common for people to commute to the capital. The largest project was Furumo IV, where construction commenced in 1978.Ekeberg: 58 This was instrumental for NSB to decide to establish a second station at Harestua, to serve the new residential area.Ekeberg: 62 Furumo Station opened on 3 June 1984. The same day Viubr√•ten Station, situated to the north, was closed. The original location of Furumo Station was at from Oslo S,Bjerke & Holom: 146 and was in a curve. A 2012 report showed that there were about 600 people living within of Harestua Station and 900 within the same radius from Furumo. The old Furumo Station had 1,500 people living within . Furumo had 38,300 passengers per year while Harestua had 89,200. Part of the traffic to Harestua was generated by the good access to the wilderness. However, it was in poor technical condition and had a requirement to receive a new and longer platform. The Norwegian National Rail Administration therefore decided to merge the two stations and located it at a new site. This new site is planned as the new community and commercial center for Harestua. The passing loop would be retained at the old station, so the merger would not cut running times. Construction commenced in April 2012, when the old Furumo Station was closed and work on the new station could begin. the main contractor was Peab. In addition to a new platform, the work consists of of new county road, to culverts under the track, ramps allowing wheeled access the platform area, new parking places including a kiss and ride and a new waiting room. To install the culverts all train traffic past the stop had to cease. Total price for the project was 40 million Norwegian krone. The new Furumo Station opened on 9 December 2012 and the same day the old Harestua Station closed. The new station took the name Harestua on 15 December 2013. Facilities Harestua Station is situated on the Gj√∏vik Line, from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The line past H√∏ybr√•ten is single track and electrified and the station does not have a passing loop. The station features a side platforms with a heated shed. The platform is long and tall. There are 95 parking spaces at the station, including charging stations for electric cars and disabled parking, a halt for buses and a kiss and ride. The station is built according to standards for accessibility. Harestua is predominetly residential area with a high proportion of commuters. In addition to these, the station also is located near an access point to the ski trail network of the Association for the Promotion of Skiing in Nordmarka, making it attractive to serve people for skiing outings. Service The station is served by lines L3 of Oslo Commuter Rail and R30 regional trains, both operated by NSB Gj√∏vikbanen using Class 69 trains. The lines operate every twice every two hours, with 40 and 80 minutes between departures. Both operate southwards to Oslo Central Station; L3 operates north to Jaren Station while R30 runs the entire length of the line to Gj√∏vik Station. Harestua is 44 minutes from Oslo S and 1 hour and 14 minutes from Gj√∏vik.

Norse religion was a folk religion (as opposed to an organised religion), and its main purpose was the survival and regeneration of society. Therefore, the faith was decentralized and tied to the village and the family, although evidence exists of great national religious festivals. The leaders managed the faith on behalf of society; on a local level, the leader would have been the head of the family, and nationwide, the leader was the king. Pre-Christian Scandinavians had no word for religion in a modern sense. The closest counterpart is the word sidr, meaning custom. This meant that Christianity, during the conversion period, was referred to as n√Ωr sidr (the new custom) while paganism was called forn sidr (ancient custom). The centre of gravity of pre-Christian religion lay in religious practice ‚Äî sacred acts, rituals and worship of the gods.Steinsland (2005) p. 268 Norse religion was at no time homogeneous but was a conglomerate of related customs and beliefs. These could be inherited or borrowed,Steinsland (2005) p. 347 and although the great geographical distances of Scandinavia led to a variety of cultural differences, people understood each other's customs, poetic traditions and myths.Roesdahl (1998) pp. 35-36 Sacrifice (bl√≥t) played a huge role in most of the rituals that are known about today, and communal feasting on the meat of sacrificed animals, together with the consumption of beer or mead, played a large role in the calendar feasts. In everyday practice, other foodstuffs like grain are likely to have been used instead. The purpose of these sacrifices was to ensure fertility and growth. However, sudden crises or transitions such as births, weddings and burials could also be the reason. In those times there was a clear distinction between private and public faith, and the rituals were thus tied either to the household and the individual or to the structures of society.Steinsland (2005) p. 265 It is not certain to what extent the known myths correspond to the religious beliefs of Scandinavians in pre-Christian times, nor how people acted towards them in everyday life. The Scandinavians did not leave any written sources on their religious practice, and Christian texts on the subject are marked by misunderstandings and negative bias, since the Christians viewed the Nordic beliefs as superstition and devil worship. Some archaeological evidence has been discovered, but this is hard to interpret in isolation from written material.Kofod & Warmind (1989) p. 66 Worship of the gods A detail from runestone G 181 in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. The three men are interpreted as the Norse gods Odin, Thor, and Freyr. Recent research suggests that great public festivals involving the population of large regions were not as important as the more local feasts in the life of the individual. Though they were written in a later Christian era, the Icelandic sagas are of great significance as sources to everyday religion. Even when the Christian influence is taken into account, they draw an image of a religion closely tied to the cycle of the year and the social hierarchy of society. In Iceland the local secular leader had the title of gothi, which originally meant priest but in the Middle Ages was a term for a local secular leader.Sigurdsson (1993) pp. 133-136 Ceremonial communal meals in connection with the bl√≥t sacrifice are mentioned in several sources and are thus some of the most described rituals. Masked dancers, music, and singing may have been common parts of these feasts.Kofod & Warmind (1989) p. 38 As in other pre-Christian Germanic societies, but in contrast to the later situation under Christianity, there was no class of priests: anyone could perform sacrifices and other faith acts. However, common cultural norms meant that it was normally the person with the highest status and the greatest authority (the head of the family or the leader of the village) who led the rituals.Hansen, Lars Iver (1999) pp. 105 The sources indicate that sacrifices for fertility, a safe journey, a long life, wealth etc. were a natural and fully integrated part of daily life in Scandinavian society, as in almost all other pre-modern societies across the world.N√§sstr√∂m (1999) p. 161 The worship of female powers is likely to have played a greater role than the medieval sources indicate, because those texts were written by men and pay less attention to religious practices in the female sphere.Steinsland (2005) p. 301 A trace of the importance of goddesses can be found in place-name material that has shown that there are often place names connected to the goddess Freyja near place names connected to the god Freyr.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 46 Fertility and divination rituals that women could take part in or lead were also among those which survived the longest after Christianisation.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 121 Different types of animals or objects were connected to the worship of different gods; for instance, horses and pigs played a great role in the worship of Freyr. This did not mean that the same animal could not also play a role in the worship of other deities (the horse was also an important part of the Odin faith).Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 97 One of the most important objects in Norse paganism was the ship. Archaeological sources show that it played a central role in the faith from the petroglyphs and razors of the Bronze Age to the runestones of the Viking Age. Interpretation of the meaning of the ship in connection to the mythological material is only possible for the late period,Crumlin-Pedersen (1994) pp. 143 when it was mainly associated with death and funerals.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 135 =Faiths, statues and images= Drawing of an archaeological find from √ñland, Sweden of a gold-plated depiction of Mjolnir in silver. Several written sources mention statues of heathen gods. They are mostly described as either anthropomorphic or as wooden staves with a face carved at the top. Ahmad ibn Fadlan writes about such poles in his description of a Scandinavian sacrifice at the Volga. This account has a suggestion of the mythological connection but it is impossible to decipher it.Kofod & Warmind (1989) p. 48 No such large statues from the Viking Age have been found, only small figures and amulets. This may be because larger statues were deliberately destroyed. After Christianisation, the possession of such figures was banned and severely punished. Many accounts of missionaries have the destruction of heathen idols as their climax, symbolising the triumph of the strong Christian god over the weak, \\"devilish\\" native gods. The sagas sometimes mention small figures that can be kept in a purse. Such figures are known from archaeological findings across Scandinavia. They include hammer-shaped jewelry, golden men or figures of gods.Steinsland (2005) pp. 292-293 Sources from different periods also suggest that chariots were used in fertility rituals across Scandinavia over a very long period. In his Germania, Tacitus refers to a sacred chariot in the faith of Nerthus. Also the Dejbjerg chariots from the Roman Iron Age, the Oseberg ship from the Viking age and the medieval tale about Gunnar Helming have survived until today. It is possible that this motif can be traced as far back as the processions of the Bronze Age.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 95 Public faith Although no details are known, it is possible to form an unclear image of some of the rituals and religious practices through interpretation of the sources that have survived. The sources are heterogeneous since the written accounts are from the late heathen period and written in a Christian context. Thus it is also hard to determine whether a ritual was private or public. The only heathen shrine about which there is detailed information is the great temple at Uppsala in modern Sweden, which was described by the German chronicler Adam of Bremen in a time where central Sweden was the last political centre where Norse paganism was practised in public. =Centres of faith= Reconstruction of the temple in Upp√•kra by Sven Rosborn, archaeologist at Fotevikens MuseumRemains of so-called multifunctional centres have been discovered in several places in Scandinavia. Near Tiss√∏, archaeologists have unearthed a complex consisting of, among other things, a central mead hall connected to a fenced area with a smaller building. The hall is likely to have been associated with the great festivals and the fenced area to have contained a h√∂rgr. This complex is similar to others found in Scandinavia.,J√∏rgensen (1994) p. 139 such as Borg in Lofoten, Uppsala in Uppland, Upp√•kra in Scania, Gudme in Funen and Lejre in Zealand. Since the 1970s, discoveries have significantly expanded knowledge about the public faith. The excavations have shown that large buildings were used for both secular and religious purposes from the 600s and into the Viking Age and the Middle Ages. Such structures are likely to have been both religious and political/economic centres.Steinsland (2005) p. 269 The combination of religious festivals and markets has been common to most cultures through most of history, since a society where travel is difficult and communication limited uses such occasions to get several things done at the same time. Thus the religious festivals were also the time and place for things, markets and the hearing of court cases. The religious festivals have to be seen in the light of these other activities. In some places the same area was used for these festivals from the Roman Iron Age until the Middle Ages, while in other places different locations were used in succession.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 12-13 Excavations of the complex at Tiss√∏ have shown that it grew from the 7th century until the 10th century. The most recent findings are from 1020 to 1030, when the great hall seems to have been dismantled.J√∏rgensen (1994) pp. 136-137 Locally there were several kinds of holy places, usually marked by a boundary in the form of either a permanent stone barrier or a temporary fence of branches. Thus a holy space was created with rules of its own, like a ban on spilling blood on holy soil.Steinsland (2005) pp. 271-272 The importance of these holy places should be understood in connection to the cosmological ideas people had. It is known that different types of divine forces were tied to different places and that there were different rituals connected to them. In addition to sacred groves, texts mention holy wells and the leaving of offerings at streams, mountains, waterfalls, rocks, and trees; these may have been to the landv√¶ttir as well as, or rather than, the gods. There is no mention of worship of the j√∂tnar and it is unknown whether there were places sacred to them. The sources disagree about faiths buildings, so there are varying opinions about their form and nature.Steinsland (2005) p. 284 However, it seems that for some buildings, sacral use was secondary.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 36 The Germanic languages had no words in pre-Christian times that directly corresponded to the Latin templum, the ancestor of the modern word temple. Thus it has long been a topic for discussion whether there were buildings exclusively meant for religious purposes in pre-Christian Scandinavia.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 20 It is most likely that religious buildings were erected in some places, as the words h√∂rgr and hof are found in several place-names. Other sources suggests that the ritual acts were not necessarily limited to religious buildings. Whether \\"temples\\" were built is likely to have depended on local custom and economic resources.Steinsland (2005) pp. 285-288 A hof or a h√∂rgr did not need to be connected to one of the faiths centres.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 37 Other forms of the faiths buildings were the hall and the v√©. Place names containing the word sal (hall) occur in several places and it is possible that this word was used for the multi- functional halls.Steinsland (2005) pp. 296-298 Earlier scholars often translated sal as barn or stable, which has been shown to be inaccurate. Such a hall is more likely to have been a long-house with only one room. This was a prestigious type of building used for feasts and similar social gatherings in the entire Germanic area. In place names the word sal is mostly connected to Odin, which shows a connection with political power.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 27-30 Old place names containing the word sal may thus mean that a religious hall once stood there.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 18 Another word for hall, h√∂ll, was used to describe another kind of sacral building, not meant for habitation but dedicated to special purposes like holding feasts. In the legend of Beowulf, Heorot is named as such. However the word h√∂ll is not found in place names and is likely to have been borrowed into East Norse from German or English in the late period.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 23-26 The v√© is another kind of holy place and is also the most unambiguous name used for holy places in Scandinavia. The word comes from the proto-Germanic *w√Æha, meaning \\"holy\\". Originally this word was used for places in nature but over time religious buildings may have been built.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 32 Gamla Uppsala Artistic impression of a mid-winter bl√≥t in Uppsala in the painting \\"Midvinterblot\\" by Carl Larsson. Adam of Bremen's description of the sacrifices and the religious centre in Uppsala is the best known account of pre-Christian rituals in Sweden.Gr√§slund (1999) p. 57 There is general agreement that Gamla Uppsala was one of the last strongholds of heathen religion in central Sweden and that the religious centre there was still of great importance when Adam of Bremen wrote his account.Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, English translation by F. J. Tschan, Columbia University Press, 2002, Adam describes the temple as being gilded everywhere and containing statues of the three most important gods. The most important was Thor, who was placed in the middle, with Odin at one side and Fricco (presumably Freyr) at the other. He tells that Thor reigned in the skies where he ruled rain, wind and thunder, and that he provided good weather for the crops. In his hand he held a sceptre. Odin was the god of war and courage, his name meant \\"the furious\\" and he was depicted as a warrior. Fricco, on the other hand, was the god for peace and physical satisfaction, and was thus depicted with a huge phallus. Each god had his own priests and people sacrificed to the gods whose help they needed: Thor was called upon in times of famine and disease, Odin was called upon to gain victory and Fricco was called upon for fertile marriages. According to Adam, the temple at Uppsala was the centre for the national worship of the gods, and every nine years a great festival was held there where the attendance of all inhabitants of the Swedish provinces was required, including Christians. At these festivals men and male animals were sacrificed by hanging. Adam recounts from Christian eyewitness accounts that up to 72 corpses could be hanging in the trees next to the temple during these sacrifices. He uses the Latin term triclinium, meaning banquet hall, for the central religious building and says that it was used for libations. In Roman culture such a building was not considered a temple proper, but it had a function similar to that of Heorot in the legend of Beowulf.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 19-20 For comparison the Iron Age hall at Berg in Lofoten had benches along three of the walls just like the Roman triclinium. In recent Strahinja, remains of a large building have been found in Uppsala. It was 100m long and was in use from 600 to 800. It was built on an artificial plateau near the burial mounds from the Germanic Iron Age and was presumably a residence connected to the royal power, which was established in the area during that period. Remains of a smaller building have been found below this house and the place is likely to have been in use as a religious centre for very long time. The memory of the hall (sal) remains in the name Uppsala.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 16-20 The building was surrounded by a fence which could not have had any defensive function but could have marked the royal or sacral area.Gr√§slund (1999) p. 67 Around 900 the great hall burned down, but new graves were placed on the site. The traces of postholes under the medieval church have traditionally been interpreted as the site of the temple, but some scholars now believe the building was a later feast hall and that there was never a \\"temple\\" as such, but rather a hall used for banquets and political and legal functions as well as sacrifices.Gr√§slund (1999) p. 63 Gamla Uppsala was used for about 2000 years but the size and complexity of the complex was expanded up until the Viking Age, so that Uppsala in the period from 500 to 1000 was the centre of royal power and a location of a sizeable religious organisation.Brink (1999) p. 37 =Religious leaders= A go√∞i leads the people in sacrificing to an idol of Thor in this painting by J. L. Lund. Norse religion did not have any class of priest who worked as full-time religious leaders. Instead there were different kinds of leaders who took care of different religious tasks alongside their secular occupation.Kofod & Warmind (1989) p. 40 From Iceland the terms go√∞i (gothi) and gy√∞ja are known for \\"priest\\" and \\"priestess\\" while the terms v√≠fill and lytir are primarily known from the East Norse area. However the title gothi is also known from Danish rune stones. The king or the jarl (earl) had overall responsibility for the public faith in his realm while the head of the household was responsible for leading the private faith.Steinsland (2005) p. 280 Thus, religious as well as secular power in Norse society was centered on individuals. It was secured through ties of friendship and loyalty and meant that there never were any totally consolidated structures of power. The king could only exercise his power where he or his trusted representatives were personally present. A king thus needed to have homesteads throughout the realm as the physical seat of his government. It is unclear which of them were royal and which of them were owned by local aristocracy, but place names can give an indication.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 15 The common Swedish place name Husaby or Huseby could be an old term for a royal homestead.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 25 The same was true for leaders of lesser rank in the hierarchy; they too had to be present for the rituals to work. The most known type of religious leader is the gothi, as several holders of this title appear in the Icelandic sagas. Because of the limited knowledge about religious leaders there has been a tendency to regard the gothi and his female counterpart, the gy√∞ja, as common titles throughout Scandinavia. However, there is no evidence pointing to that conclusion. In historic times the gothi was a male politician and judge, i.e. a chieftain, but the word has the same etymological origins as the word \\"god,\\" which is a strong sign that religious functions were connected to the title in pre-historic times. In pre-Christian times the gothi was thus both politician, jurist and religious expert.Steinsland (2005) p. 281 Other titles of religious leaders were √æulr (thul), thegn, v√∂lva and sei√∞ma√∞r (seidman). The term thul is related to words meaning recitation, speech and singing, so this religious function could have been connected to a sacral, maybe esoteric, knowledge. The thul was also connected to Odin, the god of rulers and kings, and thus poetry and the activities in the banquet halls. It is a possibility that the thul function was connected to the king's halls.Brink, Stefan (1999) pp. 28-30 Both the v√∂lva and the sei√∞ma√∞r were associated with seid. =Human sacrifice= It has been a topic for discussion whether human sacrifice was practised in Scandinavia. There has been great disagreement about why, for instance, two bodies were found in the Oseberg tomb or how to interpret Ibn Fadlan's description of the killing of a female thrall at a funeral among the Scandinavian Rus on the Volga.Steinsland (2005) p. 299 The many discoveries of bog bodies and the evidence of sacrifices of prisoners of war dating back to the Pre-Roman Iron Age show that ritual killings in one form or another were not uncommon in Northern Europe in the period before the Viking Age. Furthermore, some findings from the Viking Age can be interpreted as evidence of human sacrifice. Sagas occasionally mention human sacrifice at temples, as does Adam of Bremen. Also, the written sources tell that a commander could consecrate the enemy warriors to Odin using his spear. Thus war was ritualised and made sacral and the slain enemies became sacrifices. Violence was a part of daily life in the Viking Age and took on a religious meaning like other activities. It is likely that human sacrifice occurred during the Viking Age but nothing suggests that it was part of common public religious practise. Instead it was only practised in connection with war and in times of crisis.Steinsland (2005) pp. 300-301 =Developments= Excavations of the religious centres have shown that public religious practise changed over time. In Southern Scandinavia, the great public sacrificial feasts that had been common during the Roman Iron Age were abandoned. In the 6th century the great sacrifices of weapons were discontinued. Instead there are traces of a faith that was tied more to the abode of a ruler. This change is among other things shown by golden plates and bracteates becoming common. Gold was a precious material and was thus connected to the ruler and his family. The changes are very remarkable and might be a sign that the change of religion in Scandinavia started in an earlier time than was previously believed, and was closely connected to the establishment of kingdoms. Private religion The rituals of the private religion mostly paralleled the public. In many cases the line between public and private religion is hard to draw, for instance in the cases of the yearly bl√≥t feasts and crisis and life passage rituals. In the private sphere the rituals were led by the head of the household and his wife. It is not known whether thralls took part in the worship and in that case to what extent.Steinsland (2005) p. 264 The rituals were not limited to seasonal festivals as there were rituals connected to all tasks of daily life. Most rituals only involved one or a few persons, but some involved the entire household or the extended family. =Rites of passage= These rituals were connected to the change of status and transitions in life a person experiences, such as birth, marriage and death, and followed the same pattern as is known from other rites of passage. Unusually, no Scandinavian sources tell about rituals for the passage from child to adult.Steinsland (2005) pp. 327-328 Birth and naming J. C. Dollman. Giving birth has always been extremely dangerous for mother and newborn. Thus, rites of birth were common in many pre-modern societies. In the Viking Age, people would pray to the goddesses Frigg and Freyja, and sing ritual galdr-songs to protect the mother and the child. Fate played a huge role in Norse culture and was determined at the moment of birth by the Norns. Nine nights after birth, the child had to be recognised by the father of the household. He placed the child on his knee while sitting in the high seat. Water was sprinkled on the child, it was named and thus admitted into the family. There are accounts of guests being invited to bring gifts and wish the child well. Children were often named after deceased ancestors and the names of deities could be a part of the name. People thought certain traits were connected to certain names and that these traits were carried on when the names were re-used by new generations. This was part of ancestor worship.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 155 Putting the child on the knee of the father confirmed his or her status as a member of the clan bestowed the rights connected to this status. The child could no longer be killed, or exposed by the parents, without its being considered murder.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 80 Exposing children was a socially accepted way of limiting the population.Steinsland (2005) pp. 329-330 The belief that deities were present during childbirth suggests that people did not regard the mother and the child as excluded from normal society as was the case in later, Christian, times and apparently there were no ideas about female biological functions being unclean.Steinsland (2005) p. 328 Marriage As it was the core the family, marriage was one of the most important social institution in pagan Scandinavia. A wedding was thus an important transition not only for the couple but also for the families involved. A marriage was a legal contract with implications for, among other things, inheritance and property relations, while the wedding itself was the solemnization of a pact in which the families promised to help each other. Because of this the male head of the family had the final say in these matters. However it is clear from the sagas that the young couple also had a say since a good relationship between the spouses was crucial to the running of a farm. A wedding was a long and collective process subject to many ritual rules and culminating in the wedding feast itself. The procedures had to be followed for the divine powers to sanction the marriage and to avoid a bad marriage afterwards. However accounts in the sagas about the complicated individual emotions connected to a marriage tell us that things did not always work out between the spouses.Steinsland (2005) pp. 334-336 Freyja (1901) by Johannes Gehrts. As a prelude to marriage the family of the groom sent the groom and several delegates to the family of the bride to propose. Here the date of the betrothal was set. This was the first legally binding step between the families, and the occasion was used to negotiate the inheritance and property relations of the couple as well as the dowry (heimanfylgja) and wedding present (mundr) from the groom's family. Those were the personal property of the bride. Usually the bride's family were less wealthy than the groom's, but in most cases the difference was not great. Thus the dowry was an investment by the bride's family that made it possible for her to marry into a more powerful family.Clunies Ross (1994) p. 92 When an agreement on these matters had been reached, the deal was sealed at a feast.Steinsland (2005) p. 336 These conditions were reserved for the dominating class of freeholders (b√≥ndi/b≈ìndr), as the remaining parts of the population, servants, thralls and freedmen were not free to act in these matters but were totally dependent on their master. The wedding (brudlaup) was the most important single ritual in the process. It was the first public gathering of the two families and consisted of a feast that lasted for several days. Anything less than three days was considered paltry. The guests witnessed that the process had been followed correctly. The sources tell very little about how a wedding was related to the gods. It is known that the goddess V√°r witnessed the couple's vows, that a depiction of Mjolnir could be placed in the lap of the bride asking Thor to bless her, and that Freyr and Freyja were often called upon in matters of love and marriage, but there is no suggestion of a worship ritual. From legal sources we know that leading the couple to the bridal couch was one of the central rituals. On the first night the couple was led to bed by witnesses carrying torches, which marked the difference between legal marital relations and a secret extra-marital relationship.Steinsland (2005) pp. 336-337 =Ancestor worship= The Royal mounds of Gamla Uppsala in Sweden from the 5th and the 6th centuries. Originally, the site had 2000 to 3000 tumuli, but owing to quarrying and agriculture only 250 remain. Ancestor worship was an element in pre-Christian Scandinavian culture. The ancestors were of great importance for the self- image of the family and people believed that they were still able to influence the life of their descendants from the land of the dead. Contact with them was seen as crucial to the well-being of the family. If they were treated in the ritually correct way, they could give their blessings to the living and secure their happiness and prosperity. Conversely, the dead could haunt the living and bring bad fortune if the rituals were not followed. It is not clear whether the ancestors were seen as divine forces themselves or as connected to other death-related forces like elves. The status of the dead determined the shape of the tomb and the burial mounds were seen as the abode of the dead. They were places of special power which also influenced the objects inside them. The evidence of prehistoric openings in mounds may thus not indicate looting but the local community's efforts to retrieve holy objects from the grave, or to insert offerings. Since the excavation of a mound was a time- and labour-consuming task which could not have happened unnoticed, religious historian Gro Steinsland and others find it unlikely that lootings of graves were common in prehistoric times. There are also several mythological tales and legends about retrieval of objects from burial moundsSteinsland (2005) p. 342 and an account in Ynglingasaga of offerings to Freyr continuing through openings in his burial mound at Uppsala. The connection between the living and the dead was maintained through rituals connected to the burial place like sacrifice of objects, food and drink. Usually the graves were placed close to the dwelling of the family and the ancestors were regarding as protecting the house and its inhabitants against bad luck and bestowing fertility. Thus ancestor worship was of crucial importance to survival and there are signs that it continued up until modern times in isolated areas. Ancestor worship was also an element in the bl√≥t feasts, where memorial toasts to the deceased were part of the ritual. Also elf bl√≥t was closely connected to the family.Steinsland (2005) pp. 344-345 =Wight worship= Land wights were unnamed collective entities. They were protective deities for areas of land and there were many religious rules for how to deal with them to avoid conflicts. This was used by Egil Skallagrimson. When he was driven from Norway into exile in Iceland, he erected a nithing pole (n√≠√∞stang) to frighten the Norwegian land wights and thus bring bad luck to Norway as revenge for the Norwegian king's treatment of him. According to the saga the cursing pole consisted of a gaping horse's head mounted on top of a pole which he drove into the ground at the beach. In the Viking Age, women are likely to have played the main role in the wight faith. This faith included sacrifices of food and drink on certain locations either near the farm or other places like waterfalls and groves where wights were believed to live. During Christianisation the attention of the missionaries was focused on the named gods; worship of the more anonymous collective groups of deities was allowed to continue for a while, and could have later escaped notice by the Christian authorities. The wights also lived on in folklore as nixies and tomter.Steinsland (2005) p. 352 Types of rituals Far from all types of Norse pagan rituals are known in detail. Below is an introduction to most known types of rituals. =Bl√≥t= The D√≠sabl√≥t, by August Malmstr√∂m. The Bl√≥t was an important type of ritual in the public as well as the private faith. The word bl√≥t is connected to the verb bl√≥ta, which is related to English bless. In the Viking age the main meaning of the word had become to sacrifice. =Seid= In academia Seid was traditionally written about in a degrading fashion and considered magic rather than religion. This is connected to the general disparagement of magic in the Christian medieval sources, such as the sagas. Seid was an element of a larger religious complex and was connected to important mythological tales. Freyja is said to have taught it to Odin. Thus Seid is today considered as an important element of Norse religion.Ellis Davidson (1990) p. 119 It is hard to determine from the sources what the term meant in the Viking Age but it is known that Seid was used for divination and interpretation of omens for positive as well as destructive purposes.Grambo (1991) p. 133 =Runes= The sources mention runes as powerful symbols connected to Odin, which were used in different ritual circumstances. Sources on Norse paganism and their interpretation The sources of knowledge about Norse paganism are varied, but do not include any sacred texts that prescribe rituals or explain them in religious terms. Knowledge about pre-Christian rituals in Scandinavia are composed mainly from fragments and indirect knowledge.Steinsland (2005) p. 64 For instance the mythological eddas tell almost nothing about the rituals connected to the deities described. While the sagas contain more information on ritual acts, they rarely connect those to the mythology. All these texts were written in Iceland after the Christianisation and it is likely that much knowledge about the rituals had by then, been lost. The mythological tales survived more easily, and the information found in them is probably closer to pagan originals.Steinsland (2005) p. 270 An example of how sagas have been used as indirect sources for religious practice is Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. For instance, in the first part of the tale of the Norwegian kings he tells about the rituals Odin instituted when he came to the Scandinavian peoples. This account is likely to describe rituals in the Odin faith. According to Snorri, Odin required that a sacrifice be held for a good year at the beginning of winter, one for rebirth at mid-winter and one for victory in the summer. All dead were to be cremated on a funeral pyre together with all their belongings and all cremated in this way would join him in Valhalla, together with their belongings. The ashes were to be spread either at sea or on the ground. This is similar to other written and archaeological sources on burial customs, which thus substantiate each other. Graves are the most common archaeological evidence of religious acts and they are an important source of our knowledge about the ideas about death and cosmology held by the bereaved. This material is very useful in forming a general view of the structural relations and long-time developments in the religion. By comparing it to other archaeological findings and written sources, new perspectives can be formed.Lagerl√∂f (1991) pp. 207-209 Another source is found in toponyms. In recent years, research has shed new light on pagan rituals, among other things, by determining the location of pagan shrines. The name of a location can reveal information about its history. The name of the city Odense, for instance, means Odin's v√© (shrine), and the name Thorsh√∏j, which can be found in several places in Norway, means \\"Thor's hof\\" (temple). The basis point for the interpretation of placenames is that they were not just practical measures people used to make their way but also constituted a symbolic mapping of the landscape. Thus toponyms can contribute with knowledge about the culture of previous societies for which there are no other sources.Holmberg (1991) p. 149 Toponyms tell about which deities were connected to the place and worshipped there, and names for holy places can be found, for instance, in the suffixes -v√©, -sal,-lund, -h√∏rg and -hov or -hof. One of the most common terms was v√©, meaning an area that was consecrated and thus outside the sphere of the profane and where special rules applied.B√¶ksted (1994) p. 109 The distribution of toponyms in middle Sweden containing the names of the deities Freyr and Freyja may be a trace of a prehistoric sacral kingdom in the M√§laren region associated with the two fertility deities and the idea of a sacred marriage.Hyenstrand, √Öke (1999) p. 129 There are difficulties involved in the use of toponyms, since words often have both a sacral and a non-sacral meaning; for instance the word h√∏rg can mean stone altar as well as stony soil. Many images can also be interpreted as depictions of ritual acts. For instance, the bracteates from the Germanic Iron Age can be interpreted as depictions of rituals connected to the belief of Odin, such as seid and magic.Ellmer p. 191 However, in principle, material remains can only be used as circumstantial evidence to understanding Norse society and can only contribute concrete knowledge about the time's culture if combined with written sources.Brink, Stefan (1999) p. 12 For instance, the written sources point to the existence of religious specialists within the public faith. The titles of these specialists have been found on rune stones, thus confirming their position within society. Several tales from the sagas contain remains of pre-Christian rituals. Often the stories are not of a religious nature but include singular incidents that reflect religious life. An example is Snorri's account of how the Christian king of Norway, Haakon the Good, tried to avoid taking part in the pagan feasts. It was traditionally one of the king's duties to lead a bl√≥t feast each fall. At this feast, Haakon refused to eat the sacrificed horse meat that was served, and made the sign of the cross over his goblet instead of invoking Odin. After this incident the king lost many of his supporters, and at the feast the following year, he was forced to eat the sacrificial meat and was forbidden to bless his beer with the sign of the cross.Hakon the Good's Saga This account is often used as evidence of the ruler's role as a religious leader. However, it is an important point that medieval sources have to be understood according to the environment they were written in. For instance Margaret Clunies Ross has pointed out that the descriptions of rituals appearing in the sagas are recycled in a historicised context and may not reflect practice in pre-Christian times. This can be seen by their often being explained in the texts rather than just described. From this she deduces that the readers were not expected to have direct knowledge of pagan rituals.Clunies Ross (1994) p. 86 They are also explained in terms of Christian practice; for example a hlautteinn used for sprinkling participants in a bl√≥t being described as \\"like an aspergillum\\".

It is considered as about the 58th the worst alien species in Europe.  Distribution  The indigenous distribution of Pomacea maculata is South America. Pomacea maculata is reported from Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia and it probably occurs in Uruguay and Paraguay. The type locality is the R√≠o Paran√°, which joins the R√≠o Uruguay just above Buenos Aires, forming the R√≠o de la Plata.

In Florida, Georgia, and Texas, initially the occurrences of Pomacea maculata were incorrectly identified as Pomacea canaliculata. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed that specimens collected in Florida, Georgia, and Texas were indeed Pomacea maculata. Byers et al. (2013) predicted potential range of this species in the Southeastern United States. They indicated that the minimum temperature in the coldest months and maximum amount of precipitation in the warmest months are the best predictors. In Taiwan, where golden apple snails were introduced in Asia, Pomacea maculata maybe misidentified as Pomacea canaliculata. Pomacea maculata occurs in Latin America where it thrives in some of the Amazonian rivers in Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. Description Pomacea maculata shell including an operculum. shells of Pomacea maculata. Scale bar is 5 cm. This snail species was described by Georges Perry in March 1810. Perry also created the genus Pomacea, and Pomacea maculata was described as the type of species. The snail can grow up to 15 centimeters in size. The eyes are just below the antennae. The colour of the shell varies from a pale olive green to a darker green, with dark bands across the shell. The shell is quite thin compared to other family members of the apple snail family. The inside has dark spots (maculata means spotted or stained). The shells of these applesnails are globular in shape. Normal coloration typically includes bands of brown, black, and yellowish-tan. Color patterns are however extremely variable, and both albino and gold color variations exist.R. Howells, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, personal communication. in: Benson, A. J. 2008. Pomacea insularum. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. <> Revision Date: 8/14/2007. The size of the shell is up to 150 mm in length. Pomacea maculata individuals can be difficult to differentiate morphologically from Pomacea canaliculata (but egg masses are strikingly different to a trained observer). The color of the visible soft parts is grey-brown with dark spots.Stijn Ghesquiere. Pomacea (pomacea) insularum, The Apple Snail (Ampullariidae) Website http://www.applesnail.net, accessed 26 October 2008.  Ecology  Freshwater habitat with Pomacea maculata Eggs of Pomacea maculata at the bottom of the image. Eggs of Pomacea paludosa at the top. Scale bar 5 cm = Habitat = Pomacea maculata commonly colonizes small water bodies, such as roadside ditches and littoral edges of larger water bodies. Experimentally determined incipient physiological tolerance limits under laboratory conditions for adult and juvenile Pomacea maculata collected in Texas are: * salinity: from 0.0 ‚Ä∞ to 6.8-10.2 ‚Ä∞ * pH: from 3.5-4.0 to 10.0-10.5 * temperature: 15.23 ¬∞C - 36.6 ¬∞C. It is also possible that the snails have behavioral mechanisms to tolerate low temperatures, such as burrowing, which could not be exhibited in laboratory experiments. * emersion: from 70 days at 30 ¬∞C (<5% relative humidity) to >308 days at 20-25 ¬∞C (>75% relative humidity)  Life cycle  This snail lays pink eggs in clutches above the water level. Pomacea maculata egg clutches contain 2000 eggs. = Feeding habits = Pomacea maculata voraciously consumes aquatic vegetation. The snail‚Äôs extensive consumption of aquatic vegetation and ability to accumulate and transmit algal toxins through the food web heighten concerns about its spread. The snail eats dead and decaying plant matter and algae. = Impact = The limited ecological data on Pomacea maculata in the USA show that the species has considerable impacts, especially on native aquatic vegetation and snail species. In Florida, in particular, Pomacea maculata is much larger and more fecund than the native Pomacea paludosa (that produces 20‚Äì30 eggs). Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated that Pomacea maculata can transfer the neurotoxin linked to Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy (AVM) to its avian predators. The invasion of Pomacea maculata has possibly affected the endangered snail kite, a specialist predator on the native Pomacea paludosa, which seemingly experienced decreased foraging success and juvenile survival following invasion of Pomacea maculata. There is a further, but largely unexplored risk that Pomacea maculata harbors rat lungworm parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Human use Pomacea maculata is edible and part of the ornamental pet trade for freshwater aquaria.Ng, T. H., Tan, S. K., Wong, W. H., Meier, R., Chan, S. Y., Tan, H. H., & Yeo, D. C.

It forms from the reaction of clay minerals or aluminous rocks with solutions enriched in phosphate derived from bat or bird guano or, less commonly, from bones or other organic matter. Taranakite is most commonly found in humid, bat inhabited caves near the boundary of guano layers with the cave surface. It is also found in perennially wet coastal locations that have been occupied by bird colonies. The type location, and its namesake, the Sugar Loaf Islands off Taranaki, New Zealand, is an example of a coastal occurrence. Taranakite forms small white, pale yellow, or gray crystals, which are typically found in pulverulent nodular aggregates, or crusts. Taranakite crystallizes in the hexagonal system, and is noted as having the longest crystallographic axis of any known mineral: the c-axis of the taranakite unit cell is 9.505 nanometers long. Occurrence Taranakite was first described in 1866 by James Hector and William Skey. The material had been found by H. Richmond on the Sugar Loaf Islands of Taranaki, New Zealand (in the vicinity of ), as thin yellowish- white amorphous seams in fissures within trachytic rocks. Within the taranakite, dark yellow-brown seams were observed and thought to be wavellite. Modern X-ray analysis later showed this inclusion to be vashegyite (Al11(PO4)9(OH)6)¬∑38H2O). Two of the Sugar Loaf Islands. View down the c-axis of taranakite (four unit cells visible) Taranakite itself was initially mistaken for wavellite. Physical differences--its relative softness and ease of fusibility--led Skey, the colonial New Zealand Government analyst, to undertake quantitative chemical analysis which identified the mineral as a double hydrous phosphate of aluminia and potash, with some replacement of aluminium with ferric iron. This identified it as a new mineral species - the first to be discovered in New Zealand. Hector and Skey identified bird guano as the most likely source of the phosphate required to form taranakite, and speculated on possible advantages of its use in making superphosphate, owing to the absence of carbonate and relatively small amounts of aluminium. Such industrial use was never realized owing to the limited distribution of taranakite. Taranakite was rediscovered in two cave locations, and given two new names. In 1894, Armand Gautier described a mineral which he called minervite from caves at Grotte de Minerve in H√©rault, France and argued that it formed from decomposing guano and animal remains reacting with clays. He experimentally justified this by reacting ammonium phosphate with gelatinous aluminium oxide, iron carbonate, and limestone. These reactions yielded a minervatie-like compound, and iron and calcium phosphates similar to what he observed in the caves. In 1904 Eugenio Casoria found a mineral under a guano layer at Monte Alburno, Italy which he called palmerite. These two minerals were later identified through X-ray powder diffraction as taranakite and discredited in favor of taranakite by historical priority. Further occurrences of taranakite include: * Misserghin, Algeria (as minervite) (1895) * Jenolan Caves, Australia (as minervite) (1898) :No guano deposits are present in the caves; phosphatization is believed to occur from river water containing organic matter penetrating the cave. * R√©union, Indian Ocean (as minervite) (1910) :Within a basalt cave in the Saint-Paul district * Islas Leones, Patagonia (1933) :Associated with a penguin colony * Pig Hole Cave, near Blacksburg, Virginia (1954) :A limestone cave. Taranakite occurs as a powder near the contact of bat guano and hair with clay, and within fractures in brecciated clay. This was the first discovery of taranakite in the United States. * Onino-Iwaya cave, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan (1975) :As a powder associated with gypsum within clay sediments, no more than three centimeters below the surface in areas of bat guano deposits. *Mezesse Cave near Yaound√©, Cameroon :Coralloid speleothems of regularly alternating taranakite and opal microlayers in a granitic cave. The regular layering of taranakite was explained as the seasonal effect of leaching of guano and flow of clay from upper parts of the cave during the rainy season. * Cook's Head Rock and Green Island, Otago, New Zealand (2003) :Occurring with leucophosphite as microcrystalline aggregates in jointed and brecciated basalt. Little blue penguins on Green Island and gulls on Cooks Head Rock are believed to be the main guano source. The coastal occurrences, in New Zealand and Patagonia, occur at high latitudes supporting the necessity of humid conditions for the formation of taranakite. In the tropics, rather than taranakite, the minerals that form from guano-derived phosphatization of igneous rocks are variscite (AlPO4¬∑2H2O), metavariscite (AlPO4¬∑H2O), barrandite ((Al,Fe3+)PO4¬∑2H2O), strengite and phosphosiderite (Fe3+PO4¬∑2H2O). Presence in soils Tarankaite is observed to form in the reaction zone of fertilizers. Potassium-taranakite (synonymous with taranakite) or ammonium-taranakite (where the alkali cations are replaced by ammonium) may form in acidic soils treated with potassium or ammonium-containing phosphate-fertilizers. The formation of taranakites, which are relatively insoluble, can act to reduce the bioavailability of phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen if formed. This can both hinder plant growth in initial stages by reducing the available cations, and also aid in the long run by extending the presence of these nutrients. Structure View of the taranakite unit cell perpendicular to the c-axis Taranakite crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system (hexagonal scalenohedral, _3_ 2/m) with the space group R _3_ c. The unit cell dimensions are a = 870.25 pm and c = 9505 pm, enclosing a volume of 6.234 nm3. The c-axis is the longest of any known mineral. Atomic environment within a layer of the taranakite unit cell, showing three crystallographically distinct aluminium centres linked by HPO42‚àí units (potassium ions not shown). The unit cell of taranakite contains six layers of composition ()6()2()12, each 13.78 √Ö thick and separated by layers of water. The rigid structure of each layer is built around 2‚àí groups coordinating three crystallographically distinct aluminium centres, each of which has coordination number six. Near the middle of each layer, an aluminium ion octahedrally coordinates six HPO42‚àí. Two other oxygens in each hydrogen phosphate group coordinate the other distinct aluminium centres, which in turn are coordinated octahedral to three hydrogen phosphate groups and three water molecules. This structure forms an Al'-P-Al-P-Al' linkage nearly parallel to the c-axis, with the other distinct aluminium atom offset, and nearly vertically below a PO43‚àí ion. Taranakite readily loses water when heated. Thermal gravimetric analysis shows two endothermic water loss events occurring in the ranges 80-140 ¬∞C and 140-300 ¬∞C corresponding to the sequential loss of five and thirteen water molecules to form francoanellite and a noncrystalline material. Heating to 500 ¬∞C results in complete dehydration to form K3Al5P8O29. In the range 562-595 ¬∞C crystalline AlPO4 and KAlP2O7 form.

His catalogue of 1862-63 (2 volumes) continued the earlier catalogues of Radcliffe and of Greswell (from 1791 and 1821 respectively). He was described as \\"one who seemed designed by nature for the place and whose whole soul was in his work\\". As well as the catalogues of the library's collections, he wrote a Catalogue of the collection of tracts for and against popery (published in and about the reign of James II) in the Manchester library founded by Humphrey Chetham (1859).

Academic career  From 1868 he was a student at the University of G√∂ttingen, and following military duty in the Franco-Prussian War, he continued his education at the University of Bonn, where he had as instructors Franz B√ºcheler and Hermann Usener. At Bonn his fellow students included Georg Kaibel, Friedrich von Duhn, Georg Dehio and Hans Delbr√ºck. After graduation in 1873 he toured countries of the Mediterranean extensively. In 1881 he became an associate professor at the University of Kiel, followed by professorships at the Universities of Rostock (1883), Strasbourg (1888) and G√∂ttingen (1889). At the latter institution he was university rector (1903‚Äì4), and was a colleague of Ulrich von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff. In 1889 he became a member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences.  Written works  Much of Leo's earlier work concerned research of Seneca's tragedies and the writings of Venantius Fortunatus. Later his focus dealt largely with works of Roman playwright Plautus and early Roman literature in general.

The Robert Day School emphasizes coursework that blends theory and practice. The undergraduate programs offer majors in economics and economics-accounting, and a sequence in financial economics. RDS also offers a specialized full-time master's degree in finance as well as administering the Robert Day Scholars Program. In contrast to any other liberal arts college, the offerings include a broad spectrum of core and elective courses in finance and accounting. The course is designed to develop the individual student's analytical, quantitative, and communication skills.https://www.cmc.edu/rdschool/discover/ The establishment of the program was controversial, with several professors sending a letter to CMC president Pamela Gann saying they were concerned that the gift would \\"distort the college into a single focus trade school.\\" History In 2007, the founder and Chairman of Trust Company of the West and Trustee and former Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Claremont McKenna College, Robert A. Day (‚Äô65), made a $200 million individual gift, the largest donation ever made to a liberal arts college at the time, to Claremont McKenna College for the purpose of creating a one-year graduate program that would emphasize finance, accounting, organizational behavior and leadership as well as a scholarship for seniors at the Claremont Colleges. While both programs share the same name, the master's program is an addition, rather than a change, to the established undergraduate program which offers majors in both economics and economics-accounting as well as a financial economics sequence that students can earn in addition to any major. The master's program accepted the first students, 20 members of the class of 2010, in the beginning of 2009. Academic programs= Undergraduate programs = At the undergraduate level, the Robert Day School offers a broad array of coursework in economics, finance, and accounting. The undergraduate majors build of theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics, and stress applications of theory to a variety of topics, as reflected in over 40 upper-level courses. Many students choose to double major in subjects such as mathematics, psychology, or history. Another popular option is to augment the major with a sequence. Students may participate in research with faculty, sponsored by the various research institutes on campus, and all students conduct their own research with a faculty advisor that culminates in a thesis in their respective major, which is a requirement for graduation. https://www.cmc.edu/rdschool/academic/undergraduate/ = Graduate program = The school offers undergraduates a one-year master's degree in finance.

The position was established in the Constitution of 1876. It was abolished in 1996. History The office of State Treasurer superseded a similar office in the Republic of Texas. The Treasurer had a four-year term as head of the State Treasury Department. Duties were divided between the State Treasurer and the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Over time, the Texas Legislature transferred most of the Treasurer's functions to the Comptroller's office. The last State Treasurer, Martha Whitehead, successfully campaigned for office in 1994 on the premise of abolishing the position and transferring its few remaining duties to the Comptroller's office. Detractors to Whitehead's plan, including Republican opponent David Hartman, favored expanding the Treasury by having it assume the duties of several other state agencies, including the Public Finance Authority and the Pension Review Board, possibly saving more money. Whitehead said in the event voters kept the office open she would have served the whole four- year term.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/us/the-1994-campaign-texas- candidate-seeks-job-she-would-cut.html Whitehead, a Democrat, won by a narrow margin‚Äî50.29 percent to Hartman's 49.7 percent of 4,145,981 votes cast statewide. Whitehead successfully campaigned the Legislature for a constitutional amendment in 1995 to formally abolish the Treasurer's office, which was approved by voters in November of that year. By 1996, the Comptroller had taken over the Treasurer's few remaining duties, and the treasury department was formally closed in 1996.http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tslac/10211/tsl-10211.html Organization The major duties of the office were to receive and keep state money, maintain accounts of all receipts and expenditures, collect cigarette and tobacco taxes and certain gross-receipts taxes, serve as custodian of securities in trust, receive unclaimed property held in trust, and administer money in a local government-investment pool called TexPool. Additionally, the treasurer acted as chairman of the State Depository Board and the Cash Management Committee, officer of the Treasury Safekeeping Trust Company, and member of the State Banking Board and Bond Review Board. The State Treasury Department had two divisions: fiscal management and administration. Within the fiscal management area the Fiscal Operations Division processes checks from state agencies and state warrants. The State Depository Board approved Texas financial institutions to function as state depositories and establishes interest rates on state time deposits. The Treasury Safekeeping Trust Company kept several billion dollars in securities owned by state agencies and the treasury. Unclaimed money from dormant bank accounts, insurance benefits, corporate dividends, and mineral proceeds, for example, were handled through the Unclaimed Property Division, which the treasury used to locate missing owners. The administrative divisions of the treasury provided computer operations, legal support, and the sale and distribution of cigarette and alcoholic beverage stamps. The Cash Flow Estimating Division forecasted state expenditures and revenue. The Rapid Deposit Program developed efficient cash- management programs. A system called TEXNET, begun in 1990, was designed to receive and process large taxpayer payments electronically to hasten interest earnings. In 1990 approximately 260 employees worked in the State Treasury Department, which had an operating budget of more than $21 million. The treasury processed more than 34,000 checks a day from state agencies and earned more than $300 million in interest during the fiscal year.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mbsex Notable Texas State Treasurers Some notable former state treasurers in Texas include: * Francis Lubbock (1878‚Äì1891) * W.

In October 2014, the US State Department increased the reward for any information leading to the capture or killing of al-Wuhayshi to US$10 million, the same as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

He spent time in religious institutions in Yemen before travelling to Afghanistan in 1998 and joining al-Qaeda. al-Wuhayshi served as secretary to Osama bin Laden for years in Afghanistan. He left Afghanistan in 2001 and was soon arrested by Iranian authorities, who handed him over to his native Yemen two years later where he was imprisoned without charges.Robert F. Worth, \\"Is Yemen the Next Afghanistan?\\" New York Times (6 July 2010).

Nasir al-Wuhayshi and three other men appeared in several threatening videos released in January 2009. Al Wuhayshi published an additional video calling for violence in February. He claimed the increase in western warships off the Horn of Africa to fight piracy were really intended to oppress Islam. According to Yemeni military officials he was killed in southern Yemen on 28 August 2011. On 25 October 2011, AQAP denied that he was killed.

In 2013, Al-Qaeda Emir Ayman al-Zawahiri appointed al- Wuhayshi as his deputy, speculating that he may be the next Emir of Al-Qaeda. In March 2014, al-Wuhayshi made an appearance in a video celebrating the mass jailbreak of fighters held in Yemeni prisons. Around 400 AQAP fighters were present in what was described as being the largest known gathering of al-Qaeda in Yemen. In the video, al-Wuhayshi declared, \\"We have to remove the Cross, and the bearer of the Cross, America.\\" Death Al-Wuhayshi was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen on 12 June 2015.

It was the only Carthusian monastery in Scandinavia,apart from three unsuccessful attempts to establish one in Denmark: see List of Carthusian monasteries and one of the last monasteries established in Sweden before the Reformation. History The establishment of a Carthusian monastery in Sweden was brought about by the efforts of Jakob Ulvsson, Archbishop of Uppsala, and Kort Rogge, Bishop of Str√§ngn√§s, who in 1493 persuaded Sten Sture the elder, Regent of Sweden, to have the monks Fikke Dyssin and Johannes Sanderi together with two lay brothers sent from the Marienehe Charterhouse near Rostock to Sweden for a meeting with the riksr√•det (Privy Council of Sweden). Later that year Sten Sture enfeoffed the Carthusians with the Gripsholm estate in Selebo h√§rad in S√∂dermanland and in 1502 gave them other lands round about. The monastery church was dedicated on 15 February 1504. The monastery was built on the high ground close to Gripsholm Castle on a site where Mariefred Church now stands. In 1498 the lay brothers set up a printing press. The only book now known from this press is a tract for an ecstatic devotional movement based on the veneration of the rosary, the \\"Brotherhood of the Psalter of the Virgin Mary\\". This was distributed across the whole of Europe, and had a powerful effect on the devotional life of late medieval period. Mariefred Charterhouse was short- lived: in 1526 it was one of the first monasteries secularised by Gustav Vasa. In December 1525 he claimed its assets from the heirs of Sten Sture the Elder, who had given the estate to the monastery on the condition that it should pass to the right heirs of the monastery if it were ever wound up. This claim was legitimated by the Privy Council in January 1526. Virtually no trace of the monastic buildings now remains above ground: Gustav Vasa had them dismantled for the construction of Gripsholm Castle. A cellar and a few traces of walls have been discovered to the south of the church. A small collection of stones discovered during excavations in the monastery grounds, is in the church tower. The present parish church of Mariefred, on the site of the former charterhouse Mariefred Church Mariefred Church (Mariefreds kyrka) was built in 1621-1624 over the ruins of the old Cartusian monastery. It was built of stone and was burned in 1682 but rebuilt and completed in 1697. Today it is the parish church of Mariefred and is associated with the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s.

The 1993 - 2000 F650 was the first single-cylinder motorcycle from BMW since the 1960‚Äì1966 R27, and the first chain driven motorcycles from BMW. Newer models (post-2000) included the F650CS Scarver, F650GS, and F650GS Dakar. 1993‚Äì2000: F650 and F650St Strada The BMW F650St Strada was introduced to Europe in 1993, a variant F650 (dubbed the 'Funduro') in 1994 and then to the United States in 1997. The BMW F650 models were jointly designed by BMW and Aprilia, who also launched their own very similar model called the Aprilia Pegaso 650 (a 654cc single cylinder, 5 valve motorcycle). The BMW version was assembled in Italy by Aprilia and these were powered by the Austrian 652cc single-cylinder, 4 valve Rotax engine. It was the first BMW motorcycle with chain drive since the 1960s. The two variant models of the F650 motorcycle had some subtle differences which determined their utility bias: the F650 'Funduro' was the more dual/multi purpose with more off-road capability due to the longer wheel base, more ground clearance and taller seat height, a higher front fairing and a larger 19inch front wheel, the F650St Strada had slightly smaller dimensions and an 18 inch front wheel. Both models used two 33 mm Mikuni carburetors. In 2000, BMW introduced the F650GS to replace the F650, and the F650CS Scarver to replace the F650St Strada variant. In 2001, the original F650 was discontinued. 2000‚Äì2007: F650GS, F650GS Dakar, and G650X Produced from 2000 to 2007, the BMW F650GS is a dual- purpose motorcycle. It sold over 105,000 units during its production life. It was available in a lowered model with lower seat height from a shorter rear shock, a standard model, and a taller more off-road oriented 'Dakar' model. The Dakar model had a thinner, 21 inch front wheel (as opposed to the street oriented 19 inch) and longer suspension travel for improved off-road handling. It also had a thicker, higher seat. It was named after the Paris Dakar Rally, which BMW rider Richard Sainct won on the F650RR in 1999 and 2000. The 'Dakar' specifications put it in the 650 cc dual-sport class, competing against bikes such as the Kawasaki KLR650, Suzuki DR650, Honda XR650L, KTM LC4 640, Yamaha XT660 and Honda Transalp. A specially prepared rally raid version of the bike was used by Charley Boorman and his team during the 2006 Dakar Rally while filming their documentary Race to Dakar. The G650X series was released as 2007-year models, consisting of the off-road X-Challenge, the scrambler-style X-Country, and the road-oriented X-Moto. This series was discontinued after the 2009 model year. =Design and technology= The F650GS had several advanced technology features for its time, with computer-controlled fuel injection, catalytic converter, a Nikasil-lined cylinder, optional ABS and an airbox designed to exploit the airflow pattern of the bike when in motion. Combined with the bike's high compression ratio and twin spark plugs (from 2004 onwards), excellent fuel economy and low emissions existed alongside high power output. The original F650 single-engine was manufactured for BMW by Austrian company Rotax while the bike was assembled by Aprilia. When the F650GS was launched, the full process was brought back in-house. In 2000, the German motorcycle magazine Motorrad reported about a defeat device delivered within the BMW F 650 GS. BMW responded in issuing an improved injection as of 2001 and calling back the models from the previous year. Amongst the changes from the original F650, the engine was upgraded to a 43 mm throttle body. The fuel is stored in an under seat fuel tank, and the false tank (where a conventional fuel tank would be) housed the remote oil reservoir (for the dry sump), airbox and battery. This contributed to a lower centre of gravity for improved handling. The bodywork was redesigned by head BMW designer David Robb. Due to the high numbers sold, the F650GS developed a large aftermarket accessories range and a sizeable owner community. BMW also developed a large range of factory original hard luggage for the bike. 2008: F650GS parallel- twin In 2008, the single-cylinder F650GS was discontinued and replaced by an all-new design featuring a 798 cc, parallel twin engine. Intended as a new- generation replacement for the old bikes, the new motorcycle has retained the same F650GS model name, despite the fact that it has a larger engine. 2009: G650GS In late 2008, BMW relaunched the original single-cylinder F650GS under the new name G650GS in the United States, South America, Greece and Australia. The new G650GS is essentially the 2007 single-cylinder F650GS brought back into production with some minor modifications and with the engine assembled by Loncin in China instead of Rotax in Austria, but still using parts manufactured by Rotax in Europe.Motorcycle News (USA), April 2009, page 5 The finished engines are shipped back to BMW in Germany where the bikes are assembled. G650GS models with the Chinese-assembled engines can be easily identified as the engines are painted black while in the earlier European- assembled engines were finished in silver. Before the bike was discontinued in 2007, there was a brief period when the engines were assembled by Kymco in Taiwan. The G650GS received some upgrades over the F650GS of 2007: the engine now produces 3 additional horsepower (now 53 hp) and received a stronger 400 watt alternator. In the United States and Australia, ABS and heated grips are now standard equipment instead of \\"additional cost options\\" because BMW sells their bikes through dealers with nonnegotiable accessories packages added and included in the MSRP. An emergency services specific version of the G650GS, fitted with blue lights and sirens, is available from BMW Motorrad's Official and special duty vehicles division. In 2010, at the EICMA show in Italy, BMW Motorrad announced the global availability of the G650GS with a slightly down- rated engine producing . In 2012, BMW released the G650GS Sert√£o, which is a more off-road capable version. The Sert√£o fills the product gap that was left when the F650GS Dakar was discontinued in 2008.

It follows the earlier lives of characters Renton and Sick Boy as they first descend into heroin addiction. Background When Welsh described the novel he said: \\"I think I‚Äôm going to call it Skag Boys: ‚Äúskag‚Äù is my favourite word for heroin. It's set before their fall into heroin and investigates how the main characters became junkies, the family dynamics, the anxieties of young men. A lot of the fringe characters become more prominent\\". \\"I had a great deal of material that for various reasons, namely pace and because it didn't fit with the timeframe, wasn't suitable for the book. There's a particular section about Renton and Sick Boy's first visit to London to stay with their friend Nicksy in Hackney that I always wanted to publish, but it was just a bit too long for magazines and anthologies. So I've pulled back some of the other unused Trainspotting material and put alongside this piece. The thing is basically a prequel to Trainspotting. It's basically about how Renton and Sick Boy went from being daft young guys just out for the buzz on drugs, to total junkies. It shows how their attitudes and behaviour start to change as they become more defined by the drug and the culture around it\\". In 2012, Welsh said the prequel was actually initially written as part of Trainspotting but was not used in the published version. He later decided he would either erase his old work or use it in some way, as \\"he had a fear that he might fall under a bus and leave behind 'half-written stuff' which people would publish\\". He said, \\"I just went through it and started writing on the basis of what was there, getting inspired by what I was reading and chopping bits out and putting bits in. Before I knew it I had another novel on my hands\\". Plot summary Section 1: Tempted In 1984, Mark Renton and his father Davie have travelled to Yorkshire to take part in a picket of the coke plant. After briefly meeting his London pal Nicksy, he gets caught up in the police-picket violence and, shaken, feels estranged from his father and the pickets and refuses to return to Glasgow. In the Banana flats, Sick Boy becomes determined to seduce Maria, the nubile daughter of his neighbours, and takes her father Coke to the local pub. However, they fall foul of violent, ex-cop pub landlord Dickson, and are expelled from the bar. Meanwhile, in Manchester, Mark meets Nicksy again and accompanies him to a party. He is offered heroin to chase, but rejects this in disgust. While Renton accompanies Begbie, Spud, Tommy and Keezbo to a Leith pub to watch the Euro 84 final, eighteen-year-old Samantha Frenchard comes in and accuses Begbie of getting her pregnant. After a blazing row he humiliates her and she storms out, swearing retribution. Renton realises that he has grown obsessed with \\"the skag\\" and had really wanted to take it in Manchester. He and Sick Boy go to see Swanney, an old football mate and drug dealer, who helps him fix up. The resulting high is so good he doesn‚Äôt even care that he and Sick Boy have stood up the psychotic Begbie for a drink. Samantha's family learn about her pregnancy and are told that Begbie wants nothing to do with her or the baby; they plot revenge. Sick Boy once again takes Coke to Dickson's pub. While Sick Boy fixes heroin in the toilet, Dickson takes Coke outside and beats him unconscious. Sick Boy heads to the hospital and learns from Coke's distraught family that he has slipped into a coma; he eventually dies from his injuries. Feeling isolated from his family, Renton moves into Sick Boy's place. His search for more heroin leads him to meet Mikey Forrester in Muirhouse. There, he meets Alison, who tells Renton her mother is dying, and Sylvia, who takes him back to her place in Lochend for sex. When he gets back, Renton gives Spud his first hit of heroin. The following day, Alison learns that the brother of her boss in a Dutch Elm disease control unit is involved in drug smuggling at a local chemical processing plant. After attending a family barbecue, Alison seduces her boss. Section 2: Falling During an Aberdeen University field trip to Europe, Renton begins a sexual relationship with his classmate Fiona. When he returns home, he learns that his sickly brother has died. There are tensions between him and the rest of the family as funeral preparations are made, but they are dissipated when Fiona arrives and charms the family. Meanwhile, with Maria staying in Nottingham, Sick Boy seduces her mother Janey and encourages her to make a fraudulent claim on Coke's docks pension. Spud encounters Sick Boy and Alison before witnessing Begbie stabbing one of Samantha Frenchard's brothers. Renton learns from a despondent Sick Boy that Dickson has gotten off with Coke's murder. Janey has been anonymously grassed up for the benefit fraud and taken to prison. Confused and angry, Maria stays alone in the house and, with Sick Boy's help, plots revenge on Dickson. Tommy catches up with Begbie and, with a group of enlisted friends, accompanies him to Pilton and help him lay siege to the Frenchard family's home. The attack ends when Begbie smashes her brother Ronnie's face in with an iron bar. They flee back to Leith in triumph, but on their return, Davie tells Tommy that Renton has gone away with Matty, presumably in search of heroin. Section 3: Cold On his Aberdeen wanders, Renton meets a junky named Don, who becomes his heroin connection. He begins keeping secrets from Fiona as he indulges in the skag. Renton eventually confesses his behavior to Fiona and they break up on bad terms. Suffering from withdrawal, Sick Boy and Maria resort to prostitution to support their mutual heroin addiction. Sick Boy finds a homeless Spud and lets him stay at the flat. He then goes to his mother's new place and is horrified to find that his father has moved back in. Desperate to prove to himself that he's a better man than his father, Sick Boy pledges to look after Maria and take care of her. When Don mysteriously leaves town, Renton heads back to Edinburgh to stay with Sick Boy. Renton, Sick Boy, Begbie, Keezbo, Tommy and Spud try to burgle a big house. However, Renton, Tommy, and an injured Spud rescue a Spanish au pair, Carmelita, who has overdosed on pills and vodka in a suicide attempt. Later, Alison encounters Renton and Sick Boy at a club and accompanies them to Swanney's where she witnesses Swanney arguing with a skag supplier that she recognizes as a worker at the chemical plant. Alison takes Sick Boy back to her place in Pilrig, where he tries to talk her into having anal sex. Instead, Alison convinces him to let her use a strap-on dildo on him, which he enjoys more than he expects or admits. Sick Boy and Maria visit Janey in prison, who is distraught when she hears of their relationship. When they return to Leith, Sick Boy sets a drug-stunned Maria up with more punters, one of whom, to her extreme horror, is Dickson. Section 4: Thawing Alison befriends Maria and delivers her to her family in Nottingham. At the hospital, she witnesses her mother's death from cancer but has to get away from her grieving family. She heads to Swanney's in shock, catching Matty lurking outside. Inside, there is another Matty-Swanney conflict about Matty trying to get into Swanney's business. 33.

Dirty Dicks ‚Äì Narrated by Renton. Mark wakes up and he and Nicksy chase brown and lament defeat in the class war. Begbie phones, saying that June's father caught them in a sexual encounter and threw her out the house so they are getting a flat together.

At the party, Renton bangs up with Lesley and they fall asleep, petting each other but without having sex. They wake up the next morning having missed the bells, Renton being hauled down to the pub for the Hibs-Hearts game.

Unknown to either man, Davie's oldest son, rootless ex-squaddie Billy, drinking in the corner with his friends Lenny and Peasbo, has witnessed this confrontation. Billy sets Dickson up to go into the adjoining yard on the pretext of ‚Äògetting‚Äô Davie, but then gives the unpopular landlord a savage beating.

Nicksy is walking around the boat, confused, the foetus in his bag. It moves into a Sick Boy narrative as he takes advantage of chaos of the football riot to steal Cream Shirt's wallet. It ends up with Renton narrating; he's been skiving on the car deck, smacked out. They go to Amsterdam, and are having second thoughts about drug running for Marriot. Sick Boy and Nicksy vanish, and Renton ends up having sex with Charlene back on the boat, after learning that she's a career thief.

After having to take 50 grams of heroin through customs on his own, Marriot has the lads in his sights. Renton, Sick Boy and Nicksy go back to Hackney, resolving not to return to Sealink and to steer clear of Essex. Charlene has also packed it in and she and Renton are shoplifting and horned up, when she drops a bombshell; she's into somebody else and it's all over between them. To the increasingly depressed Nicksy's dismay, Renton attempts to store drugs in the freezer compartment where he keeps the foetus (in a shoebox) he is unable to give up. He takes the box containing the foetus out and sticks it into his Sealink bag. He goes down to the library and after some research decides that Marsha must come down and see the foetus for herself. Charlene takes the Sealink bag, swapping it for her own, believing the Northern Soul singles are in it, before leaving Renton. Renton gets over this by shooting up heroin and giving a grandiose self- justification speech to Nicksy as to how it's his right as a Scot. Speed psychotic, Nicksy goes upstairs to confront Marsha, determined that she‚Äôll see the foetus. 45.

He finds Renton and their principal concern is their flat being full of drugs and what would happen if it got searched. Nicksy is eventually talked back inside.

They head down to see Maria and her friend Jenny at a bar, with Sick Boy holding court as top predator. Nelly comes in and Renton learns that his friends Julie and Goagsie are both HIV+. Renton and Matty leave the others and opportunistically steal the Cat Protection League tin from Mrs Rylance's shop, but can‚Äôt get it open.

Renton detox's at the centre and joins the group. This lengthy, crucial chapter, stylistically different from the rest of the novel, though foreshadowed in the opening chapter, is written as his rehab diary and journal.

Meanwhile, Sick Boy is shagging confused hooker Molly, Swanney is winding everybody up, suggesting the absent Matty is a grass, Seeker declaring he's staying clean to make proper money dealing, Renton realizing that ‚Äòthe rehab game‚Äô is not about quitting, but detoxing to get the habit under control.

They gain entry, but the alarm is raised and they have to make a hasty escape, and Keezbo is stranded in the plant, due largely to Matty. They have a hostile fall-out, with Renton and Sick Boy ganging up on Matty, and him fleeing, to be comforted by Spud. Renton and Sick Boy carry on towards the flat. Sick Boy almost confesses his treatment of Janie and Maria, but pulls back, while prompting Renton to disclose about his infidelity to Fiona with Joanne. (Which Sick Boy already knows about.) They make a heartfelt pact to get clean and never touch skag again, but as they open the door of the flat, the phone is ringing. Reactions Sam Leith, in the Financial Times, argues, \\"Heroin addiction is there not as a metaphor but as a sort of paradigm: a morally inverted Thatcherism. The addict is the ultimate individualist..\\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9eb99e7a-84e5-11e1-a3c5-00144feab49a.html#axzz1sQx0Wdck 3:AM Magazine remarks, \\"It was known that there was more material of Trainspotting than went into the final draft, but that‚Äôs true of most novels. So you anticipate a lashed-together series of outtakes and bloopers. What you get is something quite different. The prequel has all the marvellous set pieces, the schemes, stories, scams and dreams and the same mad profusion of narrators that characterises everything Welsh has written. But it‚Äôs long, strange, full of lush description that gives the whole thing a haunting and elegiac quality\\".http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/this-is-an-epidemic/ References Novels by Irvine Welsh 2012 British novels Prequel novels Jonathan Cape books ","title":"Skagboys"},{"id":"21274242","text":"Nicholas Hugh \\"Nick\\" Pigott (born 1951) was the editor of The Railway Magazine, Britain's best-selling rail title between 1994 and 2015.

In 2002, he was voted IPC Media's Specialist Writer of the Year and in 2008 was shortlisted in the national Editor of the Year awards held by the British Society of Magazine Editors. On 22 March 2007, The Railway Magazine won the top prize at IPC Media's Editorial Awards ceremony. Competition for this award was limited to specialist titles within IPC Media selling up to 40,000 copies per month. One week later, 29 March 2007, the magazine's marketforce team won the Gold Cup awarded by the Association of Circulation Executives. The Railway Magazine and Steam Railway The Railway Magazine was a long-running monthly railway magazine dating back to July 1897, but in 1988, whilst under the Editorship of John N. Slater (1970‚Äì1989), lost its position as \\"best-selling rail title\\". That went to a younger competitor, Steam Railway magazine, which had been founded nine years earlier under the launch Editor David Wilcock. Wilcock was followed as Editor by Nick Pigott. By the early 1990s Steam Railway was outselling The Railway Magazine by upwards of 10,000 copies per month. Slater's successor Peter Kelly (1989‚Äì1994) attempted to reduce the sales gap and that work was continued under his successor, Nick Pigott; who by then had moved over from Steam Railway. In 2008, The Railway Magazine regained its position as Britain's best-selling rail title and has continued to increase its circulation ever since. Its current publisher is Mortons Media, which bought the title from IPC Media in August 2010.

Maccius Plautus. It is said to be one of Plautus's favorite works. Epidicus is the name of the main character, who is a slave. The plot takes many turns as Epidicus tries to please his master's son, Stratippocles. The main plot was based upon a Greek play, however the story line was changed in order to prevent a brother from marrying his half-sister. This change was made because Romans considered this incest, which deeply disturbed them; the Greeks, however, were not bothered by this.  Characters  *Periphanes ‚Äì an aged Athenian who has a son in wedlock, Stratippocles. Had a relationship with a Theban woman, Philippa and had an illegitimate daughter, Telestis, who lives with her mother in Thebes. *Stratippocles ‚Äì son of Periphanes, is summoned to war in Thebes between the Athenians and Thebans. Has his slave, Epidicus, purchase a slave girl, Acropolistis, before he leaves for war. Once in Thebes, falls in love with another girl, Telestis, whom he purchases on borrowed money. *Philippa ‚Äì formerly seduced by Periphanes. A woman of Thebes who has an illegitimate daughter, Telestis. *Epidicus ‚Äì slave to Periphanes. *Telestis ‚Äì illegitimate daughter of Periphanes and Philippa. *Acropolistis ‚Äì first girl that Stratippocles falls in love with; plays as if she is Periphanes' daughter  Plot  Epidicus is a slave who looks only to please those he serves. In the play, Epidicus tricks his master, Periphanes, out of a sum of money in order to purchase a female slave, Acropolistis, that the master's son, Stratippocles, has fallen in love with. Epidicus does this by convincing Periphanes that this girl is his daughter from Philippa, whom he hasn't seen in many years, and has been captured in Thebes and brought to Athens. Believing this young woman is his daughter, Periphanes willingly hands over the money. Stratippocles soon goes off to war and falls in love with a different woman while away. To purchase this new woman, Stratippocles borrows forty mince from a banker. When Stratippocles returns home, he vows not to meet with his father until the debt is paid back to the banker. To accomplish this, Stratippocles tells Epidicus to accumulate the money, and if he cannot do so he will be severely punished. To convince Periphanes to give him more money, Epidicus tells his master that his son is about to purchase a singing- girl, Acropolistis, in order to marry her. Epidicus states that he needs to purchase her before his son can so that this can be avoided. Eventually, Periphanes decides to give his slave the money. Once the money is received, Epidicus uses it to pay off the banker. Epidicus then purchases a different singing-girl to act as if she were Acropolistis. A captain who is enamored with Acropolistis comes to Periphanes home in hopes of convincing Epidicus to allow him to gain custody of her. However, when the captain shows up he realizes that the singing-girl is not Acropolistis, but instead a fraud (all the while, the real Acropolistis is presented to Periphanes as his daughter, Telestis). While this is occurring, Philippa shows up at Periphanes home looking for her daughter since she heard she was brought to Athens. Periphanes assures Philippa that their daughter, Telestis, is safe inside. When Telestis is presented to Philippa, she instantly knows it is not her daughter and is a fraud (the real acropolistis). Epidicus is soon confronted about his double deceit and is to be severely punished. However, the woman that Stratippocles purchased while away is brought to Periphanes home with her former master, ready to be given to Stratippocles. When the young slave girl walks in, Philippa recognizes her to be her daughter, Telestis. Overwhelmed and confused, Periphanes finally meets his daughter for the first time. Stratippocles, upset about the loss of his \\"love\\" due to her being his half- sister, is \\"comforted\\" by Acropolistis (the original girl which he had Epidicus purchase for him). Epidicus is quickly forgiven his trickery and is set free because he helped reunite a father and daughter.  External links  *Perseus Project ‚Äì T.

Tube bending may be form- bound or use freeform-bending procedures, and it may use heat supported or cold forming procedures. Form bound bending procedures like ‚Äúpress bending‚Äù or ‚Äúrotary draw bending‚Äù are used to form the work piece into the shape of a die. Straight tube stock can be formed using a bending machine to create a variety of single or multiple bends and to shape the piece into the desired form. These processes can be used to form complex shapes out of different types of ductile metal tubing.. Freeform-bending processes, like three-roll- pushbending, shape the workpiece kinematically, thus the bending contour is not dependent on the tool geometry. Generally, round stock is used in tube bending. However, square and rectangular tubes and pipes may also be bent to meet job specifications. Other factors involved in the bending process are the wall thickness, tooling and lubricants needed by the pipe and tube bender to best shape the material, and the different ways the tube may be used (tube, pipe wires). Geometry A tube can be bent in multiple directions and angles. Common simple bends consist of forming elbows, which are bends, and U-bends, which are 180¬∞ bends. More complex geometries include multiple two- dimensional (2D) bends and three-dimensional (3D) bends. A 2D tube has the openings on the same plane; a 3D has openings on different planes. A two plane bend or compound bend is defined as a compound bend that has a bend in the plan view and a bend in the elevation. When calculating a two plane bend, one must know the bend angle and rotation (dihedral angle). One side effect of bending the workpiece is the wall thickness changes; the wall along the inner radius of the tube becomes thicker and the outer wall becomes thinner. To reduce this the tube may be supported internally and or externally to preserve the cross section. Depending on the bend angle, wall thickness, and bending process the inside of the wall may wrinkle. Processes Tube bending as a process starts with loading a tube into a tube or pipe bender and clamping it into place between two dies, the clamping block and the forming die. The tube is also loosely held by two other dies, the wiper die and the pressure die. The process of tube bending involves using mechanical force to push stock material pipe or tubing against a die, forcing the pipe or tube to conform to the shape of the die. Often, stock tubing is held firmly in place while the end is rotated and rolled around the die. Other forms of processing including pushing stock through rollers that bend it into a simple curve.. For some tube bending processing, a mandrel is placed inside the tube to prevent collapsing. The tube is held in tension by a wiper die to prevent any creasing during stress. A wiper die is usually made of a softer alloy such as aluminum or brass to avoid scratching or damaging the material being bent. Much of the tooling is made of hardened steel or tool steel to maintain and prolong the tool's life. However, when there is a concern of scratching or gouging the work piece, a softer material such as aluminum or bronze is utilized. For example, the clamping block, rotating form block and pressure die are often formed from hardened steel because the tubing is not moving past these parts of the machine. The pressure die and the wiping die are formed from aluminum or bronze to maintain the shape and surface of the work piece as it slides by. Pipe bending machines are typically human powered, pneumatic powered, hydraulic assisted, hydraulic driven, or electric servomotor. =Press bending= Press bending is probably the first bending process used on cold pipes and tubing. In this process a die in the shape of the bend is pressed against the pipe forcing the pipe to fit the shape of the bend. Because the pipe is not supported internally there is some deformation of the shape of the pipe, resulting in an oval cross section. This process is used where a consistent cross section of the pipe is not required. Although a single die can produce various shapes, it only works for one size tube and radius. =Rotary draw bending= Full tooling for rotary draw bending Rotary draw bending (RDB) is a precise technology, since it bends using tooling or \\"die sets\\" which have a constant center line radius (CLR), alternatively indicated as mean bending radius (Rm). Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs with varying degrees of bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes. Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle roll cages, handles, lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application. CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements. The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean bending radius Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the pressure die is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and ovalization. For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the mandrel, and the wiper die (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products. =Roll bending= During the roll bending process the pipe, extrusion, or solid is passed through a series of rollers (typically three) that apply pressure to the pipe gradually changing the bend radius in the pipe. The pyramid style roll benders have one moving roll, usually the top roll. Double pinch type roll benders have two adjustable rolls, usually the bottom rolls, and a fixed top roll. This method of bending causes very little deformation in the cross section of the pipe. This process is suited to producing coils of pipe as well as long gentle bends like those used in truss systems. Three-roll push bending Three-roll push bending process Three-roll push bending (TRPB) is the most commonly used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several plane bending curves. Nevertheless, 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the bending radius. The bending point is the tangent- point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw bending machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial- functions can be manufactured. Simple three-roll bending Three roll bending of tubes and open profiles can also be performed with simpler machines, often semi-automatic and non CNC controlled, able to feed the tube into the bending zone by friction. These machines have often a vertical layout, i.e. the three rolls lie on a vertical plane. =Induction bending= An induction coil is placed around a small section of the pipe at the bend point. It is then induction heated to between 800 and 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (430 and 1,200 C). While the pipe is hot, pressure is placed on the pipe to bend it. The pipe can then be quenched with either air or water spray or be cooled against ambient air. Induction bending is used to produce bends for a wide range of applications, such as (thin walled) pipe lines for both the upstream and down stream and on- and off shore segments of the petrochemical industry, large radius structural parts for the construction industry, thick walled, short radius bends for the power generating industry and city heating systems. Big advantages of induction bending are:  no need for mandrels  bend radii and angles (1¬∞-180¬∞) can be freely selected  highly accurate bend radii and angles  accurate pipe spools can easily be produced  significant savings can be obtained on field welds  wide range of pipe sizes can be accommodated in one machine (1‚Äù OD thru 80‚ÄùOD)  excellent wall thinning and ovality values =Packing=Ice packing The pipe is filled with a water solution, frozen, and bent while cold. The solute (soap can be used) makes the ice flexible. This technique is used to make trombones. Pitch packing A similar techniques using pitch was formerly used, but discontinued because the pitch was hard to clean out without excessive heat. Sand-packing/hot-slab forming In the sand packing process the pipe is filled with fine sand and the ends are capped. The filled pipe is heated in a furnace to or higher. Then it is placed on a slab with pins set in it, and bent around the pins using a winch, crane, or some other mechanical force. The sand in the pipe minimizes distortion in the pipe cross section. s A mandrel is a steel rod or linked ball inserted into the tube while it is being bent to give the tube extra support to reduce wrinkling and breaking the tube during this process. The different types of mandrels are as follows. * Plug mandrel: a solid rod used on normal bends * Form mandrel: a solid rod with curved end used on bend when more support is needed * Ball mandrel without cable: unlinked steel ball bearings inserted into tube, used on critical and precise bends * Ball mandrel with cable: linked ball bearings inserted into tube, used on critical bend and precise bends * Sand: sand packed into tube In production of a product where the bend is not critical a plug mandrel can be used. A form type tapers the end of the mandrel to provide more support in the bend of the tube. When precise bending is needed a ball mandrel (or ball mandrel with steel cable) should be used. The conjoined ball-like disks are inserted into the tubing to allow for bending while maintaining the same diameter throughout. Other styles include using sand, cerrobend, or frozen water. These allow for a somewhat constant diameter while providing an inexpensive alternative to the aforementioned styles. Performance automotive or motorcycle exhaust pipe is a common application for a mandrel. =Bending springs= These are strong but flexible springs inserted into a pipe to support the pipe walls during manual bending. They have diameters only slightly less than the internal diameter of the pipe to be bent. They are only suitable for bending soft copper pipe (typically used in household plumbing) or PVC pipe. The spring is pushed into the pipe until its center is roughly where the bend is to be. A length of flexible wire can be attached to the end of the spring to facilitate its removal. The pipe is generally held against the flexed knee, and the ends of the pipe are pulled up to create the bend. To make it easier to retrieve the spring from the pipe, it is a good idea to bend the pipe slightly more than required, and then slacken it off a little. Springs are less cumbersome than rotary benders, but are not suitable for bending short lengths of piping when it is difficult to get the required leverage on the pipe ends. Bending springs for smaller diameter pipes (10 mm copper pipe) slide over the pipe instead of inside.

The act had the effect of attracting top quality people capable of improving education during short- and long-term assignments in the profession. Interdisciplinary Model Programs in the Arts for Children and Teachers Through the Teacher Retraining Authorization of the EPDA, the Interdisciplinary Model Programs in the Arts for Children and Teachers (IMPACT) was established in 1970. Four arts education associations established a plan of operation for IMPACT. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate that school activities in the arts can transform the traditional curriculum into one that: # emphasizes the integration of the arts into the mainstream of human experience # aids students in becoming sensitive to the qualitative aspects of their own experiences as sources for artistic ideas # explores the similarities and differences in the ways that professionals in the arts develop their ideas # challenges students to make effective use of their creative resources IMPACT was implemented in five locations ranging from single schools to a consortium of three school districts. When IMPACT ended in 1972, it was considered to have been successful in terms of its own goals. Teachers who were not arts specialists became more confident of their abilities to use the arts in teaching, and children had the opportunity to learn in an aesthetic environment. Test results indicate that students who participated in IMPACT programs were significantly above grade level in reading and other skills several years after their arts experiences. They also showed that students developed self-esteem through their arts experiences and that their attitudes toward school improved. References Mark, M.L. (1986). Contemporary Music Education.

He appeared in the 1984 FA Cup Final with Watford. Career As a youth, Atkinson represented both the Leeds Schoolboys and Yorkshire Schoolboys teams before joining Oldham Athletic as an apprentice in 1977. He was given his first professional contract two years later and made his senior debut on 18 August 1979, scoring in the 2‚Äì3 defeat away at Newcastle United. He became a first-team regular for Oldham over the following four seasons and scored a total of 11 goals in 143 league matches for the club. In July 1983, Atkinson was signed by Watford manager Graham Taylor for a transfer fee of ¬£175,000. A broken ankle sustained in pre-season delayed his debut in the First Division. When he returned to action later in the season, he failed to hold down a regular place in the team and played only 11 league games. Atkinson's last appearance for Watford came on 19 May 1984, coming on as a second-half substitute for Neil Price in the 0‚Äì2 defeat to Everton in the 1984 FA Cup Final. He spent one more season with the club but did not make a first-team appearance and left in August 1985, returning to Oldham for a fee of ¬£30,000. Atkinson was not a regular starter during his second spell at Oldham, playing 33 league matches over the following three seasons. He was loaned out three times during the 1986‚Äì87 campaign; he joined Fourth Division side Swansea City in December 1986, scoring once in six appearances. He later had a one-month loan spell at Bolton Wanderers before returning to Swansea City in March 1987 for the remainder of the season. Atkinson was released by Oldham in the summer of 1988 and subsequently signed for Burnley. On his second league appearance for the Lancashire side, he scored a goal in the 6‚Äì0 Fourth Division win against York City. He spent two seasons with Burnley, playing 35 games in all competitions, four of them as a substitute, before leaving the club at the end of the 1989‚Äì90 season.

History The Canadian Rustic Pony was developed by Dr. Peter Neufeld of Manitoba, Canada.Tarpan, Oklahoma State University, retrieved February 10, 2009. Breeders developed the breed by crossing Heck horses from the Atlanta Zoo in Atlanta, Georgia with Arabian horse-Welsh pony crosses. On January 23, 1989, the Canadian Rustic Pony Association was formed, incorporated under the new Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act, also known as Bill C-67. Prior to this, since 1978, Canadian rustic ponies had been registered through a registry based in the United States, and as of September 1989, 72 ponies had been US- registered. These ponies were eligible to become double-registered under the Canadian and US registries, and many did so. No ponies were found outside of Manitoba and Saskatchewan as of September 1989, but this was expected to change as more breeders became aware of the new breed. Characteristics These ponies stand between high. They can be gray, buckskin, dun or bay, have primitive markings such as dorsal and zebra stripes, and have partially raised manes. The facial profile is straight or slightly dished, with a prominent jaw. The neck is thick but arched, the girth and shoulders thick, and the croup slightly sloping. The legs are strong, and the ponies are said to move fluidly, especially at the trot. The Canadian Rustic Pony is used mainly for jumping, driving or as family pets.

The team is the first incarnation of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and was followed by the 1994 and 2004 rebooted versions. It first appeared in Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958) and was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino. Publication history=Superboy's supporting cast= Superboy was the featured series in Adventure Comics in the 1950s. In Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958) by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, Superboy was met by three teenagers from the 30th century: Lightning Boy, Saturn Girl, and Cosmic Boy, who were members of a \\"super-hero club\\" called the Legion of Super- Heroes. Their club had been formed with Superboy as an inspiration, and they had time travelled to recruit Superboy as a member. After a series of tests, Superboy was awarded membership and returned to his own time. Cover of Adventure Comics #300 (Sept. 1962), which was the first issue of the Legion run. Art by Curt Swan and George Klein. Although intended as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in Adventure Comics #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in Adventure Comics, Action Comics, and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger over the next few years.Mort Weisinger's run on the Legion of Super-Heroes at the Grand Comics Database The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, Triplicate Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, and Ultra Boy. Even Supergirl was recruited as a member. In Adventure Comics #300 (September 1962), the Legion received their own regular feature, cover-billed \\"Superboy in 'Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes'\\". While they would share space with Superboy solo stories for a couple of years, they eventually displaced Superboy from the title entirely as their popularity grew. Lightning Lad was killed in Adventure Comics #304 (January 1963) and revived in issue #312 (September 1963).McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 108: \\"The demise of the Legion co-founder was a first not only for the Legion fan base, but for mainstream comics in general...Lightning Lad was resurrected later that year in Adventure Comics #312.\\" It was the Adventure Comics run which established the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated out of a clubhouse in the shape of an inverted yellow rocket ship which looked as if it had been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets. The regular police force in the United Planets was the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication. In Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966), Jim Shooter, who was 14 years old at the time, had his first Legion story published.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 118: \\"In his first-ever published story, fourteen-year-old Jim Shooter admitted four new members into the Legion of Super-Heroes ... Shooter's long, memorable tenure as one of the Legion's greatest writers was officially underway.\\" Soon thereafter, Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories, with Curt Swan, and later Win Mortimer, as artist. Shooter wrote the story in which Ferro Lad died ‚Äì the first \\"real\\" death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before) ‚Äì and introduced many other enduring Legion concepts, including the Fatal Five,McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 123: \\"Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan unleashed an even greater menace when the Fatal Five decided to stay united in the years ahead.\\" Karate Kid, Princess Projectra, Shadow Lass, the Dark Circle, Mordru, and the \\"Adult Legion\\", a conjecture regarding what the Legionnaires would be like when they grew up. The Legion's last appearance in Adventure Comics was #380 (May 1969), and they were displaced by Supergirl in the next issue. The early 1970s saw the Legion relegated to the status of back-up feature. First, the team's stories were moved to Action Comics for issues #377‚Äì392 (June 1969 ‚Äì September 1970). Following Mort Weisinger's retirement from DC, the Legion was passed to the oversight of editor Murray Boltinoff and began appearing occasionally as a backup in Superboy, starting with #172 (March 1971),Murray Boltinoff's run on the Legion of Super-Heroes at the Grand Comics Database with writers E. Nelson Bridwell and Cary Bates and artist George Tuska. Dave Cockrum began drawing the series with Superboy #184 (April 1972), again increasing the team's popularity.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 151: \\"After more than a year as Murphy Anderson's background inker, Dave Cockrum landed his big DC break as the Legion of Super-Heroes artist ... Cockrum's debut story, which was written by Cary Bates, quickly established an exciting new vibe for the super-team.\\" =Superboy and their own title= The Legion of Super-Heroes as seen in the 1976 DC Calendar. Art by Neal Adams and Dick Giordano. The first comic book published under the title Legion of Super-Heroes was a four-issue series published in 1973 that reprinted Legion tales from Adventure Comics. In the same year, the Legion returned to cover billing on a book when Superboy became Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes with #197 (August 1973). Crafted by Bates and Cockrum, the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel in Superboy #200 (Feb 1974).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 159: \\"Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel became the first Legionnaires to tie the knot. The wedding planners were writer Cary Bates and artist Dave Cockrum.\\" Issues #202 (June 1974) and #205 (Dec. 1974) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Cockrum was replaced on art by Mike Grell as of issue #203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 160: \\"With the unenviable task of replacing the departing Dave Cockrum, one of the most popular artists ever to draw the Legion of Super-Heroes, Mike Grell's first issue on Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes killed off one of the team's most beloved members.\\" With #231 (September 1977), the book's title officially changed to Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes and also became a \\"giant-size\\" title. At this point, the book was written by longtime fan Paul Levitz and drawn by James Sherman, although Gerry Conway frequently wrote as well. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married in All-New Collectors' Edition #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special written by Levitz and drawn by Grell.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 177: \\"Only an oversized treasury edition could have contained Superboy and the entire Legion of Super-Heroes' battle with the Time Trapper...and the long-awaited wedding of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl...Legion favorites Paul Levitz and Mike Grell were up to the enormous challenge with the popular tale 'The Millennium Massacre'.\\" In #241‚Äì245 (July‚ÄìDecember 1978) Levitz and Sherman (and then Joe Staton) produced what was at that time the most ambitious Legion storyline: \\"Earthwar\\", a galactic war between the United Planets and the Khunds, with several other villains lurking in the background. During this period, Karate Kid was spun off into his own 20th Century-based self-titled series, which lasted 15 issues. Levitz left the book, to be replaced full-time by Gerry Conway. Superboy departed from the Legion due to a plot of a villain, and the book was renamed simply Legion of Super-Heroes starting with issue #259 (January 1980). Editor Jack C. Harris hired Steve Ditko as guest artist on several issues, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title's readership. Jimmy Janes became the regular artist in a lengthy tale by Conway (and later Roy Thomas) involving Ultra Boy's disappearance during a mission, and his long odyssey to rejoin the team. This story told the tale of the Legionnaire Reflecto (only glimpsed during the \\"Adult Legion\\" stories in Adventure Comics), featured villainy by the Time Trapper and Grimbor the Chainsman, and saw Superboy rejoin the team. =Paul Levitz era= Paul Levitz returned to write the series with #284. Pat Broderick and Bruce Patterson illustrated the title for a short time before Keith Giffen began on pencils, with Patterson, and then Larry Mahlstedt, on inks. The creative team received enhanced popularity following \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\",Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 198: \\"When [Levitz] wrote \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\", a five-issue epic that pitted the Legion against one of the most notorious villains of DC's long history, he and artist Keith Giffen crafted the most famous Legion story of all time and became fast fan favorites.\\" which ran from #287; #290‚Äì294; and Annual #3, featuring a full assault on the United Planets by Darkseid. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that \\"Working with artist Keith Giffen, Levitz completed the transformation of Legion into a science-fiction saga of considerable scope and depth.\\" The Legion celebrated issue #300 (June 1983) by revisiting the \\"Adult Legion\\" storyline through a series of parallel world short stories illustrated by a number of popular Legion artists from previous years. The story served to free up Legion continuity from following the \\"Adult Legion\\" edict of previous issues. Giffen's style changed abruptly a few issues later, to a darker and sketchier style inspired by Argentinian artist Jos√© Mu√±oz. A new Legion of Super-Heroes comic (the third publication under the title) was launched in August 1984. The existing Legion series, renamed Tales of the Legion of Super- Heroes with issue #314, continued running new material for a year, then began reprinting stories from the new Legion of Super-Heroes with issue #326. Tales continued publishing reprints until its final issue, #354 (December 1987). The new series was launched in August 1984Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 208: \\"As DC began to toy with the idea of relaunching some of their more popular titles using high-quality Baxter paper, the Legion of Super-Heroes was an obvious choice. Utilizing the talents of writer Paul Levitz and artist Keith Giffen...the Legion was off and running in their own new title with a major new storyline...the Legion's other monthly comic changed its moniker to Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes with issue #314.\\" with a five-part story featuring the Legion of Super-Villains. Giffen left in the middle of the story and was replaced by Steve Lightle, who stayed on the book for a year. The debut story arc saw the death of Karate Kid in issue #4 (November 1984).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 209: \\"In a story written by Paul Levitz, with art by Keith Giffen and Steve Lightle...the Karate Kid gave his life heroically while battling Nemesis Kid.\\" Levitz and Lightle co-created two Legionnaires, Tellus and Quislet, whose unusual appearances contrasted with the humanoid appearances of the other Legionnaires. Greg LaRocque began a lengthy run in #16 (November 1985), including a crossover with John Byrne's recently rebooted Superman titles in #37 and #38. The crossover was the first of several attempts by DC editors to explain the origins and fate of Superboy and his history with the Legion, in light of the revisions to the DC Universe caused by Crisis on Infinite Earths that removed Superman's career as Superboy from his personal history. In the crossover, the Legion's Superboy was revealed to have come from a parallel \\"Pocket Universe\\" created by the Time Trapper. The crossover ended with Superboy's death. Levitz's run ended with the return of Giffen and a four-part story \\"The Magic Wars\\", concluding in #63 (August 1989). =\\"Five Years Later\\"= The Legion \\"five years later\\" by Keith Giffen and Al Gordon. Giffen took over plotting as well as penciling with the Legion of Super-Heroes volume 4 title which started in November 1989, with scripts by Tom and Mary Bierbaum and assists by Al Gordon.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 241: \\"Plotted by Keith Giffen and inker Al Gordon, scripted by Tom and Mary Bierbaum, and pencilled by Giffen, this relaunch of the formerly teen team of heroes and heroines broke new ground in the fictional realm of the 30th Century. Five years after the Magic Wars, the United Planets is a darker place and the Legion a distant memory. However, a group of former Legionnaires worked to re-form the Legion in this harsh new universe, in which Earth was ruled by the alien Dominators. Shortly after this storyline began, the decision was made to retroactively remove Superboy completely from Legion history. Writer Mark Waid stated that \\"Because of inter-office politics and machinations...it was decided that there was no Superboy, but we weren't even allowed to reference him at all.\\" This left the question of where the Legion's inspiration came from without the influence of Superboy. The writers' solution was a massive retcon, in which Mon-El served in the role of paragon instead of Superboy, with several more retcons to follow. Issue #5 featured an alternate universe story in which the restructuring took place, and the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his onetime underling Glorith. One major storyline during this period was the discovery of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion, c. their Adventure Comics days, created by the Dominators. Keith Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed to be the real Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims‚Äô names being picked at random out of a hat. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th- century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men. Instead, a parallel title, Legionnaires, was launched, starring the \\"SW6\\" Legion, whose origins were not resolved until the Zero Hour crossover by a different writing team. Legionnaires was lighter in tone than the main Legion book, and was written by the Bierbaums and drawn by Chris Sprouse. Giffen left the book after a storyline which involved the destruction of Earth,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 255: \\"Writer/artist Keith Giffen was leaving the Legion title, and he was determined to go out with a bang.\\" and the Bierbaums continued writing, overseeing the return of several classic characters. When the Bierbaums left, writer Tom McCraw took over and made a number of changes, such as forcing several Legion members underground, which required them to take on new identities and costumes, and bringing back long-absent Legionnaire Wildfire. As part of the Zero Hour company-wide crossover, the Legion's original continuity came to an end with Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #61 (September 1994). =Post-Infinite Crisis (2007‚Äì2015)= Statues depicting the Legion in the \\"Lightning Saga\\" crossover. From Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #5 (2007). Art by Fernando Pasarin. The \\"Lightning Saga\\" crossover in Justice League of America (vol. 2) #8‚Äì10 and Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #5‚Äì6 featured the return of the original versions of Star Boy (now called Starman), Dream Girl, Wildfire, Karate Kid, Timber Wolf, Sensor Girl, Dawnstar, and Brainiac 5. Though several differences between the original and Lightning Saga Legions exist, Geoff Johns stated that this incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the original Legion up to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, with Clark Kent having joined the team as the teenage Superboy prior to the start of his career as Superman. This version of the Legion next appeared in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" storyline in Action Comics #858‚Äì863. In the year 3008, the Earth's sun has turned red and several failed Legion applicants who were born on Earth have banded together to form the Justice League of Earth under the leadership of Earth-Man after he claims that Superman was a human who gained his powers from \\"Mother Earth\\". Earth-Man uses the claim to have Earth secede from the United Planets and ban all aliens from Earth, resulting in several Legionnaires going underground. With the help of Superman, the Legion eventually restores the Sun to its normal state and defeats Earth-Man and the Justice League of Earth just as the United Planets is about to attack the Earth. This version of the Legion next appeared in the 2008 Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds limited series, written by Geoff Johns and drawn by George P√©rez. The mini-series features the post-Infinite Crisis Legion and Superman teaming up with the \\"Reboot\\" and \\"Threeboot\\" incarnations of the Legion to fight Superboy-Prime, the Legion of Super-Villains, and the Time Trapper. It was revealed in the mini-series that the \\"Reboot\\" Legion came from Earth-247 (a metafictional homage to the Legion's first appearance in Adventure Comics #247), which was destroyed in Infinite Crisis, and the \\"Threeboot\\" Legion came from the reconstructed Earth- Prime. Geoff Johns stated that the intent of the mini-series was to validate the existence of all three versions of the team while simultaneously restoring the pre-Crisis Legion's continuity as well. The incorporation of the three teams into mainstream DC continuity was shown in Action Comics #864 (June 2008). In the story, Batman recounts the JLA and JSA's battle alongside the original Legion to defeat Mordru, the \\"Reboot\\" team's assistance in destroying a Sun-Eater in the 20th century, and his own recent encounter with the \\"Threeboot\\" team. This version of the Legion was featured in the second Adventure Comics series from September 2009 to October 2011, with the feature focusing on the Legion Academy from April 2011 onwards. This Legion played a part in the \\"Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton\\" storyline in 2010, where the ongoing continual events of \\"The Lightning Saga\\" concluded in its entirety. A new Legion of Super-Heroes ongoing series was published from May 2010 to August 2011, written by Paul Levitz and drawn by Yildiray Cinar, featuring the post-Infinite Crisis version of the team. The New 52 (2011‚Äì2015) Legion of Super-Heroes was relaunched in September 2011 with issue #1. Simultaneously, DC Comics cancelled Adventure Comics and replaced it with a new volume of Legion Lost. While Legion of Super-Heroes continued the adventures of the team from that title's previous volume, Legion Lost featured Wildfire, Dawnstar, Timber Wolf, Tyroc, Tellus, Gates and Chameleon Girl stranded on 21st century Earth on a mission to save the future and are forced to remain there after contracting a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they returned. The Legion Lost series ended with the time-lost Legionnaires still stranded in the 21st century. This era of the Legion's publication concluded with issue #23 in August 2013 with the title's cancellation. In the final issue, the United Planets disbands the Legion after a cataclysmic battle with the Fatal Five, and the individual Legionnaires retire to their homeworlds or the Science Police. It is hinted that this iteration of the Legion exists on the New 52 version of Earth 2, with character dialogue suggesting the perseverance of the Legion in other times and realities. Writers Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen clarify that the Legion's placement on Earth-2 is just one possibility, with Giffen stating, \\"I think the ending is open to interpretation. The way I saw it was, it could be Earth 2. It might be Earth 1. It could be an Earth we've never seen before. It could be another universe.\\" The entire Legion was re-mobilized to battle Infinitus in the six issue \\"Infinitus Saga\\" in Justice League United written by Jeff Lemire (December 2014 ‚Äì May 2015) which featured Brainiac 5 as leader, the return of the Legion Lost team to active Legion status and the inclusion of a number of Legionnaires from other continuities in the Legion's active ranks.

The team is the second incarnation of the Legion of Super-Heroes, following after the 1958 version, and was followed by the 2004 rebooted version. It first appeared in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #0 (October 1994) and was created by Mark Waid, Tom McCraw and Stuart Immonen. Publication history Following Zero Hour, a new Legion continuity was created, beginning with a retelling of the origin story starting in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #0 and then continued in spin-off sister series Legionnaires #0 (both released in October 1994). Lightning Lad was renamed Live Wire, and after the group's founding, a large number of heroes were added to the roster very quickly. Several members from the previous continuity were given new codenames, and some new heroes were added, including XS (the granddaughter of Barry Allen, the second Flash), Kinetix, and Gates. While in some ways following the pattern of the original continuity, the new continuity diverged from the old one in several ways: some characters died as they had previously, others did not, and some Legion members spent time in the 20th century where they recruited Ferro. The Legion also started out having to earn the respect of the United Planets, which they did through two well-earned victories: successfully defending Earth from the White Triangle Daxamites, a group of Nazi-style racial purists; and exposing United Planets President Chu as the mastermind behind the Braal-Titan War, the Sun Eater hoax, the formation of the Fatal Five and the brainwashing of future Legionnaire Jan Arrah. New writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning came on board with penciller Olivier Coipel to produce a dark story leading to the near-collapse of the United Planets and the Legion. In the wake of the disaster, a group of Legionnaires disappeared through a spatial rift and the two existing Legion series came to an end. The limited series Legion Lost (2000‚Äì2001) chronicled the difficult journey of these Legionnaires to return home, while the ensuing limited series Legion Worlds (2001) showed what was happening back in the United Planets during their absence. A new series, The Legion, was launched in which the Legion was reunited and given a new base and purpose. Written for its first 33 issues by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, the series was cancelled with issue 38. The most notable addition to the team during the title's publication was the post-\\"Crisis\\" Superboy, a 21st-century clone of Superman and Lex Luthor who had previously been granted honorary membership. =Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds= The Post-Zero Hour Legion reappeared in the 2008-2009 Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds limited series, written by Geoff Johns and drawn by George P√©rez. The mini-series features the 1994 Legion teaming up with Superman and the post-Infinite Crisis and 2004 incarnations of the Legion to fight a new incarnation of the Legion of Super-Villains (led by Superboy-Prime) and the Time Trapper. It is revealed at the end of the miniseries that Earth-247 and its entire universe were destroyed during the events of Infinite Crisis. The post-Zero Hour Legion, under the guidance of Shikari Lonestar, takes the name \\"the Wanderers\\" and decides to travel the Multiverse to look for survivors from the various alternate universes that were destroyed.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (July 2009) MembersWorkforce The Workforce is a fictional semi-heroic-super-team, in DC Comics' Post-Zero Hour Legion of Super-Heroes continuity. The group was introduced in Legion of Super-Heroes #64 (January 1995). =Fictional history= The Workforce was founded by the corrupt industrialist Leland McCauley as a response to the Legion of Super-Heroes, founded by his rival R.J. Brande. When Live Wire was replaced in the Legion by his sister Spark, he joined the Workforce with the belief that McCauley could help him find his brother Mekt. While the team often appeared to be performing heroic deeds, everything they did was designed for McCauley's profit. Karate Kid commented that the only reasons for being in the Workforce were selfish ones. The team had little teamwork skills, often getting in each other's way in battle. McCauley would often shout orders at them through holographic projection, thereby telegraphing their moves to their opponents. Live Wire eventually quit and rejoined the Legion, inspiring other members to do the same, which forced McCauley to hire new members frequently. A later version of the group consisted entirely of adults, to make the point that the Legion was endangering teenagers. However, a member of this group was actually the eight- year-old Lori Morning, using her H-Dial to appear adult. The group disbanded during the \\"One Year Gap\\" and was replaced by the \\"Oversight Watch.\\" =Membership=Original members *Spider Girl (fired to create \\"Adult Workforce\\") *Evolvo (fired to create \\"Adult Workforce\\") *Ultra Boy (quit, joined Legion) *Karate Kid (quit, joined Legion) *Inferno (transported to 20th century Earth) Later members *Blast-Off (\\"killed\\", see Wildfire) *Particon (contract bought out by R.J.

Ardilla was instrumental in the return of teen pop rock in the country's music scene, and a dominant presence during the first half of the 1990s. Ardilla died in a car accident at the age of 19 in 1995 during the height of her career and fame. She is generally regarded as one of the most successful figures in Indonesia's entertainment industry, and media regularly refers to the fact that she is the only musician in the country whose death continues to be mourned even after more than 20 years. She has sold 30 million albums to date, and her 1995 album Sandiwara Cinta remains the best-selling Indonesian album of all time. Early life Ardilla was born Raden Rara Nike Ratnadilla on 27 December 1975 in Bandung, to parents of Ciamis and Bandung descent. Her father worked for the Indonesian Railway Company (PT Kereta Api Indonesia), which caused the family to move periodically throughout her childhood. They eventually settled in Bandung where she began performing in talent shows at the age of five, winning a local singing competition in 1980. Career Denny Sabri, a talent scout, helped Ardilla sign a record deal with Arista Records. In 1987, she contributed to a compilation album titled Bandung Rock Power, which featured Nicky Astria, Mel Shandy among others. She released her debut album Seberkas Sinar in 1989 when she was only 14. It reached number one on the charts, and has sold over 500,000 copies in Indonesia. The title track stayed at the top of the charts for ten weeks, and the album had further hits with the top-ten ballad \\"Cinta Pertama\\", and the top-five song \\"Tembang Asmara.\\" In the spring of 1990, Ardilla released her second album, Bintang Kehidupan, with a chart- topping title track. The album itself also topped the charts on its debut, selling over 500,000 copies in its first week and setting a new record for single-week sales by a female artist. By 1991, Bintang Kehidupan had sold over two million copies and won two BASF Awards, for Best New Artist and Best Selling Album. She performed the title track at the 1991 Asia Song Festival in Shanghai where she won the \\"Gold Prize of New Singer.\\" Her next album Nyalakan Api was released in the autumn of 1990, which earned her a third BASF Award, again for Best Selling Album. Her fourth album Matahariku was released in summer of 1991 and was followed in the autumn of 1992 by Biarlah Aku Mengalah, which was featured on Musik Plus. After winning Best Selling Album consecutively at the 1993 BASF Awards, Ardilla released a greatest hits album, Tinggallah Ku Sendiri (The Best Of). It spawned the hit single \\"Tinggallah Ku Sendiri\\". She moved from Billboard Records (now EMI) to Musica Studios for her record Biarkan Cintamu Berlalu, which debuted at number one and earned her the 1994 HDX Best Selling Album award. Her final album, Sandiwara Cinta, was released on 1 March 1995. The single first began airing on the radio in late February. The first version of the Sandiwara Cinta video debuted on TV in late February 1995. A second version of the video was released posthumously in April 1995, featuring Ardilla in the style of her idol Marilyn Monroe. Sandiwara Cinta won HDX Awards for Best Selling Album, Best Single (Deru Debu), and Best Video Klip MTV Indonesia. In addition to singing, Ardilla was also active as an actress and model. In 1986, she joined the cast of the film Kasmaran, starring Ida Iasha and Slamet Rahardjo in which she played the daughter of Iasha's character. In 1988, she recorded a single for the soundtrack of the film Kabayan Saba Kota, in which she made a cameo appearance. Since 1989, she had starred in seven films and eleven soap operas. In 1990, Ardilla won a modelling competition Gadis Sampul and a \\"Best Model Catwalk\\" award in the \\"LA Model Contest\\" in Bandung two years prior. Death and legacy Ardilla's grave in Ciamis On the night of 18 March 1995, Ardilla met with friends from Aneka-Yess!, a popular teenage magazine, at Jayakarta Hotel Bandung, to discuss the election of the magazine's cover girl and cover boy. The vote was to be held the following day, with her appearing as a guest star at the event. She spent the early hours of the next day with friends and later left a hotel at 05:15 AM to go home with her female companion and bodyguard, Atun Sofiatun. While attempting to overtake another car, she lost control of her Honda Civic Genio and slammed it into a wall in a suburban Bandung street, killing her instantly. Sofiatun, severely injured, was taken to a hospital where she recovered, though with little recollection of the crash. Under Islamic funeral customs, she was buried on the same day in Ciamis, West Java, in the presence of family, friends, fans, reporters as well as thousands of mourners. Two months after her death, a commemorative concert was held in Bandung with performances from some of Indonesia's best-known artists, proceeds from which went into the establishment of a charity, the Nike Ardilla Foundation. Every year, thousands of fans commemorate her passing by visiting her grave and the Nike Ardilla Museum, which was constructed in her memory. Fan clubs dedicated to her are still running with active members. Hong Kong magazine Asiaweek noted that \\"in death, her popularity soared.\\" The Indonesian media usually refers to her as the \\"Lady Rocker.\\" In 1996, Pos Indonesia published commemorative postcards and envelopes, which were sold out within days. In the same year, daily Bandung newspaper Pikiran Rakyat reported the Nike Ardilla stamps issued in Abkhazia and Tuva, Russia. Her posthumous releases, such as albums Mama Aku Ingin Pulang (1995) and Suara Hatiku (1996) were met with success.

Varga was active in the Union of Working Youth, student organisation of the Hungarian Working People's Party, within which he was regarded as an intellectual. He was part of a group which in 1954 founded the Petofi discussion group, in opposition to M√°ty√°s R√°kosi. When it was revived in 1956, he became Deputy Secretary of its Provisional Bureau.

In 1972, the OCI decided to leave the ICFI and instead set up the Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. Varga initially sided with the OCI, but soon after came into conflict with them and was expelled. The following year, he founded the International League for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. The OCI claimed that he had been both a CIA and a KGB agent, but an international committee consisting of representatives from Lutte Ouvri√®re, the Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire, the Socialist Workers Party (US) and the International Spartacist Tendency found no proof of this. In 1984, Varga was expelled by an opposition group within his own international, and instead formed the Group of Opposition and Continuity of the Fourth International. In 1990, this dissolved itself into the Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International, of which Varga became Secretary.

Al-Raymi was one of 23 men who escaped in the 3 February 2006 prison-break in Yemen, along with other notable al-Qaeda members. Al-Raymi was connected to a July 2007 suicide bombing that killed eight Spanish tourists. In 2009, the Yemeni government accused him of being responsible for the running of an al-Qaeda training camp in Abyan province. After serving as AQAP's military commander, al-Raymi was promoted to leader after the death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi on 12 June 2015.Al Qaeda's second in command killed in Yemen strike; successor named, Jethro Mullen, CNN, 16 June 2015 Early life, Afghanistan and al-Qaeda in Yemen Al-Raymi was born on June 5, 1978 in the Raymah Governorate, near the Yemen capital of Sana'a. He was a trainer at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan during the 1990s before returning to Yemen. In 2004, he was imprisoned for five years for being suspected in a series of embassy bombings in the capital. After escaping from prison in 2006, al-Raymi, along with Nasir al-Wuhayshi, oversaw the formation of al-Qaeda in Yemen, which took in both new recruits and experienced Arab fighters returning from battlefields across Iraq and Afghanistan. The group claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks that killed six Western tourists before being linked to the assault on the US embassy in Sana'a in September 2008, in which militants detonated bombs and fired rocket-propelled grenades. Ten Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed, along with six assailants. Founding of AQAP In January 2009, al-Raymi, along with three other men, appeared in a video calling for the foundation of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a unification of both al-Qaeda's Yemen and Saudi Arabian branches. He was introduced as AQAP's military commander. The other men were identified as Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi, Abu Sufyan al-Azdi al-Shahri and Nasir al-Wuhayshi. Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi was an AQAP field commander, Abu Sufyan al-Azdi al-Shahri was the Deputy of AQAP and Nasir al-Wuhayshi the former Emir of AQAP. Military commander of AQAP=Saudi and American wanted list= On February 3, 2009, Saudi security officials published a new list of Saudi most wanted terrorist suspects. The 68th individual found on the list was named \\"Muhammad Qasim Mehdi Reemy\\" or \\"Qassem Mohammed Mahdi Al- Rimi\\", with the aliases \\"Abu Hurayrah\\" and \\"Abu Ammar\\". Qassem Al-Rimi on the Saudi wanted list was one of two Yemenis on the list, and was said to be a \\"linked to Al Qaeda in Yemen, Saudi Arabia\\". A few days later an anonymous Saudi official supplied documents to the Associated Press, which alleged that al-Raymi had \\"links to a plot targeting the U.S. ambassador in San'a.\\" The documents also reported that he rented the house where the operation was planned and that he \\"monitored the US embassy\\". On May 11, 2010, the U.S State Department listed al-Raymi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. On October 14, 2014, it announced a reward of $5 million for any information leading to his capture or death. =Previous reports of death= Al-Raymi's death has been reported multiple times. He was reported to have died during a raid by Yemeni security officials on 9 August 2007. Ali bin Ali Douha and two other militants were reported to have been killed during the raid. Abu al- Raymi was the target of a raid on al-Qaeda camps in Yemen on December 17, 2009, which reportedly was carried out by U.S. cruise missiles. He was not reported killed. It was reported that he was killed in a January 4, 2010 raid by Yemeni security forces, though this was proven false. However, according to officials, a Yemeni air strike on two cars, one of which reportedly contained al-Raymi, was conducted on Friday, January 15, 2010. Al-Raymi was reported to be one of those killed. Of the eight men thought to be in the two cars, six are thought to have been killed in the strike. Following reports of his death, al-Raymi was described as the military commander for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). He was reported to have \\"orchestrated\\" 25 December 2009 attempted suicide bombing of Nigerian Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab. Al-Raymi announced the creation of an \\"Aden-Abyan Army\\" to free the country of \\"crusaders and their apostate agents,\\" in an Internet audio tape. =Apology for hospital attack= Following the 2013 attack on the Yemeni Defense Ministry, which resulted in the killing of numerous doctors and patients at a hospital present in the compound, al-Raymi released a video message apologizing, claiming that the team of attackers were directed not to assault the hospital in the attack, but that one had gone ahead and done so. =Yakla raid= On January 29, 2017, al-Raymi was the supposed target of a military action undertaken by the United States known as the Yakla raid. The raid resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL and of a number of civilians including a U.S. citizen. Shortly after the raid, on February 5, 2017, al-Raymi released an audiotape onto the internet referencing the raid. The fact that al-Raymi had been a main target of the raid had not been previously confirmed. In the audiotape, al-Raymi confirmed he was still alive and taunted U.S President Donald Trump. Emir of AQAP On June 16, 2015, following the death of former AQAP Emir and founder Nasir al-Wuhayshi, AQAP commander Khaled Batarfi confirmed al-Raymi had been elected by the group's leadership council to succeed Wuhayshi. On July 8, 2015, al-Raymi swore allegiance to al-Qaeda emir Ayman al Zawahiri. He congratulated the recent successes of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front, and the gains made by Army of Conquest coalition in Syria. He called for renewed attacks against the United States, remarking \\"\\"All of you must direct and gather your arrows and swords against [America].\\". Reports say that in 28 June 2016, an airstrike targeted the home of Qasim in Abyan Governorate, killing five people, including two family members of the targeted leader. Qasim survived the attack, with only some wounds. On October 18, 2016, the US State Department announced that it is offering rewards of $5 and $10 million for information concerning al-Raymi and another AQAP leader. The US State Department offered $10 million for information on al-Raymi and $5 million for Khalid al-Batarfi. For more than five years al-Raymi had eluded U.S. forces as he led what experts sometimes refer to as al-Qaida's ‚Äúmost dangerous franchise.‚Äù He was the target of the Jan. 29, 2017, special operations raid in which Navy SEAL William Owens was killed. Death On January 31, 2020, The New York Times reported that three U.S. officials \\"expressed confidence\\" that al-Raymi, the emir of AQAP was killed by a U.S. airstrike on 29 January, while traveling in a car with another senior AQAP leader, Abu Al-Baraa Al-Ibby, in the Yakla area of Wald Rabi' District, Al Bayda Governorate, Yemen, according to local sources, although there was no official confirmation. On February 1, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm reports that the U.S. had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the leader of an al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen by retweeting reports claiming that the CIA had conducted a drone strike targeting the AQAP leader. Some experts considered him to be a possible successor to Ayman al- Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda overall. On February 6, 2020, the White House released a statement confirming al-Rimi's death. On February 23, 2020, AQAP confirmed al-Rimi's death and announced Khalid Batarfi as his successor. Family One of al-Raymi's brothers is Ali Yahya Mahdi Al Raimi, a Yemeni held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Ali Yahya Mahdi Al Raimi was transferred from Guantanamo to Saudi Arabia in 2016.

(January 2, 1745 ‚Äì May 14, 1826) was an American-born Loyalist who served in the British Army during the American War of Independence. He is best known for his part in the Asgill Affair in which he hanged an enemy officer, Joshua Huddy, in revenge for similar murders of Loyalists, provoking an international incident. Personal life Lippincott was born in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. He was descended from an old colonial family, and served during the revolution as a captain in the New Jersey volunteers. He was married on March 4, 1770, to Esther Borden, daughter of Jeremiah and Esther Borden, of Bordentown, New Jersey. Incident On the outbreak of the revolution, he warmly espoused the side of the Crown and was captured early in the war and confined in the jail at Burlington, New Jersey, from which he escaped in 1776, making his way to the British Army at Staten Island. He fought with the New Jersey Volunteers, which David Gagan described as an irregular group that fought guerilla warfare behind American lines. In 1782, Lippincott's brother-in-law, Philip White, was seized from his home by Americans, who made him run a gauntlet. When his body was found, he appeared to have been subjected to further torture and his body mutilated. His legs had been broken, one of his eyes had been gouged out, and one of his arms was missing. Lippincott was assigned to exchange three captured Americans for some British prisoners, but he hanged one of them, Captain Joshua Huddy, and pinned a note to his body that stated that the hanging was in retaliation for White's death. Huddy was a partisan officer of some repute in New Jersey. His connection with the execution of Captain Joshua Huddy, of the rebel service, attracted a great deal of attention both in Europe and America. American Commander-in-Chief George Washington demanded British Commander Sir Henry Clinton to court martial Lippincott. Lippincott's defence successfully argued that as an irregular, he was technically a civilian, subject to civilian, not military law. Chief Justice William Smith ruled that he did not have jurisdiction to try Lippincott since the incident occurred in an area outside effective British control. Lippincott was not convicted, but according to Gagan, \\"Clinton was forced to hold Lippincott in custody for the duration of the war to prevent Washington from exacting his revenge on an officer in Lord Cornwallis' captive army.\\" Even though Lippincott was tried by a court-martial for the offense, the Loyalists interposed and refused to return him. After conferring with his officers, Washington determined a course of retaliation was called for and accordingly Captain Charles Asgill, who had been taken prisoner at the surrender at Yorktown was selected by lot, to atone for the death of Huddy.Humphreys, 1859, p. vi At the Evacuation of New York at the end of the war, Captain Lippincott removed first to Nova Scotia and later to Upper Canada. Lippincott received a grant of in Vaughn Township. In 1806 he went to live with his newly married daughter, Esther, and his son-in-law George Taylor Denison, in York (now Toronto). Lippincott Street, in Toronto's Harbord Village, is named after him.

An ushnu or usnu is a pyramid-shaped, terraced structure that was used by the Inca to preside at the most important ceremonies of the Tawantinsuyu, or Inca Empire.  Name  Little is known of the Quechua root of the term ushnu, but it seemed to mean \\"the place of stones where the water filters\\". Presenting the places with characteristics of ushnu, major feasibility for the receipt of liquid offerings. They were probably used by the pre-Hispanic populations, when they had to conduct rituals in which they offered liquids, principally alcoholic maize drink, in sacrifice. Thus, a ceremonial concept formed of ushnu, that probably was referring to \\"the place where one offers liquids, or place of drinks \\". Structure  The structure is a rectangular pyramid formed by five platforms, successively built to the highest part for a perron. Everything was constructed in stone. At the top was a double armchair worked in stone, which according to the local tradition was covered with golden sheets. This was the place where the Inca and the Coya (his wife) sat to give justice and to preside at the ceremonies and rituals that were developing in the square. In the peripheral Ushnu mas, his structure was enough a precarious mas, but it was arranged under archeoastron√≥mics rules. It is necessary to highlight the references of certain ethnohist√≥rics documents that indicate that they were constructed in squares and inside the road network Inka, mentioning also the offerings alcoholic maize drinks in ceremonies, as the Capac Hucha2.Guaman Poma de Ayala, F. 1980 [1615] El Primer Nueva Cor√≥nica y Buen Gobierno, editado por J.

Universidad de Lima/Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica, Lima.  Planning, radial organization and astronomic alignments  In Cusco, the ushnu went adem√†s a place destined to realize astronomic observations. This way Zuidema's investigations demonstrate it,Zuidema, T. 1974/76 La imagen del Sol y la Huaca de Susurpuquio en el sistema astron√≥mico de los Incas en el Cuzco. Journal de la Soci√©t√© des Am√©ricanistes 63: 199-230. The one who in addition mentions that \\" The ushnu was the architectural center of the square of the Cuzco and together with the Temple of the Sol it influenced the outline of the long shot of the city \\". By what the overlapping function is perceived in the ushnu, with relation to the astronomy and to the design of the Imperial Capital. The organization of the space that existed in the Cuzco was based on the system of ceques,Wachtel, N. 1973 Sociedad e Ideolog√≠a, Ensayos de Historia y Antropolog√≠a Andinas. IEP, Lima.Zuidema, T. 1974/76 La imagen del Sol y la Huaca de Susurpuquio en el sistema astron√≥mico de los Incas en el Cuzco. Journal de la Soci√©t√© des Am√©ricanistes 63: 199-230. Whose center was the Qurikancha. Some huacas of the ceques served as reference to astronomic observations done from the ushnu (Zuidema 1974/76, 1981). Being several huacas and ceques associated with astronomic specific phenomena (Zuidema 1974/76). Therefore, it departs from the organization of this system it would be of radial and astronomic order. The model is divided by four cardinal basic directions in four quadrants (NE, SE, NW, SW), each one by four astronomic directions, having in whole 20 directions used for the planning in the tampus of the Chinchaysuyu.  World view and urbanism  These ushnus were constructed in order to be understood according to the image that the Inkas wanted to project.The world was turning out to be composed by three planes, Hanan Pacha (the world of above), Kay Pacha (the world of here) and Uku Pacha or the world of the dead men and also of that one who was under the terrestrial surface. In Quechua language, pasha means simultaneously time and space. In an efficient way, on having been tied in a sense to his astral deities, and to be the point of connection between the worlds of below (Uku Pacha) and of the surface who were living (Kay Pacha), they fulfill the function to reveal the knowledge of the Pasha as time and space; representing in joint form, at the moment of realizing the ceremonies, a species of \\" Theatricality of the Power \\", where the Inka or the representative of the Inka occupies the central position on the point that connects all the sacred directions, not only of three-dimensional form but concibiendo simultaneously, inside this abstraction, the temporary dimension. Being the artifice of the ushnu and the organization of elaborated spaces of form combines, they create a scene, in order to produce a collective uniform conscience. On having used ideas that existed in the conquered territories, and to use them to legitimize his position of Empire, they were assuring also the ideological domination. Being these tampus creations of New Cuzcos that: \\" they Can be compared in many senses with an enormous scene to being used by the condition for the integration of an interior fragmented area \\", since Morris proposes it.Morris, C. 1987 Arquitectura y Estructura del Espacio en Huanuco Pampa. Cuadernos 12:27-45. There is perceived also a zeal to connect symbolically the sacred sites of the territories in conquest by means of the Qapaq Ucha, to the sacred sites that they are creating, that are not only Huacas for yes same as the conquered ones, but the ushnus are connected to the whole cosmos. The Capac Hucha was possibly the biggest of the ceremonies realized in the Empire Inca. It has been described for Duviols (1976) and Zuidema (1989).  Evolution  The rituals became progressively more complex and the ushnu in the epoch Inka not only would be the place destined for liquid offerings, but also it would link itself with children's sacrifices, animals, as well as with the burning of fabrics and other offerings.

It was serialized by Shogakukan in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday between April 1981 and October 1985. Musashi no Ken received the 1984 Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen manga. The manga was adapted as a 72-episode anime television series by Eiken. The manga was also adapted into an NES Platform game called . The game was developed and published by Taito Corporation. It was released in Japan on August 8, 1986. Plot The manga tells the story of Musashi Natsuki, an aspired kendo swordsman. He was born to Eiichiro and Kayo Natsuki, in Iwate Prefecture of the Northeast region. Both his parents were acclaimed kendo swordsmen, especially his father Eiichiro who was nationally famous. After Eiichiro's death accidentally caused by his rival Kunihiko T≈çd≈ç's tsuki, Musashi vowed to defeat Kunihiko one day. Unfortunately, Kunihiko retired from kendo out of guilt, and Musashi then aimed to beat his son Shura T≈çd≈ç instead. There was no hard feeling between them, however, and they remained good friends. Musashi trained hard as a child under the guidance of his mother Kayo, who had retired from professional kendo and now only did her day job as a full-time grade school teacher at Musashi's school, but he also got more practice from the local dojo with Ranko Todoroki, who later became one of his closest friends. From volume 13, after Musashi finally defeated Shura at the national championship, the story jumped forward to when Musashi was 15 and the \\"Youth Series\\" (ÈùíÊò•Á∑® Seishunhen, a new \\"arc\\" for the time when Musashi was no longer a headstrong kid) started. Musashi went to Kaiyo High and met new friends and stronger fellow kendo swordsmen. But during the time there, he realized his shortcomings, and wanted to be stronger and learn more from various schools of kendo in Japan. Thanks to Kayo's words of encouragement, he made up his mind, halted his high school education, traveled from dojo to dojo and challenged their best swordsmen, just like his legendary namesake Miyamoto Musashi did (he even learned Miyamoto Musashi's double- katana technique from a reclusive old man and tailored it to suit his kendo), until he was ready to face off very strong opponents at the final national championship. The story takes place in the Northeast region, therefore the characters spoke their local dialect and accent, and furigana is frequently used to gloss obscure dialectal words. Characters ; :The protagonist. Born on Jun 3 at 4 (the \\"sixth\\" (mu) month, the \\"third\\" (sa) day, \\"four\\" (shi) AM), he started out as a headstrong and kid who was taught kendo by his beloved father at a very young age. For the most part of his childhood, he never backed down from a duel and refused to give up even when he got beaten up. After his father's death, he was determined to perfect his tsuki in order to beat Shura and become the strongest swordsman in Japan. During the Youth Arc, he traveled to schools of kendo to better his skills and experience various styles of kendo. ; :Musashi's mother. She was known as one of the strongest and most acclaimed swordswomen in the Northeast region. Unlike Musashi's easy- going father, she was strict on his upbringing, especially after his father died. She helped with his practice at times, and coaching his team for the adolescent championship. She taught at Musashi's school as a day job and retired from kendo for a while. She encouraged Musashi to travel in the Youth Arc. With Musashi's encouragement, she practiced kendo again for one last championship, during which Musashi finally approved of her remarrying her coworker and his former teacher, Mikio Yaegashi, which he had hoped her not to do as a kid because of his love for his late father. ; :Musashi's father. He is a full-time salaryman, but also one of the strongest swordsman nationally. He was easy-going and a bit of an alcoholic, but he sincerely loved his wife and son. He was capable of fending off muggers with just a toothpick as his \\"sword\\", and very quickly slicing holes through a waterfall. Despite his various accolades, he was determined to beat his eternal rival Kunihiko T≈çd≈ç, whose tsuki proved deadly and cost him his life. But even in death, he never stopped inspiring his son Musashi to be the strongest swordsman. ; :Musashi's dog. He was an abandoned puppy who seemed to be as headstrong as Musashi, and was adopted by Eiichir≈ç to keep Musashi's company. He somehow got into a fight with feral dogs, but thankfully got saved by Musashi, although the fight resulted in Musashi critically injured and Toichi blind in his right eye forever. Toichi could understand human speak, and always ran along with Musashi for exercise during his childhood. He also had puppies with another dog without his family's knowledge, although one of them froze to death due to Ranko's neglectful adoption. ; :Musashi's first rival. He was very well- mannered being raised by a strict father. When Musashi tried to challenge his father and failed, he told him that only he could defeat his own father, and also promised to duel Musashi at the championship. He was, unfortunately, beaten twice by Musashi (both times during the final duel of a national championship, the second one is at the end of the series) even though he had really great potential as an almost unbeatable swordsman, and felt guilty that he failed his late mother for whom he fought. Shura is apparently named after Asura (exact same Japanese pronunciation and spelling) for some reason; this fact was highlighted only once, when Mr. Yaegashi's mentioned the title of Kenji Miyazawa's Spring and Asura (Haru to Shura) in his class and caught Musashi's attention while he was otherwise being bored out of his mind. ; :Shura's strict father and Eiichir≈ç's rival. He was in sharp contrast to Eiichir≈ç's easy-going personality, in that he always appeared stiff and formal. His abusive way of training Shura kept his wife up at night because she always felt sorry for her son, which was the bane of their marriage. Kunihiko's tsuki was deadly, being able to pierce through hard wood at full force, and it is this tsuki that killed Eiichir≈ç, whom he deeply respected. ; :Shura's mother. Shura's memory with his beloved mother was always what kept him going. Despite his stiff demeanor and abusive method, her husband really loved her and accepted her slapping as a punishment for his inability to express sympathy. ; :One of the few notable swordswomen in the series. Ranko had a lot of similarities with Musashi as headstrong kids who refused to back down. She was one of the few lesser swordsmen that could hold up against Musashi, and also his first female opponent ever. When Musashi moved to her town and obliterated her dojo, she was the only one who could fight him for long. After Musashi joined the dojo, she frequently got into fights with Musashi every time she lost, but they made good teammates. As Ranko got older and more feminine in the Youth Arc, she started to develop feelings for Musashi and ended up being with him. ; :A Kagoshima (\\"Kagomma\\" in his accent) resident, who followed the brutal and powerful Jigen style of kendo. Musashi got to know more about the tanned boy who beat him after his exhausting triumph at the national championship during his stay in Kagoshima, where he showed him how tenacious Kagoshima swordsmen could be with their practice routine. ; :One of Musashi's opponents, who saved Ranko from the gang that got Musha suspended after his fight with them along with Musashi. He was a wealthy boy, but actually a strong swordsman and not a bad, typical spoiled rich boy. However, the duel with Musashi resulted in his left arm broken, and permanently losing strength even if it recovers, which made him hate Musashi, and Musashi feel responsible. When Musashi learned about the dual-wielding technique by the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi from a reclusive old man, he told Monami to give Inui a hint. With this technique that doesn't rely on the raw strength of a single arm, Inui was inspired to practice kendo again. ; :Musashi's childhood sweetheart, with a mole on her glabella. As a kid, she crushed on Musashi and wanted to be his future wife. It took a long time since Musashi moved away from Iwate until they met again when he went to high school. She later empathized more and more with Inui (who almost raped her to revenge on Musashi) and his situation, and became more supportive of his determination. ; :A skilled sophomore swordsman and Musashi's perverted roommate. Despite his skills, he frequently slacked off, and at one time even brought Musashi on a \\"special crash course\\" to peep on girls in short skirts playing tennis, which helped Musashi reunite with Monami. He was actually a gangster, but decided to give up the delinquent lifestyle in pursuit of education. He helped Musashi fend off his old gang while they surrounded Musashi and Monami on their date and got suspended as a result, but thanks to Inui's influence, he was forgiven.

It was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was first aired on Channel 1 of the Soviet Central Television on October 8‚Äì9, 1968, with repeat on October 10‚Äì11, 1968. On January 29, 2009 the film was released on DVD (in Russian). On 14 April 2019 the film was shown under the title Solyaris at the Barbican Centre in London (as part of the Stanislaw Lem on Film series within the Kinoteka festival of Polish film) with English subtitles commissioned for the screening that were composited over the film live by the translator. Plot Dr. Kris Kelvin arrives on Solaris Station, a space station orbiting the ocean planet of Solaris. The scientists there have been studying the planet and its ocean for many decades. Shortly before Kelvin's arrival, the crew exposed the ocean to a high-energy gamma-ray bombardment. The ocean's response tests the scientists' minds by confronting them with their most painful thoughts and memories. The ocean does this by materializing physical human simulacra. Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide. The torments of the other researchers are only suggested, but seem even worse than Kelvin's personal ordeal. The ocean's intelligence expresses physical phenomena in ways difficult for their limited science to explain, deeply upsetting the scientists. The alien mind of Solaris appears to differ so much from the human mind that communication doesn't seem possible. In a final experiment, Snaut and Sartorius record Kelvin's brain waves and beam them at Solaris. Unknown to Snaut and Sartorius, Kelvin, while his brain waves are being recorded, wishes that Kelvin and Snaut's visitors disappear but Harey stays. Kelvin tells the crew that he and Harey are to return to Earth. However, Snaut talks to Harey in private and says that she will not be allowed on Earth and would not make it anyway since she only exists because of the energy directed at the space station by Solaris. The night before Kelvin and Harey are due to leave, Harey tricks Kelvin into taking a sleeping draught and while he is asleep writes a second suicide note to him, then goes to Snaut and Sartorius who have built a machine to cancel out the effects of Solaris making the visitors disappear. Harey asks them what it will be like, Snaut says it 'will be like a flash and breath of wind'. Harey is gone, the visitors do not return and the three scientists agree to stay on the station.

Fire is the second phase of Wu Xing. Fire is yang in character. Its motion is upward and its energy is expansive. Fire is associated with Summer, the South, the planet Mars, the colour red (associated with extreme luck), hot weather, daylight, and the Vermilion Bird (Zhu Que) in the Four Symbols (which is associated with a red phoenix in Western culture). Attributes In Chinese Taoist thought, Fire attributes are considered to be dynamism, strength, and persistence; however, it is also connected to restlessness. The fire element provides warmth, enthusiasm, and creativity; however, an excess of it can bring aggression, impatience, and impulsive behavior. In the same way, fire provides heat and warmth; however, an excess can also burn. In Chinese Medicine, fire is associated with negative emotions of hate and the positive emotion is joy. The organs associated with the Fire element are the Heart (yin) and small intestine (yang), tongue and a body's pulse. Astrology The element plays an important role in Chinese astrology and feng shui. Fire is included in the 10 heavenly stems (the five elements in their yin and yang forms), which combine with the 12 Earthly Branches (or Chinese signs of the zodiac), to form the 60 year cycle. Yang Fire years end in 6 (e.g. 1976). (Yang years end in an even number.) Yin Fire years end in 7 (e.g. 1977). (Yin years end in an odd number.) Fire governs the Chinese zodiac signs Snake and Horse.findyourfate.com Flying Star Feng Shui uses number 9 to represent Fire. The South corner releases energy of Fire as I Ching and Feng Shui states. It is generally referred as energy of destroying and rebuilding. It also directly relates to a lucky lovelife. Cycles of Wu Xing In the regenerative cycle of Wu Xing, wood engenders Fire as \\"fire is generated by rubbing together two pieces of wood\\" and it must be fueled by burning wood; Fire begets earth as \\"fire reduces everything to ashes, which become a part of the earth again\\". In the conquest cycle, water overcomes Fire as \\"nothing will put out a fire as quickly as water\\"; Fire overcomes metal as it \\"can only be melted and forged\\" by flame or heat.Theodora Lau, The Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes, pxxix-xxx, Souvenir Press, London, 2005 References ","title":"Fire (wuxing)"},{"id":"21275517","text":"Yu Tsai (Chinese: Ëî°ÂÆá; pinyin: C√†i Y«î) is an American photographer based in Los Angeles and New York.

The film is also the producing debut of Bridget Marquardt, who teamed up with veteran producer Chuck Williams. It is directed by Jeff Burr and first time director Nicholas Carpenter, grandson of filmmaker Hal Roach. The making of the film was featured on the popular reality show The Girls Next Door. The majority of the filming took place at the Playboy Mansion and the Hollywood Castle. In addition to Marquardt and Madison, Playboy Playmate of the Year Sara Jean Underwood makes an appearance in the film.  Plot  In the prologue, Brianna (Najarra Townsend), after being harshly rejected from a sorority, is found dead at a party from overdosing on prescription drugs and alcohol. Scrawled in lipstick on a nearby mirror are the words \\"You made me do this.\\" One year later, the most exclusive and cruel sorority on campus, headed by Stephanie (Holly Madison), is in the final days of rush. For their final task, the three remaining pledges are required to tell the scariest story they know. The first pledge, Tonya (Jessica Noboa), tells a true story she heard from a friend. In the story, Lily (Rebekah Kochan), is a beautiful blonde that lives with her boyfriend Tommy (Ryan Freeman) and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah, from England. Tommy works at a coffee shop, and finds a doll in a dumpster one day, which he brings home to Lily. At first, Lily thinks that Sarah has done something to the doll to mess with her. The doll kills Sarah first, stabbing her to death, then electrocutes Lily. The story ends with Tonya saying Tommy was convicted for the murders and was put away for life. The girls think that the story is good and take a shot. The second story, told by Phoebe (Stephanie Sanborn), is about a former A-list actress, Eva DeMarco (Bridget Marquardt), who wants to be back on top. So she accepts a role from an elusive filmmaker (John D'Aquino) in a desolate region in Romania. However, the film crew has a deadly secret. Eva is drugged and has a dream where she's in a jail cell and killed by an angel with black wings (Christine Nguyen). When she wakes up, she goes to a dinner party for the shoot of the movie, where she discovers that all of the crew members are dead, and that they make snuff films. Eva is killed and becomes the newest member of the group. Again, the sorority girls like Phoebe's story and take another shot. Finally, it is Haley's (Jean-Louise O'Sullivan) turn. She tells a story about a group of three girls, based on Stephanie, Amber, and Roxy. The story begins at the girls' home; the girls are about to go see a movie while their cable is being fixed. The girls come back home after one of them forgot to buy tickets in advance. Another girl suggests making prank calls. They call a man and tell him that he has won seven free pizzas. During the call, the man goes to answer the door and is killed. The girls overhear the man being killed and hesitantly call the police. The girls don't trust the cop who shows up, since he is by himself. After a killing spree occurs, only Anna and the cop ramin. Anna kills the cop out of terror, thinking he is the killer. After shooting him five times, she walks into the hallway, where the real killer is waiting. She is promptly killed. After all of the girls tell their stories, it is time for the sorority sisters to make their decision. First, Stephanie reveals the two newest members selected for their sorority are two other girls, Stacie and Rachel, who were inducted in a private rush separate from the official rush that Tonya, Phoebe, and Haley just underwent. Stephanie derides the three pledges for thinking that they could become members of the sorority. But then the sorority sisters start feeling the ill effects of the poisoned cookies provided by Haley. Haley, who turns out to be Brianna's half-sister, became a pledge solely to get close enough to the sorority (that she blames for Brianna's suicide) to kill them.

The estate of Marienehe was bought in 1393 by the Rostock merchant and statesman Winold Baggel or Baggele, who in 1396, when he was B√ºrgermeister of Rostock, together with his father-in-law, Matthias von Borken, founded the charterhouse here. The monastery was noted for the extent to which it favoured university education for its monks and the mystical writings the community produced, particularly under the priors Heinrich Eler, Vicco Dessin and Heinrich von Ribnitz. The community, under the leadership of Marquardt or Markwart (von) Behr, the last prior, vehemently resisted the imposition of Lutheranism during the Reformation and the monastery had to be dissolved forcibly by 300 armed men on 15 March 1552, after which it was demolished and used as a quarry. The stone was mostly put to use in the construction of Schloss G√ºstrow. There are no visible remains. The site was later used for the construction of the Heinkel works, and after the war for the Rostock Fischkombinat (\\"fishery centre\\"). A block of flats now stands here.

The series starred the mythological superhero Hercules, his sidekick Amadeus Cho, the seventh- smartest person in the world, and half-sister Athena. The series began in the aftermath of World War Hulk with The Incredible Hulk receiving a title and focus change to Hercules. Though the title does not change until issue #113 the first issue of the first story arc of The Incredible Hercules appears in issue #112. The ongoing series concluded with issue #141 in February 2010, with two succeeding miniseries announced.The Heroic Age: Prince of Power This was followed by Chaos War. Story arcs=\\"The Incredible Hercules\\" (#112-115); also known as \\"Against the World\\"= Picking up from the end of World War Hulk, Hercules and Amadeus Cho are now on the wrong side of the law. Hercules intends to make peace with S.H.I.E.L.D., while Cho only wants to continue his campaign to bring it down. However, on being confronted with his half-brother and longtime nemesis Ares, God of War, now a Mighty Avenger and in charge of Hercules' case, Hercules changes his mind and, together with Cho, runs. Hercules aims to seek shelter with his sister Athena in Vermont, while Cho, using a stolen SHIELD laptop, wants to destroy the entire agency. Ares, Wonder Man, and Black Widow pursue the two. Ultimately, Hercules defeats Ares and talks Cho down from his desire to destroy SHIELD. The two then join Athena, only to be informed of a coming planetary invasion. =\\"Secret Invasion\\" (#116-120)= Informed of the Skrull invasion, Athena perceives this holy war as a threat to the Earth's deities, who will be replaced and consumed if it succeeds. The group travels to San Francisco, where they are briefly waylaid for a battle with the Eternals. Gathering the Council Elite of Pantheons in San Francisco, she proposes to confront and slay the Skrull Gods, Kly'bn the Eternal Skrull and Sl'gr't of the Infinite Names, before the invasion can succeed. The force consists of Hercules (representing Europe) and Cho, Snowbird (representing the Gods of North America), Atum (representing Africa), Ajak (representing South America), and Amatsu-Mikaboshi (representing Asia). The Australian Skyfather contributes the ship on which the God Squad will travel. After a sidetrip into the realm of Nightmare, Hercules and Snowbird have sex, before she seemingly sacrifices herself to allow the rest of the group to make it through to the Skrull gods, after a Skrull sleeper agent posing as Cho's coyote companion Kirby sabotages their ship. In the final battle, Kly'bn blows up Ajak (who, as an Eternal, will regenerate), and Sl'gr't destroys Atum, before Hercules, Cho, and a returning Snowbird slay Kly'bn. Sl'gr't then seemingly kills Mikaboshi, only for it to be revealed that in fact it was Mikaboshi who survived, now in command of the Skrull gods' army of thralls - a watching Athena is pleased with this development. =\\"Love and War\\" (#121-125)= Following their victory, Hercules and Cho go on vacation to the tropics adjoining Atlantis, where Hercules and Namora frolic. They are interrupted by the arrival of the Amazons led by Princess Artume and Delphyne Gorgon, who abduct Cho (who they mistake for Hercules' eromenos), needing him to decipher an Atlantean tablet. Cho is infatuated with Artume, and ignores the warnings of Delphyne. Artume is revealed to be leading a rogue sect of Amazons, and slays her mother Queen Hippolyta to become the new ruler. Hercules, Namora, and Namor raid the Amazons' base to rescue the captive Poseidon, but Artume's group escapes with Cho, their goal revealed to be the location of the omphalos, which will allow them to remake the world. Cho and Delphyne become attracted to each other, and she agrees to help him escape. Artume notices the potential betrayal, however, her attempt to execute Delphyne fails due to inadequate knowledge of Gorgon anatomy. Artume succeeds in using the omphalos to remake reality, but her scheme is ultimately undone within the reality itself, and Delphyne slays her, becoming the new queen. Now bound to have nothing to do with men, she bids Cho adieu; meanwhile, Namora and Hercules break up angrily over her attraction to Namor. The two dispirited friends agree to go out for pizza. Meanwhile, Hera and Pluto stage a takeover of the Olympus Group, the Greek Gods' seat of power on Earth, and plot against Athena and Hercules. =\\"The Origin of Hercules\\" (#126)= A flashback issue reveals Hercules' early years in Thebes, and the roles of both Athena and Hera in his creation. Hercules' actions encourage his fellow citizens to use weapons consecrated in temples (and thus, meant to be off-limits) against the enemy, which pleases Athena but offends Hera, who vows that both Hercules and Athena will suffer in the future. The backup story concerns Cho's attempt to locate his missing coyote Kirby, who is revealed to now be fully grown with a mate, and no longer wants to travel with him. =\\"Dark Reign\\" (#127-131)= Huntsman, one of Hera's minions, ambushes and kills Aegis, a mortal given superpowers by Athena to fight crime. At the same time, Hera meets with Norman Osborn to share details of her plan, which Osborn (who does not believe she is a real god) is appalled by. Hercules, Athena, and Cho are confronted in New York City by Hera, who is accompanied by a now-freed Typhon. Hera demands that Athena apologize for going to the Council Elite (in \\"Sacred Invasion) and disregarding her position as head of the Pantheon, which Athena refuses to do - Hera then hints at Aegis' death. The group track Aegis' breastplate to a remote warehouse, where Hera and her forces are waiting, including Delphyne Gorgon, who was unaware that Cho would be there. The skirmish is interrupted by the arrival of Osborn's Dark Avengers, tipped off by Hercules' estranged wife Hebe (who is working as Hera's assistant). The battle allows the heroes to escape, before an alliance between the two groups of villains is concluded. Athena sends Hercules and Cho to Hades to attempt to rescue Zeus in order to counter Hera. Pluto is waiting for them, where he is putting Zeus on trial for crimes against creation. Cho visits with his dead parents, and discovers that his sister Maddy is not, as he believed, dead. Hercules attempts to defend Zeus, despite the latter's contempt, and his heroics ultimately convinces Zeus to drink the waters of the River Lethe. He is reborn on the surface as a child, and Athena and Hercules agree he must be protected from Hera. Cho, who believes Athena knew of his sister's survival and withheld this information (as well as an earlier warning from Delphyne), abruptly leaves the group, to Hercules' befuddlement. =\\"The Replacement Thor\\" (#132, 134, 136)= Traveling to hide the young Zeus with the Mighty Avengers, Hercules and Zeus are separated from Athena by attacking Harpies, and then recruited by Balder the Brave to pose as Thor in order to avert a war between Asgard and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim. Hercules is delighted by the opportunity, and upon arriving in the kingdom quickly seduces Queen Alflyse, only to accidentally marry her. Alflyse then prepares to invade Asgard in order to install her \\"husband\\" on his throne again. Zeus is disgusted with Hercules' behaviour, and becomes a fan of Thor through reading of his heroic exploits. Thor then appears, accompanied by the Warriors Three, and poses as Hercules in order to stop the invasion. The two fight, with Thor winning. It is then revealed that Malekith the Accursed was posing as Balder to bring about these events, but his scheme humorously unravels and Zeus easily defeats him. Hercules reveals his true identity to Alflyse, who considers his sexual prowess sufficient compensation for the deception. =\\"The Secret Origin of Amadeus Cho\\" (#133, 135, 137)= Determined to uncover the truth behind the death of his family and the disappearance of his sister, Cho travels to Excello, Utah, the home of the company that ran the contest that uncovered his intellect. He encounters a familiar face from his past in Agent Sexton, who attempted to warn him about something shortly after his house exploded, but becomes enmeshed in a web of realities set up by Pythagoras Dupree, who claims to be the sixth-smartest man in the world. Cho eventually realizes that Dupree is attempting to prevent him from realizing the true power of his mind, the \\"hypermind\\", which he uses to break the illusion. It is also revealed that Sexton is in fact Athena in disguise; Cho demands to know why she did not prevent his parents' deaths, which Athena says is not how gods work. Cho angrily goes to confront Dupree, who reveals he was Athena's original choice for champion, but rejected the position, and began killing anyone who might possibly lead Athena to him; however, he does not know where Maddy is. Cho declines to fight him, saying he is not worth it, a declaration which leads to Dupree committing suicide. Cho uncovers evidence of a superweapon called \\"Continuum\\" that Dupree developed for Hera, and shares this information with Athena: both conclude they must immediately find Hercules. =\\"Assault on New Olympus\\" (Assault on New Olympus Prologue, #138-141)= Athena and Cho attempt to gather the other Olympians to confront Hera, but are rejected; meanwhile, Hercules travels to retrieve Hebe, who, after being exiled from the Olympus Group by Hera for her betrayal, ended up working with May Parker in a homeless shelter. May set her up with Peter Parker on a date, something that enrages Hercules. After an extended fight, Hebe breaks it up, and she and Hercules are reconciled. Spider-Man and some of his fellow New Avengers join Hercules and his teammates U.S. Agent, Hank Pym and Quicksilver from the Mighty Avengers to battle Hera. Hera, reveals her plan meanwhile: to erase all existence and replace it with a new universe devoid of human life. She is able to do this by using an invention called \\"Continuum\\" which was created by the mortal Pythagoras Dupree. The Avengers trick their way into the Olympus building, but are quickly confronted by Hera's forces who have the upper hand in battle. In alliance with Hephaestus, Delphyne Gorgon uses a special weapon to turn Athena to stone, an act which undoes the Gorgon curse on her. The reborn Zeus convinces Hera to stop her plan only for Typhon to reveal that he is no longer under Hera's control. He slays both Hera and Zeus before Hercules successfully defeats him. Athena then reveals that he must die so that Cho can become the new \\"Prince of Power\\". She destroys the Continuum machine with Hercules in the other world, seemingly killing him. Sequel series=Hercules: Fall of an Avenger= Following Hercules' apparent death at the conclusion of the series proper, crowds flock to the Parthenon to honour his legacy. Cho is met there by a large body of heroes from Hercules' past, led by Thor and Bruce Banner. Thor contributes a story of his past adventures with Hercules, followed by Namor, the various women from his past (Black Widow, Snowbird, Namora, Queen Alflyse) speaking of his sexual prowess, and Bruce Banner. Afterward, Athena arrives, accompanied by Pluto, Poseidon, Apollo, Artemis and Hebe, and announces that she intends for Cho to take over the Olympus Group. Apollo challenges Athena for leadership of the Olympians, leading a brawl between various champions, with Athena and her allies triumphing. Cho then travels to Hades to find Hercules, but is told by Persephone that Hercules is not there. Realizing that Hercules must be alive somewhere, he accepts Athena's offer to lead the Olympus Group, and vows to use the Olympus Group's resources to find Hercules.Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1-2 =Heroic Age: Prince of Power= Cho, now in charge of the Olympus Group, with Hebe working as his assistant, spends half a trillion dollars in order to have Bruce Banner build a device capable of scanning the multiverse to find Hercules. However, it is determined that this will take over a billion years to work. After a battle with the Griffin, Cho is visited by Vali Halfling, the leader of the Pantheon, who proposes an alliance in order to gather the necessary ingredients to become as powerful as the Skyfathers: Hebe's ambrosia, the golden apples of Idunn, the spells of the Book of Thoth, and the amrita cup of Dhanavantari. Cho steals the list from Vali and goes to Asgard himself, only to find that Vali had already stolen the apples, framing him for the theft. Cho battles Thor, but convinces him of his innocence, and recruits him to stop Halfling and use the power to instead locate and rescue Hercules. They play into Halfling's hands by allowing him to retrieve the Book of Thoth from the Egyptian realm, but succeed in stopping him from using the full formula. Meanwhile, Delphyne escapes from her cell and, somewhat reluctantly, allies with Athena to return control of the Olympus Group to the gods, who Halfling had incapacitated by extinguishing the Promethean Flame. Cho gains true godhood, but, realizing that he is not worthy to wield it permanently, instead transfers it to the returned Hercules. Hercules senses the impending return of Amatsu-Mikaboshi, and hurriedly departs to gather other heroes to face him.Heroic Age: Prince of Power #1-4 Reception The series has garnered high praise since its debut in 2008.

Earth is the third element in the Wu Xing cycle. Earth is a balance of both yin and yang, the feminine and masculine together. Its motion is inward and centering, and its energy is stabilizing and conserving. It is associated with the color yellow and the planet Saturn, and it lies at the center of the compass in the Chinese cosmos. It is associated with the turn of each of the four seasons and with damp weather. It governs the Spleen, Stomach, mouth and muscles. Its negative emotion is anxiety and its positive emotion is empathy. Its Primal Spirit is represented by the Yellow Dragon. Colour Yellow, Golden (Sun)  Attributes  The Wu Xing Earth is associated with the qualities of patience, thoughtfulness, practicality, hard work, and stability. The earth element is also nurturing and seeks to draw all things together with itself, in order to bring harmony, rootedness and stability. Other attributes of the earth element include ambition, stubbornness, responsibility and long-term planning.  Astrology  Earth plays an important role in Chinese astrology. In Chinese astrology earth is included in the 10 heavenly stems (the five elements in their yin and yang forms), which combine with the 12 Earthly Branches (or Chinese signs of the zodiac), to form the 60 year cycle. Yang earth years end in 8 (e.g. 1998), while Yin earth years end in 9 (e.g. 1999). Earth is the central balance of the elements and therefore lends qualities to all 12 animals as well. The element earth is associated with the planet Saturn on account of its yellow color.Wolfram Eberhard, A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols, pp238 -9, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1986 However, some Western astrologers have suggested that the Western associations of Saturn give it greater affinity with the rigid, controlling Chinese element of Metal; while the Chinese conception of earth as a centering, harmonizing element has more in common with the Western notion of the planet Venus. As I Ching and Feng Shui described, Earth generally contains all elements including Fire, Water, Wood and Metal. These four types of Earth are Earth-of-water (wet Earth), Earth-of-Fire (dry Earth), Earth-of-Metal (Wet Earth) and Earth-of-Wood (dry Earth). Yellow, orange, beige and brown colors represent Earth. Earth governs Ox, Dragon, Goat, and Dog.  Cycle of Wu Xing  In the controlling cycle, earth controls water by damming or absorbing it; wood can overcome it by breaking it up (by the roots). In the conductive cycle, earth is produced by fire's ashes, and in turn melts to produce metal.

Water is the most yin in character of the five elements. Its motion is downward and inward, and its energy is stillness and conserving. Water is associated with certain colors, with the planet Mercury, with the moon (which was believed to cause the dew to fall at night), with night, with the north, with winter or cold weather, and with the Black Tortoise (Xuan Wu) in the Chinese constellation Four Symbols. Attributes In Chinese Taoist thought, water is representative of intelligence and wisdom, flexibility, softness, and pliancy; however, an overabundance of the element is said to cause difficulty in choosing something and sticking to it. In the same way, water can be fluid and weak, but can also wield great power when it floods and overwhelms the land. In Chinese medicine, water is believed to govern the kidney and urinary bladder, and is associated with the ears and bones. The negative emotion associated with water is fear/anxiety, while the positive emotion is calmness. The colours black, blue, and grey also represent water. Astrology In Chinese astrology, water is included in the 10 heavenly stems (the five elements in their yin and yang forms), which combine with the 12 Earthly Branches (or Chinese signs of the zodiac), to form the 60 year cycle. Yang water years end in 2 (e.g., 1992), while yin water years end in 3 (e.g., 1993). Water governs the Chinese zodiac signs Pig and Rat. Water usually represents wealth and money luck in Feng Shui, although it might differ in some subjective scenarios. Cycle of Wu Xing *In the regenerative cycle of the Wu Xing, metal engenders water, as it traps falling water from a source, and water begets wood as \\"rain or dew makes plant life flourish\\" *In the conquest cycle, water overcomes fire, as \\"nothing will put out a fire as quickly as water\\" *Earth overcomes water as earth-built canals direct the flow, and soil absorbs water.

However, her position was purely titular and apart from customary privileges, she had little authority.  Ancestry and early life  Vijaya Bai was the second daughter of Shivaji, the last Maratha ruler of Tanjore and Kamakshi Bai, the queen of Tanjore and was born in 1846. She became the heir-apparent on the death of her elder sister Rajasa Boje Ammanee Rajur Bai.  Shivaji's death and British annexation of Tanjore  Shivaji died in 1855. In the absence of a natural male heir to the throne, Tanjore was annexed by the British East India Company as per the newly constituted Doctrine of Lapse. Nine-year-old Vijaya Bai assumed the title of Queen of Tanjore on 31 October 1855 after the British refused to recognise the claims of Serfoji III, an adopted son of Shivaji II, but she had little authority in the kingdom apart from certain customary privileges. The dispossessed queen was extremely ??? and waged an unsuccessful legal battle to get her authority restored.  Marriage  With the permission of the Madras government, Vijaya Bai married Sakharam Saheb, the prince of Kolhapur and the widower of Princess Rajur Bai in about 1859.  Honours  Muktamba Bai was granted a personal salute of 13 guns on 8 December 1874. She was awarded the Prince of Wales' gold medal in 1876 and the Empress of India Medal in gold in 1877. Muktamba Bai was appointed to the Order of the Crown of India in the New Year Honours' List of 1878.
