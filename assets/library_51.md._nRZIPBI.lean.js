Language The language of the Biyaygiri was Biyay, a dialect of Warrgamay. The last speaker of the language was Nora Boyd, who enabled Robert Dixon to supplement what little was known of the dialect before dying at age 95. Country The Biyaygiri were the Indigenous people of Hinchinbrook Island, with a continental foothold on the area around Lucinda Point. Norman Tindale estimated their lands as encompassing about . Social organisation Some uncertainty exists as to whether the Biyay speakers on Hinchinbrook and the Lucinda Point were the same tribe. The latter called themselves Biaigin, and may have been tribally distinct. Those on Hinchinbrook had a four-class marriage system: * Koorkeela * Kookooroo * Woongo * Wooitcheroo Biyaygiri furnished some of the major trade goods of the continental area adjacent to their island, and among those mainland tribes the Nautilus necklaces, and Melo shells they collected and worked came to be known by one of the Hinchinbrook tribal ethnonyms, bandjin. History of contact Hinchenbrook Island was first occupied by whites around 1863. The island was ethnically cleansed just under a decade later. Robert Dixon writes that an initial attempt to established a mission, where the Biyaygiri might have found some protection, was undertaken by the Reverend E. Fuller in 1870, but his sojourn in the area lasted only five months, during which the Biyaygiri kept their distance. > In retrospect, the Biyaygiri might have done well to seek his protection. In > 1872, Sub-Inspector Robert Johnstone - who was convinced that there was only > one real way to \\"teach the Aborigines a lesson\\" - led a party of police and > troopers who beat a cordon across the island and cornered almost the whole > tribe on a headland. Those who were not massacred on land were shot as they > attempted to swim away.' A slightly different version is provided by newspapers of the period. Fuller's mission was undertaken in 1874, two years later than Johnstone's cleansing of the area with the assistance of the Australian native police. The Biyaygiri had been decimated before Fuller's arrival and he spent 3 weeks trying to turn up Aboriginal people on the island without finding a single native person there.

He is generally known for his Pago Pago expressionist paintings produced between 1963 and 1969. Early life Latiff was born in Lenggeng, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia and received his formal primary education at Kota Raja Malay School in Singapore. His talent in painting later granted him the Deutscher Akademischer Austrauschdienst (DAAD) scholarship to study at the Academy of Arts in Berlin from 1960 until 1964. Later in 1969, the French Ministry of Culture awarded him with a scholarship to study etching in Paris at the Atelier Lacouri√®re-Fr√©laut, followed by a grant from the Asian Cultural Program of The JDR 3rd Fund (later known as the Asian Cultural Council) for a residency at the Pratt Institute in New York. Due to his education, he speaks Malay, English and German. Career Latiff's passion for painting and drawing was evident from an early age. At 11, he sold his first painting to the then British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, Sir Malcolm MacDonald. He later came to be identified as \\"the magical boy with the gift in his hands\\" after his first exhibition at the Kota Raja Malay School in Singapore, a school that he attended before he flew to Berlin to further his artistic education. Upon his return from Germany in 1964, he travelled throughout Indochina and the Malay world, establishing affinities and conversations with avant-garde artists and intellectuals of the time. This moment, which he evokes through the phrase ‚ÄúPago Pago,‚Äù has found a significant place in writings on Southeast Asian art. His artistic practice is often linked to his literary activities. He first became recognised as a poet when he published his collection of poems Sungai Mekong in 1971, which has since been translated into multiple languages. Like his art, his poetry is a methodological wandering that resists ideological systems and structures, offering an extended interrogation of the artist's interior world. Many of these thoughts are reflected in GARIS Latiff Mohidin dari titik de titik, a work of immense literary prowess that was first published in 1988. It grapples with the position of vernacular cosmopolitanism within the story of global modernism, which still defaults to Europe. His literary and painterly world is also heavily informed by the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, Chairil Anwar and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe amongst others. Breaking down disciplinary boundaries between the visual and literary, in 2012, Latiff Mohidin published his translation of Goethe's Faust (Part 1), a figure who has fascinated him since his encounter with German literature in the early 1960s. In 2018, he became the first Southeast Asian artist to be featured at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

It is often subtitled Sinfon√≠a en negro: Homage to Martin Luther King.  Composition  Balada grew up in Barcelona in a liberal family under Francisco Franco's regime. As he recalls, being raised to respect freedom of expression and equality caused him to admire post-World War II United States. However, the mistreatment of African Americans felt like a disappointment to him. After moving to the United States, he came in contact with the Civil Rights Movement, a relationship which culminated with Balada meeting Martin Luther King Jr. in New York City in 1967, one year before King was assassinated. In 1968, Balada received a commission by Spain's RTVE Symphony Orchestra to compose a work scored for them. Balada decided to use King as the subject for the symphony. As he did with his Symphony No. 6, Guernica and No-res, he used his own ideology as the unifying thread for the work. The symphony was finished in 1968 and was premiered at the Teatro Real in Madrid on June 21, 1969, with the RTVE Symphony Orchestra under Enrique Garc√≠a Asensio.

In Japan she is sometimes known as tekazuhime (ÊâãÊï∞Âß´), (\\"Princess of Many Strokes\\"). She has the image of a gecko on the front of her 20-inch bass drum, and on her Zildjian drumsticks. She has won many awards for her drumming. Early life Kawaguchi was born in a suburb of Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture on 8 January 1997; and when she was still very young, she moved with her family to Yokkaichi in neighbouring Mie Prefecture. She was introduced to drumming at the age of five when her father, whom she described in an interview as a mecha-otaku („É°„Ç´„Ç™„Çø„ÇØ), brought home an electronic drum kit so that he could explore its inner workings. Eventually, he gave it to her to play with, and at the age of six, she began taking drum lessons locally. When she was eight years old her teacher recommended that, having shown sufficient interest and talent, she start taking lessons from the renowned Japanese drummer and drum instructor Kozo Sugunama. Under Sugunama's tutelage Kawaguchi's skills developed, and soon she was accompanying professional musicians. In 2009, she made her first DVD, Horoscope with Sugunama and members of the Japanese fusion band Fragile. Later that year, after starting junior high school, she began making appearances at a number of small venues, as Senri's Super Session with Akira Tanemura on guitar, Teruyuki Iwawaki on bass and Mayumi Yoshida on keyboard, and with whom she still performs; and, between 2011 and 2014, as Senri's BeeHive Session at the BeeHive in Osaka‚Äîplaying with a number of top Japanese rock and fusion jazz musicians, including Kyoji Yamamoto, Minoru Mukaiya, and Tetsuo Sakurai. Videos from many of these performances, were posted to a YouTube account set up in her name, along with videos in which she performed to the accompaniment of music from the anime K-On, bringing her to a much wider audience. In 2010, at the age of 13, she became one of the youngest drummers, and only the second Japanese drummer after Akira Jimbo to be added to the Drummerworld list of top 500 drummers. Career In 2011, as well as continuing session work, she made her first overseas trip as a drummer when Yamaha Drums invited her to showcase some of their new drum kits at the 2011 Winter NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. Later in the year, she travelled with Yamaha to China, to participate in the 2011 Tianjin Jiutai International Drum Festival. In 2012, she made her first national television appearance when, along with the members of Senri‚Äôs Super Session, she accompanied guitarist Kyoji Yamamoto at that year's Tokyo Crossover Night International Jazz Festival, which was broadcast by Fuji Television on their satellite channel. On her 16th birthday in January 2013, she released her first solo CD A la Mode. In it she was accompanied by a number of Japanese musicians, including some that she had performed with in her BeeHive Sessions. Later that year, she travelled to the Hua Hin Jazz Festival, where she performed with Jun Abe, Shingo Tanaka, the bassist of fusion jazz band T-Square, and Kay-Ta Matsuno. Towards the end of the year, she began a collaboration with Kiyomi Otaka the keyboard player from Casiopea 3rd, forming the fusion duo Kiyo*Sen. They released their first CD Chocolate Booster in January 2014. The release of this CD was followed up with a short tour later in the year. At the beginning of 2014, she went to Los Angeles to record her second CD, Buena Vista. There, she met French smooth jazz and new- age music multi-instrumentalist Philippe Saisse, with whom she continues to work. She was also invited to be one of the international judges for the 2014 Hit Like a Girl drum competition, and has been a regular judge since then. Later in the year, she became involved in idol group E-Girls' tour of Japan, joining their support group as the drummer, giving her her first experience of performing at larger venues, including Tokyo's Budokan. Finally, in September, she made her first appearance at the Tokyo Jazz Festival. In April 2015, after graduating from senior high school, she moved to Tokyo to study social science at Waseda University. While studying at university she continues her session and studio work. In June that year, Kiyo*Sen released their second CD Duology and followed it up with a short tour publicising the release. In August, she travelled to the 2015 Rock au ch√¢teau festival held in the grounds of the ch√¢teau de Villersexel in France. In September, she performed at the Super Mario 30th Anniversary Concert in Tokyo. She also became more in demand to work with other artists, either in concert, or as a session artist on albums, notably being invited to perform with Guthrie Govan on the Japanese leg of his Erotic Cakes tour at the end of 2015. She would work again with Govan, a year later, at the end of 2016. In 2016, she released 3 CDs: KKK Core, a collaboration between Kawaguchi, Kozo Sugunama and Kaori Hirohara that they had worked on since the previous year; Trick or Treat, her third CD as part of Kiyo*Sen, and Cider Hard and Sweet, a collaboration with Philippe Saisse and the bassist Armand Sabal-Lecco. Throughout 2017, she participated in events to promote Yamaha Drum's 50th anniversary‚Äîculminating in a concert on stage with Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, and Akira Jimbo on 2 September. Artists that she worked with in 2017 included Bootsy Collins on his CD World Wide Funk, which was released in October 2017 and Jan Erling Holberg, with whom she worked on the single Aim to Please. In September, 2017 she performed with Saisse and Sabal-Lecco for a televised performance at the 2017 Tokyo Jazz Festival at NHK Hall, after which they performed at various venues, including Motion Blue in Tokyo, which was recorded and released as a DVD and Blu-ray, and for which they won the Nissan Jazz Japan Award 2017 for Best Live Performance. In October 2017, she travelled to Bengaluru where she participated in the 2017 October Octaves with Indian fusion violinist Abhijith PS Nair. In 2019, she graduated from Waseda University.

She is Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. She is known for her work in the fields of behavior, communication and persuasion. Her contributions have had implications for the scientific understanding of basic social psychological processes and communication policy, especially in the area of health. She was the Dave Thomas Professor of Psychology at the University of Florida and the Martin Fishbein Professor of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author/editor of two books, Prediction and Change of Health Behavior: Applying the Theory of Reasoned Action Approach and The Handbook of Attitudes. She is the lead or co-author of more than 150 published articles and book chapters and has received two Scientist Development Awards from the National Institute of Mental Health. As of 2018, she directs the Social Action Lab and the Health & Social Media Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  Early life and education  Albarracin was born in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina in a family of politically active academics. She grew up during the long military dictatorship that oppressed Argentina for close to a decade. After attending Liceo Victor Mercante in La Plata, she received a degree in Psychology from Catholic University of La Plata and a degree in Letters from the National University of La Plata. Subsequently, she completed her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Belgrano. Albarracin was recruited by social psychologist Martin Fishbein to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where she received her Ph.D. under the direction of Robert S. Wyer and Martin Fishbein.  Career  After completing her Ph.D. in 1997, Albarracin joined the University of Florida as Assistant Professor and ascended through the ranks to Dave Thomas Professor of Psychology there until 2007, when she started teaching at the University of Illinois. In 2012, she joined the University of Pennsylvania as the Martin Fishbein Professor of Communication and taught there for the next two years. She is the author/editor of two books, Prediction and Change of Health Behavior: Applying the Theory of Reasoned Action Approach and The Handbook of Attitudes. She is the lead or co-author of more than 150 published articles and book chapters, and has received two Scientist Development Awards from the National Institute of Mental Health. In 2018, she was awarded the Mid-Career Award for Outstanding Scientific Contributions from the Attitudes and Social Influence Group of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. As of 2018, Albarracin directs the Social Action Lab and the Health & Social Media Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. She is the editor in chief of Psychological Bulletin. She is a fellow of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, the American Psychological Association and Association for Psychological Science.  Research  Albarracin's research focuses on attitudes and persuasion, the relationship between intention and behavior, and predicting general activity patterns. In the beginning of her career, she did research on the sequence of cognitive and motivational events that mediate the impact of persuasive communication on attitudes and behavior. Later, her work was aimed at understanding how people form specific attitudes and goals based on fragmentary social information and thoughts. More recently, she has studied how behavioral intentions undermine actual action, methods of debunking misinformation and conspiracy theories, and the dynamics of multiple-behavior change. Much of Albarracin's research has had implications in the area of health including how health risk behaviors can be discouraged and how peer influence impacts the likelihood of smoking. For almost two decades, she has received funding from National Institute of Health to apply the theoretical findings of her research to curb disease in the area of HIV, smoking, and lifestyle change. = Behavior, attitudes, affects and persuasion = Albarracin has done significant research about how behavior and attitudes are influenced by selective exposure, source credibility, intentions and affective feelings. In the early 2000s she researched the effect of cognitive and motivational mediators in the impact of persuasive speech on behavior and attitudes. Her research concluded that when people have time to think about a persuasive message, they form beliefs about the behavior outcomes described. These beliefs later impact their attitude and behavior. On the other hand people base their attitudes and behavior on the affective feeling they are experiencing at the time, if they don't have enough time to think about the message content. Her research was the first that detailed the cognitive processes that act as a mediator in the relationship between persuasive messages and behavior. Another line of her research studied how affect impacts the cognitive responses to a persuasive message. She has also studied the influence of self-talk in the regulation of behavior. Her research provided a socio-cognitive understanding on the conditions and effects of this form of speech. Her research showed that people talk to themselves using the pronoun I, but sometimes, they also address themselves in the second person pronoun, you. According to her research, when people require conscious self-guidance, people refer to themselves as you. Moreover, she concluded that the second- person mode of self-talk contribute to effective self-regulation. In the late 1990s she investigated how intention facilitates actual behavior in multiple studies. In 2013, she further delved into the topic by researching how intentions can sometimes undermine actual behavior. The research found that for brief, easily enacted and regularly repeated actions, intentions can sometimes be misremembered as completed actions. = General action and inaction goal = More recently her work has been focused on action and inaction goals. The research found that people primed with action words engage in more behaviors than people primed with inaction words. Her team has also found a positivity bias favoring action over inaction. When there are no specifications about the quality and nature of actions and inaction, people find actions as more favorable than inaction. The research has important implications for mental health. = Applications to health promotion= Albarracin's research has had many implications in the health industry. In one of her researches, she examined the effectiveness of HIV-prevention campaigns in changing attitudes and behaviors. The findings revealed that persuasive messages communicated in such campaigns increase the audience's knowledge about the HIV. However, they bring about no change in the actual behavior of individuals. According to the research, active and complex programs that strengthen behavioral skills are effective. Albarracin has also conducted research on the efficacy of health program campaigns that use fear appeals to discourage certain behaviors. Her research has highlighted a positive effect of fear on intentions and behavior, specially if the message encourages self- efficacy. Her research also highlights that the direction of behavioral recommendations also matters in how effective a health program will be. According to her research multi-behavior interventions where the recommendation direction is homogeneous are more effective. So a program requiring an action and an inaction will be less effective than a program requiring two actions or two inactions.

His father was Jacopo Bellini, his brother was Gentile Bellini (who was more highly regarded than Giovanni during his lifetime, although the reverse is true today), and his brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna. He was considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style.

Early life and career Craven was born in London in 1818, son of Robert Thornton, a schoolmaster in Holborn. Starting life as a publisher's clerk in Paternoster Row, he subsequently acted as amanuensis to Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and began writing for Bentley's Miscellany. Ambitious to become a dramatist, he took to the stage, making his first appearance at York in 1840 and his London debut soon after at Fanny Kelly's Theatre in Soho. In 1841 he was acting on the Sunderland circuit, and in 1842 his first play, Bertram the Avenger, was produced at North Shields. Craven produced his second play, Miserrimus, at Portsmouth late in 1843. In the spring of 1844 he joined Robert Keeley and Mary Anne Keeley at the Lyceum Theatre, London, and after both acting and writing for the stage of the smaller theatres he was in 1850 engaged at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where, on the occasion of William Macready's farewell in February 1851, he played Malcolm to the tragedian's Macbeth. On 12 June of that year his operetta The Village Nightingale was produced at the Strand Theatre, with himself in one of the characters. Eliza (1827‚Äì1908), daughter of the composer Sidney Nelson, took the leading female role. In November 1851 the two were engaged by Lloyd of Edinburgh for the Theatre Royal company, Craven as principal stage director. In that city they were married on 12 May 1852. Australia, and success as a dramatist In June 1854 the Cravens left for Australia. In Sydney they fulfilled a successful engagement at the Royal Victoria Theatre. In partnership with the actor W. H. Stephens, Craven then built the little Lyceum Theatre in the same city, which they opened in 1855. In April 1857 the Cravens appeared at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, in several of Craven's own pieces. On their return to England, Eliza withdrew from performing, while Craven continued to write and perform. The Post Boy was first seen at the Strand Theatre on 31 October 1860. Frederick Robson produced and played in Craven's domestic drama The Chimney Corner at the Olympic Theatre, opening on 21 February 1861. Miriam's Crime opened at the Strand Theatre on 9 October 1863. These plays were successful. Milky White Craven designed for Robson the title-character in Milky White, which was first produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, opening on 20 June 1864. Robson's sudden death in August altered Craven's plans, and he himself sustained the title-role when the piece was brought out at the Strand on 28 September of that year. Milky White enjoyed a run and a revival at the Strand and was subsequently popular in the provinces. \\"The author\\", remarked The Daily Telegraph (29 September 1864), \\"has not only to be congratulated on the literary power and constructive skill with which he has worked out an exceedingly original idea, but he has also to be complimented on the cleverness with which he has embodied the effective character who is the hero of the story so happily imagined. Already well known as a dramatist. . . his histrionic achievements have, in this country at least, scarcely been considered as prominently associated with his name. . . . It would be difficult to name any comedian who could have more thoroughly realized the part. . . . The writing abounds in quaint turns of expression, some of them so daringly tipped with verbal flippancies that the serious situations are occasionally endangered by their utterance. . . .\\"Charle E. Pascoe, editor. The Dramatic List: a record of the performances of the living actors and actresses of the British stage. 1880. Later career In the dual role of actor and dramatist Craven scored again at the New Royalty on 17 October 1866, when Meg's Diversion opened, with himself as Jasper, the play running 330 nights. In 1873 he made his last provincial tour. His last play Too True, an historical drama, was produced at the Duke's, opening on 22 January 1876, and in this he made his final appearance on the stage. Many of his numerous plays were published by Duncombe, Lacy, and French. In 1876 he published a novel, The Old Tune. He was described in 1880: \\"Mr Craven is a genuine humorist, and contrives to blend the pathetic and comic sides of human nature in a manner that places him in the front rank of living actors. Since Mr Robson, whose style Mr Craven recalls, no English actor has equalled him in presenting beneath a droll exterior underlying touches of subtle pathos.\\" Craven died at his home in Clapham Park, on 13 April 1905, and his widow in Eastbourne on 20 March 1908. Both were buried in Norwood Cemetery. Two of their four children survived them, a daughter and a son, Tom Sidney Craven, who became a dramatist and actor.

Ventus Lau Wing-hong (; born 8 October 1993) is a Hong Kong politician. He is the convenor of the Shatin Community Network and the founding convenor of the Community Network Union, an alliance of the localist community groups in different districts. He came to media attention in the 2018 New Territories East by-election and his candidacy was disqualified by the returning officer for his previous pro-Hong Kong independence stance. Biography Lau first participated in politics on the invitation of his secondary school teacher Tam Hoi-pong to join the pro- democracy Neo Democrats in early 2014. He became a community officer of Pok Hong in Sha Tin. During his study at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he established the CUHK Local Society in 2014, aiming to disaffiliate the Chinese University Students' Union from the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) after the 2014 Hong Kong protests, in which the radical localists held the HKFS responsible for the failure of the movement. Lau quit Neo Democrats over the dispute of the disaffiliating campaign as the Neo Democrats supported the unity of the HKFS, as well as the \\"Liberation\\" street actions launched by the militant localists such as Civic Passion and Hong Kong Indigenous targeting mainland parallel traders. He formed the Shatin Community Network and continued his community services in the district. In the 2015 District Council elections, the group won a seat in Chung Tin. In August 2017, the Shatin Community Network co-founded the Community Network Union, an alliance of the six localist community groups in different districts, in which Lau became the convenor of the union. Lau declared his candidacy in the 2018 New Territories East by-election, a seat left vacant by localist Baggio Leung of Youngspiration over the oath-taking controversy. He claimed to have received Leung's endorsement and did not participate in the primary organised by the pro-democracy camp. He also declared that he no longer supports Hong Kong independence. He also resigned as the convenor of the Community Network Union and ran as an independent localist. After the end of the nomination period, Lau's candidacy was disqualified by the returning officer on the basis of his previous support for the idea of Hong Kong independence. Lau is an avid supporter of Chelsea F.C. and is often seen wearing a Chelsea jersey in public. On 19 January 2020, Lau led an rally at Chater Garden to call for electoral reforms and a boycott of the Chinese Communist Party. Violence erupted when protesters began assaulting police officers at the scene. In response, the police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. After speaking to reporters, Lau was arrested by authorities. The police spokesman said that the police liaison officers, who were injured, had maintained close contact with the organisers and said that Lau's characterisation of them as \\"suspected plainclothes\\" to the press is both \\"ridiculous and irresponsible\\" as the organisers had been acquainted with them. He further stated that Lau was arrested on the charges of obstructing police officers and violating the conditions outlined in the letter of no objection for the rally. The police also accused Lau of lying and inciting the crowd, because he claimed that he did not know the police liaison officers when they approached him during the ongoing rally, which would then lead to a crowd forming around them and the officers getting assaulted by the protesters. =Disqualification for 2020 Legco election= Lau sought to stand in the 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council Election but five weeks ahead of the designated poll date, on 30 July, the government stated that he was among a dozen pro-democracy candidates whose nominations were 'invalid', under an opaque process in which, nominally, civil servants - returning officers - assess whether, for instance, a candidate had objected to the enactment of the national security law, or was sincere in statements made disavowing separatism.

She was slow to mature and finished unplaced on her only start as a two-year-old in 1916. Her second season was dominated by her rivalry with the brilliantly fast filly Diadem. Sunny Jane was narrowly beaten by her rival in the 1000 Guineas but reversed the form over a longer distance to win the New Oaks. She won one other race but lost her form in the autumn and was retired from racing. As a broodmare she produced few winners but exerted an enduring influence through her daughter Miss Cavendish. Background Sunny Jane was a chestnut mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Sunstar who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1911 before his career was ended by injury. Sunny Jane's dam Maid of the Mist was a daughter of Sceptre and an influential broodmare in her own right, who also produced the 2000 Guineas winner Craig an Eran. Her other descendants have included Buchan, Commanche Run, Full Dress, Swiftfoot and One in a Million. Sunny Jane's racing career took place during World War I. Many racecourses were closed for the duration of the conflict and all five of traditional British Classic Races were run at Newmarket. Racing career=1916: two-year-old season= On her only run as a two-year-old, Sunny Jane finished last of the five runners in the Bretby Post Stakes at Newmarket. =1917: three-year-old season= Otto Madden, who rode Sunny Jane to win the Oaks On 4 May Sunny Jane was one of fourteen fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and before the race Alec Taylor said \\"that big, green filly of mine will run well\\". Diadem started 6/4 favourite and won as expected but Sunny Jane finished very strongly and was only half a length away in second place. Two months later she reportedly won a race at the Newmarket July meeting. The New Oaks was run in \\"wretched\\" weather on 2 August at Newmarket and attracted a field of eleven runners with Diadem starting the 7/4 favourite. Sunny Jane, ridden by Otto Madden, was second choice in the betting on 4/1 while the best of the other runners appeared to be Molly Desmond (Cheveley Park Stakes) and Hampshire Lily. Appearing to be well-suited by the heavy ground conditions, Sunny Jane took the lead just after the start and quickly opened up a lead of five lengths from Hampshire Lily and Diadem. Although the favourite closed the margin in the straight, Madden appeared to have left something in reserve and won by half a length from Diadem, with four lengths back to Moravia in third. Sunny Jane returned in autumn but ran poorly behind Quarryman in the Select Stakes. For her final appearance she was assigned a weight of 111 pounds in the Cambridgeshire Handicap and started at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16/1). With Madden in the saddle she tracked the leaders for most of the way but faded in the final stages and finished eleventh of the fourteen runners. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sunny Jane an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record After being retired from racing at the end of her second season, Sunny Jane became a broodmare for Lord Astor's stud. Her foals included: *Miss Cavendish, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1919, sired by Chaucer. Her female-line descendants have included Red Bullet, Noalcoholic and Tin Horse (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). *Bright Knight, bay colt, 1921, by Gay Crusader. Won five races.

Guitarist Julian Lage was 16 when this was recorded last September. He plays with astonishing maturity, knitting his lines into the group fabric with assurance and producing beautifully rounded solos. The title is apt, since the three main soloists represent different generations - Burton is 61 and pianist Makoto Ozone, an earlier Burton discovery, 43. It is good to hear Burton's vibraphone as part of a full quintet again, superb though his recent series of duet recordings have been. The most unselfish of leaders, he has the rare knack of making others play their best. Bassist James Genus and drummer Clarence Penn complete an ensemble that feels like a band, not just a collection of soloists.\\" Jerry Karp of SF Gate wrote, \\"Generations was recorded in September of last year with Ozone's regular rhythm section, bassist James Genus and drummer Clarence Penn. It's a rewarding collection in which Lage is revealed as a lithe, assured soloist and a talented composer. With the success of the \\"Generations\\" CD, Burton decided to put together a touring band, a decision facilitated by his retirement from Berklee School of Music in Boston after 33 years as a teacher and administrator, the last eight as executive vice president. The demands of that position had forced Burton to limit his live appearances primarily to duet performances with Ozone and another longtime collaborator, pianist Chick Corea. Before getting this ensemble on the road, Burton had gone a full seven years without a working band, a long time for a renowned group leader.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Gary Burton ‚Äì producer, vibraphone *James Genus ‚Äì bass *Julian Lage ‚Äì guitar *Makoto Ozone ‚Äì guest artist, piano *Clarence Penn ‚Äì drums ReferencesExternal links * Gary Burton albums 2004 albums ","title":"Generations (Gary Burton album)"},{"id":"56502068","text":"Matee Joseph Molefe is a South African sailor, currently serving as Master at Arms of the South African Navy, the highest enlisted post in the Navy.

It is 17 km from Chandabali. Aul is surrounded by the river Kharasrota and Brahmani on north and south respectively. To its east is Bhitarkanika National Park.  History  Aul has a clear history of establishment. This state is an outcome of the war between the Suryabanshis and Bhoi Banshis for the throne of Utkal at Cuttack. The ancestors of Aul raj family belonged to the last independent king Gajapati Mukunda Deb of Khurda. Gajapati Mukunda Deb ruled Odisha for a16 years long period from 1559 to 1567. His ancestors were considered as the feudal chiefs under the Gajapati and before acquiring the throne he worked there as the military chief. When Gajapati Maharaja Pratap Rudra Deb died in 1540 his minister played foul and started conspiracy against Kalua Deb Allias Ramachandra Deb-I and Kakharua Deb alias Purusottama Deb-II, the two legal sons of Gajapati maharaja. They were killed by him in 1541. After this incident, Minister Gobinda Bidyadhar acquired the throne at Cuttack and ruled till 1548. In the meantime Gobinda's nephew Raghubhanja Chhotray created chaos and attacked Gobinda to get the throne but could not succeeded. during this period Utkal was threatened by the Afghans of Bengal also. Chakra Pratap became the King from 1548 to 1557 and after Chakra Pratap, Raghuram Jena and Narasingha Jena ruled Utkal till 1559. In 1559 Mukundra Deb the Army chief of Gajapati ascended the throne and started his reigning in the name of Gajapati Tailenga Mukunda Deb as an heir of Chalukya Dynasty. He fought bravely against the Afghans and became popular by digging ponds and establishing new villages in different places of Puri. But the Minister named Janarddan Bidyadhar started treachery against him. Looking forward to the throne of Gajapati, Janardan made friendship with the Afghans and dethroned Mukunda Deva by killing him in the Gohira Tikiri Fort. Janarddan made his son investiture on the Gajapati's throne in the name of Ramachandra Deb-II. The wife of Mukunda Deb ran away with some of the king's followers and her two kids Rama Chandra Deb and Chakadi Bhramarbar. They approached the Mughal emperor at Delhi but couldn't succeeded. Mahanubhab Samarat Akbar sent two Hindu kings Todar Mall and Raja Maan Singh from his Durbar to Puri to look into the matter and have a solution. Janarddan tried much to establish Ramachandra Deb-II as the real Gajapati of Odisha. During the Chandan Yatra time Raja Maan Singh entitled Ramachandra Deb-II as the real Gajapati and offered him the Gaddi Prasad. On the other hand, he divided Utkal into three parts between Ramachandra Deb-II and other two brothers. Telenga Ramachandra Deva got Aul killa as his new Kingdom and Chhakadi Bhramarbar got Patia with Sarangagad fort. From that day Aul came to the front and prospered with Talenga Ramachandra Deb but always cheeked the Gajapati rule in Odisha. History says that they were always supported the external forces and tried to save their state and never cooperated with the Gajapati and his allies. Folk tale says something older in its story.

VanderHeyden House is a private house located at 926 West Main Street in Ionia, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History William H. VanderHeyden was born in 1836 in New York state, and began working in the brick industry. He moved to Ionia in 1864, where he married Emily Wood, the daughter of a brick maker. The next year, VanderHeyden purchased the Ionia brick works of Thomas Cornell, located near this location on Main Street. He expanded the business, winning the contract for the Ionia prison in 1875, and supplying bricks for many of the major homes, churches, and institutions in Ionia. By 1881, VanderHeyden had 45 employees. In 1879, VanderHeyden began work on this house, located directly adjacent to the property that at the time contained his brickyard. Although the builder is unknown, it is likely Captain Lucias Mills, who constructed other prominent houses in Ionia. The house was built using brick from VanderHeyden's yard, and was probably completed in early 1880. VanderHeyden sold his business to his son Fred in 1892, and continued to live in this house until his death in 1910. His wife Emily Wood VanderHeyden lived in it until her death in 1918, after which it passed to Fred VanderHeyden. He lived there until his death in 1952, and his widow Leaner VanderHeyden lived there until her death in 1963. It has been sold to multiple owners since. Description The VanderHeyden House is a two-story, symmetrical Italianate house constructed of ivory brick on a brick foundation sheathed in sandstone. It measures approximately 53 feet wide by 57 feet deep. The roof is a very low hipped design, with paired brackets supporting the eaves. It has an arched central entrance with two-story slant-sided bay windows to each side. The entrance is reached via wooden steps and a small wooden front porch. A timber- frame summer kitchen, one of two originally constructed, is attached to the rear of the house. According to tradition, the house was designed to be a duplex, with the intention that William and Emily VanderHeyden would occupy one side and their son Fred the other. Thus, on the interior, the center entry hall is flanked on each side by a parlor, dining room, and kitchen.

Jack Adcock, a 6-year- old child, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) on 18 February 2011. He died later that day, in part because of failings in his treatment. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, the junior doctor who treated him (under the supervision of duty consultant Dr Stephen O' Riordan) and a nurse, Isabel Amaro, were subsequently found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence. Both were subsequently struck off their respective professional registers, although Bawa-Garba had that decision overturned at appeal. There is an ongoing debate about the judgements against Bawa-Garba, partly around Bawa- Garba's personal culpability versus a context of systemic failures, and partly around the possible use of her reflective notes about her own practice as evidence. Background In 2010, the Medical Programme Board demonstrated almost a quarter of junior doctors dropped out of their NHS training in England after two years, and according to Unions, this was due to high workload. Denied by the department of Health, the BMA highlighted issues around the 'European Working Time Directive', shift patterns and understaffing. In 2016, a report issued by the Royal College of Physicians stressed \\"gaps in rotas, poor access to basic facilities and an ever-growing workload\\" for doctors in training. Despite feeling valued by their patients, 80% of these doctors reported excessive stress, either ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô or ‚Äòoften‚Äô. The report presented \\"a bleak picture of the conditions junior doctors currently face and the impact this is having on the patients they care for every day\\" and this was at \\"a harmful and unsustainable level\\". The problem of rota gaps and high levels of stress and its resulting effect on staff morale was also later emphasised at the 2017 BMA annual representative meeting. Timeline=Jack Adcock's death= On 18 February 2011, Jack Adcock, a 6-year-old boy, was referred to Leicester Royal Infirmary by his GP and admitted to a Children's Assessment Unit (CAU) at 10.20am. He had Down's syndrome and had an atrioventricular septal defect repaired at 4.5 months of age. He was on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. He presented with diarrhoea, vomiting and difficulty breathing. He was treated by Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, a specialist registrar (SpR) in year six of her postgraduate training (ST6) who had recently returned from maternity leave, was responsible for Jack's care. There was no senior consultant available, leaving her with sole responsibility for the whole CAU. Rota gaps had meant that Bawa-Garba had to cover the work of two other doctors and the on-call consultant was off-site in Warwick until 4.30pm that day, as he had not realised he was on-call. The morning hand-over between the incoming and outgoing teams was not completed due to a cardiac arrest call. Soon after admission, Bawa-Garba was alerted to Jack's condition by the nursing staff in CAU. After clinical examination, she found him to be dehydrated. A point-of- care venous blood gas revealed profound Metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 11.4 mmol/L and serum pH of 7.084. She diagnosed hypovolaemia from gastroenteritis, and administered Fluid replacement. Blood tests were sent off for laboratory analysis and a chest x-ray was requested. Bawa-Garba made a number of mistakes. She did not ask the on-call consultant to review Jack during an afternoon handover meeting at 4.30pm but did share abnormal laboratory results with him which he duly wrote down in his notebook. However, the consultant did not review the patient as he expected Bawa-Garba to \\"stress\\" these results to him. It was the first occasion they were working on the same shift. Although she deliberately omitted the patient's medicine enalapril on the drug chart she did not make it clear to the child's mother not to give it. Jack's mother subsequently gave it to the child that day at 7pm which led to the child's circulatory shock and death. This was the custom and practice in the hospital ‚Äì to permit parents to administer medicines in the hospital before being prescribed. Separately, a hospital-wide IT failure delayed test results being available until 4.30pm, despite the blood samples being sent at 11am. After phoning the laboratory, the team received the blood results showing CRP 97, Urea 17.1, Creatinine 252. The chest x-ray was undertaken an hour later at 12 noon, but was not reported by a radiologist. Bawa-Garba reviewed the x-ray image at 3pm, identified left upper lobe pneumonia, and prescribed intravenous cefuroxime. A repeat venous gas showed an improvement in the pH to 7.24. She reviewed Jack again in CAU, and saw that he had improved, and was sitting up and having a drink. The antibiotics were administered by the nursing staff at 4pm. The hospital Trust has acknowledged systemic failures contributed to events. Earlier that day, Bawa-Garba had admitted a terminally-ill child with a Do not resuscitate (DNAR) order to the side-room on the ward. This child was seen by another consultant during the day and discharged home in the afternoon. At 7pm, unbeknownst to Bawa-Garba, Jack was transferred from CAU to the same side-room on the ward. At around 8pm Jack began to deteriorate further, whereupon the on-call anaesthetic and paediatric registrars were fast-bleeped. Despite urgent treatment, he suffered cardiac arrest, CPR was commenced, and endotracheal intubation was carried out. Bawa-Garba attended the cardiac arrest call to the side-room believing it to be the terminally-ill child she admitted earlier with a DNAR order. She requested the team to stop resuscitation, but realised it to be the wrong patient within 2 minutes, and therefore recommenced CPR. Jack Adcock died of a cardiac arrest as a result of sepsis at 9.20pm. =Isabel Amaro cases= On 2 November 2015, Amaro was sentenced to a 3-year suspended jail sentence, having been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Her monitoring of Jack Adcock's condition and record-keeping were criticised. She was subsequently struck off the nursing register. =Hadiza Bawa-Garba cases= On 4 November 2015, Bawa-Garba was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in Nottingham Crown Court before a jury directed by Justice Andrew Nicol. The following month, she was given a 2-year suspended jail sentence. She appealed against the sentence, but the appeal was denied in December 2016. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service suspended Bawa-Garba for 12 months on 13 June 2017. The General Medical Council successfully appealed and Bawa-Garba was struck off on 25 January 2018. On 13 August 2018, Bawa-Garba won an appeal against being struck off, restoring the one-year suspension. Many healthcare professionals have raised concerns that Bawa-Garba is being unduly punished for failings in the system, notably the understaffing on the day. E-portfolio A series of high-profile medical scandals including the Bristol heart scandal and The Shipman Inquiry have influenced the proposals of revalidation, that is, the relicensing of doctors. The process was put on hold in 2005, when Dame Janet Smith criticised the plans as inadequate for identifying dangerous doctors. Revalidation was eventually implemented in late 2012. All doctors in the UK who wished to retain their licences to practise were informed that they were legally required to be revalidated every five years, based on a combination of demonstrating up-to-date knowledge by fulfilling CPD (continuous professional development) requirements of the Colleges and providing multisource feedback from patients and colleagues. This was designed to demonstrate they were up to date and fit to practise. Revalidation, according to BMA council GMC working party chair Brian Keighley 2012, was intended \\"to encourage quality in healthcare for patients through self-assessment, appraisal, continuing medical education and reflective practice.\\" He also stated that, \\"Over the past 10 years there has been confusion and tension between those who believe it is a screening tool for the incompetent, rather than a formative, educational process for the individual.\\" Since 2012, several concerns have been highlighted including in 2016, that for junior doctors \\"A large number of doctors are required to 'reflect' on Serious Untoward Incidents (SUIs) and Significant Event (SE) information as part of their specialty training. This could therefore create a significant administrative burden and result in cases of double jeopardy.\\" As is common for clinicians, Bawa-Garba kept reflective learning material in an e-portfolio as part of her training, including relating to the treatment of Jack Adcock. This material was used against her, although to what degree has been disputed. Her defence team have stated that her e-portfolio was not used in the 2018 case. The e-portfolio was not used explicitly in the 2015 case, but had been seen by expert witnesses. This has raised concerns that clinicians would be concerned to be honest in their own reflective learning. Reaction There is broad agreement that serious errors were made in Adcock's treatment. However, there has been a public debate about the background, context and pressures in which doctors work, and what happens when mistakes are made. The discussion centres on the issues of what systems and processes are in place that make mistakes less likely, and improve the chances of detecting them when they do occur. In the case of Dr Bawa-Garba, the NHS Trust in question has recognised there were systemic failures and pressures which contributed to the death of a patient. Dr Bawa-Garba had an excellent record until then. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, the then junior doctors' committee chair for the British Medical Association (BMA), argued that these systemic shortcomings were not adequately considered in the initial trial. At the end of January 2018, BMA council chair, Chaand Nagpaul, expressed concerns over doctors' fears and challenges in working under pressure in the NHS. He explained that without clarity from the General Medical Council (GMC) and others, issues surrounding recording reflective learning would result in defensive practice and failure to learn from experience. The BMA, in response, would, therefore, take actions to liaise with the GMC regarding the culture of fear, blame and system failings. Guidance to doctors on appraisal and recording reflection have also been included, as well as the launch of an online reporting system. The Doctors‚Äô Association UK, a campaign and lobbying group for Doctors and the NHS campaigned to raise awareness of system failures in the case. The GMC released a FAQ about the case, covering issues such as what doctors should do if concerned about staffing levels and reflective practice. The UK government introduced a series of reforms in response to the case, with a report released in June 2018.

History According to a legend in the Carte Portuensi, Pietro degli Onesti and the monks of Santa Maria in Porto (the Porto Fuori gate was then by the shoreline) were starting to say matins on Domenica in albis, the first Sunday after Easter, on 8 April 1100. Suddenly the apse of their church began to shine with light and - as it was too early for it to be sunlight - the monks went out onto the seaside to find its source. This proved to be the torches of two angels, who were escorting an image of the Virgin Mary which was floating on the water. The monks knelt to greet the Virgin Mary with prayers and songs and then exhorted Pietro to pick up the image. He did not feel himself worthy to do so and asked his fellow monks to go fetch it, but the image kept receding from them when they approached. Pietro then approached it with his arms stretched wide in welcome, at which the angels vanished and the image moved towards him. Historically, the image was probably made in a workshop in or near Constantinople and then brought from there to Italy either to escape iconoclasm or by a soldier on the First Crusade in the late 11th century. Pietro degli Onesti had definitely built a church dedicated to Mary in the 12th century, Santa Maria in Porto Fuori, mentioned by Dante as a \\"house of Our Lady on the Lido Adriano\\"Paradise, Canto XXI and destroyed in an air-raid on 6 November 1944. There he founded the \\"Sons and Daughters of Mary\\" to promote her cult on the anniversary of the image's legendary arrival and there he was buried. The relief remained in that church until 1503, when the monks moved to a new monastic church inside the city walls and installed the sculpture in the wall of a side chapel there. Pope Julius II stayed with the monks in 1511 and promoted the construction of another new church specifically to house the sculpture. That church was completed in 1570 and that year the work was solemnly translated to a side-chapel in its interior, where it still remains. 'Domenica in albis' is still celebrated annually as the Festival of the Greek Madonna, with a procession from the canal to the church Festa della Madonna Greca su Ravenna Turismo e Cultura.

Kerr (16 May 1945 ‚Äì 14 April 2008) was a British scholar of Christian-Muslim relations and world Christianity.  Biography  Kerr was born and raised in London to Agatha Jean, the daughter of Scottish missionaries in China (1921‚Äì1927) and Wilfred Kerr, a minister of the United Reformed Church. He conducted his studies in Arabic and Islamic Studies at SOAS, University of London (1963‚Äì1966), theology at Mansfield College, Oxford (1966‚Äì1968), and a PhD at St Antony's College, Oxford (1969‚Äì1973). His doctoral work on church-state relations in Lebanon was supervised by the scholar of Middle Eastern studies, Albert Hourani. Kerr worked for a short time as a journalist with the BBC World Service. He later took up a position teaching Islamic studies at the Selly Oak Colleges (now part of the University of Birmingham) in 1973, founding the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations in 1976. In 1987, he became the director of the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim studies at Hartford Seminary, before returning to the UK in 1996 to succeed Andrew Walls as professor of Christianity in the Non-Western World and as the director of the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World at the University of Edinburgh. In 2005, he took up a post at the University of Lund as a professor of Missiology and Ecumenics. Shortly after arriving in Sweden, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and died in 2008. His wife, Gun Holmstr√∂m, was a Finnish student in London when they first met in his father's church. They married in Finland in 1970 and had two children, Simeon and Anna.  Academic work  Kerr was an active administrator of a number of academic centres around the world. He was also known for his supervision of master's degree and PhD students from various parts of Africa and Asia, for most of whom English was not their first language. It is said that while he was the director for the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World, he had oversight of over 30 students at a given time. Stephen Goodwin comments: > David belonged to that set of scholars who saw their principle task to be > the education, support and development of their students; the student > subsequently would be the primary witness of the scholar's work, rather than > the contemporary tendency, under the pressure of publications-based funding, > to issue forth a stream of books. Although Kerr never produced an academic monograph himself, he was well respected for his scholarship as can be seen in the two-volume Festschrift produced in his honour: The appendix of his Festschrift lists significant articles in the areas of Christian-Muslim relations (including historical, theological, missiological, and regional studies), Middle Eastern Christianity, and Ecumenics.

During his time at Leeds 166 works were added to the collection, and Lambert edited and published an illustrated catalogue of the permanent collection. In 1931 Lambert was appointed director of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool in succession to A. G. Quigley. His tenure in Liverpool coincided with the acquisition, through several bequests, of a large extension to the existing exhibition space, giving the gallery six new rooms and bringing it to a size comparable with that of the Royal Academy in London. During the Second World War, Lambert arranged for the gallery to host lunchtime concerts on the lines pioneered by Myra Hess at the National Gallery in London. At the Walker, Lambert instituted a vigorous campaign of acquisitions. Until his time the gallery had owned few pre-Victorian paintings, and under him it acquired works by Gainsborough, Stubbs, Allan Ramsay and Zoffany, as well as works by twentieth-century artists including Sickert, Augustus John, Harold Gilman and Wilson Steer.Stevens, Timothy. \\"Mr Frank Lambert\\", The Times, 18 January 1973, p. 19 Lambert was well known as a lecturer, first at London University (1920‚Äì24) and from 1927 to 1931 at Leeds University.

The Basilica of Santa Maria in Porto was an important church in Ravenna, not far from Porta Nuova, on the via Roma, the north-south high street across the historic city centre. It houses the Greek Madonna. History In the first half of the 15th century, the Canons Regular of Santa Maria in Porto decided to built a new monastery next to their church of Santa Maria in Porto Fuori, but the Republic of Venice forced them to build it instead inside the city walls. They acquired a site by the Porta Nuova, in the southern half of the walled city, and demolished the houses on the site on 5 August 1496. The construction of the new monastery took thirty years and was only completed in 1509, though the canons moved in in 1503. They hosted pope Julius II in the new buildings in 1511 when he was travelling through Romagna - the same year he commissioned Bernardino Tavella to design the canons a new monastery church, but its construction only began in 1553. The roof of the central nave was completed in 1561, but the consecration of the whole church by only occurred on 8 October 1606 - it was presided over by Pietro Aldobrandini, camerlengo and archbishop of Ravenna. In 1710 a new high altar was installed and the facade was finally completed in 1784 to designs by Camillo Morigia. When the French invaded in 1797, the sanctuary was ransacked and the monks expelled, with the new Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan assigned a painting from the monastery by Ercole de Roberti \\"known as the Pala Portuense ... [showing] the Virgin and Child enthroned; Saints Anne, Elisabeth and Augustine and Blessed Pietro degli Onesti\\". The monastery was closed in 1798 and turned into a barracks, but it was restored in 1828, only for the monastery to close down for good in 1886 due to the laws on church assetsRegio decreto n. 3036 del 7 luglio 1866. It initially became a sweetshop before being turned over to the diocese as a parish church, taking the territory of the suppressed church of Santa Barbara in the city. Archbishop Vincenzo Moretti (1871-1879) and his successors promoted the restoration of the cult of the Greek Madonna in the church - on 21 April 1900, the 800th anniversary of its miraculous appearance, the sculpture was solemnly crowned. A bomb hit the choir on 24 July 1944 but the church was restored after the war. It was then promoted to minor basilica status in 1960 by pope John XXIII.Catholic.org Basilicas in Italy Part of the monastery buildings is occupied by monks of the Order of Saint Paul, the First Hermit, who also hold mass in the church, and part has housed the town's art gallery since 1972.

It was effectively wiped out by the construction of the Great Northern Warehouse and its ancillary buildings and roads in the 1890s. Known by several names over a period of years, including Aldeparc, Aldport, Over Alporde, Nether Alteport, Alporton, Hooperton and Upperton, the area was known as Alport or Alport Town around the time of its demise. First appearing in records at least as early as 1281 as a small park, a manorial survey of 1322 recorded Alport as comprising of heathland, pasture and meadow, with the River Medlock running through it. The district had been in the possession of Robert Grelle before passing into ownership of the La Warre family. In 1421, that family gave the land to the collegiate church in Manchester and in 1547, following the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII gave it to Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. The property was sold to Sir Randle Brereton by William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, in 1599 and then almost immediately sold again. For many years from 1602, it was in the possession of the Mosley family, who made use of a lodge there until its destruction during the English Civil War. By the time that the Great Northern Warehouse was constructed, Alport was \\"one of the lowest of Manchester slums\\", according to The Railway Magazine. The construction cleared those houses.

The assailant had escaped from the scene, but was arrested following a six-week manhunt. A protester was killed during a violent demonstration against searching for the suspect.  Incident  The attack occurred at a bus stop at the Ariel Junction, on Highway no. 5. An Israeli civilian was attacked by a man who stabbed him multiple times in the upper body. The perpetrator is said to have decided to kill a Jew during an argument with a policeman at a road junction near Ariel. He purchased two knives, each 27-centimeters-long, at a store in Nablus, and returned to the junction. There, he identified Rabbi Ben Gal as a Jew due to the fact that he was wearing a kippah. He attacked Ben Gal, and gave chase when Ben Gal ran away. The perpetrator was stopped from pursuing his victim when he was struck by a passing car.  Perpetrator  Abed al-Karim Adel Assi (alt. Abd al-Hakim Asi), a 19 year-old Israeli Arab resident of Jaffa, was behind the attack. His parents are separated. Assis' father lives in Nablus; his mother lives in Haifa. Assis is known to have resided at one time in a home for at-risk youth and to have received social services aid over the years.  Manhunt  During the manhunt for Assi, there were clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian rioters in the city of Nablus, and the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that a Palestinian man, Khaled Tayeh, died. The six-week manhunt ended with capture of the perpetrator. Legal proceedings Assi was indicted for murder and charged with selecting his victim because he was a Jew. He was convicted.

His work employs similarity transformations, which seek to decouple the ‚Äúlow-energy‚Äù degrees of freedom from the ‚Äúhigh-energy‚Äù degrees of freedom related to the renormalization group approaches in quantum field theory and the non- perturbative Hamiltonian renormalization methods. His work addresses the complex systems, such as the 16-nucleon problem, using realistic microscopic nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions where only the low-energy modes are retained as well as the finite diagonalization within the low-energy space to obtain the spectra leading to detailed comparisons with experiments. He also focuses on the development of a covariant Hamiltonian light-front approach called the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) which leads to the ab initio descriptions of the mesons and baryons.

His family wished him to become a notary, but he refused and instead concentrated on studying Italian and Latin literature. During this period he translated several works, including Girolamo Rossi's Historiarum Ravennatum libri decem and several classical works by Seneca, Plutarch and Theocritus. In May 1827 he became a grammar teacher in Ravenna's gymnasium. In 1841 he was granted an honorary diploma by the Accademia Ravegnana di Belle Arti thanks to his earlier writings. In October 1842 he won the competition to be chair of eloquence at the college on the retirement of Dionigi Strocchi from the post. This faced some opposition due to his involvement in the 1831 risings and so he only began teaching in January 1843. He was elected a member of the Roman Constituent Assembly of 1849 to represent Ravenna but following for his vote against the maintenance of the church's temporal power he was excluded from teaching and later jailed and exiled from the Papal States. He moved to live in Florence, where he spent five years before returning to Ravenna in 1855 thanks to the mediation of Giuseppe Pasolini. In 1859 he took part in the Romagna Assembly as deputy for Ravenna in the first college.

Early years Georges Louis V√©sier was born on 26 October 1858 in Paris. V√©sier's birth certificate in the Paris archives does not name his father and does not record the profession of his mother. He studied at the Lyc√©e Condorcet. He was engaged for his military service in the artillery in 1878, leaving with the rank of sub-officer. He then studied at the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, where he was a brilliant pupil. He graduated as an engineer in 1882. He married a Mlle Damour de Valbray. V√©sier was an engineer and then director at the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, a chemical products manufacturer, from 1882 to 1889. He became a director at the Forges d'Einville from 1889 to 1891, then managing director of the St√©arinerie de l'Etoile in Saint-Denis from 1891 to 1899. In 1895 V√©sier was appointed an administrator at the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux (CFM). He invented an apparatus for making superphosphates. President of Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux V√©sier tomb in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery On 2 May 1899, during a company crisis, V√©sier was appointed president and managing director (administrateur d√©l√©gu√©) at the CFM. Several directors had been dismissed due to financial setbacks. His was an example of promotion strictly on the basis of ability, which was not always the case among companies at the time. He proved to be a strong leader for this large enterprise over the next forty years. In 1899 he was appointed Vice President of the Chambre Syndicale des M√©taux, and became President in 1913. At the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18) V√©sier was charged by the relevant ministries with allocating important orders related to copper production for the national defense. The CFM's Ardennes factory was invaded during the war. After the war he was involved in questions of reconstruction, customs duties, agreements and social and labour issues. On 1 June 1920 V√©sier, Charles Marchal of the Banque Bauer/Marchal, and the Marquis Georges de Crequi- Montfort formed a group that bought shares in the Berndorf metal factory of Arthur Krupp, which mainly worked with bronze and nickel. On 15 March 1923 the group sold the shares to the √ñsterreichische Credit Anstalt. As of 1924 the CFM had a capital of 40 million francs. During discussions of the Union des industries et m√©tiers de la m√©tallurgie (UIMM) in 1934 Vesier as representative of the large metallurgical firms was in favour of complete freedom from state interference, while Maurice Olivier on behalf of the smaller metallurgical firms thought a small degree of state intervention was indispensable. Under V√©sier there was an unusual lack of graduates of the √âcole Polytechnique at CFM, apart from his second-in-command √âmile Demenge. V√©sier was president of the Chambre syndicale des M√©taux, vice-president of the Group of Paris Region Metallurgical and Mechanical Industries, president or administrator of various chemical or metallurgical companies.

Belding Memorial Library is a public library building located at 302 East Main Street in Belding, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History Hiram Belding and Mary Wilson Belding moved from Ashfield, Massachusetts to a farmstead in what is now Belding in 1855. With them was their 17-year-old son, Alvah N. Belding. They were soon joined by Alvah's brother Hiram. However, farming proved unprofitable, and in 1857 the Belding brothers began a trade selling silk thread to nearby settlers. By 1863 the brothers opened a retail shop in Chicago, and in 1864 began manufacturing their own thread. Although this first venture was rocky, Belding Brothers eventually had multiple manufacturing facilities throughout the country. In 1886 they built their first factory in Belding, the Richardson Silk Mill. This was followed by three others, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, silk manufacturing was the major part of Belding's economy. Concurrently, the town's population grew, from just over 500 people in 1880 to 1700 in 1890 and over 4000 in 1910. As Belding grew, so did its social clubs. The Ladies' Literary Exchange Club (Ladies' Literary Society) was formed in 1897. In 1913, the Club proposed the formation of a public library. The city approved the proposal, and library board was elected. The first public library opened in the city hall in 1915. In 1917, Alvah N. Belding donated $50,000 for the construction of a permanent library building. The Grand Rapids architectural firm of Frank P. Allen & Son was selected to design the library. The cornerstone was laid in the summer of 1917 and the building completed in 1918. However, the next few decades marked a downturn for Belding, as the silk industry gave way to synthetic fabrics. Alvah Belding died in 1925, and the silk mills were sold. As the Great Depression worsened, the mills were closed by 1932. During this time, the library was a social center for the city, used by the unemployed in Belding. Belding slowly emerged from the Depression, but was no longer the single-industry town it had been before. The old mills were demolished or repurposed. The library is the only building associated with Alvah N. Belding that remains in its original use. Description The library is a T-shaped, hip-roofed structure of Bedford limestone, with a shed-roofed extension at the rear. It is located on a sloping lot on the bank of the Flat River, so that the basement level can be accessed from the rear. The roof is clad with green Spanish tile. The main elevation has a prominent central entrance portico, consisting of a pediment supported by two columns. The entrance to the building is through an arched doorway, which is flanked by small single-sash six-over-six windows. The portico is flanked by large round arch windows capped by limestone headmoldings. The side facades are similar in style to the front. On the interior, there is a central lobby and desk, with two principal reading rooms, one on each side. A small cloakroom and stairs to the basement are beside the entry vestibule. The basement level contains a large hall and an assembly room, along with furnace and storage rooms.

Napoli : Stamperia della Regia Universit√†, 1967 he was the son of Giuseppe Baldacchini and Giovanna Vecchioni. His father died when he and his brother Michele were still very young and so the family moved to Naples, where he studied under the historian Carlo Troya, published political essays whilst still a student and finally ended up in exile after the failure of the 1820-1821 Revolution. He travelled extensively in Italy, Paris and Britain, reaching as far as London and becoming friends with politicians and intellectuals such as Carlo and Alessandro Poerio. He also took part in the debate between classicism and romanticism. Marcello Gigante, La cultura classica a Napoli nell'Ottocento, vol. I, p. 339, () He returned to Italy in 1837, where he backed Basilio Puoti's moves for purism in Italian literature. He wrote an essay in Puoti's honour, in which he sought to refute accusations of pedantry against Puoti, perhaps arising from a misunderstanding of Ultimo dei puristi by Francesco De Sanctis. S.

Napoli: Stamperia della Regia universit√†, 1867. In 1840 Baldacchini married the widowed mother of Ruggero Bonghi, who was greatly influenced by his new step- father. He became more and more involved in moderate liberal politics, founding several daily newspapers and in 1848 becoming a deputy to the Neapolitan Parliament for the college of Bari. There he headed a movement to put the constitution into immediate effect and became president of the Commission for Public Education. After Ferdinand II's coup and the replacement of Carlo Troya's government with that of Gennaro Spinelli di Cariati on 15 May 1848, Baldacchini left politics to devote himself to writing.

He currently serves on the Board of Directors for Datto, a data backup company he founded in 2007. By 2015 Datto had a \\"purported valuation of $1 billion,\\" making it the only \\"unicorn\\" company in the state of Connecticut. In December 2017 Datto was sold to Vista Equity Partners for around $1.5 billion and merged with Autotask, with McChord appointed CEO of the combined company. Named to Forbes‚Äô annual 30 Under 30 list of leaders in enterprise technology in 2015, he is a periodic author for publications such as Entrepreneur, Business Insider, and TechCrunch.  Early life and education  Austin McChord was born in 1985 in Connecticut, spending his youth in Newtown, Connecticut. He developed an interest in technology by the time he was in the third grade, when he relates that his school had him use a computer in class to compensate for his bad handwriting. He soon started learning to program, and began writing games to play during class. In middle school he constructed Rube Goldberg machines, and while attending Newtown High School, he joined the Technology Club as a freshman. The club was responsible for the television station broadcast to the town, which McChord worked to upgrade from scrolling text to live TV and sports replays. Collecting old television sets from the dump, McChord repaired them and built necessary components for live sports broadcasts, also building his school's video-editing software. Graduating high school in 2003, he initially studied electrical engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology. In 2009 he received a bachelor of science degree in bioinformatics.  Career  While still attending college, throughout the summer of 2007 the 21-year-old McChord began creating a data recovery and backup device in his father's office basement. He recollects having an idea \\"around building a mass device that replicated data to servers in the cloud, and I thought I could build it cheaper than anything that was on the market.‚Äù He fashioned his first product using Linksys parts, Lego pieces, hot glue, a soldering iron, and his own software. McChord went on to secure several patents. His products take frequent snapshots of clients' server content and then encrypt and transmit the data to backup servers, allowing for quick reboots if client servers are hacked or crash. He became the founding CEO of the company Datto to sell the product in 2007, with the product hitting the market in early 2008. Articles in blogs like Engadget and Gizmodo resulted in his first customers. He initially built a Linux-compatible backup device to market to a small number of resellers, before continuing to design new models. In early 2013 McChord turned down a $100 million buyout offer from an unnamed security firm. McChord, who was Datto's sole shareholder at the time, disliked the firm's plan to dismantle Datto and lay off employees. That fall McChord instead raised $25 million from General Catalyst Partners in growth capital, with Paul Sagan and Steve Herrod joining the Datto board as part of the deal. In December 2014 McChord acquired Backupify, a startup in Massachusetts which \\"backs up data in cloud apps such as Salesforce and Google Apps.\\" After a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) request and permission from the Hillary Clinton organization, in September 2015 McChord reportedly handed over up to 17,448 Clinton emails from Datto's servers to the FBI, as well as hardware. Datto received $75 million in funding from Technology Crossover Ventures in November 2015, with McChord saying he would use the funds to expand internationally. In 2015 he was named to Forbes‚Äô annual \\"30 Under 30\\" list of leaders in enterprise technology. Also that year, Connecticut Magazine named him among the \\"40 Under 40\\" of Connecticut state. In 2016 he won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year New York Award, after being a finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2014. He was also named a CRN Top 50 Midmarket IT Vendor Executive and a CRN Top 25 Innovator. With McChord continuing to serve as CEO out of Datto's headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, by 2015 Datto had a \\"purported valuation of $1 billion,\\" making it the only \\"unicorn\\" company in the state of Connecticut. In November 2017 it was reported that Datto had been sold to Vista Equity Partners for over $1.5 billion, and merged with Autotask the following month with McChord as CEO of the combined company. By December 2017, Datto employed 1,400 people. In October 2018, Austin announced he was stepping down as CEO of Datto.

Judgment=High Court= The High Court held that breach of contract claims were not justiciable in the courts. She appealed, and the University argued it was an abuse of process to bring a contract action with a six year limitation period, rather than judicial review with a three month limitation period. =Court of Appeal= Sedley LJ held that the claim should not be struck out. The relationship of a university to a fee paying student was contractual and courts could adjudicate upon them. Much had changed since O'Reilly v Mackman. However, questions of academic judgment had to be excluded as unsuitable for adjudication by the courts: Hines v Birkbeck College [1986] Ch 524 applied. A claim against a public body for breach of contract should not be struck out simply because judicial review might be more appropriate. The CPR 1998 enabled courts to prevent unfair exploitation of the longer time limits for civil suits. Some aspects of were 'unsuitable' for adjudication 'because these are issues of academic or pastoral judgment which the university is equipped to consider in breadth and depth, but on which any judgment of the courts would be jejune and inappropriate'. But there was a public law dimension for statutory HEIs and judicial review available. This, with a 3 month time limit was preferable to the 6 year limit for contract. Ward LJ agreed.

Originally destined by his parents for service in the church, like his older brother, he left theological studies because of his great interest in music. Given a scholarship by local nobility, he was able to formally study music, and then return to his hometown of Rudolstadt to perform and sing for twelve years. He spent three years in Hamburg before becoming an itinerant musician for seven years. His period of greatest income was as Kapellmeister in Braunschweig from 1832 to 1842. His career was then hampered by health difficulties, but he continued to compose, write musical treatises, and correspond with his fellow musicians until his death in 1869. He is most well-known for his vocal compositions, in particular, his works for students and for male voices. Early life and family Born Albert Gottlieb Methfessel in Stadtilm, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, on 6 October 1785, he was the son of Johann Christian Methfessel (1733‚Äì1816) and Sophia Marie (n√©e G√∂litz) Methfessel (1745‚Äì1818). Johann Christian was the local school teacher and Cantor in Stadtilm, while Sophia was the daughter of a Stadtilm church councilman. Albert's older brother Frederick Methfessel (1771‚Äì1807) also became a song composer of note. He had two sisters, one of whom, Marie (1839‚Äì1927), married a clergyman. Education From a very early age Albert showed a strong proclivity towards music. At the age of twelve, he wrote music for church services and these compositions were utilized by his father in his position of Cantor. His father fervently desired that he become a theologian, a desire that was heightened when older brother Friedrich, having attained a theological degree, abandoned his church career in pursuit of music. After his confirmation he was sent to the Rudolstadt grammar school. Here he was further attracted to music by the music of the prince's chapel, as well as the town choir, the latter of which he immediately joined and soon became its leader. As part of his functions for this position he composed cantatas and motets for the choir. However, upon completion of his Rudolstadt studies he followed his father's wishes and attended Leipzig University from 1807 to 1809, studying theology and classical literature. He did not give up music during this time, as he joined the Gewandhaus as a singer. Karoline Luise von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt became enamored with his voice, and proffered a scholarship which enabled Methfessel to abandon his theological studies and travel to Dresden, where he studied singing under Francesco Ceccarelli for nearly two years. Music career Plaque in Braunschweig commemorating a residence of Methfessel Methfessel returned to Rudolstadt in 1810, and spent the next twelve years as a Kammers√§nger and chamber musician at the Rudolstadt court. He became a particular friend of Louis Spohr, and along with three other friends they wandered together in 1818 from town to town towards the music festival at Mannheim. At Mannheim the \\"Travelers\\" were given welcome as celebrities, Spohr in particular. Spohr, then at the height of his fame, was offered a private apartment but turned it down so he could be with his friend Methfessel. Methfessel turned down a position in Prague as Kapellmeister, to which he had been recommended by Carl Maria von Weber, but 1822 saw him relocated to Hamburg as a director of music, where he also added teaching to his duties. From 1825 to 1832 he was a traveling musician whose income was insecure, until such time as he decided to settle into stable employment. Methfessel became Kapellmeister at Braunschweig in 1832, a position which he held until 1842. He married a singer, Louise Emilie Lehmann (1815‚Äì1854), in 1834. As Kapellmeister, one of his principal aims was to improve the quality of opera performances. In he also spent some of this time as a music teacher, including piano. He was forced to resign his position of Kapellmeister as he developed a severe hearing impairment. For the rest of his life Methfessel was self-employed as a composer, music critic, and writing on music theory, although he did receive a small pension from his previous court position. Later life His wife's death in May 1854 was particularly hard on him. His sight became very weak, but his mind remained at full strength despite the loss of use of both ears and eyes. He was the composer-in-residence at the 1861 Great German Song Festival in Nuremberg, and the 1865 German Signing Association in Dresden. The city of Braunschweig held a celebration day honoring his 80th birthday on 6 October 1864. The University of Jena took the occasion to confer a Doctor of Philosophy upon him. Age and financial difficulties eventually compelled Methfessel to leave Braunschweig in May 1868 and move to the village Heckenbeck of town Bad Gandersheim to live with his eldest daughter. That August he suffered a severe stroke, which removed his remaining hearing and sight, and left him with little ability to speak. However, by mid-September his heath improved such that he was again able to correspond with friends and even sing. Methfessel died on 23 March 1869 in Heckenbeck, and he was buried in the village cemetery. Assessment Portrait of Methfessel from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France With his solo voice and choral compositions, Methfessel was a key figure, not only of German folk singing in the 19th century, but of popular singing of the male voice in general. Many of his songs, in particular patriotic songs included in the five editions of \\"Allgemeinen Commers- und Liederbuch\\", were considered the model for student songs. His songs were described by his contemporaries as \\"fresh, singable, pleasant, and pleasing\\". The instrumental accompaniment for his songs have no independence to the melody, merely supplying simple harmonic support to the vocalist. He wrote several pieces of instrumental music, but the reputation of this output suffers in comparison to his vocal works. Methfessel was an \\"exquisite\\" singer, even preceding his formal training. In addition to his singing, he was a highly accomplished pianist and guitarist. He was a serious student of both theology and music, yet he was popular with his peers and society in general because of his personal integrity and his genial personality. Even upon the loss of his wife, his hearing, and his sight he was known for his cheerfulness. Works Many of Methfessel's songs were scored for guitar accompaniment. A large part of his output is for a solo vocalist. His part-songs for male voices remained in the German choral repertoire long after his death. His setting of \\"Stadt Hamburg an der Elbe Auen\\" became the national song of Hamburg. The settings for his vocal pieces range from the sacred to the comic. His most resounding works celebrate patriotism, friendship, freedom, and love. In addition to his vocal works, he wrote instrumental music for guitar, organ, piano, and glass harmonica. =Operas= *The Prince of Basra =Oratorios= *Das befreite Jerusalem References 1785 births 1869 deaths German classical composers German male classical composers German opera composers Male opera composers Oratorio composers People from Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt ","title":"Albert Methfessel"},{"id":"56503491","text":"Arjun Babuta (Hindi: ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•Å‡§® ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¨‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ) is an Indian sport shooter.

History  The first hack was reported on March 5, 2017 DirtyTooth Hack \\"It¬¥s only Rock'n Roll but I like it\\" and was officially presented to the public at the RootedCon conference RootedCon 2017 Youtube video \\"DirtyTooth Hack\\" in August 2017 in Madrid (Spain) and later at the ToorconToorcon 19 security conference 2017 \\"Put music & lose your contacts\\" Toorcon 19, Youtube video \\"DirtyTooth Hack\\" in San Diego. A research paper \\"DirtyTooth official paper \\" was published in 2017 using DirtyTooth with a real bluetooth speaker. In BlackHat Europe 2017 BlackHat Europe 2017 \\"DirtyPi\\" another demonstration was carried out, this time with a Raspberry Pi.  Overview  DirtyTooth is based on the way how Bluetooth notifies the user when it changes the profile. Some operating systems ask the user to accept the profile change but others like iOS, do not warn the user, changing automatically from one profile to another. Depending on the Bluetooth profile, it can provide different access levels to the services and the information located in the device. The DirtyTooth hack works impersonating the A2DP profile so that a user's iOS device connects, changing to a PBAP profile after pairing without having to enter a PIN if the device has Bluetooth version 2.1 or higher.  Affected hardware  The hack affected every iPhone from the 3G to the X, given that the smartphones were running any operating system below iOS version 11.2.  Impact  The data obtained exploiting the DirtyTooth hack may include personal and technical information about the user and the device.  Mitigation  This hack is resolved by updating the iPhone to iOS version 11.2 or higher.

Initially intended as an organ to promote the idea of Manchester Liberalism, a decline in its later years led to a takeover by a group who intended to use it to promote Liberal Unionism without actually being directly associated with the Liberal Unionist Party (LUP). That scheme soon failed due to severe financial problems, leading the LUP to take control of the newspaper for a brief period just before the 1892 general election campaign. It was then sold at a significant loss to a competitor, who also owned the Manchester Courier. The last edition was published in 1894 before it was absorbed by the Empire News.  Manchester Liberalism  The Manchester Examiner was established as a rival to the radical Manchester Times, which its proprietors considered not sufficiently representative of their Liberal viewpoints. The initial owners were Thomas Ballantyne, John Bright, Alexander Ireland, William McKerrow and Edward Watkin. The first edition of the Manchester Examiner was published on 10 January 1846. It absorbed the Manchester Times in 1848 and from June 1855, by now being run by George Wilson, the newspaper was published every morning at a price of one penny. The price was set to undercut rivals such as the Manchester Guardian and did so for some time until the rivals responded. Despite this competitive advantage, and in common with many other local newspapers, its influence in London was low and it suffered from difficulties in distribution. In 1856, Richard Cobden was inspired to become involved in establishing the Morning Star in London as an imitator of the Manchester Examiner that would disseminate the school of Manchester radicalism more widely, but it was of an inferior journalistic standard and had little political impact. The newspaper reached its point of greatest influence during the editorship of Henry Dunckley but by 1888 it was in severe decline. There had been criticism of Dunckley's habit of leaving work for home while the bulk of the day's news was still arriving at the offices, and also of the editorial wavering over the issue of Home Rule, in contrast to the strong support shown for it by the Manchester Guardian that had caused the latter to surge ahead of its competitor. Around the end of 1888, together with its companion newspaper, the Manchester Weekly Times, the Manchester Examiner was sold to the Manchester Press Company, a business headed by Sir Joseph Lee.  Liberal Unionism  The new owners, who were Liberal Unionists, believed that it could be a serious rival to the Tory- supporting Manchester Courier and the Gladstonian Liberalist Manchester Guardian. Despite originally believing that they could revive and run the newspaper without explicit support from the Liberal Unionist Party, by 1890 they were struggling to sustain the newspaper business for which they had paid around ¬£98,000. Various requests were made to Liberal grandees, such as Lord Derby, in search of further funds but those people were reluctant to throw good money in the direction of what they perceived to be a failing enterprise, even when the expertise of W. H. Smith was called upon to vouch that it could be made viable once more. Nonetheless, and by means that are uncertain, the party did in fact provide money and paid ¬£8900 in the run-up to the 1892 general election to take direct control. An attempt to arrest the decline was made by founding the Manchester Evening Times, which it was hoped would provide support for the morning newspaper in a manner similar to the successful introduction of the Manchester Evening News by the publishers of the Manchester Guardian. The venture proving to be unsuccessful, the evening newspaper was closed after 49 issues. The new owners also reduced the price of the Manchester Examiner to halfpence but that, too, did not resolve the problems. In November 1891, it was sold to a syndicate headed by Thomas Sowler, the owner of the Manchester Courier, for what Lord Wolmer at the time said was a \\"net sum recovered\\" of ¬£390. Wolmer, himself a Liberal Unionist, had been a vocal supporter of efforts to keep the newspaper going at least until the election, telling the party's leader, Lord Hartington, Publication ceased in 1894 when it was absorbed by the Empire News.

The library has a range of digital, online and physical material and collections that support the literary traditions of the northern isles. Aside from the main branch, the service also provides seven school libraries, two of which (in Baltasound and Mid Yell) are community libraries open to the public, and a mobile library. The Shetland Library service is provided by the Shetland Islands Council (SIC).  History  Shetland Library was established in 1916, two years before Scottish county libraries were constituted by law in 1918 and was part of a pilot scheme financed by Carnegie United Kingdom Trust to promote wider access to library privileges.http://www.shetland- library.gov.uk/documents/QuinquennialReport1964-1969.pdf Having resided in ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô accommodation from 1948 onwards which no longer provided adequate space for their expanding collections, the decision to relocate was taken. On 29 June 1966 the new library and museum building was opened on Lower Hillhead by the Lord Lieutenant R.H.W. Bruce. The building was shared with Shetland Museum and Archive, and was built in 1966 by the (then) Zetland County Council. The library relocated again in 2002 and has since been housed within the former St. Ringan's Church on Lower Hillhead in Lerwick. This United Free Church‚Äôs congregation had been dwindling throughout the 1970s and 1980s and there had been considerable thought given to what use the B-listed building could be put to. In fact, in the early 1980s the congregation of St. Ringan‚Äôs had proposed selling the building to Shetland Islands Council (SIC) for the purpose of turning it into a library. Plans were drawn up but the project came to nothing. The building was still sold to the SIC ‚Äì for the price of ¬£1.00 ‚Äì and after some renovations which were overseen by Historic Environment Scotland, St. Ringan‚Äôs became a library after all.http://www.shetland- library.gov.uk/documents/StRingansHistory.pdf The St. Ringan's United Free Church is a B-listed, Gothic grey sandstone building with a squat crenellated central tower. It was built by R.G. Sykes of Liverpool in 1885-86. At the time of the 2002 move, the church was renovated to include a mezzanine floor and rolling library shelving. Since the 2002 move, the old library building on Lower Hillhead has been used partially as a library store as well as housing services such as adult learning and social services. Fifty years after the original opening of this building, in 2005 plans were approved to renovate this building and bring it back into more active use.

Collections  The Shetland Library houses adult, young adult and children's fiction and non-fiction, eAudio, eBooks, eMagazines, online reference resources, large print material, reference material, DVDs and videos, talking books and music and their Shetland Collection. = Shetland Collections = In aid of promoting local literary traditions Shetland Library seeks to collect as many books published in or about Shetland as possible. The library also supplements this by publishing material on Shetland themselves, from local history to poetry. The Shetland Collection also includes Shetland periodicals, pamphlets and maps and microfilm of The Shetland Times and The Shetland News among other newspapers which go back into the 19th century.  Services and Community Outreach  Shetland Library takes part in the Scottish Government‚Äôs book gifting programme for under fives, Bookbug. The main branch in Lerwick runs book groups and there is a regular series of events including author talks and book launches (many of which tie into the Library‚Äôs Shetland Collection) as well as behind the scenes ‚ÄòBasement Browsing‚Äô and practical ICT help. In 2016, the library received a 3D printer due to a Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC) initiative which was funded by the Scottish Government. The Shetland Library hosts a local writers‚Äô showcase which features writing in the Shetland dialect. It works with Shetland ForWirds, an organisation which promotes the use of the Shetland dialect and, aside from having a range of material on the dialect for both adults and children, it also offers a dialect writing prize in its annual Young Writer competition. Mobile and housebound services are provided by a van, which travels around Shetland, including the islands of Yell, Unst, Whalsay, Trondra, Burra and Muckle Roe.

She was raised in Clarksburg, West Virginia, and graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1952. She received an associate degree from Ohio University in 1954. When she was thirty years old with young children at home, she began pursuing a painting career. At a time when the art world was favoring abstract expressionism and geometric expression, Plevin stayed true to her realistic style. Her need for technical information and experience with materials and tools of art, led her to classes at the Cooper School of Art, and the Cleveland Institute of Art. Thelma Frazier Winter and Moe Brooker were among her teachers. Plevin first received public recognition of her work in 1973 when she received the \\"Helen Logan Award\\" for Traditional Painting for her father-in-law's portrait in the Chautauqua National Juried Show. In 1985, she opened her own gallery in Chautauqua, New York. Over time, Plevin's content moved from portraits and still-life to gardens and landscapes. Her first museum curated show was held in 1993 at the Butler Institute of American Art, then located in Salem, Ohio. In 1999, Plevin received the Governor's Award from the Ohio Arts Council.

The Tomb of Dante () is an Italian neoclassical national monument built over the tomb of the poet Dante Alighieri. It is sited next to the Basilica of San Francesco in central Ravenna. The monument is surrounded by a \\"zona dantesca\\", in which visitors have to remain silent and respectful. The small garden to the monument's right originated as the monastic cloister but now only has a colonnade on one side. The garden is traditionally named after the Quadrarco di Braccioforte, where two people invoked the \\"strong arm\\" of Christ to guarantee their contract and therefore had the image of that arm painted on the arch Passerini, Giuseppe Lando, Minutaglia dantesche, Firenze, S. Lapi, 1911 [1897], ISBN non esistente. via Archive.org. History=Burial= Dante had spent his final years in Ravenna and died there in 1321. The day after his death his funeral was held in the cloister of the basilica, then a Franciscan monastery, the Church of San Pier Maggiore, later called Basilica di San Francesco. He was then buried outside the cloister by the roadside in an ancient Roman sarcophagus, in which he still rests. Bernardo Canaccio wrote a poetic Latin epitaph in 1366, which was inscribed on its lid: The sarcophagus was moved to the west side of the cloister by Bernardo Bembo, Venetian podest√† of Ravenna, at the end of the 15th century. A few years later Dante's hometown of Florence began making requests to have his remains returned. These had the support of two Medici popes, Pope Leo X and Pope Clement VII. The first request was supported by Michelangelo and in 1519 Leo granted Florence permission to move the sarcophagus there, but the Franciscans had enough time to make a hole in the wall and secretly move Dante's bones there. A Tuscan delegation duly arrived but found the sarcophagus empty. It was moved into the cloister and kept under guard. =17th to 19th centuries= Meanwhile the bones were put in a new box in 1677 by Antonio Sarti, prior of the monastery. The sarcophagus was restored under armed guard in 1692. The bones were put back in their original sarcophagus in 1781, the same year as the monument was completed, having been commissioned from the local architect Camillo Morigia by Luigi Valenti Gonzaga, the cardinal legate in Romagna. Square in plan and with a small cupola and dome, it covers the sarcophagus. Its interior is covered in marble and stucco. Morigia planned to have images of Virgil, Brunetto Latini, Cangrande della Scala and Guido Novello da Polenta in the pendentives of the dome's interior vault, but this plan was abandoned. Behind the sarcophagus is a 1483 bas-relief by Pietro Lombardo, which also stood in this position for most of the 15th century, showing Dante reading at a lectern. From the ceiling hangs an 18th century votive lamp, continually kept burning with olive oil from the Tuscan hills donated by Florence every 14 September, the anniversary of Dante's death. The monument's facade to the street is very simple, with a gate surmounted by Cardinal Gonzaga's archepiscopal coat of arms and the simple inscription \\"DANTIS POETAE SEPULCRUM\\" (\\"tomb of Dante the poet\\"). The friars hid the bones in the 1677 box again in 1810 during the French occupation to prevent them being confiscated. They hid the box under an old doorway between the Basilica of San Francesco and the Braccioforte Chapel before leaving the city.http://www.theflorentine.net/art- culture/2017/04/dante-ravenna-florence-battle-of-bones/, Dante‚Äôs Tomb Florence had not given up hope of having the remains removed from Ravenna, however, and in 1829 the city erected a cenotaph in Santa Croce Basilica, showing the poet seated in thought and a personification of Poetry weeping over the sarcophagus.

The box's location was forgotten until 27 May 1865, when it was found by a worker carrying out restoration work for the 600th anniversary of Dante's birth. A young student and later a respected notary, Matteucci Anastasio, noticed the words \\"OSSA DANTIS\\" (Dante's bones) on the box and saved it from being thrown into a common grave. (The full inscription stated: \\"Dantis ossa a me Frate Antonio Santi hic posita 1677, die 18 Octobris\\", written by Friar Santi.)http://www.theflorentine.net/art-culture/2017/04/dante-ravenna- florence-battle-of-bones/, Dante‚Äôs Tomb The almost complete skeleton bones were rearticulated and put on display to the public in a crystal coffin for a few months before being reburied under the monument in a walnut chest protected by a lead cover.

Giorgia Lupi is an Italian information designer and former co-founder of data-driven research and design firm Accurat Lupi calls herself an information designer because she gives people access to information and shaping the way that people access information. She is a co-author of Dear Data, a collection of hand drawn data visualizations, along with award-winning information designer Stefanie Posavec. Her work is also part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art. In 2019, she became a partner on Pentagram's New York team. Early life and education Lupi was born 1981 in Italy. When she was a little girl she would spend a significant amount of time collecting and organizing all kinds of items into folders: colored sheets of papers, tiny stones, pieces of textiles from her grandmothers buttons, sales receipts and so much more grew in her collection. She has said she took pleasure in organizing and categorizing her treasures based on their, sizes, color and dimensions. She has said that her childhood interest in numbers, cataloguing and classifying rules and systems explains the origin of her work and her desires to play with data. These interests have also included the scales of large cities and urban mapping projects, and representing information layers underlining an architecture project. She graduated from FAF in Ferrara, Italy, where she studied architecture. Lupi has her masters in architecture, but has not build any houses during her schooling career. An architect‚Äôs job is not to build buildings, but they design representations of buildings, images of building‚Äôs following a system of symbols that convey information about how to manufacture them. After graduating in 2006 She worked with two different interaction design firms in Italy, mostly working on interactive installations and mapping projects showing off difficult systems of knowledge. In 2011 she began her PHD in design at Milan Politecnico and started Accurat. In 2012 she moved to New York City where she lives now.  Career  In 2011, Lupi co- founded research and design firm Accurat, that combines design and data to create data visualizations, interfaces, and tools. Among their clients are Google, IBM, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Starbucks, United Nations, and the Museum of Modern Art.. Lupi‚Äôs influences for her work come from fascinations by geometrical feel and balance of abstract art compositions. Lupi's work has been influenced by data visualization and data art by Moritz Stefaner, Aaron Koblin and Jer Thorp. What drives Lupi in her career is the overlapping space between intuition and analysis, between beauty and logic, numbers and images. In 2014 Lupi began the Dear Data Project with Stefanie Posavec. Every week for one year Lupi and Posavec exchanged a \\"data drawing\\", a hand drawn data visualization that represented a part of their daily life, through the mail. In 2016 these postcards were compiled and published in a book called Dear Data. The following year the Museum of Modern Art added the original Dear Data postcards to the Museum's collection. In 2016, Giorgia Lupi published an article in Print Mag in which she introduced the concept of Data Humanism, which she further developed in her TED Talk. According to Lupi, data is just an instrument that people created to record and archive reality and is always a placeholder for something else. Lupi warns against simply focusing on numbers, technologies, and algorithms when working with data and suggests to instead focus on what data represents: people, stories, ideas. She argues people should reclaim a personal approach to how data is captured, analyzed, and displayed proving that subjectivity and context play a big role in understanding even big events and social changes. In 2019, Lupi joined Pentagram New York as a partner.

He became Jodrell Chair of Zoology at University College London in 1899, Chair of Protozoology at the University of London in 1906, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1911. Early life and education Edward Alfred Minchin was born in Weston-super-Mare on 26 February 1866 to Charles N. Minchin and Mary J. Lugard. He was educated at the United Services College, Westward Ho!, and the Bishop Cotton Boys School, Bangalore, India. Minchin graduated from Keble College, Oxford in 1890 with first class honours in zoology, and three years later was elected Fellow of Merton College. Career After graduating Minchin was awarded first the University Scholarship, and then the Radcliffe Travelling Fellowship which enabled him to travel through Europe. He worked at several different institutions including the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, Observatoire oc√©anologique de Banyuls-sur-Mer and Station biologique de Roscoff in France, and in the laboratories of Otto B√ºtschli and Richard Hertwig in Germany. On his return to Oxford he worked as demonstrator in comparative anatomy for Ray Lankester from 1890 to 1899. He was also appointed lecturer of biology at Guys Hospital from 1898 to 1899. In 1899 he succeeded Raphael Weldon as Jodrell Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and curator of what is now the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London (UCL). While Professor of Zoology at UCL Minchin worked on sponges, especially the development of spicules in calcareous sponges. He was the first to conclusively prove that sponges are not part of the Coelenterata. Lankester had long lobbied for a permanent Chair of Protozoology at the University of London and in 1906 the position was finally created, associated with the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. Minchin was appointed to the job which he continued to hold until his death in 1915. He was succeeded as the Jodrell Chair of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy by James Peter Hill. While working at the Lister Institute Minchin's research focus moved to parasitic protozoa, especially trypanosomes. In 1905 he visited Uganda to study sleeping sickness, and went on to study trypanosomes in humans and other animals including rats and birds. During his career he published around 40 papers, his first was on the stink glands of cockroaches, and was published in 1888 while he was still an undergraduate. fMinchin wrote seven articles for the 1911 edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica including the entry for Protozoa. In 1912 he published a general textbook entitled An Introduction to the Study of Protozoa. Minchin also contributed chapters to Lankester's Treatise on Zoology, for Volume I Introduction and Protozoa, and Volume II Porifera and Coelenterata published between 1900 and 1909. Minchin was encouraged to stand for election to the Royal Society by E Ray Lankester, who championed his work on tsetse flies to support the application. As well as becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society, Minchin was involved with several other learned societies, he was President of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1908 to 1912, Vice- President of the Zoological Society of London and Zoological Secretary of the Linnean Society. He won the Linnean Society's Trail Award in 1910. Death and legacy Minchin had always suffered from ill health. He died from tubercular pleurisy on 30 September 1915, aged 49. In his obituaries Minchin was praised for the quality of his work, the depth of his knowledge, and was described as the first great British protozoologist.

The magazine was edited by Jordan as the journal of the International Group and aimed at a readership in the left wing of the Labour Party. Coates and Jordan were Marxist members of the Labour Party connected to the New Left Review, to which Marxist journalist Claud Cockburn occasionally contributed. Their version of The Week, named after the earlier The Week that had been edited by Cockburn, provided a socialist critique of Harold Wilson's government, notably over its failure to oppose the Vietnam War.

Marxist journalist Claud Cockburn launched the first British publication known as The Week as a newsletter in the spring of 1933, after he had returned from reporting on Germany. It focused on the rise of fascism, in a style that anticipated Private Eye and won a wide readership, according to Cockburn's son.My Father, Claud Cockburn, the MI5 Suspect, from a June 2005 article on the CounterPunch website Jessica Mitford attributed the journal's influence to its use of undercover sources.A Fine Old Conflict, quoted in Spartacus Educational It ceased publication in 1941.Spartacus Educational In the late 1930s, The Week was highly critical of Neville Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement.Watt, Donald Cameron \\"Rumors as Evidence\\" pages 276-286 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 278. Cockburn maintained in the 1960s that much of the information in The Week was leaked to him by Sir Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office. At the same time, Cockburn claimed that MI5 was spying on him because of The Week; but the British historian D.C. Watt argued that it was more likely that, if anyone was spying on Cockburn, it was the Special Branch of Scotland Yard who were less experienced in this work than MI5. Cockburn was an opponent of appeasement before the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. In a 1937 article in The Week, Cockburn coined the term Cliveden set to describe what he alleged to be an upper-class pro-German group that exercised influence behind the scenes.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is owned and used by the city of Belding. History Belding was first settled in 1839, but remained a tiny hamlet until 1871, when a sawmill was built in town. The Detroit, Lansing and Lake Michigan Rail Road soon constructed a branch line to serve the village. This line carried only freight until 1888, when the Belding brothers opened their silk mills. A passenger depot was constructed on this site at about that time. In 1899, the Pere Marquette Railway was first organized from the merger of several railroads, including the railway that operated Belding line. In 1920, the Pere Marquette Railway replaced the original 1888 depot with this one, for reasons unknown. Passenger traffic through the depot was heavy initially, but Belding's silk industry collapsed in the 1930s. The railway discontinued passenger service to Belding in 1941. The building was used as storage facilities until the early 1990s. In 1994, the city of Belding rehabilitated the structure to serve as a meeting place for the city council and as a transit center. Description The Pere Marquette Railway Belding Depot is a long, single story reddish-brown brick building with a low hip roof with overhanging eaves. A central hip-roof projection on the track side originally held the ticket/telegrapher's office.

The Basilica of San Francesco is a major church in Ravenna. It was first built in 450 by Neo, bishop of Ravenna, and dedicated to saint Peter and Saint Paul. It was later also known as the Church of the Apostles (Chiesa degli Apostoli). In the second half of the 9th century and over the course of the 10th century, the earlier church was demolished to build a larger one and a tall bell tower, both of which survive. This new church was dedicated to Saint Peter and named San Pietro Maggiore. It was handed over to the Franciscans in 1261 and rededicated to Francis of Assisi.Wladimiro Bendazzi, Riccardo Ricci, Ravenna. Guida alla conoscenza della citt√†. Mosaici arte storia archeologia monumenti musei, Ravenna, Edizioni Sirri, 1992, . Dante Alighieri's funeral was held in the church in 1321 and his remains still rest next to the church in the Tomb of Dante. Between 1500 and 1700 the church was restored again and again and Baroque altars and decorations were added. The most important restoration was that under Pietro Zumaglini in 1793. Ravenna was occupied by the French soon afterwards and in 1810 the monastery was suppressed, with its buildings confiscated by the authorities but the church kept open as a parish church, which it still is. Between 1918 and 1921, in preparation for the 600th anniversary of Dante's birth, the church was radically restored, removing all the Baroque additions and returning it to something like its original style. A competition was held during the anniversary for a new scheme inside the church based on Dante's best known work, the Divine Comedy. Adolfo De Carolis won the competition but his sudden death prevented his scheme from being realised. The crypt was restored between 1926 and 1970 and in 1949 the Franciscans took on the church once again. Instead of the old monastery buildings, they moved into a building opposite the church and continued to run it as a parish church.

Developed in the 1820s around textile mills on the Mumford River, it was the largest industrial area in Sutton, with at least three mill complexes in operation. The district is centered on the junction of Main Street with Manchaug, Putnam Hill, and Whitins Roads. Description and history The area that became Manchaug Village was a rural agricultural area until the early 19th century. The only industry of note on the Mumford River was a trip hammer known to be in operation in 1795. In 1826, investors from Rhode Island began purchasing water privileges and land along the river for the development of textile mills. The stone mill standing at 9 Main Street was built in that, and was soon followed by housing for mill workers. The mills where significantly expanded in the 1850s and 1860s, when the dam impounding Stevens Pond was built, followed by new mills and a major tract of mill housing. The mills flourished until after World War I, and closed in 1921; the company-owned housing was sold off after bankruptcy in 1927. The historic district is centered on the junction of Main Street with Manchaug, Putnam Hill, and Whitins Roads. To the north, west, and south of this junction stand collections of mills, mill sites, and worker housing. The surviving mill buildings are typically large stone structures, while the housing units a multifamily wood-frame dwellings with gabled roofs. The mill operators also built some single-family housing, for supervisory and specialized technical personnel. The Greek Revival Manchaug Baptist Church is one of the buildings not related directly to the mills; it was built in 1842 to serve the workers.

Goals  The need to run these kind of conferences was identified during the drafting of the Summary report of the feasibility study and design of a network of centers of excellence in R&D; in cybersecurity,https://www.certsi.es/guias-y-estudios/estudios/estudio- de-viabilidad-oportunidad-y-diseno-de-una-red-de-centros-de-excelencia-en-idi- en-ciberseguridad with the consensus of participants. The strategic plan of the Spanish Network of Excellence on Cybersecurity Research included on its measure #17, the creation of national cybsersecurity R&D;+i conferences, intended to be the scientific meeting point in which both the Network of Excellence in particular and the research ecosystem in general could demonstrate their capacities, both in terms of knowledge and talent and in terms of research findings and their potential for transference to market. Equally, the measure #12 of the same study, proposed the design of an open call for proposals with mechanisms to evaluate and select candidates in order to grant awards and acknowledgement for research excellence.  Organizers  Each edition of the conferences is organised by the institution selected according to the procedure laid out in the regulation of the JNIC.https://www.incibe.es/sites/default/files/paginas/jnic/reglamentacionjnic.pdf An organising committee is named based on the regulations established for the JNIC, with the General chair of the committee being the representative from the organising institution who is responsible for the event. The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) in its mission to support research in cybersecurity for strengthening the cybersecurity sector, participates in the organization of this conference.  Transference Track  With the aim of converting the JNIC into a scientific forum of excellence in national cybersecurity field that promotes the innovation, for the first time in the 2017 edition, a complete Technological Transfer Programhttps://transferencia.jnic.es/ has been designed, that is an instrument to bring final users (companies, organisms, etc.) in contact with researchers in order to solve cybersecurity problems that are currently unresolved, formulated as scientific challenges. After the good reception and the success of participation in this new initiative by challengers and research teams, it is expected that the Program will continue to grow and the Transfer Track will be part of the JNIC in future editions.

Beslik's approach was at the heart of a general shift towards long-term and sustainable investments in Nordic countries. When the Dakota Access Pipeline project became the target of protests in early 2016, Beslik visited the affected Sioux tribe and concluded that Native Americans had not been properly consulted. He quarantined three of Nordea's partner companies for the six months needed for a risk assessment and consultations with Greenpeace, which described it as a breakthrough. Beslik announced that Nordea would pull out if the companies breached the tribe's rights. When they refused to comply, Nordea's fund managers were instructed not to invest in them any more. This stance affected other investors: the ING Group sold its stake in the pipeline in March 2016. Beslik showed that the Swedish fast fashion giant H&M; could double the salary of its workers in Bangladesh, raising it to a living wage, by increasing its clothing prices by half a dollar. He has researched the scarcity of cobalt as a key raw material for electric car batteries. Visiting the Democratic Republic of the Congo on several occasions, he examined how local cobalt producers handled the resulting long-term risks such as human rights violations. When a massive breach of personal data of Facebook users was revealed in March 2018, Beslik announced that Nordea would \\"quarantine\\" Facebook investments, meaning it would no longer authorize the buying of Facebook stock in its sustainable investment unit. Awards Beslik won the Swedish Banking Profile of the Year award in 2016. In 2013, he received the H. M. The King's Medal, 8th size with the ribbon of the Order of the Seraphim from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden for outstanding contributions within Swedish environmental and sustainability theory. He was chosen as a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in 2011. Stars Fund, the Nordea sustainable fund launched by Beslik in 2011, was chosen as Sweden's best overall equity fund in 2017. It was the first sustainable fund to receive the award. In 2020, Beslik was ranked the world's most influential person within green finance.

One of the founders of the People's National Movement, she served as vice chair of the party and was the first woman to hold the office. When Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from Britain, she ran as a candidate, becoming the first woman elected in the newly established House of Representatives. She became the first woman cabinet Minister and later ambassador for the country. Posthumously, she was awarded the Trinity Cross, the highest honor of the country. Early life Isabel Ursula Cadogan was born on 24 July 1911 in San Fernando, on the island of Trinidad, in the British West Indies's colony of Trinidad and Tobago, to Maude and Thomas Cadogan. Her father was a tailor and soon after her birth, the family moved to Princes Town, where Cadogan grew up and attended the Government Primary School. Having little access to secondary education, common in the country at that time, Cadogan continued her education under the pupil-teacher system. While working as a student teacher, she began organizing student clubs arranging concerts, dances and speaking events. She founded a boys‚Äô club in Princes Town and worked on numerous charitable events to assist the underprivileged in her local parish, through St. Stephen's Anglican Church. Career Upon completing her schooling, Cadogan began working at the dairy of the Petit Morne Sugar Estate in Sainte Madeleine, working her way up to a clerk in the plantation sugar office. After some years, she moved to Port of Spain and began working at Perreira's and Company, as an inventory control clerk. She enrolled in courses at the University of Puerto Rico and then on 24 September 1938, married George McGregor Teshea. Teshea joined the Teachers' Education and Cultural Association (TECA), the People's Education Movement (PEM) and the Federation of Women's Institutes (FWI), becoming politically active. These women's organizations were focused on education and providing social services throughout the island. In 1955, during the push for decolonization, the PEM was reorganized as the women's arm of the People's National Movement. Going door-to-door Teshea and other women campaigned and organized fundraisers for candidates. She also worked as a researcher, reading transcripts of speeches of British Parliamentarians, known as the Hansard, to assist in the writing of speeches. Teshea had developed a network of ties with various village councils and became a valuable asset to Eric Williams in the formation of the People's National Movement (PNM). Teshea was appointed as one of the vice chairs of the party in 1956 and simultaneously became chair of the PNM Women's League, as well as the FWI. Her marriage dissolved in 1959, and Teshea devoted more time to politics, coming to national prominence. When Trinidad and Tobago gained their independence and elections were held in 1961, Teshea, frustrated that women's roles had theretofore been limited to supporting male candidates, ran for a seat in the Port of Spain East District, winning by more than 7,000 votes. Her election to the newly established House of Representatives, made her the first woman to serve in that capacity in Trinidad. Appointed as parliamentary secretary, she served in the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development. The department maintained responsibility for ensuring for health, water, and sanitation needs of the island. In 1963, Williams, who was Prime Minister, reorganized his cabinet, making Teshea the Minister of Health and Housing, the first woman to serve as a Minister in the country. During her tenure she put a number of initiatives in place to improve educational opportunity; provide cultural, home economic and moral training; and promote racial harmony between the Afro- and Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian communities. She toured the major African states with Prime Minister Williams in 1964 and was featured in a women's magazine in Senegal during the trip. Two years later, when her Ministry was split into the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Housing, Teshea was assigned responsibility for both portfolios, which she served until 1970. She shared responsibilities in the Ministry of Health with Dr. Leonard Comissiong, the island's chief medical officer. Teshea was appointed as ambassador to Ethiopia in 1969, the first woman ambassador from Trinidad. Zambia was added to her ambassadorial duties and she served the posts until 1971, when she returned to Trinidad and was appointed as Minister of Education and Culture, serving in that office through 1975. In 1974, she was appointed as high commissioner of Guyana and retained that post, though made Trinidad and Tobago's ambassador to Senegal in 1975. While serving in Guyana, she participated in the regional negotiations which led to the establishment of Caricom. She served through 1976 in Senegal and through 1977 in Guayana before retiring from public life. Death and legacy Teshea died 14 April 1981 and was posthumously awarded four months after her death Trinidad's highest honor, the Trinity Cross. Teshea did not consider herself a woman's rights activist, though she often worked to improve the status of women. She described herself as \\"not a feminist by definition, but a believer in ‚Ä¶'human rights'\\".

He was also a pioneer in the field of vaccination and he created a vaccine for sheep pox.http://www.artandmedicine.com/biblio/authors/Plaut.html Life He was born in Leipzig, the son of the banker Gustav Plaut and his wife Bertha, n√©e Oppenheimer. His school was the humanistic Thomas School in Leipzig . After leaving school he studied veterinary medicine and medicine at the University of Leipzig and the University of Jena. He received his doctorate with a dissertation titled \\"The organised contagium of sheeppoxhttp://www.artandmedicine.com/biblio/authors/Plaut.html (variola ovina in Latin) and the mitigation thereof in Toussaint's manner\\" (see note about Toussaint and Pasteur). He made contributions to the aetiology of the poxviridae family of viruses through his work using the method of Toussaint to produce attenuated vaccine that was therapeutically active against sheepox. His work was under the supervision of his mentor, Friedrich Anton Z√ºrn (1835-1900),https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Haan:Friedrich_Anton_Z√ºrn who was professor emeritus of veterinarian sciences at Leipzig University. In 1888 he married and moved to Hamburg, here he published papers and established laboratories firstly at his home in Eppendorf and later at his residence in central Hamburg street at Neue Rabenstrasse 21. From 1888 he probably had some connection with Eppendorf Hospital but had to wait until Brauer's appointment as director of the hospital to have a small research institute of his own. In 1896 he described a special form of tonsillitis, now called Plaut-Vincent angina, two years later Vincent of the Pasteur Institute described the same condition. It became known as Vincent‚Äôs angina in the english speaking world probably as a reflection of anti-German feelings after World War 1. Both names are in current use. In addition, he worked on microbial research of Streptococcus mucous , Streptothrix and Actinomyces and he continued his research in veterinary medicine. In 1888 he became founding director of a small Institute for Mircrobiological Research at what is now the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). After the 1st World War he taught ex- servicemen at the nascent University of Hamburg. It became a full university in 1919 and he was honoured with the title of Extraordinary Professor. Before he died he left instructions to his cleaner Frau Lemke to safely destroy his microbial cultures including possibly cholera cultures. In his honour, the Hugo Carl Plaut Medal is awarded annually to botanists, doctors and scientists. Family He married Adele n√©e Brach (1867-1953) in 1888. Their daughters Carrie (1892-1976) and Rahel Plaut (1894-1993) both became doctors, the latter was married to the historian Hans Liebeschuetz.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The building has been converted into apartments, known as the Portland School Apartments. History Portland was first settled around 1833, and the first schoolhouse built in the area was in 1842. This building was replaced in 1860 with a new two-story structure. Soon, Portland entered a boom time, and a second school was added in 1870, located on the property where this High School is now located. A third school was added in 1873. In 1881, the district constructed their first high school, again located near the site of this building. The 1881 high school was expanded in 1903, but was completely destroyed by fire in 1918. The school board immediately began the process of replacing the high school, hiring architect Thomas E. White of Lansing to design a new school. In 1919 they hired Charles Hoertz & Son as contractor, and construction started on the new building, located on the same lot as the previous high school. The new Portland High School was completed in 1920 for a cost of $110,000. At the time, the school served the entire student body of the district, from kindergarten to high school. By 1935, the building was full, and the school board hired Lansing architects Warren S. Holmes Company to design an addition. The addition was constructed with help from the Works Progress Administration, and finished in 1936. By 1953, the school was again overcrowded, and an elementary school was constructed to relieve some of the pressure. A second elementary school was constructed a few years later, but the High School was still housing a substantial number of elementary students. In 1962/63, a new high school was constructed, and the 1919 High School was renovated to house a Junior High School, along with some grades of elementary school. In 1991, another hew high school was constructed, and the 1962 high school renovated into a middle school, and the 1919 High School was sold. In 1992 the building was converted into twenty-nine apartments. However, in the mid-2000s, the owners ceased maintenance, and in 2008 the building was condemned and foreclosed. In 2013, plans were made to renovate the building. Work on renovations began in 2016, and the building has been converted into the Portland School Apartments. Description The Portland High School is a 2-1/2 story building of red brick, with limestone accent bands. The main building has corridors in the shape of a C, with the auditorium in the center. A 1936 addition on one corner is a three-story red brick building with an L-shaped corridor plan. The main facade is symmetrical with a gymnasium and auditorium section in the center, flanked by two entrance bays. Classroom sections are on each end.

From 1971 to 1989, the publication was the paper of record for the world of working artists. Its circulation reached a high of 40,000 subscribers. Originally a four-page newsletter called The Art Workers Newsletter, the publication grew into a monthly newspaper called Artworkers News. During the early 1980s, FCA changed the publication's name to Art&Artists; and made it a bi-monthly. The initial staff included Mary Albanese, Pamela Bickford, Bernie Brown (columnist for the New York Post), Sandy Relis, Alex Gross (who in protest to AT&T; wore part of a dial telephone around his neck), Peter Leggieri and Jacqueline Skiles. Subsequently, Robert Perlmutter (of Pearl Paint), Daniel Grant, Eva Cockcroft, Larry Rosing, Steven s‚ÄôSoreff and illustrator Barbara Nessim joined. Rather than reviewing shows, AWN/A&A; focused on topics central to the lives of working artists in the 1970s and ‚Äô80s, (and continuing today): artist housing, health hazards, business practices, health insurance, women‚Äôs issues, issues affecting artists of color, law and the arts and censorship were impacting the daily life of artists. The publication featured, as well, contemporary theories and philosophies in the arts, general news articles, a select number of book reviews, commentaries, editorials and special issues. The special issues were wide-ranging, reflecting the times and the interests of the editors and writers who were involved at a given time over the course of its existence. Special issues included: ‚ÄúArt Against Apartheid.‚Äù ‚ÄúArt and Sports,‚Äù ‚ÄúAre There Too Many Artists?,‚Äù ‚ÄúTilted Arc by Richard Serra,‚Äù \\"Museums,\\" and ‚ÄúArtists Against US Intervention in Central America.‚Äù Art Workers News was also the publication of record for the Comprehensive Employment Act (CETA) Artists Program in New York City and documented the work of artists in all media associated with the project.Judd Tully, a writer for the CETA Artists Project, has digitized some of his AWN articles (retrieved 1/30/18) AWN/A&A; produced 160 issues over eighteen years. Editors and production staff were volunteers; writers and photographers were paid (minimally) in accordance with the belief that people, including artists and writers, deserved to be paid for their work. The journal newspaper gave voice to many artists, critics and journalists who were prominent in the cultural milieu of its time, as well as to younger professionals at the start of their careers.

She was a committed anti-fascist and a survivor of the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp.  Life = Provenance and early years = Leopoldine Elisabeth \\"Lisl\\" Morawitz was born into a conventionally catholic family in Vienna, the youngest of her parents' four children. August Morawitz, her father, worked on the market (\\"der Naschmarkt\\"). Her mother, Leopoldine Morawitz, is identified as a housewife. Lisl attended school locally between 1930 and 1938 and then went on to embark on a commercial apprenticeship at an office supplies shop. Illegal political activities in which she was engaged used up a lot of paper and paint, and it was later reported that she had stolen significant quantities of supplies. \\"The owner did not bother with the business anyhow.\\" = Political activism under the Nazi r√©gime = On 12 March 1938 Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany. Although this involved German troops marching into Austria, there were many across much of the political spectrum who welcomed the development, both for historical reasons and because Austria's economic performance had been dire for many years, whereas Chancellor Hitler appeared to have found a way, at least in Germany, to beat the ongoing run-off from the Great Depression. News reports distributed and viewed round the world showed Austrians greeting the columns of German troops with flowers. Morawitz had grown up in the Social Democratic milieu of the city's working class quarters, however, and within the family there was little sympathy with the fashion for populist extremism. Lisl was a member of the Young Communists and now found herself pitched into resistance activism by what had become a one-party dictatorship. Activities included supporting imprisoned Communists and their left-behind dependent family members. She helped to create an information network and was able on at least one occasion to warn vulnerable comrades such as Ernst Goldblum, a Jewish friend of her elder sister, about an impending raid by Nazi paramilitaries. She and her siblings made themselves available to escort \\"illegals\\" from the station to apartments where they might hide: typically that involved people living without having registered their residence at a town hall because they were keen to avoid being located by the authorities, generally for reasons of politics and / or race. She collected money for the Soviet sponsored \\"Red Aid\\" communist welfare organisation. She also joined her brothers on leafleting tours round the district, in a campaign reminiscent of the White Rose movement in Munich. They would make their way to the square where trams parked up overnight and, early in the morning, climb up and place piles of political leaflets on the roofs of the trams. The leaflets would then be slowly distributed by the wind as the trams moved off. As the children became bolder they took to sneaking up behind people in the street and slipping leaflets into their back pockets or open-topped bags. Sometimes they were spotted at the last minute by Nazi thugs and Gestapo, but she was \\"a natural gymnast and quick\\". And she \\"knew the Vienna alleys and cellars\\". (\\"Ich war schnell, Turnerin, und kannte die Wiener Gassen und Keller\\". It was not just the Morawitz children who backed the anti-fascist resistance. August Morawitz, Elisabeth's father, hid the duplicating machine they used for preparing their leaflets; and she later found out that her mother, too, had been collecting money for \\"Red Aid\\" and, indeed, making their apartment available for \\"illegal meetings\\". However, August Morawitz died in March 1941. = Arrest, interrogation and trial = Sources differ as to whether Lisl Morawitz was arrested by the Gestapo on 3 July 1941 or 2 August 1941. She was arrested at work, and when she was taken to the Gestapo station she came across her mother who had also been arrested. She discovered much later, having been able to research the matter, that her mother had been \\"even more active\\" in the resistance movement than she had been, but when the arrests took place she was evidently, like the Gestapo, unaware of the extent of her mother's involvement. Mother and daughter shared the first name \\"Leopoldine, and there was talk of her mother having been arrested in error. Neither woman was released, however. At the Gestapo centre she underwent a series of interrogation sessions after which she was taken into investigative custody. In a gesture of solidarity which she would always recall with pleasure, her cell-mate's aunt, who was a professional dress maker from Hamburg, made her a beautiful dress for her court appearance. She only saw the aunt for the first time on the day when the trial opened, but evidently the dress fitted. The charge was a familiar one: \\"Preparing high treason and undermining military strength\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat und Wehrkraftzersetzung\\"). Her membership of the (by now illegal) Young Communists was a particular issue for the authorities. She was sentenced to a three years jail term. Her mother, presumably convicted on the basis of similar charges, received a four year jail term,. = Prison = Following conviction Lisl Morawitz and her brother Bruno were sent to the Stadelheim Street Penitentiary in Munich. Their mother was sent to a prison at Aichach, also in Bavaria. In Munich she was allocated to a gang of women workers and sent to work each day at a former Agfa factory which had been converted to produce munitions for the war which had broken out in September 1939. As was usual under these circumstances, they worked without wages. Morawitz teamed up with \\"Sepp ... whose brother was being held in Dachau\\" and \\"Anni ... whose fiance was classified as half-Jewish, as a result of which the two of them were not permitted to marry\\" to form a little illegal activist cell. They were working alongside civilians who had been conscripted to work in the munitions plant, so were not completely isolated from the world outside. The work, which was intricate and in which she became highly proficient, involved assembling bullets for use in aircraft mounted guns. Cell members assembled the bullets so that a few of the bullets would be unusable. The \\"tip\\" on what to do came from \\"outside\\". They always placed the \\"bad bullet\\" in a different position when packing the bullets into their boxes, and the potentially very risky acts of sabotage went undiscovered. Bruno Morawitz, Lisl's brother, faced further charges. He was convicted by the special \\"People's Court\\" on 23 September and was condemned to death. He was killed by guillotine in Vienna on 25 February 1944. He was 21. = Ravensbr√ºck = Lisl's own prison term came to an end in September 1943. However, the war was no longer going well and the authorities were becoming ever more concerned about political dissidents on the home front. Still aged only 17, she was on the receiving end of a \\"Protective Custody Order\\", by which she was identified as one of the \\"Unimprovables\\" (\\"Unverbesserliche\\") and deported to the Women's Concentration Camp at Ravensbr√ºck, a short distance to the north of Berlin. Fellow inmates, she recalled in an interview many decades later, included \\"criminals, lesbians, political detainees and the so-called 'work-shy'\\". The train took them not to the village station but to a nearby rail depot from where they were marched the final few kilometers to the camp. At the concentration camp she was reunited with people she had known inside the prison in Vienna when she was first arrested back in 1941, including one called \\"Friedel Sedlacek\\" who had heard of her impending arrival \\"on the grapevine\\" even before Lisl's reached the camp, and who was able to warn her against \\"asocial\\" inmates next to whom she should avoid falling asleep. Her first work at Ravensbr√ºck involved shovelling sand. It was heavy work which she would not have been expected to survive for long, but by this time the guards, increasingly demoralised by the anticipated military defeat of the Nazi state, had transferred much of the daily administration of the camp to trusted inmates. Friends saw to it that she was transferred to \\"administrative\\" work. She fell ill with typhoid in March 1945 but recovered. Many did not. Despite the overwhelming inhumanity of the situation at Ravensbr√ºck, glimmers of something better occasionally turned up. On 24 December 1944 the inmates organised a Christmas party for the children. Children from birth up to the age of 12 were normally kept in concentration camps with their mothers, and there were several hundred at Ravensbr√ºck. Tables were covered in white cloth and sandwiches - one per child - prepared. The camp guards joined in the preparations. There were toys for the children. Some of the women had got hold of materials to make dolls. Lisl made a \\"Kasperle\\" doll. Suddenly she heard a guard behind her, and was overcome with a sense of dread over what would follow. But Mr Bunte, the guard, asked simply, \\"Would you make a doll like that for me?\\". She did not want to, but fellow inmates persuaded her to relent: \\"Just make that doll for him, and if necessary make him two dolls\\". The prisoner made a doll for the guard and a few days later she received an apple by way of thanks. Many years later Mr.Bunte's past evidently caught up with him and he made contact again, asking that she should testify that he had sent her an apple. \\"So conditions cannot have been as bad as all that\\", was the message he was hoping to infer from the incident. Thinking back, even to the Christmas party, would be hard, in later years: not many of the children survived their time in the camp. As the Soviet forces drew near from the east there was a desperate scramble to clear the concentration camps. On 28 April 1928 Ravensbr√ºck was evacuated. The inmates were sent out on a Death March towards the west. Their paramilitary guards grew careless or themselves ran away: Lisl was able to escape with two comrades and hide out in the forest for three days and three nights. As the war ended, at the start of May 1945 Ravensbr√ºck was liberated by the Red army and Lisl returned to help look after survivors who had been too sick to be sent out from the camp earlier. At the beginning of July 1945 Lisl Morawitz returned home to Vienna. The political situation was unstable and unpredictable, but over the next few years the country was divided into four military zones of occupation. The area surrounding Vienna comprised the Soviet occupation zone, although the city itself was separately divided, with roughly 60% under Soviet occupation and smaller occupation zones administered by US, British and French occupation forces. The defining backdrop was one of austerity leading, on occasion, to acute hunger, as supplies were diverted from the Soviet zone to the Soviet Union. Sources are largely silent about Lisl Morawitz's activities during this time, but in or before 1950 she married Max Bair. = Max Bair alias Martin J√§ger = Max Bair was a \\"farm boy\\" from the Tirol (\\"ein Tiroler Bauernbub\\"). His mother died when he was 3: his father died when he was 16. In 1937, after selling the three cows he had acquired when he inherited the heavily indebted family farm in 1935, he paid of the creditors and left to fight against the Francoists in the Spanish Civil War. He had spent most of the subsequent war years in the Soviet Union, but in October 1944 the Soviets conveyed him to Slovenia where he commanded the first battalion the Austrian Independence Movement. After the liberation of Innsbruck he made his way to the Tirol as regional first secretary of the Austrian Communist Party. However, his friends from ten years earlier were mostly disappeared or dead. The Red army was widely blamed for blocking food supplies and reports of a sustained plague of rapes by Soviet soldiers in occupied Vienna meant that there was very little support for the communists in the Tirol, as election results in November 1945 confirmed. Seeing no future for himself in his homeland Bair sold the family farm for 35,000 Schillings and moved to the Soviet occupation zone in Vienna to complete his schooling. He remained politically engaged and in April 1949, at this point using the name \\"Josef Maier\\", he was arrested in Salzburg by the US intelligence services. Suspected of involvement in deporting civilian workers to the Soviet zone, he was detained in a secret location. However, Bair retained some level of public profile, since his Spanish Civil War experiences had caught the imagination of the journalist-write Egon Kisch who had written about him in a short biographical volume under the title \\"Die drei K√ºhe\\" (\\"The three cows\\"): the first edition, back in 1938, had run to 10,000 copies. Twelve years later he managed to smuggle out a message from his secret place of incarceration, and with the help of comrades to trigger a media storm, following which in March 1950 he was released \\"on bail\\" by the Americans (but without ever having undergone a trial), after eleven months. To the north, most of Germany had also been divided into military zones of occupation. It appeared that the Soviets had given very much more attention to planning for this outcome in Germany, and although not everything had gone to plan, in October 1949 the region administered as the Soviet occupation zone in Germany had been relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1950 Max Bair changed his name to Martin J√§ger, and with his new wife, Elisabeth relocated to the German Democratic Republic where they would build a new life together. = A new life in a new Germany = Like her husband, Elisabeth J√§ger had survived the war without ever having completed her schooling. In the German Democratic Republic she now studied for and passed her German School final exams (Abitur). She then enrolled at Leipzig University where she graduated successfully from what as becoming the university's well regarded Faculty of Journalism. During this period the couple's daughters, Brigitta and Claudia, were born in 1951 and 1954. During the years that followed she worked for the East German radio service, for various newspaper publishing houses, and at the Ministry for Culture and the Arts. Her work placed her in a position of some privilege. Unlike most of her fellow citizens she was able to travel abroad, visiting Cuba, Cyprus, Finland and, much more frequently and usually accompanied by her husband, Austria. Since the 1950s Lisl J√§ger has involved herself with the \\"Lagergemeinschaft Ravensbr√ºck\\" (\\"Ravensbr√ºck Camp Association\\"). In presentations to school children and young people she testifies to her own experiences and warns against the consequences of right-wing extremism, fascism and totalitarianism. = Personal life = Martin J√§ger died in 2000. Elisabeth J√§ger had two daughters, as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren. She died in June 2019 at the age of 94.Elisabeth J√§ger : Traueranzeige  Honour  On 13 June 2008 Minister-President Platzeck conferred on Elisabeth J√§ger the Order of Merit of Brandenburg in recognition of her consistent public opposition to political amnesia in respect of the twentieth century dictatorships.

Summary Alex Chilton's musical career began in October 1966, when the 15-year-old joined a band that would later be named The Box Tops. As their lead vocalist, he recorded \\"The Letter\\", one of the biggest hits of 1967. In 1971, Chilton formed the influential power pop group Big Star, a critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful band known for its harmonies and jangling guitars. Chilton's subsequent solo career on small labels drew an intense following among indie and alternative rock musicians. According to The New York Times, George-Warren's biography addresses questions about Chilton's \\"wildly different incarnations as a cult figure\\" whose life and career confounded even the people closest to him, resulting in \\"a fascinating story, but also an exceptionally knotty one\\". Author Holly George-Warren is the author of over a dozen books, including New York Times bestsellers The Road to Woodstock (with Michael Lang), Public Cowboy #1: The Life and Times of Gene Autry, and Punk 365.

Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon (MFO) demonstrated the suitability of single-phase alternating current at high voltage for long-distance railway operation with the Seebach-Wettingen single-phase alternating current test facility. For this purpose, MFO electrified the 19.45-kilometre-long Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) route from Seebach to Wettingen at its own expense with single-phase alternating current at 15,000 volts. Overview By 1900, the use of direct current (DC), usually at 500-600 volts, to supply power to electric trams and trains was well-established. Examples include Trams in Budapest (from 1887) and the Liverpool Overhead Railway (opened 1893). This was satisfactory for urban systems but, for long distance railways, a higher voltage was desirable to reduce energy losses. The 106 km Valtellina line in Italy was electrified using three-phase alternating current (AC) at 3,000 volts and opened on 4 September 1902. The system was designed by K√°lm√°n Kand√≥ and a team from the Ganz Works in Budapest. This was an advance but the three- phase system had disadvantages. Two overhead wires were required and this limited the voltage because the two wires had to cross at junctions. The use of single-phase AC, which only required one overhead wire, had been held back by the lack of suitable motors. The three-phase system used induction motors but the single-phase universal motor was in its infancy and problems were experienced with overheating and excessive sparking at the commutator. The Seebach-Wettingen trial used two different approaches. The first was to supply power at the standard 50 Hz mains frequency and use a rotary converter on the locomotive to convert this to direct current for the traction motors. The second was to use a low-frequency (15 Hz) supply to power universal motors on the locomotive. It was expected that the low frequency would minimise the overheating and sparking problems and this was the case. The test track was operated between 1905 and 1909 and provided evidence for the construction of overhead line and pantograph types to allow operation with a voltage of 15,000. Because of the high voltage, the wooden passenger coaches were provided with a device that protected the passengers from the consequences of contact with drooping overhead lines. Experimental operation at 50 hertz At the suggestion of MFO, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) agreed on 31 May 1902 to set up a trial operation on the Seebach-Wettingen route with single- phase alternating current at 15,000 volts. This system allowed a higher overhead line voltage than usual at this time, and thus a greater distance between substations, and a single-wire instead of a two-wire overhead line as was then successfully in use on three-phase routes in northern Italy. Since the traction motors could not yet be operated with single-phase alternating current with the technology of the time, MFO first built the four-axle pilot locomotive No. 1 with a rotary converter, which converted the overhead line voltage of 15,000 volts AC into direct current for the operation of the traction motors. The rotary converter system was patented, patent US754565 of 1904. Before the start of operation of the test track, the electrification of the approximately 700-metre-long connecting track of their factory premises with the station at Seebach was completed by MFO and tests with the converter locomotive were started. On 16 January 1905, the regular test runs between Seebach and Affoltern were started with a timetable set by SBB. For these trips, until 10 November 1905, the converter locomotive No. 1 was used. Experimental operation at 15 hertz Operation with the converter locomotive did not continue for long. In the summer of 1904, MFO introduced locomotive number 2, with alternating current motors, but using 15 instead of 50 hertz. Thanks to the reduced frequency, as well as the compensation winding, the single-phase series motor developed by Hans Behn-Eschenburg at MFO had similar characteristics to a direct-current motor and sparking at the commutator was greatly reduced. The 50 Hertz overhead line led to strong interference on the telephone line from Zurich to Baden, which ran parallel to the railway line. The reduction in frequency to 15 hertz led to an improvement. Modification of the motors and the use of twisted pair wiring on the telephone line caused the interference to cease. Despite the different electrical equipment, the mechanical parts of locomotives numbers 1 and 2 were similar, except that number 2 had two driver's cabs. The power supply was changed on 11 November 1905 from 50 Hertz to 15 Hertz and locomotive No. 2 took over the train operation. So that locomotive No. 1 could continue to be used, it was rebuilt with 15 Hz AC motors, to match No. 2, and the converter was removed. The two locomotives became the model for the low-frequency AC powered locomotives, as they were built until the 1970s, in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. On 2 June 1906, the trial operation was extended to Regensdorf. For financial reasons, MFO accepted a proposal from Siemens-Schuckert to participate in further experiments with a third locomotive. Locomotive No. 3 was delivered on 3 August 1907 but failed on 7 October 1907 with overheating problems. Power generation Interior view of the converter station At Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, a small steam power plant was built to supply the energy needed for the Seebach-Wettingen line. The tubular boilers in which the steam was produced for the turbine had a heating surface of 300 m¬≤ each and an output of 18,000 kilograms of steam per hour. The three-stage steam turbine ran at 3000 revolutions per minute. The three-phase current produced had a voltage of 230 volts and a frequency of 50 hertz to match the factory's existing power plant. The converter station with AC buffering was housed in a special building, which was located near the steam turbine plant. The two converter groups had a capacity of 700 and 500 kilowatts. The 375 element backup battery had a capacity of 592 ampere hours. Next to the engine room was the transformer room, in which four transformers increased the voltage of the single-phase current from 700 to 15,000 volts. The exact layout of the converter station is unclear but the presence of the batteries suggests that it used a back-to-back connection. The three phase AC would have been converted to DC and then the DC converted to single phase AC. Catenary Overhead line (MFO system) at Seebach Overhead lines, MFO system and Siemens- Schuckert system running parallel ;Seebach to Regensdorf On the section from Seebach to Regensdorf, MFO tested an overhead line at the side of the track. The current collector mounted on the roof of the locomotive, the so-called tail, consisted of a slightly curved tube with a replaceable contact strip. The tube was pressed by spring force against the contact wire and could describe more than a half circle, so that contact with the contact wire from above, from the side or from below was possible. Normally, the wire was located at the side of the track. The system proved unreliable at speeds above 50 km/hour. ;Regensdorf to Wettingen On the section from Regensdorf to Wettingen, Siemens-Schuckert installed a standard Catenary and, on 1 December 1907, operation was started. At the exit from Regensdorf station, the overhead line ran approximately 400 metres parallel to the side-mounted line so that the current collector could be changed while driving. The contact wire was located six metres above the rail above the middle of the track. To test a low contact wire height in tunnels and underpasses, the contact wire between Otelfingen and W√ºrenlos was laid only 4.8 meters above the rails over a distance of one kilometre. The pantograph (current collector) was usable for both directions of travel and could follow height differences of the overhead line even at high speeds. The lifting of the pantograph was done by compressed air. After the trial From 4 July 1909, the Seebach-Wettingen line was again operated with steam traction and the overhead lines were dismantled. Because it was a secondary line with easy gradients, SBB did not consider it economical for electric operation. Locomotives No. 1 and 2 were stored and, in 1919, were sold to SBB. Locomotive No. 3 returned to Berlin and was converted there into a DC locomotive. In 1944 it was destroyed in a bombing raid. Despite the cessation of operations, the attempt was successful. In 1907, MFO supplied railcars BCFe 4/4 to the Maggiatalbahn for operation at 5000 volts, 20 Hertz. In July 1910, the Bernese Alpine Railway Company Bern - L√∂tschberg - Simplon (BLS) opened its Spiez-Frutigen test track electrified at 15,000 Volts, 15 Hertz. In 1913, Prussia, Bavaria and Baden jointly defined a traction current frequency of 16‚Öî Hz, whereupon the BLS also adopted this frequency. On 15 July 1913, the BLS started continuous operation between Spiez and Brig using 15,000 volts, 16‚Öî Hertz. In the same year, the Rhaetian Railway opened its Engadine line using 16‚Öî Hertz, but with a voltage of 11,000 volts. From 7 July 1919, the SBB operated their feeder line from Bern-Thun to L√∂tschbergstrecke using 15,000 volts, 16 ‚Öî Hertz and from 28 May 1922, the trains on the Gotthard route of the SBB began to operate electrically.

Background Brown was a reserve outside-left at Everton during the inaugural Football League season. He was signed between 1887 and 1888 from Stanley (Liverpool) Football Club. He played six times mainly at outside-left. League & Everton Debut Outside-left was one of three problem forward positions for Everton and probably explains why Everton struggled to score goals in the 1888-1889 season. James Costley was injured after a 6-2 home win over Derby County. On 3 November 1888 Bolton Wanderers were the visitors to Anfield and this match gave William Brown a chance for his League and Everton debut. He played outside-left. Very little happened in the first half and the scores were level, 0-0 at half-time. Early in the second-half Brown crowned his debut with a debut League goal putting a shot past Bolton goalkeeper, Sam Gillam. Bolton played well after Brown scored and quickly equalised. Brown formed a good partnership with Everton inside-left, Edgar Chadwick but it was Nick Ross who scored the winner with a powerful shot. Everton pressed for a third but it was Bolton who came closest to scoring. Everton hung on to the lead in a close fought match. Final score - Everton 2-1 Bolton Wanderers. Playing Record Brown's debut saw him play three successive matches at left-wing for Everton but he was left out/injured after a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor, Burnley. Brown returned to the team on 22 December 1888 for the trip to Deepdale, Preston but he now played centre-forward (another of Everton' problem positions) in place of R Morris. He played two games at centre-forward but was replaced by Jack Angus. His final appearance was for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 9 February 1889. He replaced Jack Angus at outside- left. Everton lost 2-1. Everton finished eighth in the League Scoring 35 goals, the second lowest tally by a League team in that first season.

Chaumpeneys was the first Abbot of Vale Royal following its relocation from Darnhall, where he had been elected at Michaelmas in either 1274 or 1275. Chaumpeneys was said by the Abbeys' chronicler to have been a stalwart in the defence of his house, overthrowing those enemies who tried to attack. Wool exports were, like its predecessor at Darnhall, the Abbey's main source of income. In 1283, Chaumpeneys acknowledged receipt of 53s 6d 8p as an advance on the Abbey's eventual delivery of twelve sacks of collecta. This was paid to Chaumpeneys on the proviso that it was put to the \\"common profit of his house.\\" Chaumpenays had been trading with this particular merchant‚ÄîJohn Wermond of Cambrai‚Äîsince at least 1275 when he sold twelve sacks of wool to Wermond in London for eighty shillings. In 1277 the foundation stone was laid at the altar of the new abbey. Edward, the Queen, their son Alphonso and members of the King's retinue then laid subsequent stones, after which Chaumpeneys performed a celebratory Mass. Chaumpeneys is known to have attended the Parliament held at Westminster from May‚ÄîJune 1278, and to have signed off a quitclaim to the King on 26 May. He also spent curiously long periods in attendance upon the King at court, such as between 1285 and 1286. In April 1283 he was in Conwy, assisting in the transference of the Abbey to Aberconwy. It is likely as a result of his presence there that he took part in the King's \\"momentous progress\\" from York, the following year, joining the entourage at Tarporley.

One term connected to school security is school safety, which is defined as the sheltering of students from violence and bullying, as well as exposure to harmful elements such as drugs and gang activity. Along with other public places, schools are at risk for invasion from outside as well as attacks from students or faculty because of the high traffic of potential assailants and availability of victims. Safety threats= Shootings and bombings = In the US, as of January 2018, since 1990, at least 240 school shootings have occurred. School shootings have a 450% increase in the past 30 years, in which there were only 53 shootings. School bombings are less frequent at 22 in 2016, but according to the US Bomb Data Center, education related buildings are over twice as threatened than any other target. Over 74% of education related threats were middle schools, junior high, and high schools. Due to safety threats, during the 2013-2014 school year, reports say 93% of public schools lock or monitor doors and gates as a means of controlling access to the school; this is an 18% increase since the turn of the century. Metal detectors are installed at many entrances of public schools to deter students from bringing weaponry into schools.\\"Government Gives Go-Ahead to Metal Detectors in Schools.\\" Education (14637073), no. 243, 20 Oct. 2006, pp. 3-5. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=22828299&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site = Vandalism = Vandalism is often a problem for schools as they are an easy target. What constitutes vandalism varies among reports, which makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the extent of vandalism. However, vandalism generally refers to damage to property (graffiti, etc.) and break-ins. The Center for Problem Oriented Policing categorizes break-ins as being of three types: nuisance break-ins, where a break-in is done just for the sake of it; professional break-ins, with an intent of theft; and malicious break-ins, where damage is caused out of spite. Solutions for preventing vandalism include providing after-school and evening programs to engage youth that are loitering, improving lighting, adding security patrols, and education for students on anti-vandalism.  Policies on vandalism in New Zealand  see Education in New Zealand The New Zealand government provides funding to public schools to repair vandalism. This funding comes from different sources depending on the type of damage that occurs. Two important guidelines regarding vandalism repair are that it must \\"be carried out immediately, and comply with Ministry standards.\\" = Bullying = The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the U.S., 20.8% of students ages 12‚Äì18 experienced bullying at school in 2014-15. Prevention for bullying by parents, teachers, and other adults includes talking to students about bullying, modeling treating others with kindness, and helping students get involved in something they are passionate about. Helping students understand the importance of bully reporting and learning ways to stop others from bullying can also be effective. Between the ages of 11-15, in most countries around the world, boys are bullied more than girls. As reported by Young People's Health in Context, in Israel, almost twice as many boys ages 13‚Äì15 are bullied than girls; Belgium has a difference nearly as high. On average, bullying tends to peak at age 13. Lithuania experiences the highest level of bullying, with an average of 63.6% for girls between the ages of 11-15, and an average of 65% for boys between the ages of 11-15. Sweden experiences the lowest level of bullying, with an average of 14.7% for girls between 11-15, and an average of 15.3% for boys between 11-15. Security measures The National School Boards Association states that ensuring safety and security in schools is the primary responsibility of every school district. =School Resource Officers= As we see a rise in gang and drug activity among other safety threats in our schools, there has been an increase in police presence on school campuses. In 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics reported that 43% of schools in the U.S. had School Resource Officers on their campuses anywhere from once a week to full-time hours of operation. School Resource Officers, also known as S.R.O.s, are often responsible for teaching a gang-resistance program to students. Commonly referred to as G.R.E.A.T., this program has been shown to be 39% effective at deterring at-risk youth from becoming involved in gangs or gang-related activity. Some of these S.R.O.s are accompanied by dogs that are fully trained in drug and bomb sniffing. Although this could be potentially helpful, especially in the drug culture among students, it is a highly controversial issue as some believe it may go against Fourth (and possibly Fifth) Amendment Rights. =Surveillance= Digital surveillance technology monitoring students, staff and visitors is currently being employed in schools around the world. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, by 2014, an average of 80% of secondary schools in the United States had installed security cameras. This was over 300% increase compared to the 19% of public educational facilities using video surveillance in 2000. Closed-circuit television (CCTV), the most common type of video monitoring system, is also reported to be prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia.Nemorin, Selena (2017) Post-panoptic pedagogies: the changing nature of school surveillance in the digital age. Surveillance and Society, 15 (2). pp. 239-253. ISSN 1477-7487 A possible 85-90% of secondary schools used CCTV in Britain, according to statistics claimed by Big Brother Watch. Cameras are also installed on buses to prevent violence, theft, illegal activity by students or drivers and as evidence against motorists who violate traffic laws regarding school buses. In the new wave of technology, cyber-security has also become a concern as schools try to balance advancement in students' technological skills with the possibilities for misuse of borrowed devices and breeches in school servers. = Identification cards and badges = Student and faculty ID cards and/or badges are a possible way of improving school security. They allow school authorities to know immediately that the people carrying or wearing ID belong there. Student ID cards can help monitor student location. Tracking students through tracking chips has been controversial, however, due to concerns for privacy. Identification badges for visitors to schools can alleviate confusion about who someone unfamiliar is, and school authorities will easily be able to determine where the visitor is authorized to go. These visitor badges can also be a way to conduct background checks before the visitor enters a school campus. ID Cards in Poland Students in schools abroad (outside of Poland) who are learning Polish language or academic subjects taught in Polish are eligible for Polish student ID cards. These cards provide benefits including transportation, museum, and national park discounts while visiting Poland. Students under age 18 can get one of these IDs, as well as teachers of Polish. They are valid for one school year. = School Security Fencing = Within the United Kingdom and around the globe one of the first line of school security measures is the application of a fencing system to control ingress and egress from the school grounds. Recently guidance by NaCTSO is that 'Screen from View' fencing should be adopted on school perimeters to combat the terrorist threat to schools. Within the UK, one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of School Security Fencing is CLD Fencing Systems. For over 20 years their range of school fencing has provided protection for hundreds of thousands of pupils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. OFSTED now includes the perimeter school fencing and physical access control as an area of review in the safeguarding of pupils on school grounds.

She showed promise as a two-year-old in 1914 when she won once and finished second three times from six starts. In the following year she finished unplaced in the 1000 Guineas but then recorded an upset win in the Oaks Stakes. She was placed in wartime substitute races for the Ascot Gold Cup and the St Leger and ended her racing career by finishing third in the Cesarewitch. As a broodmare, she had her biggest influence through her daughter Martha Snow who was exported to the United States. Background Snow Marten was a bay mare bred in Ireland by Ludwig Neumann, who also owned her during her racing career. The horse was trained by Peter Gilpin at his Clarehaven Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by Martagon, a stayer whose biggest wins came in the Goodwood Cup and Queen's Vase before going on to sire the St Leger winner Wool Winder. Her dam Siberia was a top-class racemare who won the Nassau Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks, Park Hill Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes. Siberia was a daughter of Sirenia, whose other female-line descendants have included Comrade, Jeune, Electra (1000 Guineas) and Salmon- Trout (St Leger). Snow Marten was not an easy filly to train and could be stubborn. One writer commented \\"though Snow Marten may be a useful filly on her day, she cannot be regarded an altogether reliable performer. Some days she goes, well at home, and on other occasions nothing will induce her to go out of a canter.\\" Snow Marten's racing career took place during World War I. Many racecourses were closed for the duration of the conflict and all five of traditional British Classic Races were run at Newmarket. Racing career=1914: two-year-old season= Snow Marten ran six times as a two-year-old. On 30 May she finished second to Verveine in the Redfern Plate at Kempton Park Racecourse. At Goodwood Racecourse on 30 July Snow Marten was matched against male opposition in the Prince of Wales's Stakes over six furlongs and finished second, beaten a head by the King's colt Friar Marcus. At Newmarket Racecourse in September the filly recorded her only win of the season when she took the Two-Year-Old Plate. In October at the same track she started joint-favouite for the Imperial Produce Stakes but came home last of the four runners behind the colt Pommern. On her final run of the year, again at Newmarket, she finished second to Contino in the Houghton Stakes. =1915: three-year-old season= On 30 April Snow Marten was one of fifteen fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket but finished unplaced in a race which saw Vaucluse win from Silver Tag and Bright. The 137th running of the Oaks Stakes was expected to take place on 4 June but was rescheduled owing to wartime conditions and was run at Newmarket on 17 June. Ridden by Walter Griggs Snow Marten started a 20/1 outsider in an eleven-runner field, with Vaucluse heading the betting from Silver Tag, Bright and Flash. Snow Marten won the race \\"in a canter\\" by four lengths from Bright, with Silver Tag a head away in third. Few of the crowd had profited from the result and the filly returned to the winner's enclosure in near silence. Snow Marten made her next appearance in late July in the two-mile Newmarket Gold Cup, a substitute for the Ascot Gold Cup. She started second favourite behind Black Jester and finished third behind the colts Apothecary and Carancho. On 15 September the filly was matched against Pommern (who had won the 2000 Guineas and the Derby Stakes) in the September Stakes, a wartime substitute St Leger. She showed signs of temperament before the race, swishing her tail \\"ominously\\" on the way to the start. She proved no match for Pommern, being beaten two lengths into second place, but finished six lengths clear of the other five runners, which included Apothecary and Let Fly (runner-up in the Derby). On her final racecourse appearance Snow Marten contested the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket on 13 October and finished third of the thirty-one runners behind Son-in-Law and Eau Claire. Snow Marten's earnings enabled Ludwig Neumann to become British flat racing Champion Owner in 1915. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Snow Marten an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record A few days after her Oaks win, Snow Marten was covered by the stallion Sir Martin and her first foal,a bay filly, was delivered on 4 May 1916. Named Martha Snow, she was exported to the United States where she produced Nimba (Alabama Stakes, CCA Oaks), Calumet Dick (Narragansett Special) and White Favor, the female-line ancestor of Curlin. Snow Marten's other foals included: *Glen Eagle, bay gelding, 1917, by Jaeger. Winner in steeplechase races. *Royal Ermine, grey filly, 1918, by Roi Herode. Granddam of Pretender (Prix Gladiateur, Queen Alexandra Stakes) *Odessa, chestnut filly, 1919, by Sunder *Miniver, chestnut colt, 1920, by Sunder *Kalindi, chestnut filly, 1921, by Sunstar.

The basic concept is to produce a pulse of radio signal similar to the one that the target radar would produce when it reflects off the aircraft. This second pulse is then increasingly delayed in time so that the radar's range gate begins to follow the false pulse instead of the real reflection, pulling it off the target. Doppler radars may not use range gates and instead select a single target by narrowly filtering frequencies on either side of the target's initial return. Against these radars, the related velocity gate pull-off (VGPO) can be used. These send a return signal that slowly changes in frequency, rather than time, hoping the radar's velocity gate will be pulled off the target in the same general fashion. Pull-off belongs to the wider family of \\"deceptive jamming\\" concepts that use details of the target radar to their advantage, rather than attempting to simply overpower the radar's signal. Alternate names for \\"pull-off\\" include \\"stealing\\" and \\"walk-off\\". A related technique is angle deception jamming. Description=Range gates and strobing= Even the earliest radar systems included a system to highlight a single selected target for further analysis. For instance, 1939's Gun-Laying Mark I, the British Army's first operational radar, used an on-screen cursor known as the strobe to highlight a single target. This worked by filtering out, or gating, signals that were not within the strobe's short time period, typically a few microseconds, corresponding to a range of a few hundred meters. The signal within the strobe's window was then sent to secondary displays where two operators would determine the azimuth and elevation of that single target, by keeping its blip centered in their displays. Similar systems were used by many radars by the mid-war period. By the end of the war, many experiments were being carried out on automatic target following, or radar lock-on. In these systems, the operator would select a target using the strobe, and then circuits in the radar would automatically track the target in azimuth and elevation. This eliminated the need for the additional operators. Since the target's range would continue to change as it moved, the circuitry also attempted to keep the strobe centered in range. Some systems automated even the strobing; the AI Mark V was designed for single-seat fighter aircraft where the pilot would be too busy to adjust the strobe, and instead had a second system to sweep the strobe through a wide range and then lock onto the first signal it saw. In the post-war era the circuitry that produced the strobe and filtered out other returns became more widely known as a range gate. =Range Pull-off= While testing a late-war radar design, the AI Mk. IX, a serious problem with the auto-follow system was found. While this system was being developed, Bomber Command was pressing the Air Ministry to use \\"window\\", better known today as chaff, as a radar countermeasure. Fighter Command pointed out that the Germans could easily copy the system and use it against England, potentially re-opening The Blitz. It was suggested that the AI Mk. IX would ignore window because it decelerated rapidly after it was dropped, and would thus quickly pass out of the range gates and not be tracked. But exactly the opposite occurred in testing; the radar unerringly locked onto the window and the target disappeared from the display. Range gate pull-off is essentially an electronic version of window. Instead of producing the secondary return by dropping a packet of foil reflectors, the second return is created by a transponder in the target aircraft. The transponder initially responds as rapidly as possible to the radar's signal, producing a second blip that overlaps the original. Over a period of time, it increasingly delays the return so that it falls \\"behind\\" the radar signal in time. The goal is to delay the signal so it counters the aircraft's motion, leaving a signal at what appears to be a (nearly) fixed location in space. If the radar was locked on to the aircraft, it will hopefully remain locked to this second pulse as the aircraft moves away from the original location. Eventually, the aircraft will fall outside the range gate and disappear, while the radar continues tracking the false signal. Thus, the false signal is said to \\"pull the range gate off the target\\". One way to reject the signal from the RGPO jammer is to note that the transponder always takes some non-zero time to respond. This means the signal will always have some component that represents the original \\"skin reflection\\" before the transponder signal is superimposed. On a plan-position indicator, the false signal will appear as a second dot at increasing distances from the first, which the operator can then manually strobe to regain lock. Alternately, if the operator is aware there is a jammer operating, they can look for the closest signal, representing the \\"skin reflection\\", and mute down any following signals. This is easily accomplished in simple electronics, and often referred to as a \\"leading-edge tracker\\". Such systems can be defeated by tracking the original radar signal and extracting its pulse repetition frequency (PRF). With even a basic measure of the PRF, the jammer can broadcast noise across the time frame of the skin reflection in order to obscure it. This can be particularly effective against leading-edge trackers, which will no longer have a sharp signal to gate on. Since these systems generate two signals, one to blank the leading-edge and another to perform pull-off, these are sometimes known as \\"dual-mode jammers\\". A more complex solution requires extremely accurate tracking of the PRF. If this can be achieved, the RGPO can then broadcast its deception signal on either side of the skin reflection and walk-off in either direction. This technique easily defeats leading-edge tracking, and also makes it difficult for a manual operator to tell which of the returns is the \\"real\\" signal. =Velocity pull- off= Doppler radars directly measure the target's velocity via the Doppler effect. In typical early implementations, the received signal was amplified and then sent into a bank of narrow-band filters, each one corresponding to a particular target velocity. A simpler system is used in some semi-active radar homing missiles, which are pre-programmed with a measured target velocity which is used to calculate the expected Doppler shift of the signal, and then filter out signals outside a narrow band around that frequency. If an RGPO jammer responds to such a signal by sending out the same frequency it received, this additional signal will be sent into the same filter, adding to the original signal and making it stronger. If the transponder instead responds at a fixed frequency, it will fall into a different filter and can be easily distinguished. In either case, the original target return remains locked-on. Modifying a transponder to deal with Doppler radars is easy, it simply requires it to be able to adjust its frequency. In this case, the system initially responds at the same frequency as the original signal, and then increasingly shifts the frequency over time in a manner similar to the RGPO case. This will cause a second signal to appear in adjacent filters, with no way to know which is the original. Since the frequency can be easily adjusted up or down, it does not have the added complication seen in RGPOs that want to pull-off in either direction. Pulse-Doppler radars use both pulse timing and Doppler shifting to track targets, so by varying both the frequency and return timing (through amplitude modulation), these can be pulled off as well. Such a transponder will continue to work against non-Doppler radars as well, as these generally have wide frequency response and continue to see the signal as long as its frequency shift does not become significant. =Countermeasures= The effectiveness of the pull-off can be reduced if the radar changes its pulse repetition frequency, thereby making it difficult for the transponder to continue smoothly delaying the fake signal. Frequency agility has the same effect, as the transponder cannot guess what frequency to send out the fake signals on until it hears the one from the radar. Denying this capability means the signal from the transponder can only respond to signals after hearing them on its receiver. These signals will always represent returns from greater distances than the jammer aircraft. Pulse-to- pulse comparison techniques, like moving target indication, can be used to filter out these sorts of returns as they appear on the radar to be slower- moving targets.

Fossils of Chimerarachne were discovered in Burmese amber from Myanmar which dates to the mid-Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago. Its classification is disputed, either belonging to Uraraneida a group otherwise known from the Devonian to Permian, or a separate clade closer to spiders. Since the earliest spider fossils are from the Carboniferous, either answer results in an at least a 170 myr ghost lineage with no fossil record, making it a Lazarus taxon. The size of the animal is quite small, being only 2.5 mm in body length, with the tail being about 3mm in length. These fossils resemble spiders in having two of their key defining features: spinnerets for spinning silk, and a modified male organ on the pedipalp for transferring sperm. At the same time they retain a whip-like tail, rather like that of a whip scorpion and uraraneids. Chimerarachne is not ancestral to spiders, being much younger than the oldest spiders which are known from the Carboniferous, but it appears to be a late survivor of an extinct group which was probably very close to the origins of spiders. It suggests that there used to be spider-like animals with tails which lived alongside true spiders for at least 200 million years.  Etymology  The name is taken from the chimera, a monster in Greek mythology composed of parts of different animals, representing the mixture of basal and derived characteristics of the organism, together with the suffix arachne which is the Greek word for \\"spider\\". The species name honours Yanling Ying, who collected one of the specimens.  Characteristics  Restoration of Chimerarachne yingi The legs and body of Chimerarachne are generally spider-like. The chelicerae (mouthparts) are similar to those of spiders belonging to the Mesothelae or mygalomorphs. The fang does not have any hairs, which is another typical spider feature, but it is not clear whether or not the animals had venom. The male pedipalp has a palpal organ consisting of the tarsus (or cymbium), which is divided at the tip into two long lobes, and a simple palpal bulb similar to that of some mygalomorph spiders but apparently less complex than the bulbus of mesotheles. The abdomen is segmented, like that of a mesothele spider. However, unlike spiders, there are several short cylindrical segments at the back from which a long segmented tail (or flagellum) emerges. The abdomen also bears spinnerets on the underside, and these are especially interesting given that it was widely assumed that spiders should initially have had four pairs in the middle of the underside as in modern mesothele spiders. By contrast, Chimerarachne has two pairs of quite well developed spinnerets towards the back of the abdomen which are similar in shape to those of mesotheles and which are probably equivalent to the anterior lateral spinnerets (ALS) and posterior lateral spinnerets (PLS) of modern spiders. There are, however, no posterior median spinnerets. In the place where the anterior median spinnerets (AMS) would be expected in spiders there is instead a pair of stubby spigots which could be spinnerets in the process of formation.  Studies  Five specimens of Chimerarachne yingi are known . Two pairs of specimens were acquired independently by two different research teams during the summer of 2017. Their results were published back to back as companion papers in February 2018 in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. All four of the original specimens had modified pedipalps, which look similar to the ones used by modern male spiders to transfer sperm during mating, which implies that all four of the initial specimens are male. The fifth specimen lacked these modified pedipalps, and so therefore is presumably female. The two publications agree on the basic anatomy and significance of these fossils, but differ slightly in the interpretation of their position of Chimerarachne in the arachnid tree of life. The Wang et al. study, which also named the fossils, placed the genus closer to spiders. The Huang et al. study placed Chimerarachne a little more distant from spiders and as part of an extinct arachnid order known as Uraraneida which are also spider-like, and have a tail, but which were not previously thought to have spinnerets. The fossils thus raise the question whether spiders should be defined by acquiring spinnerets and a male pedipalp organ or be defined by having lost the tail.

It was listed by Historic Environment Scotland in 1971 as a Category A listed building. History The mansion, located on Nether Street (A921) near Kirkcaldy Harbour, was built in 1692 by John Watson after his marriage to Euphan Orrock, as confirmed by the monograms \\"IW\\" and \\"EO\\" displayed at various locations on the house. After just a few years, it was transferred to the Oswald family who remodelled it in the early 18th century, when the rear wings may have been added. As the town of Kirkcaldy spread ever nearer to the mansion, the Oswalds decided in the 1790s to build and move to a new house, also called Dunnikier House, further away from the town. In 1891, the old house was renovated and converted into the rectory of the local parish church. In 1979 the house was acquired by the Fife Health Board, who restored it and renamed it Path House. First serving as a nursing home, it has hosted a health centre since the 1990s.

Signed on 2 September 1933,. the agreement was in place until 22 June 1941 when Italy declared war on the Soviet Union during the Second World War. The pact built on earlier economic relations (traditionally strong between the countries), seeking to ensure security in the Balkans and for a time mutual suspicion of German intentions. Background The Soviet Union and Italy had maintained contacts since 26 December 1921 and full diplomatic relations since 7 February 1924, making Mussolini's Italy the first Western nation to recognize the Soviet Union. Some members of the Italian Communist Party, such as Luigi Tolentino from Palermo lived in exile in the Soviet Union, which caused some political friction and accusations of harbouring \\"subversives.\\" On 6 May 1933, the two moved closer together by agreeing an economic pact supporting industrialisation goals; Italy required access to Soviet oil and coal, while the Soviets were interested in Italian innovations in the aviation, automobile and naval industries. The ideological controversy between Fascism and Bolshevism was largely considered as an internal matter and relations were built up nevertheless. Reports in the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union were keen to stress the military aspect of this. In September 1933, a Soviet military mission visited Rome and Vladimir Petrovich Potemkin, who served as Soviet Ambassador to Italy from 1932 until 1934, expressed \\"gratitude for the exceptional attention devoted to the Soviet mission by the Italian command and government,\\" while a general from the Italian military stated, \\"the Italian Army has feelings which go deeper than the usual professional ones toward the Red Army. These feelings have been strengthened as a result of the Italo- Soviet Pact.\\" Potemkin sent an invite to the Undersecretary of State, Fulvio Suvich, for an Italian mission to visit the Soviet Union in return. Representatives of the Italian Army and the Italian Navy, including a Brigadier General, toured the Soviet Union for two weeks, though the Italian Air Force did not as Italo Balbo blocked the plan. There were further friendly exchanges in 1933 as an Italian submarine visited Batum on the Black Sea and three Soviet vessels visited Naples. This was in preparation for the visit of Maxim Litvinov. There were plans that captains from the Red Fleet would meet Benito Mussolini, but in the end this did not happen. These developments also coincided with Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany and as there was an element of uncertainty not only between the Soviets and Germany at the time, but also Italy and Germany (not least over the issue of the potential annexation of Austria and furthermore Italian-controlled territories in South Tyrol). A third element to this relationship was the Turkish Republic. While the Soviet ships were in Naples, the Turkish Ambassador to Italy made a visit to the Soviet admiral on board. A potential Soviet-Italian-Turkish stability alliance troubled Berlin.. Bernardo Attolio, who had been the Italian Ambassador to Moscow in 1930 and helped pave the way for the 1932 agreement, called the military contacts a \\"tradition\\" and mutually beneficial, in that it helped to build Italian military and technological prestige. In the aftermath of these exchanges, Mussolini mobilised Italian troops in the summer of 1934 and had them placed on the Brenner Pass, aiming to ensure Austrian independence against the July Putsch.

The concept has been used in science fiction and actual ships such as the Mercury capsule, Vostok and some suborbital designs. Single-person spacecraft have been envisioned as a supplement or replacement for space suits in certain applications. The Von Braun Bottle suit of the 1950s functions as a hybrid of a space suit and a one-person spacecraft. Capsule-suits Personal Rescue Enclosure is the ball on the left NASA AX-5 hard space suit The idea of a space-suit is that of a man-sized capsule, something beyond form-fitting space suits and rigid suits similar to EVA. Wernher von Braun, known for the moonshot project, proposed a conical bottle suit in the 1950s. In 1965, the Grumman moon suit had a hard bottle enclosure allowing the user's arms to fully retract into the suit. In the 1970s, NASA worked on the AX-3 Hardsuit. In the 1980s, NASA Ames center developed the AX-5 hard suit to avoid having to pre-breathe for lower-pressure suits than the host spacecraft. A NASA space suit with some hard elements (named the I-Suit), was developed later. The Manned Maneuvering Unit is noted in regard to the single-person spacecraft, and it was tested in space in 1984 during a Space Shuttle launch. Highly compact single-person spacecraft have been considered by ISS for EVA work, to avoid having to go through the decompression needed to use the lower-pressure space suits.Benefits of a Single-Person Spacecraft for Weightless Operations Brand Norman Griffin NASA developed a body-shaped single person spacecraft called FlexCraft, with the idea of allowing more and shorter EVA. The spacecraft would be at the same atmospheric pressure as the ISS, thus removing the medical stress and time needed to decompress and compress, and the danger of the bends. A single-person spacecraft could also enhance protection against micrometeoroid impacts and radiation from cosmic rays. The Personal Rescue Enclosure was developed for the Space Shuttle. On the ISS the combination of a Space Suit, the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) and Extravehicular Mobility Unit are used, combined to form a soft-suit spacecraft for emergencies. A demonstration of single-person spacecraft for ISS, called the FlexCraft, was proposed in the 2010s.Low Cost Space Demonstration for a Single-Person Spacecraft Brand N. Griffin1 In 2018 a single person spacecraft capsule tested in a water pool by NASA. This design has a hatch at the bottom that an astronaut could enter into, but it would be at full pressure thus avoiding the need to purge nitrogen from the body for low-pressure suits. The capsule suit has robotic manipulators, and could be used for some of the tasks currently done in space suits, but the capsule suit would also have enhanced micrometeoroid protection and a higher pressure atmosphere.

The new order was based on the Seaside prototype, with each ship costing ‚Ç¨700 million each. On 16 October 2015, MSC performed the steel cutting ceremony for what would be their second Seaside-class ship in Monfalcone. MSC revealed the name of the second Seaside-class vessel as MSC Seaview the following year, on 4 July 2016 On 2 February 2017, MSC held the keel-laying and coin ceremonies for the ship, in which two coins were placed under the ship's new keel block for good fortune before the keel was laid. On 23 August 2017, MSC Seaview was floated out from the shipyard. On 23 April 2018, she set sail for five days of sea trials. MSC Seaview was delivered on 4 June 2018 with a ceremony in Monfalcone. She was christened in Genoa by her godmother, Sophia Loren, on 9 June 2018. = Operational career = MSC Seaview set off on her maiden voyage on 10 June 2018 from Genoa, a 7-day sailing around the Western Mediterranean, visiting Marseille, Barcelona, Naples, Messina, and Valletta. For her inaugural season, she continued sailing weekly voyages in the Western Mediterranean before re-positioning to Brazil for the winter 2018-2019 season. The rotation repeated the following year. She was originally scheduled to be deployed to her first season sailing in the Persian Gulf from her homeport of Dubai for the winter 2020-2021 season, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing fleet redeployments, she is scheduled to return to Brazil during that timeframe. In summer 2021, she will return to the Mediterranean to sail weekly voyages.  Design and specifications  The overall architecture of MSC Seaview and identical sister ship MSC Seaside are based on Fincantieri's Project Mille, a prototype that had not been executed 12 years since its initial conceptualization. Project Mille's prototype featured the diesel generators at midship, a wider hull, a narrower superstructure, and a relocation of heavy-weight public areas to lower decks to lower the ship's center of gravity. The ship's design reflects these features, along with a midship engine room and funnels, a wider boardwalk promenade along both sides of the ship, and a wider aft promenade deck that houses a large pool complementing those located on the top decks. The aft promenade deck is positioned at the base of the narrow, tower-like structure that houses cabins in the ship's aft. Other features and accommodations included are a water park custom-designed by WhiteWater West on the top deck, the MSC Yacht Club luxury area spanning five decks, which hosts passengers paying a premium for enhanced accommodations and amenities, three themed restaurants, a bowling alley, and a theater. MSC Seaview has 18 decks and a length of , a draft of , a depth of , and a beam of . The total passenger capacity is 5,119 across 2,066 passenger cabins, with a crew complement of 1,413 across 759 crew cabins, making for a maximum capacity of 6,592 persons. She is also powered by a diesel-electric genset system, with four W√§rtsil√§ engines driving GE Marine electrical equipment and producing , and equipped with exhaust scrubbers to contend with soot.

The castle site is situated to the north of, and above, the Ulmbach Reservoir in the Hessian county of Lahn-Dill-Kreis.  History  The little castle on a hill spur was probably built around 1225 by the Lords of Lichtenstein, close relatives of the Lords of Greifenstein. This is not, however, clear from the records, because it is unclear, whether Conrad of Lichtenstein, who is named in deeds in 1225 and 1229, also belonged to the family of the Lichtensteins in Greifenstein. Many secondary sources deduce that the castle was first built around 1250 by the brothers, Werner and Kraft of Lichtenstein. Like Greifenstein, Lichtenstein was captured and destroyed in 1298 by Counts John of Nassau (died 1328) and Henry of Solms-Burgsolms (died c. 1313) along with troops of the Wetterau imperial cities, because the Greifensteins and Lichtensteins had aligned themselves with the counter-king, Albert of Habsburg and against King Adolphus of Nassau, and because they, at least in the eyes of the Nassaus and Solmses, had acted like robber barons.Beilstein, ein geschichtlicher √úberblick. at: hgv-beilstein.deThe date of their destruction is frequently given as 1280, for example in Solms-Laubach, p. 27, but this does not fit with the dates of the prince's alliance against King Adolphus. Unlike Greifenstein Castle, Lichtenstein was never rebuilt and the Lichtensteins probably lived on a farmstead in nearby Wallendorf (today part of Beilstein). The ruins of their castle continued to remain in their possession, but then finally went to Kraft of Rodenhausen in 1360 through his marriage to Irmgard, the heiress of Wittekind of Lichtenstein, Wittekind being the last male in the family line. Kraft sold the castle hill together with its ruins and the rest of the estate to Count John of Nassau-Hadamar (died 1365). In 1395 the Burgberg and ruins of Lichtenstein came into the possession of the Count of Solms. John II of Solms-Burgsolms, known as \\"Springsleben\\" (died 1405) who, since the destruction of his own castle in Burgsolms in 1384 by the Wetterau federation of the imperial cities of Wetzlar, Friedberg and Gelnhausen resided at the rebuilt Greifenstein Castle, and his son, John III (died 1415), the last of the line of Solms-Burgsolms, acquired it in March 1395 from Count Philip I of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken-Weilburg together with other estates, which Philip had bought in 1363 from Kraft of Rodenhausen and his wife, Irmgard of Lichtenstein.Solms-Laubach, p. 41.  Today  Of the old castle only the remains of the neck ditch below the hill plateau and a few wall remnants may be seen.

After graduating from the Lauenburg School of Applied Sciences, he went to the University of G√∂ttingen to study law. Instead, however, he studied philosophy, history, and literature. He moved to Leipzig to devote himself entirely to music and moved from there to Hamburg to study for two and a half years with Ignaz Lachner. His first engagement was in 1862 in Wesel. From 1863 to 1865, he went as Kapellmeister and choir director to the New Town Theater in Riga, where he was also the conductor of the Liedertafel.

He served as the Bishop of Castellammare di Stabia from 1879 to 1897 and then as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Naples from 1897 to 1898. Following his death, he was named a Servant of God.  Biography = Early life = Vincenzo Maria Sarnelli was born on 5 April 1835 in Naples, Italy to Nicola and Adelaide. He was baptized on the day of his birth. At the age of seven, he was orphaned and received his First Communion at the age of ten. He was then confirmed on 2 June 1846. He began studying law at the University of Naples and, while there, decided to enter the priesthood. He was ordained a priest on 20 December 1862 and continued his studies, with a theological-juridical specialization. The Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Sisto Riario Sforza, sent Sarnelli to Rome to further study canon law from 1868 to 1869. Upon returning to Naples, Sforza made Sarnelli responsible for teaching canon law at the Archepiscopal Athenaeum and history at the Troise Lyceum. In May 1875, Sarnelli was appointed pastor of the Church of Santa Maria Avvocata in Piazza Dante of Naples. = Episcopal ministry = Sarnelli was then appointed coadjutor bishop to Francesco Petagna, the Bishop of Castellammare di Stabia. Upon Petagna's death on 18 December 1878, Sarnelli succeeded him as Bishop of Catellammare di Stabia, being officially appointed by Pope Leo XIII on 28 February 1879 and receiving his episcopal consecration on 2 March 1879. He took possession of the diocese on 30 March. During the Italian cholera epidemic of 1884, he was awarded the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic for his ministry to the afflicted and for his material generosity to the poor. Sarnelli became a tertiary of the Servite Order and wrote a book about the seven founding saints of the order. On 19 April 1897, Pope Leo XIII appointed him Metropolitan Archbishop of Naples, of which diocese he took possession on 11 July 1897. Shortly after becoming Archbishop of Naples, Sarnelli became ill and, on 2 January 1898, died and was buried in the Cemetery of Santa Maria del Pianto. = Cause for canonization = Sarnelli was said to have predicted his own death. Shortly after his death, the cause of canonization was begun, thereby posthumously conferring on him the title Servant of God. It was said that during his time as bishop, Sarenlli never spent more than one lira per day, donating the rest of his income to the poor and the maintenance of the cathedral. On 7 January 1898, the vicar capitular of Naples, Msgr. Carbonelli, placed Sarnelli's body in \\"canonical deposit,\\" as was custom when there where tumultuous circumstances and a process of beatification was beginning. By 6 July 1898, a postulator had already been appointed to investigate the cause. The Compassionist Sisters, of which Blessed Maria Maddalena Starace (a close friend of Sarnelli) was the founder, undertook support of Sarnelli's cause in 1999, and on 17 November 1999, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the Archbishop of Naples the ability to authorize the start of the beatification process. On 6 July 1973, his remains were moved to the Church of Santa Maria Avvocata, of which he was once pastor.

Designed by Cyrillus Johansson, it is the only tower in Sweden dating from World War II and built for airspace surveillance that was designed by an architect, and one of only a few such towers to remain intact. Since 2013, it is a listed building. History During World War II, the steel mill company Fagersta Bruk AB (no longer in existence) was an important supplier of munitions and weapons for the Swedish Armed Forces. Among other things, the steel mill provided the military with shells for grenades and barrels for rifles. While Sweden remained directly unaffected by the war, the country maintained a high degree of military readiness. In order to be able to defend the steel mill in the event of an attack on Sweden, anti-aircraft guns were placed by the military around strategic industrial sites. The company owning the steel mill in 1943 took the initiative to build the tower, from which the fire of the anti-aircraft guns could be directed. The tower was finished in 1944, but saw no use in its intended capacity, since the war ended within a year of its construction, and the neutrality of Sweden was not violated during that time. Fagersta Municipality considered tearing the tower down at one point, but after funding had been secured for its restoration (funding provided to a large part by the County administrative board) the building was restored. Since 2013, it is a listed building, meaning it is protected by law against destruction or alteration. During World War II, approximately 1,200 airspace surveillance towers were built in Sweden, most of them wooden. Only a few remain preserved, and the tower in Fagersta is unique in that it was designed by an architect. The use of expensive building materials is also unusual. It is also the only such tower that Cyrillus Johansson designed. Design Fagersta Bruk AB contracted architect Cyrillus Johansson to design the tower. He had previously designed other buildings for the company, as well as other buildings in Fagersta. The tower is constructed out of yellow brick, and a spiral stair runs inside the tower. Small windows give daylight to the stairwell. The tower ends in a platform surmounted by an octagonal pavilion with a small spire and a weather vane. A small adjacent building was designed to function as a small office and bomb shelter. It has been noted that the design displays influences from oriental architecture, and it has been compared to both a minaret and the tower of a medieval or fairy tale castle. The tower is tall.

South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that, where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only alternative sentence available is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the sentencing jury must be informed that the defendant is ineligible for parole. After being found guilty of murder, Jonathan Dale Simmons faced either execution or life in prison without parole.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 156. The State asked the jury to sentence Mr. Simmons to death, in part because he posed a future danger to society.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 156-59. Although Mr. Simmons repeatedly requested permission to instruct the jury that he would never be released from prison, these requests were denied by the trial court.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 158-160. Denying Mr. Simmons his requested instruction violated his due process rights, the Supreme Court held, and presented to the jury a \\"false choice between sentencing petitioner to death and sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration.\\" Simmons, 512 U.S. at 161. Although Simmons was a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed its holding.Lynch v. Arizona, 136 S. Ct. 1818 (2016).Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U.S. 156, 165-66 (2000).  Facts and procedural history  Jonathan Dale Simmons was found guilty of brutally murdering 79 year-old Josie Lamb. Because of Mr. Simmons' criminal history, he was ineligible for parole, and he faced either life in prison or execution for the murder. Defense counsel was prohibited from asking potential jury members about their understanding of parole in voir dire.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 156-57. Following a three-day long trial, Mr. Simmons was convicted.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 157. During the penalty phase, the State sought the death penalty and, despite Mr. Simmons' parole ineligibility, repeatedly told the jury that Mr. Simmons posed a danger to society. At one point, the State told the jury that a death sentence would be \\"an act of self-defense\\" and a \\"response of society to someone who is a threat.\\" Defense counsel repeatedly requested permission to instruct the jury that, because of Mr. Simmons' parole ineligibility, he could never be released from prison. The court denied each of these requests. During deliberations, the sentencing jury asked the judge whether a \\"life sentence\\" included the possibility of parole.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 160. In response, the judge instructed the jury to \\"not consider parole eligibility.\\" After receiving this response, the jury sentenced Mr. Simmons to death. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed the sentence, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 160-61.  Decision of the Court = Plurality opinion = Justice Blackmun's plurality opinion began by grounding the Court's holding in the Due Process Clause, which requires that no person be executed \\"'on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.'\\"Simmons, 512 U.S. at 161 (quoting Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 362 (1977)). The opinion then detailed the trial court proceedings, and the \\"grievous misperception\\" created by the emphasis on Mr. Simmons' future dangerousness and the absence of an instruction regarding his parole ineligibility.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 161-62. In particular, the plurality noted the defense's repeated requests ‚Äì and the court's refusals ‚Äì to instruct the jury on Mr. Simmons' parole status. The result, the plurality concluded, was that the jury was presented a \\"false choice between sentencing [him] to death and sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration.\\" The plurality pointed to several studiesPaduano & Smith, Deadly Errors: Juror Misperceptions Concerning Parole in the Imposition of the Death Penalty, 18 Colum. Human Rights L.Rev. 211, 222-225 (1987).Note, The Meaning of ‚ÄúLife‚Äù for Virginia Jurors and Its Effect on Reliability in Capital Sentencing, 75 Va.L.Rev. 1605, 1624 (1989).Eisenberg & Wells, Deadly Confusion: Juror Instructions in Capital Cases, 79 Cornell L.Rev. 1 (1993).Bowers, Capital Punishment and Contemporary Values: People's Misgivings and the Court's Misperceptions, 27 Law & Society 157, 169-170 (1993). which indicated that jurors commonly misunderstood the meaning of the term \\"life imprisonment\\" to permit early release.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 170 n.9. In Mr. Simmons' case, this misunderstanding was exacerbated by the State's repeated emphasis on the danger that Mr. Simmons would pose to society. Of course, the plurality noted, the State was permitted to emphasize future dangerousness as a valid factor for the jury to consider in sentencing. Indeed, several factors in addition to future dangerousness ‚Äì such as the defendant's age, mental capacity, and prior criminal history ‚Äì can be appropriate for jury consideration during the sentencing phase and yet inappropriate during the guilt phase of trial. But if the defendant's future dangerousness is considered by the jury, then the jury must be informed that the defendant is ineligible for parole.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 163-64. = Concurring opinions = Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens  Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, wrote separately to state that he would base the Court's judgment in the Eighth Amendment, which guarantees capital defendants the right to clarify legal terms for the jury.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 172. In addition to the due process clause, Justice Souter wrote, the Eighth Amendment imposed \\"a straightforward duty on the court\\" to instruct juries on the meaning of a capital defendants' parole eligibility.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 173. The concurrence also noted that the court (as opposed to the defense counsel) should have provided the parole ineligibility information, so as to ensure that the jury understood it to be a binding statement of law.  Justice Ginsburg  Concurring in the opinion, Justice Ginsburg wrote to place the capital defendant's right to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility within his \\"right to be heard\\" which is a \\"core requirement of due process.\\"Simmons, 512 U.S. at 174. Contrary to Justice Souter's concurrence, Justice Ginsburg believed that the defendant's right to the parole ineligibility instruction would be satisfied regardless of whether it was provided by the defense counsel or the judge.  Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy  Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy, wrote to concur in the judgment.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 175. The concurring opinion reiterated the State's right to argue future dangerousness to the public, noted the State's right to emphasize the defendant's future dangerousness to the prison population, and acknowledged that the judgment was in contrast to the \\"general deference to state decisions regarding what the jury should be told about sentencing.\\" Simmons, 512 U.S. at 177. = Dissent = Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, dissented. In dissent, the Justices described the Court's ruling as a vast departure from the Constitution and an overreach into state power.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 178-79. The plurality opinion, the dissent criticized, was based neither in state practice nor the Court's precedent. The plurality was not based on state practice, Justice Scalia wrote, because most states did not allow capital sentencing juries to receive information regarding parole.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 179. And the plurality was not based on the Court's precedent, the dissent argued, because those cases involved an emphasis on future dangerousness that was absent from the Simmons record.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 180-81. Though the Court's opinion might have been \\"reasonable as a matter of policy,\\" the dissent concluded, the Constitution did not require that it be \\"followed coast to coast.\\" SImmons, 512 U.S. at 185.  Implications  Since Simmons, a jury instruction regarding a capital defendant's parole ineligibility is commonly referred to as a \\"Simmons instruction.\\" Several studies reveal that providing juries with Simmons instructions can have significant consequences because jurors commonly misunderstand a \\"life sentence\\" to include parole, and that this misunderstanding can increase the likelihood of a death sentence. Despite the significance of a Simmons instruction, in 1997 the Court declared that Simmons could not be applied retroactively to overturn death sentences that were final when Simmons was decided.O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 167-68 (1997). = Subsequent state practice = Evading Simmons  Though some commentators predicted Simmons would significantly impact state criminal law, it has been narrowly interpreted by state courts.63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1573 at 1575. Arizona was denying defendants Simmons instructions based on their opportunity to receive clemency.Lynch, 136 S. Ct. at 1819. But in 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that the potential for defendants to receive clemency did not obviate the need for a Simmons instruction.Lynch, 136 S. Ct. at 1820 In April 2018, Arizona sought certiorari from the Supreme Court concerning the applicability of Simmons,Arizona v. Rushing, Petition for Certiorari (April 2018). and the Supreme Court denied certiorari.Supreme Court Orders (October 1, 2018). After Simmons, South Carolina amended its sentencing schemeCRIMES‚ÄîSENTENCING, PROBATION AND PAROLE‚ÄîGENERAL AMENDMENTS, 1995 South Carolina Laws Act 83 (H.B. 3096) and, based on those amendments, claimed that Simmons no longer applied.Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36 (2001). Pursuant to the amended scheme, jurors first decided whether an aggravating factor was present. If the jury answered no, then the defendant faced life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum of 30 years. If the jury answered yes, then the defendant faced life without parole or execution. In 2001, the Supreme Court reversed the Supreme Court of South Carolina, and ruled that the amendments to South Carolina's sentencing scheme did not render Simmons instructions unnecessary. Legal commentators have characterized the Supreme Court as \\"chid[ing]\\" and \\"rebuk[ing]\\" state attempts to evade Simmons.  Implementing Simmons  Many states have added Simmons instructions into their routine capital sentencing practices. As the Simmons plurality opinion noted, most states were already providing similar instructions for capital defendants facing life without parole or execution.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 167 n.7. Meanwhile, only 8 states ‚Äì Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming ‚Äì did not provide parole ineligibility instructions under the relevant circumstances.Simmons, 512 U.S. at 167-68 nn.7-8.

Early life  Horovitz was born in Warsaw on 17 April 1877. Her father was the artist Leopold Horovitz. Her family moved to Vienna around 1890. She was educated at the University of Vienna, earning a PhD in organic chemistry in 1914. Her doctoral research was on the rearrangement of quinone using sulfuric acid.  Career  Horovitz was recruited by Otto H√∂nigschmid at the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna in 1913. At this time, the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was a recent development in radiochemistry. It predicted that lead resulting from the radioactive decay of uranium or thorium would have different atomic weights than typical lead. Early experimental data was not considered authoritative by analytical chemists. H√∂nigschmid had studied under leading expert Theodore Williams Richards at Harvard and his work in determining precise atomic weights was well respected. Horovitz isolated lead from uranium-rich pitchblende samples from the St. Joachmistal mine. Her gravimetric analysis to the thousandth of a gram proved that lead created from the radioactive decay of uranium had a lower atomic weight than typical lead. This was the first widely accepted experimental proof that elements could have different atomic weights depending on the source. Horovitz and H√∂nigschmid later proved that Ionium, a radioactive element discovered by Bertram Boltwood, was in fact an isotope of Thorium. This experimental work disproved the existence of a widely accepted element and established Thorium as a second element with isotopic behaviour. After World War I, Horovitz's career was disrupted by family matters and political upheaval. Horovitz established a foster home for children with learning difficulties with Alice Friedmann, an Adlerian psychologist. Her exact date of death is unknown. Correspondence from Kazimierz Fajans indicates that she returned to Warsaw and was killed by the Nazis in 1940. Other sources indicate that Horovitz and her sister reported to Umschlagplatz in 1942. They were transported to the Treblinka extermination camp and did not survive.

It generates a false signal that fools the radar into believing the target is to one side of the boresight, causing the radar to \\"walk away\\" from the target and break its radar lock-on. It is also known as angle walk-off, angle stealing, or inverse con-scan. Angle stealing was one of the earliest jamming techniques to be used operationally, with systems employed against the German W√ºrzburg radars near the end of World War II. The technique is not useful against monopulse radars, and is one of the main reasons those radars became popular in the post-war era. Angle stealing belongs to the wider class of \\"deceptive jamming\\" techniques, which attempt to deceive radars based on knowledge of their operating procedures, rather than simply trying to blind them with noise. Another popular deception technique that was used against early radars is range gate pull-off. Description=Conical scanning= A typical radar produces a beam that is several degrees wide. The pattern is non-linear; the antenna is most sensitive at the center of the beam, also known as the boresight or centroid, and its sensitivity drops off at greater angles. This pattern is typically represented by measuring the angle where it has one-half the sensitivity as it does on the boresight. This is known as the half power point. This means that a target in a radar beam will return a signal when the antenna is anywhere within a few degrees of the boresight. The pattern is too wide to allow the radar to directly guide weapons, especially anti-aircraft artillery which need accuracy on the order of 0.1 degrees. However, it is possible to use the non-linear pattern to improve the angle measurement using a system known as conical scanning. The basic idea of conical scanning is to offset the antenna slightly to one side of the boresight and in front of a parabolic reflector. This causes the beam to be deflected slightly to the opposite side of the boresight. The antenna is then spun so that it rotates (or nutates) around the boresight axis (pointing in the direction of the target). As it rotates, the beam traces out a cone, with its tip at the antenna and its long axis aligned with the boresight. A target that is centred in the boresight will always return some signal to the radar, creating a strong, constant signal. If it is located to one side, the signal will rise and fall as the most sensitive region of the pattern rotates across it. To use this for automatic tracking, or radar lock-on, a simple circuit is added. First, the signal is sent into a smoother that extracts the amplitude modulated signal of the series of radar pulses that were returned as it swept across the target. This will produce a flat line if the target is centred, or some form of sine wave otherwise. This is then mixed with a second control signal that has a fixed relationship to the spinning of the antenna. For instance, in the case of the W√ºrzburg the antenna spun at 25 Hz, so this fixed signal was also 25 Hz. Sending these two signals into a phase detector produces a varying output that can be used to drive the antenna pointing motors. This output is known as the error signal, and drops to zero when the antenna is pointing directly at the target. =Angle stealing= Animation of the basic concept of angle deception. The target aircraft sends out additional signals (red bolts) increasingly delayed in time so it appears to move to a new angle far from its actual position. An angle stealer is a transponder turned to the radar's operational frequency that also has some knowledge about the timing of the target radar's scanning rate. The rate can be determined by examining the signal as it is received, or by being pre-set based on some basic knowledge of the radar system. The idea is to add additional signal from the transponder to the signal naturally reflected off the target, such that the addition of those two signals no longer produces the proper output from the smoother. The radar's electronics interpret this as the antenna being misaligned, and it begins to move away from the target. Over time, this can cause the radar to \\"walk-off\\" the target entirely. There are two primary methods for causing this to occur: Inverse gain modulation Transponders are relatively simple radios that receive a signal, amplify it, and send it back out. Examples were in use for identification friend or foe from the start of World War II. However, these early models had the problem that they often over-amplified the signal, causing interference with other radars. This was addressed in the IFF Mark II with the addition of an automatic gain control system, which amplified the received signal to a pre-set level. Inverse gain modulation, also known as inverse amplitude modulation, is a simple modification to this sort of transponder. It adds a smoother circuit like the one in the radar receiver, which creates an amplitude modulated signal output. This output is then inverted and sent into the gain control. The result is an output signal that is strong when the radar signal is weak, and weak when it is strong. Depending on the exact strength of the signals, when this mixes with the radar's own signal at the radar receiver, the result is either a nearly flat smoothed curve, or one that is the inverse of the radar's curve. The resulting error signal quickly drives the radar away from the target. A carefully matched signal that is an exact invert of the original will cause the radar to believe it is aimed at the target no matter where it is pointed. Swept square wave The inverse gain technique was so effective against early tracking radars that these radars began using a system known as CORSO, conical-on- receive-signal-only. CORSO typically used two antennas, a transmitter with a fixed antenna, and a conically scanning receiver. The lock-on technique works the same as in a normal conical scan radar, but the transmitted signal is constant and denies the transponder information about the scanning rate of the radar. For this reason, this concept is also known as \\"silent lobing\\". This led to the introduction of the swept square wave (SSW) technique, also known as scan rate modulation. This is generally similar to the inverse gain method, but does not know the scanning rate. Instead, the system sends out pulses on the radar's frequency at a pulse repetition frequency that is similar to the estimated scanning rate of the radar. These pulses will only be received by the radar if the receiver is pointed roughly in the aircraft's direction. To ensure this will occur at some point, the repetition frequency is slowly increased and decreased so that at some point in this pattern it briefly synchronizes with the scan rate of the antenna. When that occurs, the radar now receives its own signal as well as a second one that is slightly offset in time. When fed into the phase detector, the output signal will no longer be a single pulse, but two, creating an error signal. Because the signal is being swept in repetition frequency, this second part of the signal moves in relation to the radar's own signal. When the two are closely synchronized it generates large error signals that can quickly drive the antenna away from the target. However, because the rate is constantly changing, after a period the error will drop to zero again, potentially before the radar has moved completely off the target. The system is not as effective as inverse gain, which interrupts the tracking process once every scan compared to the once- every-so-often for SSW, but it provides some protection against any conical scanning or CORSO radar.

His supervisor was Edmund Asa Ware. His work entailed hiring construction workers and teachers, establishing tuition, opening and closing schools, and supplying rations to African American settlements along coast of Georgia. Supplying food could be fraught with tension, as Bureau policy was that able-bodied laborers should not be provided with free provisions, but such laborers would often abandon their farm work to work for food, which hurt their eventual yield. Hoag advocated against the policy, suggesting providing provisions on credit until harvest.Cimbala 2003, p86, 163 He generally felt that political activism among the African American population was harming their well-being, and that politics took up time that would be better spent in economic activity.Jones 2008, p304 Hoag's work brought him close to the American Missionary Association (AMA), which provided many of the teachers educating the former slaves, and Hoag was respected by the AMA's teachers.Cimbala 2003, 128 He investigated and reported on violent confrontations between whites and African Americans, including an election- related riot.Harris and Berry 2014, page 180 His statement to the U.S. Congress was among the many harrowing accounts of violent attacks on African Americans, theft of property, attacks on persons attempting to organize voters, and largely complicit local law enforcement.Congressional series of United States public documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1869 pages 137 and 138 Among these was the November 3, 1868, election day riot in Savannah where three African Americans were killed and 17 injured.

The church lies on the B998 close to the junction with the A91, between Stirling and Menstrie, or more accurately between the Wallace Monument and Blairlogie. Old Kirk Old Logie Kirk The church is one of the oldest Christian sites in Scotland, being established during the reign of King David I of Scotland (between 1124 and 1153). A church dedicated to St Serf was built here by at least 1183. The church was rebuilt in 1380 and survived in use until after the Reformation (1560). The current ruins are from a church commissioned by Rev Alexander Fargy who served the parish from 1560 to 1592. The church was ruinous in 1684 and Rev George Shaw organised its reconstruction. The manse stood to the west in the grounds of Airthrey Castle and dated from around 1590, Rev Fargy having resided in Tullibody. A new manse was built in 1698 by Rev Douglas. The church was originally linked to a priory at North Berwick under the diocese of Dunblane Cathedral but post-Reformation came under the patronage of Robert, Lord Elphinstone.Logie: A Parish History by Menzies Fergusson 1905 The remnants of the original church lie to the north of the current church (at ).

The Gidabo River catchment area is one of the leading coffee production areas in Ethiopia.  Course  It is one of three medium-sized rivers discharging into Lake Abaya. The roughly 120 km long river rises on the western slopes of the Soka Sonicha mountain range (with the most prominent being the Gelala mountain) at , flows west first and then for most of its course southwards along the eastern floor of the Great Rift Valley and through the Sidama Zone. It passes the notable town of Yrga Alem. The river turns westward when entering the Gidabo flood plains directly east of Lake Abaya. It finally drains into Lake Abaya at . In the flood plains and along the final stretch of the river it defines the southern border of the Sidama Zone through which it flows for most of its length. The town of Dilla is the most prominent town in the catchment area of the river. Another town in the catchment area is Aleta Wendo.  Water flow  The river is not navigable and it has no notable tributaries, but the River basin contains a sizable number of ~97 small rivers and streams in three sub-basins. The average annual discharge at its mouth amounts to 11 m3/s, with peak discharges reaching ~40 m3/s in spring and autumn, while in summer and winter the discharge can drop to 2-3 m3/s. A special feature of the Gidabo catchment area is the existence of a large number of springs, which can be used as groundwater sources for agriculture even during the summer and winter dry seasons.  Gidabo dam  17 kilometers by road west of Dilla, where the river turns westward before entering its flood plains and marshes, the Gidabo dam, a 21.3 meter high and 350 m wide earth fill embankment dam is used for flood control and for irrigation purposes of an area of 27 km2 downstream as well as for fish production. The storage volume of the dam reservoir amounts to 0.063 km3.

Luciani\\" is a song by British post-punk band the Fall, written by Mark E. Smith with his then-wife Brix Smith and longstanding band member Steve Hanley. Released in December 1986, the record reached number 59 on the UK singles chart, the band's first original song to make the top 75 of the chart. The song was written as part of Smith's play, Hey! Luciani: The Life and Codex of John Paul I, concerning conspiracy theories about the 1978 death of the Pope (born Albino Luciani), which was performed for two weeks in London and starred Leigh Bowery. Recording The song was performed on record by the band comprising Mark E Smith (vocals), Brix Smith (guitar, keyboards), Craig Scanlon (guitar), Steve Hanley (bass), Simon Rogers (bass, guitar, keyboards), and Simon Wolstencroft (drums). The record was produced by Ian Broudie. \\"The Fall Tracks A-Z: Hey! Luciani\\". Retrieved 5 February 2018 It was described by Ned Raggett at Allmusic as \\"initially strange in its bright warmth, but [it] turns out to be a perfect little pop winner while not compromising what was core about the group.... It might have seemed a long way from the Fall's beginnings, but it was still Smith's show all the way, even with Brix adding some sparkling backing vocals at the end.\\" Song review by Ned Raggett, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 5 February 2018 \\"Hey! Luciani\\" was the second Fall record (and their first original song) to make the top 75 of the UK singles chart, following their version of The Other Half's \\"Mr. Pharmacist\\" earlier in 1986. The song was included on several Fall compilation albums including the 2004 album 50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong. References The Fall (band) songs 1986 singles 1986 songs Songs written by Mark E.

She has held several research fellowships, including a fellowship in the Classics faculty at the University of Cambridge and fellowships at the University of Sydney. She joined the School of Archaeology and Ancient History at the University of Leicester as a lecturer in 2006. She specialises in Roman and historical archaeology and has particular interests in household archaeology, and gender and space. Many of her publications relate to houses and households in Pompeii, and gender and space in Roman military forts in Germany. She is also interested in digital archaeology and how archaeological data can be spread digitally. Doctoral students she has supervised include Steven Ellis (now associate professor at the University of Cincinnati), Katherine Huntley (now associate professor at Boise State University) and Andrew Birley (currently director of excavations at the Vindolanda Trust).  Honors and awards  Allison is a senior fellow of the Higher Education Academy, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, an honorary fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and a corresponding member of the Archaeological Institute of America.  Research  Allison's research focuses on household archaeology as well as gender and space. Her current interests have expanded to encompass households and their activities in the colonial outback in Australia and foodways material culture in the Roman and colonial worlds. She also has an interest in digital archaeology and the digital dissemination of archaeological data. This last interest can be seen in her numerous open access publications and data, including Engendering Roman Military Spaces and an online companion to Pompeian households (which includes detailed documentary information on 30 Pompeian houses and their contents, consisting of 865 rooms and more than 16,000 artifacts). She has been involved in several projects: Big Data on the Roman Table (a research network), the Kinchega Archaeological Research Project, the Libarna Household Archaeology Project, People and Spaces in Roman Military Bases, and Pompeian Houses and Households.

Its commission is unusually well-documented for a work by Bellini. Uniquely Agostino Barbarigo had taken over from his brother Marco Barbarigo as doge. Marco and Agostino were not on good terms and Agostino was even suspected of killing his brother. To quell these rumours, Agostino began commissioning works promoting himself as the heir to and loyal supporter of his brother's work. These included St Mark's Clocktower (Torre dell'Orologio) from Mauro Codussi, and at the Doge's Palace, the monumental steps (Scala dei Giganti) from the brothers Marco and Pietro Lombardo, and a new wing reaching towards the Rio. He also privately commissioned a majestic funeral monument for Marco and himself in and commissioned Bellini twice, first to produce the official portrait of Marco for the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (1486‚Äì87) and then to produce a \\"large panel\\", Mariolina Olivari, Giovanni Bellini, in AA. VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007. as his ex-voto for the Doge's Palace.Ruggiero, 344 Ex-voto In Venice it became the custom in the Renaissance for the higher officials, beginning with the Doge, to commission (at their personal expense) an ex-voto painting in the form of a portrait of themselves with religious figures, usually the Virgin or saints, in thanks for achieving their office. For lower officials only their coat of arms might represent the official. The painting was hung in the public building where they worked or presided.Lino Moretti, \\"Portraits\\", in Jane Martineau (ed), The Genius of Venice, 1500‚Äì1600, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London Aspects of the picture hint at what many contemporaries saw as the excessive self-aggrandizement of the Barberigo brothers. Rather being presented to the Virgin and Child by his name-saint Augustine, as was usual, the Doge is presented by Saint Mark, patron saint of the Venetian Republic, as well as Marco Barberigo. Instead of looking towards the Child, the Doge looks out towards the Venetians passing the painting. There was opposition to hanging it in the Doge's Palace, which may be why Barberigo instead bequeathed it to a convent (so probably saving it from a later fire).Ruggiero, 344‚Äì345 Before this it apparently hung in his home, the Palazzo Barbarigo Nani Mocenigo (which survives; not the Palazzo Barbarigo). Mariolina Olivari, Giovanni Bellini, in AA. VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007. In 1501, already dying, Agostino left the canvas to the nunnery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Murano to be its high altarpiece, but it was soon moved from there (to make room for Titian's Annunciation) to San Pietro Martire. Vasari mentioned it as being in San Michele di Murano but probably mistook it for another Bellini work, now lost, which was already in the Cappella della Santissima Croce in the church of the Camaldolese.

Producing around 100,000 barrels of oil a day, most of Chad's crude comes from its reserves in the Doba Basin in southern Chad where oil was discovered in the early 1970s by foreign drillers. There is an estimated one billion barrels of oil in Chad, most of it being exploited by hundreds of rigs operated by Western companies such as Exxon-Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. However, many challenges exist to Chad's petroleum industry including but not limited to corruption, internal conflict, and geography. Since Chad is landlocked, most of Chad's oil exports are transported out of the country by a pipeline that leads to the Cameroonian port city of Kribi. This pipeline, owned by a consortium, has come under fire due to allegations of exploitation by international corruption watchdogs, and Chadian politicians. In addition, environmentalists have voiced their concerns over the pipeline's impact on the natural environment, citing several spills. Background=Early exploitation= Oil exploration in Chad began in the 1950s while the country was still under French colonial administration. At least three oil rich areas were discovered in the country, however due to the high cost that would have been incurred in exploiting the finds, the French opted not to develop them. At the time the bulk of France's petroleum was being imported from Algeria and the Middle East. In 1960, Chad achieved its independence from France, and Fran√ßois Tombalbaye took over the country as its first president. Tombalbaye enlisted Conoco, an American oil and gas company to search for oil reserves. The company found oil in several areas in 1973-1975, notably the Doba Basin in the Central African Rift system, and the Sedigui area of Lake Chad. In 1975, Tombalbaye was killed by soldiers in a coup d'√©tat and he was replaced with a military junta. This further intensified an already ongoing civil war between the government led by Goukouni Oueddei who became head of state of Chad in 1979, and Hiss√®ne Habr√©, the French and U.S.-backed former defense minister. During this period of especially heavy fighting, Conoco and other foreign oil companies suspended their oil exploitation efforts and left the country. Throughout the 1980s, very little was done to cultivate the petroleum industry owing to political instability, internal conflict, and the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. =D√©by era= In 1990, Idriss D√©by came to power in a coup changing the dynamics of oil and power in the country. Despite relative increases in stability and a reduction in conflict, rebellion and violence was still rife. Shell, and French oil company, Total (then known as Elf Aquitaine) withdrew from Chad in 1999. Elf's withdrawal drew criticism from the D√©by government and the government organized demonstrations against the move which saw protesters burn the French flag. In 2000, a new oil consortium emerged, which included Exxon (operating in Chad as Esso), Chevron, and Petronas, and formed into the Tchad Oil Transportation Company. The consortium was American led with Exxon and Chevron combined holding 65% of the stake in the deal, and the consortium promised an investment of $3.7 billion to drill Chad's oil wells and construct a pipeline from the country to Cameroon to export the resources. As agreed upon with the government, some of this money would go to poverty-reduction projects and developing Chad's infrastructure. Chad would receive about 12.5% of the profit made on each barrel exported. In 2006, President D√©by ordered Chevron and Petronas to immediately leave Chad for supposedly refusing to pay $450 million in taxes, leaving Exxon as the sole oil company from the original consortium left in the country. However, many viewed the expulsion as a method to make way for increased Chadian government involvement in the country's oil production or even to make room for Chinese oil companies with Chad recently having restored relations with Beijing. Shortly after, D√©by suspended three of his cabinet members including Mahmat Nasser Hassan, Chad's oil minister. In 2016, a Chadian court levied a $74 billion fine on Exxon, an amount seven times the size of Chad's economy, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The following year, Exxon settled the dispute and was able to keep its exploration permit. =Chinese activities= Chinese involvement in the Chadian economy began in 2006, shortly after N'djamena restored diplomatic relations with Beijing, and in 2008, China National Petroleum Company entered a joint venture with the Chadian National Hydrocarbon Company to build an oil refinery north of N'djamena with plans to produce 20,000 barrels per day. In addition, the refinery also included a petroleum college and maintains a training program for Chadian locals. Chinese oilmen also began to explore new oil fields and conduct seismic studies and in 2009, exploitation of a new oil field began. In 2014, Chad suspended China National Petroleum Corporation from exploration for environmental infractions and issued a fine of $1.2 billion. The same year the Chadian government announced its intention to substantially increase oil production in the country from around 100,000 bpd to 260,000 bpd by the end of 2016. Pipeline Construction of a pipeline from Chad to Cameroon began in October 2000 with a ceremony in the village of Kom√© which included representatives from the Chadian and Cameroonian governments, the three oil companies in the consortium, and the World Bank. The pipeline was owned by the oil consortium of Exxon, Chevron, and Petronas, with the governments of Chad and Cameroon maintaining a combined stake of 3% in the project. The World Bank helped finance the pipeline by giving a loan to Chad and Cameroon, hoping the venture would boost development in the region. As a precondition for the loan the World Bank required the oil consortium to prepare a risk assessment and an evaluation of the pipeline's environmental impact. Numerous international observers and non-governmental organizations (NGO) opposed the loan, pointing to Chad's human rights record and rampant corruption. The 660-mile (1,090 km) long pipeline was completed in 2003 and connected three oil fields in southern Chad with a floating production storage and offloading vessel located in the Atlantic, off the coast of Cameroon, near the town of Kribi. Completed a year ahead of schedule, it created 13,000 jobs in Chad and led to over $400 million in infrastructure improvements. However, in Cameroon, where the majority of the pipeline is located, NGOs have cited several oil spills as being harmful to local communities and have lambasted government officials for not doing more to prevent them.https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032737/http://www.relufa.org/documents/Pressreleaseoilspillapril2010.pdf In 2008, the World Bank ended its involvement in the pipeline after Chad finished repaying its loan, specifying the government's failure to redirect revenue from the project to the earlier agreed upon goals of reducing poverty and developing infrastructure. In a statement the Bank said, ‚ÄúChad failed to comply with the key requirements of this agreement. The government did not allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction.‚Äù Impact on Chad=Chadian society= Only a small segment of the Chadian population benefits from the oil industry with most of the population still reliant on agriculture, livestock, and fishing for subsistence, with cotton being the primary cash crop. The onset of oil production in the country has, in many cases, actually had a negative impact on other sectors of the economy with many households losing long-held agricultural and grazing lands to foreign oil corporations in exchange for meager compensation. In the Lake Chad area, a region considered to be a regional heartland for agricultural and fishing, oil wells and the construction of a new refinery have limited everyday Chadians from using the area to their economic benefit. Chad continues to be among the poorest nations in the world with levels of poverty well below average, even for sub-Saharan Africa. =Misuse of oil revenue= Oil production in Chad has led a significant windfall of money for the country's government, much of which has disappeared due to corruption or been used to purchase military weapons and fund conflict. In 2006, after the World Bank froze Chad's oil revenue account over the country's failure to use the money for development, D√©by told a French newspaper, \\"We are going to buy weapons. We're going to do it openly.\\" The Justice and Equality Movement, a Sudanese opposition group active in the Darfur region has been financed using Chadian oil money. A great deal of Chadian petroleum revenue has also been siphoned off through corruption, notably to members of D√©by's Zaghawa clan, and his supporters through bloated infrastructure projects and other development plans. Production areas=Doba Basin= The Doba Basin is a part of the Central African Rift system and contains the largest share of Chad's crude oil reserves. The basin is about 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide and contains hundreds of oil wells operated principally by Exxon-Mobil. The oil in this region is heavy and sour. =Doseo Basin= Djermaya oil refinery in Chad. The Doseo Basin is located east of the Doba Basin and west of the Salamat Basin, and is also a part of the Central African Rift system. It is 480 kilometers long and 90 kilometers wide and has a smaller ratio of sulfur content than in the neighboring Doba Basin. =Salamat Basin= Located in the lowlands in eastern Chad and parts of the Central African Republic, the Salamat Basin is a less significant oil-producing area that is classified as a transtensional formation. Block H, a compilation of 79 fault blocks, being exploited by CNPC is located in the Salamat Basin. =Lake Chad= Oil was discovered in the Lake Chad Basin, an area bordering Nigeria, in the 1990s. By the end of 2008, exploitation in the area amounted to 7.5 million tonnes a year. However violence in the area is frequent due to fighting spilling over from nearby Nigeria.

Since the abolition of the nunnery in 1745, the abbey has functioned as the parish church for Morienval. The few convent buildings not demolished after the French Revolution are privately owned and are not open to the public. History Though the cartulary for the original Benedictine abbey of Morienval survives, it does not list any act or deed marking its beginning. There do not exist any Papal bulls or other archival material that give the date of the abbey's foundation. The oldest document in the cartulary is a charter from 930, during the reign of King Charles the Simple, that confirmed a donation made to the abbey by Charles the Bald in the 840s. The charter also refers to the abbey as \\"the brothers of Sainte-Marie de Morienval\\", indicating a male religious institution that had vanished by 1161, and that the abbey had been destroyed by fire in 895, likely by the Vikings. Charles the Simple and Queen Ermentrude of Orl√©ans maintained a residence at Morienval they frequently spent time at, which may have led to them establishing the abbey. =Architectural history= There is scant archival material detailing Morienval Abbey's construction. As such, the building of the abbey is a process that has had to be tracked by archaeological analysis conducted between 1855 and 1900 by √âmile Boeswillwald and Paul Selmersheim. Unfortunately, little of the observations made by these digs can be substantiated because of construction directed by Selmersheim later. Three general periods have been delineated for the construction of the abbey between 1050 and 1135. This is followed by periods of renovation and restoration from 1608 to 1690, 1878, and from 1900 to 1903. Numerous small additions or alterations have been made to the abbey throughout its history. =Middle Ages= In 920, the year of Charles the Simple's letter confirming the abbey, Morienval Abbey's abbot was a layman, the future King Robert I of France. Robert I must have received the abbey as a good, leading historian Eug√®ne Lef√®vre-Pontalis to conclude that the property abbey had for some time before been taken by various lords. This was the case for many ecclesiastical institutions until the restitution movement inspired by the Gregorian Reform. Another of Morienval's abbots had been, with Hugh the Abbot, the guardian of Robert the Strong's children after his death. Architecture Plan of the church as it appeared in the mid-12th century The abbey church, now dedicated to Saint Denis, was built according to a roughly symmetrical cruciform plan that has generally remained unchanged, except for the addition of the Early Gothic chapel. The church stands on a northeast-southwest orientation, irregular for a church. Its layout consists of a one-bay narthex at the base, a three-bay nave with two aisles in the middle, a single-bay transept with attached bays flanking the choir that were the bases to a pair of rectangular towers, one bay long and connected to a semicircular apse of the same length, and an ambulatory four bays long. There is an imbalance in the nave's aisles, though they are of the same length.

It is signed IOANNES / BELLINVS on a rock in the lower left.Exhibition of the work  Description and style  The work is among the first produced by the artist to show an immersive tranquility of the figures in the space that surrounds them, across the light and atmosphere. These elements suggest that the painter was possibly helped by a young Giorgione, or perhaps another student close to Bellini, at least according to the information provided by Vasari. The painting depicts the baptism of Christ in a fairly traditional composition, with Jesus at the center turned toward the viewer, while John the Baptist, at left,The descriptions in this article use proper right and proper left directions. baptizes him on a cliff and at right three angelic figures with gaudy dress (allegories of the three theological virtues) await.Il ‚ÄúBattesimo di Cristo‚Äù di Giovanni Bellini prestato dalla citt√† di Vicenza alla mostra delle Scuderie del Quirinale dedicata al grande pittore veneziano ‚Äì Comune di Vicenza On high, the figure of God the Father appears among cherubs and seraphim, which sends forth the dove of the Holy Spirit. The three feminine figures are also recall the angelic figures that are placed at the side of the baptized Christ, in traditional icons. The gilt line of the early dawn on the bottom semantically marks the desired territory of the divine. The man who is not the ordered center of the universe commands but constitutes all that lives in harmony.Chiesa di Santa Corona, Vicenza, Guida storico-artistica, Antiga edizioni, 2013, pag. 87. Some have attributed the angel in red to the hand of Giorgione. The hut on high and to the right symbolizes the Old Testament; at left, on the summit of the hills, the castle symbolizes the New Testament. As in traditional iconography, the water of the river stops at the feet of Christ, to avoid depicting his reflection (in icons, reflections aren't emitted from divine figures). Another symbolic element is the little red parrot, symbol of the Passion of Christ. An extraordinary part of the altarpiece is the exceptional smoothness of tones that tie together the landscape and the sky, that muffles the surroundings of the enveloped figures, in a surprising anticipation of the tonalism that later paintings of Giorgione and Tiziano Vecellio would display. That same luminous modulation‚Äînow incidental, now tenuous, now little present‚Äîemphasizes the divine axis that goes from the sculptural figure of Jesus to the figure of eternity, that does not reflect his pose and appearance. The landscape is ample and reposed. From the sky falls a warm light that suggests the valleys around the River Jordan. The wonderful result is a secure capture of the atmospheric perspective and the impasto-ed colors throughout.

As the editor of the San Francisco based Overland Monthly magazine (founded by Bret Harte), she became an early proponent of Jack London as a writer. She was the first to publish one of his short stories, \\"To the Man on Trail\\", in 1899, and wrote a promotional biography of London in Overland Monthly in 1900, which helped to establish his career. Later she was his business manager and neighbor. Netta was the aunt and foster mother of author Charmian Kittredge, whom she raised from the age of six. It was through Netta that London met Charmian, who became his lover and later his second wife. Netta also introduced London to the town of Glen Ellen, where he settled, developed a ranch, and spent his final years. Early years Netta was born in Delhi, Wisconsin, fourteen miles outside of Oshkosh. In April 1865, as the Civil War came to an end, the Wiley family left their rural log cabin, where all the children had been born, to move west. In the 1870 United States Census, Ninetta Wiley, aged 17, lived in Santa Barbara with her parents, Jacob S. Wiley (1831‚Äì1871) and Catherine Wiley (nee Growall). She was the second youngest of seven siblings, with Dayelle, Jay, Calista, Byron, and Harry, her younger brother. Marriage and family In 1875 at age 25, Netta married Roscoe L. Eames, 30, of Maine, the business manager of the San Francisco-based magazine Overland Monthly. They lived in Berkeley at 2147 Parker Street, on the corner of Fulton. When her older sister Daisey (Dayelle) died in 1877 from consumption, Netta and Roscoe effectively adopted her sister's six-year-old daughter Charmian Kittredge and raised her as their own. Even before her death, Daisey (a minor poet) and saloon owner Captain Willard Kittredge, had been indifferent parents and Netta had already been raising the young girl, even before marrying Roscoe.Stasz, Clarice \\"American Dreamers: Charmian and Jack London\\" St Martins Pr; 1 edition (November 1, 1988) , p. 10 After Daisy died, Williard gave Netta permission to raise Charmian as a foster parent. In 1886 Captain Kittredge became gravely ill and moved in with the Eames family but died soon after. Netta home schooled Charmian in subjects including literature, geography, and art, resulting in a well-rounded woman with a genuine love for music and the discipline to train herself to become an accomplished pianist, organist and singer. Netta instilled the ideals of feminism, vegetarianism, socialism and a modern outlook on sexual activities. Roscoe was frequently absent and involved with other women, but he taught Charmian typing and a special technique of shorthand. She was able to type in the 120 - 150 word-per-minute range. In the late 1890s Charmian, who had worked her way through Mills College in Oakland as a typist and typing instructor, became an assistant to Netta at Overland Monthly.Labor, Earle, \\"Jack London: An American Life\\", Farrar, Straus and Giroux, October 1, 2013 Through an 1899 lunch with Netta, a 28-year-old Charmian met Jack London, several years her junior, who periodically wrote for Overland Monthly. Netta encouraged Charmian to pursue Jack, but soon after they met, Jack married his math tutor. Charmian later wrote that Netta had been domineering and strict, but the relationship was close. Netta taught Charmian to be responsible, with a great deal of intellectual and sexual freedom, but extremely disciplined. Netta was not completely altruistic; Charmian had inherited from her parents, and some of this money was spent during her upbringing. Netta invested in the future of a child who might care for her in later years. Glen Ellen Netta owned a resort called Wake Robin in Glen Ellen California, northwest of the town of Sonoma sitting on 10 acres between Sonoma Creek and Wildwater Creek.London 1982 She invited Jack London and his family to visit in 1903, which was his introduction to Glen Ellen, where he would later buy a ranch, build a home, and where he died about 13 years later. It was on this trip that London wrote his novel The Sea Wolf and developed a relationship with Netta's niece Charmian Kittredge. She was aware of him through their prior meeting and his correspondence with Netta. London was injured when he fell from a buggy, and Netta arranged for Charmian to care for him. The two developed a friendship, as she, Netta, Roscoe, and London were politically aligned toward socialistic causes. At some point the relationship became romantic, and Jack divorced his wife to marry Charmian, who was five years his senior. Netta and Roscoe were proponents and practitioners of open marriage and \\"free love\\". Then women's suffrage, spiritualism, and free love were strongly connected. Advocates viewed sexual freedom as an expression of self-ownership. Sex laws discriminated against women, including marriage laws and prohibitions of contraception. Netta‚Äôs and Roscoe‚Äôs openness to sexual freedom were an influence on Charmian. In June 1905, prior to marrying Charmian, Jack bought the Hill ranch in Glen Ellen. Shortly after their marriage, the new couple took up residence nearby with Netta and Roscoe at Wake Robin, where an annex was built for them. In 1906 Jack and Charmian decided to circumnavigate the world. Netta's husband Roscoe managed the building of a 45-foot sailing yawl, the Snark, and Roscoe signed on as the skipper. While Roscoe, Charmian, and Jack were at sea, Netta managed Jack's ranch and his business affairs. Jack also gave her power of attorney for making publishing decisions in his absence. She secured an excellent $7,000 deal for the serial publishing of Martin Eden in Pacific Monthly magazine.Kershaw 1997 However, upon returning Jack was generally disappointed with her performance and some bad decisions.McAleer 2016 Netta and Jack remained close for many years with Jack referring to her as \\"My Mother, Mother Mine\\", but toward the end of his life the relationship soured, and she actually sued him over water rights on their adjacent lands. In 1913 Jack built a dam on his ranch and reduced the flow to his neighbors including Netta. Jack won the lawsuit but died soon after. Subsequent marriages On November 10, 1910 Netta divorced Roscoe Eames, after a two-year process based on grounds of desertion. She soon married her second husband, Vermont-born Edward Biron Payne (1847-1923), her boss and longtime lover. Jack and Charmian London attended their wedding. While Jack and Roscoe had been friends, they had a falling out during the Cruise of the Snark because Roscoe had overrepresented his experience as a seaman and his knowledge of navigation. Payne was a Unitarian minister. In 1894, he and thirty of his followers had founded Altruria, a short-lived Utopian community in Sonoma County, California. The group published the magazine the Altrurian, which informed its supporters of the colony and sought to promote its ideals and the formation of Altrurian clubs. Several such clubs were created in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. In 1923, Payne died leaving Netta a widow at 70 years old. Netta married her third husband, 72-year-old Fred Springer, in 1937 at age 85, becoming Ninetta Wiley Eames Payne Springer. Their wedding was in Eureka California. After their honeymoon in Northern California, they moved into her home at 1282 Oxford Street, Berkeley.Finacom 2012 Netta died on March 6, 1944 at age 91 in Alameda County, California. She never had children, though she continued a close motherly relationship with Charmian throughout her life.  Career In her early work, circa 1880s, Netta wrote about Mendocino County, and collaborated with A. O. Carpenter who photographed landscapes to be published with her travel stories. Charmian became a close friend of the Carpenter twins Grace and Grant. Grace was to become ‚ÄúThe Painter Lady‚Äù who painted the Pomo Native Americans. In December 1892 when Netta was 40 years old, an article she wrote about San Nicolas Island, \\"Three Weeks on a Weird Island\\", was published in Popular Monthly magazine. She had visited the island aboard the schooner Hattie, run by Captain Conlan and a crew of two others. In the party visiting the island were five passengers plus Captain Conaln and two crew members. One of the passengers, Professor Borland, ‚Äúan authority on geology and archaeology‚Äù, had been hired by the California State Mining Bureau ‚Äúto make a report of this island‚Äù. During the voyage, Netta's uncle, Edward Bruner, recounted his visit to see the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island in Santa Barbara with his father in 1853 when he was a young boy.Eames 1892 Netta became an editor and author, and for a time a follower of Charles Keeler's ‚ÄúCosmic Religion‚Äù.Rideout 2008 p 147 During the 1890s, Netta became an editor of the Overland Monthly where Roscoe worked as the business manager, and her niece Charmian helped out in her spare time by writing reviews and articles. She was the first to publish a Jack London story, and had published seven more London stories, at $7.50 per story, before she met him for lunch in 1899, with her niece Charmian, and became a promoter of his work.

Born in Scotland, his family moved to the United States when he was an infant, settling in Westchester County, north of New York City. The family initially lived in East Chester, and later moved closer to New York, building a family estate in what is now the Hunt's Point section of The Bronx. The location of the Faile mansion, Woodside, is now the site of the American Banknote printing plant. Faile ran a successful grocery business in downtown New York from 1821 to 1853. He was also involved in the railroad, insurance, and agriculture industries.  Early life and family  Thomas H. Faile, Edward's brother. Edward George Faile was born on February 9, 1799 to George and Joan Hall Faile, in Semiston, Roxboroughshire, Scotland. Joan descended from the Burrell family of Northumberland, England. The family moved to the United States in 1801, settling in the town of East Chester. A brother, Thomas, was born there in 1803. In the 1830s, the family acquired land in Hunt's Point and relocated there. Faile was educated in Westchester. At the age of 17, he went to work at the wholesale grocery business of Abram Valentine. He married Valentine's daughter, Ann Delia, on December 8, 1821. The couple had nine children: Ann D., Edward, Thomas H., Charles V., Henry, Samuel, Mary E., Harriet, and Caroline. Edward Faile was a member and his brother Thomas a governor, of The Society of the New York Hospital. They were both also members of the Supply Engine Company, a volunteer fire department in New York.  Businesses  Edward G. Faile Building (236 Front Street) in 1976In 1821, Faile opened a wholesale grocery in an existing building at 236 Front Street in downtown Manhattan. In 18271828, Faile built a new building at the same location, larger than the original. In 1828, the building was assessed at $10,000 for tax purposes. As of 1973, this building was vacant and leased to the South Street Seaport Museum. Faile brought his brother Thomas into the business in 1825, under the name of E. G. Faile & Co. In 1839 or 1840 (sources differ), he bought buildings at 165 John Street and 181 Front Street. The business moved to the later location, where he remained for thirteen years. In 1845, Faile built two new buildings, at 179 and 180 West Street, which he rented out. In 1843, Faile joined with several other sugar merchants in New York in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury John Spencer, complaining of excessive import duties imposed on brown sugar. Edward and his brother Thomas both retired in 1853, handing the firm over to their sons and to Richard Williams, changing the firm name to Faile, Williams, & Co. The business was eventually taken over by Charles V, as a sole proprietorship, located at 130 Water Street. The business ran into financial troubles starting in 1879, when it made a large purchase of tea stocks at the peak of the market. On November 25, 1882, the business failed due to losses from falling tea prices and fluctuations in the money market. At the time, the business had about $344,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in liabilities. Prior to the failure of the business, the company was one of the largest and oldest tea distributors in New York City. Faile was a director of both the New York & Harlem Railroad and the New York Central Railroad. In 1863, he campaigned to be president of the New York Central, attempting to take the position from Erastus Corning. Faile lost the election, receiving 60,039 votes to Corning's 124,802. Faile was also a director of the Firemen's Insurance Company and the Metropolitan Bank. Southern portion of The Village of West Farms in 1872, highlighting the location of the Faile Estate  Woodside  The Faile Mansion, Woodside The Faile family estate, Woodside, was in what is now the Hunt's Point section of The Bronx. In 1831, George Faile (Edward's father) purchased a tract of land from Barnard Bayley. The estate was further expanded between 1832 (when the mansion was built) and 1842, at a cost of $15,000. The estate occupied 85 acres, stretching from the Bronx River to beyond what is now Southern Boulevard. The mansion was described in Valentine's Manual of Old New York, as having an \\"imposing array of Doric columns\\", and as being \\"surrounded by a glorious forest\\". The estate included a working farm with Devon cattle, which Faile imported and bred. Several of his cattle won first prize at shows, including Cayuga, Huron, and Queen Ann. After his death, his family continued to reside at the estate. In 1898, a lawsuit was brought by Henry J. Crawford, claiming that Faile's deed to the estate was invalid. The issue was whether John Fleetwood Marsh properly conveyed title to Barnard Bayley, from whom George Faile purchased the property. The court found that the title was valid. In 1904, the estate, comprising 1299 lots, was sold to the Central Realty Bond & Trust Co for about $1,000,000. The property was described as \\"bounded by Dongan st, Intervale av, Southern Boulevard, Longwood av, Lafayette av, Hunt's Point road, Gilbert pl, and the Bronx River\\". By 1908, the estate had passed into the hands of George F. Johnson. In 1908, part of the estate was purchased by the American Bank Note Company. Woodside was razed in 1909 to clear the lot for construction of the company's new printing plant. Faile Street runs through the area.  Personal life  Grave of Edward G. Faile at Saint Paul's Church. Faile was an acquaintance of Richard March Hoe, who had an estate near his in Hunts Point. Hoe invented a machine for stamping and dating tickets, based on a suggestion made by Faile. Faile was a vestryman of St. Ann's Church in Morrisania. In 1863, he was president of the New York State Agricultural Society. His son, Thomas H., later became vice president and another son, Henry, a life member of the society. Faile died of pneumonia in his home on April 20, 1864. Funeral services were held at St. Ann's Church, and he was buried in the cemetery at Saint Paul's Church, (known at the time as East Chester Church) in Mount Vernon, New York.
