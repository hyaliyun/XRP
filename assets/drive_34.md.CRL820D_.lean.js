Details of his life are sketchy, though there are court documents that prove that in the 1770s he was accused of heresy. He is best known for an account of a journey of lunar discovery, Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures, which is credited as the first science fiction text written in the Americas. Biography Little is known of Rivas's life outside of the trial for heresy; his birth and death dates are unknown, though it appears he was already an old man by the time he was brought to trial. According to Rivas scholar Miguel √Ångel Fern√°ndez Delgado, he arrived in Yucat√°n in 1742, and soon started \\"making enemies and trouble for himself.\\" He deviated from orthodoxy by believing, for instance, that heavenly bodies affected human behavior (denying free will), reading banned books, and criticizing the veneration of saints. Apparently he printed leaflets critical of his fellow churchmen and distributed them. His behavior was so offensive that he was put on trial in 1775, a trial which revealed his speculative book on lunar travel. He was accused of believing in astrology, of proposing a \\"branch of hell in the Sun's center,\\" and of endorsing the heliocentrism of Nicolaus Copernicus. An accusation of sodomy was dropped quickly. His Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures was one of the main pieces of evidence; fortunately for him, the court judged it to be a fable, and charges were withdrawn. Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures =Textual history= The full title of Rivas's 11-folio booklet is translated in English as Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of M√©rida of the Yucat√°n by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the Moon, and Addressed to the Scholar Don Ambrosio de Echevarria, Reciter of Funeral Kyries in the Parish of Jesus of Said City, and Presently Teacher of Logarithm in the Town of Mama of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, in the Year of the Lord 1775. No actual date of composition is given in the manuscript. The manuscript was rediscovered in 1958 by Pablo Gonz√°lez Casanova, \\"hidden among the dusty volumes of the National Archives in Mexico City\\"‚Äîin fact, among the documents compiled by the Inquisition pertaining to Rivas's trial. It was referenced in a 1977 study of Mexican literature, but was not commented on or published until 1994. An extensive study of Rivas and his lunar narrative was published in 1995 by Delgado, who published a complete, critical edition of the text in 2001. =Genesis= Rivas was evidently influenced by European narratives of lunar exploration, including Lucian's True History, Sir Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, Johannes Kepler's Somnium, Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone, John Wilkins' Discovery of a New World, Cyrano de Bergerac's The Voyage to the Moon, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, and Voltaire's Microm√©gas. =Contents= Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures (syzygy and quadrature are terms in astronomy) consists of two parts‚Äîthe first is an account of a lunar voyage by a Frenchman, On√©simo Dutalon in epistolary form, and it precedes another letter containing an astronomical almanac. Both are addressed to a Don Ambrosio de Echevarria (an \\"observer of lunar movements\\") and are written by \\"anctitones\\", the inhabitants of the Moon. In their first letter, the anctitones write to Echevarria about a visit they received from On√©simo Dutalon, a French astronomer, who had written them a very informative and erudite letter with data about syzygies and quadrature. They are pondering how to respond to the letter when Dutalon shows up on the Moon in a flying vessel, evidently propelled by wings. Dutalon tells them his life story, and shares his astronomical information and, among others, the theories of Isaac Newton and the philosophy of Ren√© Descartes‚Äîaccording to Delgado, Dutalon is the \\"obvious mouthpiece of Rivas.\\" While the president of the Moon university is preparing a welcome speech, an interruption comes in the form of a \\"legion of space demons\\", who have stopped on their way to the Sun where they are taking the soul of a materialist. Satan had apparently refused this soul in order to preserve order in his domain; Dutalon explains that hell is actually placed in the Sun, a theory he based on that of an Anglican scholar.The Anglican is called \\"Sevid√≠n\\", a reference to M. Swinden, author of Investigation of the Nature of the Fire of Hell and the Place Where it is Found (Leiden, 1733), according to Delgado. See Dziubinskyj, 29 note 16. The letter is signed by the president of the Moon university. The anctitones provided fodder for the Inquisition's trial: as it happens, they have studied Earth and its inhabitants for a long time, and question various elements on earthly history. For instance, they have doubts about Biblical chronology, and about \\"the mythological return of the Messiah\\". They also recall the legend of Pha√´ton, whose fiery accident burned the lunar records, forcing them to start their history anew, in \\"a new Lunar Era,\\" now 7,914,522 years ago. The second letter contains \\"strange\\" anctitone remarks on different Earthly chronologies, and ends with a detailed almanac and notes on stellar observations for the year 1775. =English translation= The first full English translation of Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures was published in the journal Eleven Eleven in 2015.Manuel Antonio de Rivas (2015) \\"Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures\\", trans.

As the co-founder of Miramar Images, Inc. and Sacred Earth Pictures, Nickman's career in film and television spans three decades. Career Nickman's career in film and television began as a studio camera person and editor with the ABC in Sydney, Australia. Upon returning to the United States. and graduating with a degree in communications from Washington State University, Nickman then produced and created stage and lighting designs for leading-edge, live multi-media concerts combining rock bands with symphony orchestras along with his filmed images projected onto large screens above the performers. Most notably, \\"Leviticus\\"Washington State University with Inner City Symphony Orchestra and rock group Winship and \\"Trinity\\"Seattle Symphony Orchestra with rock group Alpha Centauri and the Daryl Hansen Dance Troupe, 1973 performed by the Seattle Symphonye orchestra. After directing and producing live productions, Nickman returned to television as a news photographer with NBC affiliate KING T.V. out of Seattle, Washington. He eventually became a senior producer and director in the production department and produced and directed the Emmy Award-winning television program REV, an innovative rock and roll series featuring live music performances, music reviews and comedy sketches.\\"REV It Up\\", Seattle Times Arts & Entertainment, January 8, 1984.

Nickman went on to co-found Miramar Images with the release of Natural States (1985) featuring the music of David Lanz and Paul Speer. The film was one of the largest selling, non-theatrical releases of its time and recognized as one of the top 10 videos by People magazine.Picks & Pans, People Weekly, December 26-January 2, 1989. Natural States went double platinum, selling more than 100,000 copies, and launched the success of Miramar Images.\\"Miramar ‚Äî A Crystal Clear Picture of Success\\", Business Wise, Nov/Dec 1989. Miramar then released two more of Nickman's films, Desert Vision, and Canyon Dreams and earned Tangerine Dream a Grammy nomination for their music score.Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Desk, January 10, 1992. In 1990, Nickman directed and co-produced The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey, the first of the Mind's Eye series, a collection of animated computer-generated imagery (CGI). His body of work, which also includes Planetary Traveler and Infinity's Child has firmly established him as a computer-generated imagery (CGI) pioneer and a master of long-form films that use music as the primary narrative. Nickman's film, The Mind's Eye, was a double platinum-selling film considered to be a milestone in the field of computer animation and reached number 12 on Billboard‚Ä≤s video hits chart. Combining the artistry of numerous computer animators from around the world with a score by James Reynolds, The Mind's Eye is credited with giving rise to such films as Toy Story. Animation Magazine reviewer Karl Rathcke wrote the film was \\"... the type of audio-visual 'head trip' for the 90's that Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was for the 60's.\\"Animation Magazine, Video Reviews, September/October 1991. In 1995 Nickman's feature film \\"Third Stone from the Sun\\" was released. The film received the Gold Special Jury Award (top honors) at the Houston International Film Festival and also screened at the first International Environmental Film Festival in Boulder, Colorado, and the Seattle International Film Festival. Donald Liebenson of the Chicago Tribune described Nickman's next release, Planetary Traveler, as \\"boldly [going] where no computer animation video has gone before.\\"Chicago Tribune, October 16, 1997. At a time when computer animation was created solely on dedicated computer graphics work stations, Planetary Traveler became the first original, full-length program ever created entirely on standard desk-top computers. The seminal work was the result of a two-year collaboration by Nickman with seven artists from five different states via the internet. Former Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger composed the music score. As a result, Nickman was invited to give the keynote address at the MacWorld Conference in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in November 1997. The sequel to Planetary Traveler is titled Infinity's Child and was released by Sacred Earth Pictures in 2009. Two of Nickman's most recent films, Echoes of Creation and Sacred Earth began airing on Public Television nationwide in 2015. Both films are true to his signature fusing of picture to music and were specifically designed as a way for viewers to connect emotionally with the beauty of our planet, rather than intellectualize it through a discussion about it. Using music as the narrative, Echoes of Creation is a 40-minute journey through Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and as far south as California, featuring a soundtrack by Grammy nominated composer David Arkenstone and spoken word by Karen Hutton. Its prequel Sacred Earth also follows Nickman's unique fusion of picture to music throughout the American Southwest, featuring music by Grammy-nominated composer David Lanz and spoken word by Academy Award-winning actor Linda Hunt and in the finale features a dance performance by Caroline Richardson, former First Soloist with the National Ballet of Canada.

Sonny is the only biological child of supercouple, Justin Kiriakis (Wally Kurth) and Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis (Judi Evans). Sonny's birth was announced in 1991. Developed under head writer Dena Higley, Sonny was introduced in 2011 by executive producers Ken Corday and Gary Tomlin as Justin and Adrienne's openly gay son ‚Äì the show's first regular character to be openly gay. His major stories included a gay bashing storyline and the development of his romance with Will Horton (Chandler Massey) who is just coming to terms with his own sexuality. In 2014, Sonny and Will (then Guy Wilson) marry, becoming the first male-male couple to legally marry in the history of American daytime television drama. Sonny is also known for his friendship and business dealings with Chad DiMera (Casey Deidrick, later Billy Flynn) ‚Äì a relationship that nearly gets him killed when their sports website is taken over by an illegal gambling operation. In 2014, the series introduced Sonny's closeted first love, the world-famous baseball player, Paul Narita (Christopher Sean) and a romantic triangle develops between Sonny, Paul, and Will (who also falls for Paul). Smith vacated the role in 2015, and Sonny was written out of the show by his relocation to Paris in August 2015. Smith later briefly reappeared as Sonny that October, before returning again as a regular player in July 2016. In February 2020, it was announced that Smith would again exit the role. Smith became a fan favorite during his initial stint as one half of the show's first same-sex supercouple with Will Horton, and then in the romantic pairing with Paul Narita. The two couples are commonly referred to by the portmanteaus \\"WilSon\\" and \\"PaulSon\\". Smith won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series in 2015, and earned a nomination for the same award in 2013. Sonny's arrival on Days of Our Lives in 2011 began an era of storylines featuring gay characters in prominent roles on Days, and in 2012 the show won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Daily Drama, followed by successive wins in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

However, by January 2008, the family relocate again to Dubai. Justin returns to Salem in 2009, with Adrienne returning the following year. Sonny returns to Salem in the summer of 2011 and immediately decides to live as openly gay in Salem. Sonny comes out to his extended family, including his great uncle Victor (John Aniston). While Victor is supportive of his nephew, he is worried about how others will react. Sonny settles into his life getting a job an internship as a legal aid for the district attorney, reconnects with his family and develops fast friendships with Will Horton (Chandler Massey), Chad DiMera (Casey Deidrick) and Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus), who accept him despite their friend T's (Brendan Coughlin) homophobic disapproval. Sonny later partners up with Chad and Will to launch a website for sports fans at Salem University. However, they are forced to shut the website down when criminals begin using it for illegal gambling. The criminals kidnap Gabi, Chad, Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett) and Sonny's cousin Abigail Deveraux (Kate Mansi) forcing Sonny, Will and Austin Reed (Patrick Muldoon) to come to their rescue. Sonny and Chad embark on another business venture when they open Common Grounds coffee shop together. Sonny wants the shop to be a place where people from all walks of life can feel accepted. When Will chooses not to be involved, Sonny suspects he is keeping his distance because he is questioning his sexuality. Trying to be supportive, Sonny often invites Will to hang out with him and his friends. When Will confides in Sonny about his feelings in the summer of 2012, Sonny realizes he has fallen for him and kisses him, only for Will to reject him. T accuses Sonny of making Will gay and physically assaults him. Sonny is comforted by his friends and family and Victor even threatens T. Sonny and Will begin dating when Will officially comes out only for Will's father Lucas (Bryan Dattilo) to disapprove. However, once Sonny makes it clear that he definitely loves Will, Lucas becomes more accepting. With their relationship going so well, Sonny agrees to lend Will some money. Meanwhile, Sonny notices tension between Chad and the pregnant Gabi but Chad refuses to give him an explanation. In January 2013, as Gabi is set to marry Will's cousin Nick Fallon (Blake Berris), Chad interrupts the wedding by announcing Nick is not the father of her baby, forcing Will - the best man - to reveal himself as the father. A devastated Sonny demands answers from Chad who reveals that Gabi was behind the scheme to kidnap his then girlfriend Melanie‚Äîbut he did not know Will was her baby's father. Sonny reconciles with Will but is very wary of trusting Gabi and Nick. Sonny's suspicions prove true when Nick blackmails Will into signing away his parental rights in exchange for Nick keeping quiet about Will shooting EJ DiMera (James Scott) in 2007. Nick and Sonny later get into a fight, forcing Will to go to his mother Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) for help. Sonny supports Will and Sami's plans to ingratiate themselves to crime lord Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) in hopes that he will destroy the evidence against Will. Meanwhile, Sonny and Sami steal Nick's copies of the recordings of Will's confession. In May 2013, Sonny and Will follow Nick and Gabi, who are being held at gun point by an armed gunman. They rescue Gabi and Will stays behind to rescue Nick. However, Gabi goes into labor and Sonny helps her deliver her daughter, Arianna Horton, in an abandoned shack. Sonny is distraught when Will gets shot trying to rescue Nick but, fortunately, he pulls through. After Gabi splits with Nick, Sonny convinces her to move in with them so they can raise Arianna together. Later, Sonny and Will are furious to learn that Gabi is seeing Nick again and Gabi threatens to move out with Arianna if they don't back off. They are relieved when Gabi soon breaks up with Nick on her own. After Nick mysteriously disappears, claiming to have left town‚ÄîWill realizes Sami, Gabi and his grandmother Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) are hiding something and Will assumes they are planning a surprise birthday party for him. Sonny listens in on one of their conversations at Will's request only to learn that the three women are covering up Nick's apparent murder having disposed of his body in the river. The three women convince Sonny to keep quiet insisting that Gabi killed Nick in self-defense. After he convinces Will to keep quiet, Sonny begins having nightmares about Nick. They are all shocked when Nick crashes Arianna's christening in January 2014 appearing to have amnesia. While everyone including Sonny remained suspicious of Nick, Gabi falls back into old habits and Sonny warns her away from him. Meanwhile, Sonny proposes to Will (Guy Wilson) and he rejects him saying he wants to wait for the situation with Nick to be resolved. However, thanks to his grandmother Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) -- Will officially accepts Sonny's proposal on Valentine's Day. The duo are married by Marlena on April 3, 2014, at Victor's mansion in front of their family and friends. As the newly weds settle into their life, Sonny and Gabi butt heads over her reconciliation with Nick. While he put on a facade for Gabi, Nick shows his true colors with everyone else threatening to send Gabi, Kate and Sami to jail for his attempted murder. Sonny goes so far as to steal a gun from Victor's house and keep it for protection and Will urges him to return the gun only for Nick to be shot to death the following day. Will confesses to the crime fearing Sonny is responsible but Sonny quickly reveals he is innocent. Gabi later confesses to killing Nick after overhearing his threats to Sonny. With Gabi in prison, Sonny and Will promise to stay in touch with her. As they start their new life, Sonny appeals to Victor who pulls some strings to get Will hired at True Vista magazine. Sonny is wary when Will's first article focuses on his mother Sami's attempt to destroy her husband EJ because he has cheated on her. Sonny tries to get him to drop the article but Will refuses. Sonny is furious when the article hits the press identifying Abigail as EJ's mistress. It is revealed that Sami leaked Abby's identity to the editor. Meanwhile, Chad (Billy Flynn) returns to Salem and Sonny resents him for abandoning their club. Sonny buys out Chad allowing him a larger share of the profits and Chad also agrees to finance a second location for a new club. After EJ's murder, Sonny reluctantly gives Will his blessing to accompany the grieving Sami to Hollywood where he will work on the screenplay about Sami's life for a film. Tied up n his work, Will neglects Sonny who struggles to build the new club. He is forced to clear out his and Will's joint savings account to finance the club. Meanwhile, Sonny is reunited with his ex- boyfriend, world-famous baseball player, Paul Narita (Christopher Sean). The closeted Paul wants to reunite with Sonny who quickly reveals he is married. Will and Ari return just in time for Christmas and he starts work on a top secret article for SONIX magazine. Just before the article's release, Derrick (Spencer Neville), a customer at Sonny's club, inadvertently reveals to Sonny that Will and Paul are having an affair. A furious Sonny goes to confront Will only to be stabbed and left for dead by one of Victor's enemies. Victor and his wife Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers) discover Sonny and rush him to the hospital where he undergoes emergency surgery. Sonny initially wakes up with amnesia from the trauma but as his memories of the attack return‚Äîso does his anger toward Will. Sonny is shocked when he receives a visit from Paul and forces him to confirm the affair and throws him out. Sonny then confronts a defensive Will who confesses that he believes Sonny only married him because Paul had rejected him. Upset, Sonny decides separation is best and goes to Arizona to visit his brother Alex. Sonny later goes to Paris to work for Victor managing clubs and casinos. In October 2015, Sonny is devastated to learn Will has been murdered and he returns home to attend the funeral. Sonny leaves town again unable to shake the memories of Will and returns to Paris. In July 2016, Sonny moved back to Salem and within time, rekindles his relationship with Paul. In 2017, Sonny is named CEO of Titan Industries and also becomes engaged to Paul. Development =Casting and creation= In May 2011 rumors circulated that Freddie Smith‚Äîknown for his recent portrayal of Marco Salazar, a gay character from The CW's Teen drama 90210‚Äîwas slated to join the cast of Days of Our Lives in a new gay role. On June 17, 2011, Entertainment Weekly confirmed exclusively that Smith had been cast in the role of Sonny, an openly gay character‚Äîconnected to a previously established family. Sonny was reported at the time to be Days first openly gay character, but in fact Sonny is the second, following Ryan Scott's openly gay Harold Wentworth who featured in the show from 2001 to 2003. Smith talked about his new role, saying: \\"I'm very excited to portray him\\"; and \\"I love that I can do a role like this, stand up and speak out on what I believe in. I want to show that it's okay\\". Smith relished in playing a role \\"that makes a difference\\" and said it \\"makes my job that much better ‚Äì and to be a part of history; I'll go down in the history books, I mean it's great!\\" Smith originally auditioned with Days in March 2011 for a different character‚Äîa high school quarterback. After several meetings with the director of casting, Marnie Saitta, Smith learned that he would instead be playing a gay character. Thanks to his experience on 90210, Smith had very little reservations about playing the role of Sonny. Smith screen-tested opposite Judi Evans who would play his mother, Adrienne. \\"I had an inkling I would get [the role] because Judi and I clicked so well\\" Smith said of his audition. Smith believed he got the role of Sonny because he can relate to him so easily. Despite being straight in real life, Smith said \\"When I read the scripts, I just get it instantly.\\" He revealed that the casting department was quite impressed by his audition. In his portrayal, Smith said \\"I do as much work on the character as I can to make it as real as possible and to tell a good story.\\" To prepare for the role, Smith did a lot of research and also went to his own gay friends for advice. \\"I started reading through people's personal stories and these feelings, and it brings me that much closer to the LGBT community.\\" Entertainment Weekly first reported on the plans the for usually conservative Days of Our Lives to introduce its first character in March 2011. Co-executive producer Greg Meng gave an interview to Frontiers magazine where he discussed how Sonny came about. \\"This has been discussed for a long time with a lot of thought. And yes, there were concerns, but it's like, 'Wow. Who are we? What are we thinking? It is time!' We didn‚Äôt want to do some gay love story, or just go off on some extreme ripped-from-the-headlines political story, just to be telling a ‚Äògay story.‚Äô We are looking at a long-term, longtime beloved characters type of situation for Sonny. It is about a character who is now on the show, and who by the way, is gay!\\" As Sonny hit airwaves, there were rumors of some opposition from certain affiliates who had threatened to stop airing the series if the story continued. Despite the potential push back, Meng said that executives across the board, from both NBC and Sony were in support of the story. Smith explained that the producers \\"really did not want to go in a stereotypical\\" direction with the story. \\"They wanted to show different aspects of the story and that went into the casting of Sonny.\\" =Characterization= Freddie Smith described Sonny as \\"the center of attention kind of guy in a good way.\\" He continued, Sonny is \\"very confident and mature.\\" Sonny is very \\"open-minded.\\" According to Smith, when Sonny makes mistakes, he learns from them. Smith described Sonny as \\"so colorful and three-dimensional. He's such an interesting character.\\" Greg Meng said the character was envisioned as \\"the guy next door, but yet has strength, vulnerability and charm.\\" Meng also said \\"the plan is for Sonny to be very responsible.\\" According to Smith, \\"Sonny is a positive character\\" usually. =Introduction (2011)= What sets Sonny's introduction apart from the introductions of other gay characters is \\"that he was comfortable, and out, and even his family was accepting of him\\" Smith said. He continued, \\"They just wanted to show that when you come out and you are with the people you trust and love‚Äîyou can finally get out from under that rock, and just be who you are.\\" The openly gay Sonny slowly eases into canvas as he develops relationships with those he comes in contact with. Unlike most character introductions, Sonny is not immediately thrust into a romance. Already four months into his tenure, Smith insisted that he \\"legitimately\\" did not know who his love interest would be but he was excited because it was all people were talking about. Smith added that giving Sonny a love interest would make him much more \\"dimensional\\" as a character. \\"Everyone on the show has a boy or a girl, and I am like the fifth wheel\\" he joked. However, Smith came to appreciate the waiting period. \\"It was important for people to get to know Sonny as a person and not just as this gay character on the show, who is dating another gay character.\\" One consistent theme with Sonny is that he is very open about his sexuality. While his parents are worried about how others will react‚Äîparticularly Sonny's great uncle Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) -- \\"Sonny is very comfortable. He'll tell anyone\\" Smith said. Smith explained that Sonny \\"just wants his friends and family to accept him for who he is.\\" Victor's support is something Sonny never questions because of how close they are. While said it would have been cool to do a coming-out story with Sonny he appreciated how comfortable Sonny is with being openly gay because \\"It showed that it's great to have a support system. It made it easier for him to come out.\\" Not only does Sonny's introduction make him the only representation of a gay character on daytime television at the time as All My Children's iconic lesbian character, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) made her final appearances when the soap went off the air in September 2011, he was also the first \\"official\\" gay character in Days of Our Lives's 47-year history. = Gay bashing (2012) = Upon his arrival in 2011, Sonny's life seemed very easy going and Freddie Smith hinted that \\"At some point, there will be conflict in Sonny's story.\\" Meanwhile, his uncle Victor's only concern is how other people will react to his nephew. In the summer of 2012 during an interview with Outlook Media Smith revealed that Sonny would be involved in a bullying storyline. Smith previewed the storyline during and interview and said \\"it's told very well, and I think it's important to show storylines like that because it happens in real life all the time.\\" He insisted the importance of showing \\"how [bullying] affects people.\\" When Brendan Coughlin reprises his recurring role as Tad \\"T\\" Stevens in the summer of 2012‚ÄîT and Sonny are already at odds. \\"He did not like Sonny because he is gay, he is a gay basher\\" Smith said of T. So when T returns to town and finds out his best friend Will Horton (Chandler Massey) has recently come out of the closet‚ÄîT blames Sonny for it.\\" Sonny has already experienced this before and the incident with T \\"brings him back -- he thought he was home free. [It's] disappointing to him. He was very bullet proof at first.\\" Smith explained that Sonny already \\"came to terms with who he is, and he thought all of this was in his past.\\" The ordeal kind of shocks him. Smith admitted to having his own experience being bullied but described it as \\"very mild.\\" However, he knew of others that had worse experiences and thought it was a good reason that the plot address the \\"huge issue.\\" For about two weeks, the series shows the emotional effects of the bullying from Sonny's point of view and how he works through those emotions. One particular scene shows Sonny being comforted by his father, Justin (Wally Kurth). \\"It turned out to be such a great scene\\" Smith remarked. He continued, \\"It's important to have family there under circumstances like that.\\" The storyline culminated with Sonny retaliating against his attacker Tad \\"T\\" Stevens (Brendan Coughlin). \\"I personally wouldn't go after someone like that\\" Smith said but he defended Sonny's actions by saying \\"our emotions run wild and we don't always think. We just react.\\" Smith praised his costar Brendan Coughlin for his portrayal of T. \\"I just react off of him. He really scares me and makes me feel like crap.\\" The storyline also afforded Smith with the opportunity to speak to congress about an anti-bullying campaign. = Departure (2015) = On April 3, 2015, Michael Goldberg of Serial Scoop reported that Smith would be leaving the series. However, neither the network or the show runners were available to comment at press time. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens revealed that he had contacted the show's publicist but had yet to receive a response. Soap Opera Digest reported that Smith had decided to leave the series on his own accord. Smith who finished taping scenes in March 2015 confirmed his exit to Soap Opera Digest in May 2015 and revealed that the door was left open for his character to return. He revealed that he wanted to pursue other endeavors such as producing and directing. Not even his Daytime Emmy win could make Smith rethink his decision to vacate the role of Sonny. \\"During the press conference after his win, Smith said \\"I think it‚Äôs a reminder [of DAYS] but it‚Äôs also pushing me into the future; letting me spread my wings and move on. It represents a lot of things ‚Äî the future and the past, if you will.\\" \\"Working 60 hours a week on DOOL, I had all my focus on the show. In order for me to direct and pursue films, I had to make the tough decision and leave the show.\\" Smith had signed a four- year contract, and \\"I knew my contract was coming to an end and the big decision had to be made.\\" He continued \\"as an actor, I wanted to step outside of my comfort zone.\\" Smith met with executive producer Ken Corday and the production team to inform them of his decision. \\"They even said the door was always open, which is the best compliment I could have received\\" the actor said of the show's support of him. Smith's final scenes aired on August 18, 2015 and he posted a heartfelt message to fans on his Facebook page. \\"As Freddie I was genuinely sad, and so was the character\\" Smith said of his final day on set. \\"It was very emotional.\\" Smith explained that his desire to try other things contributed to his decision not to sign another contract earlier in the year. \\"I have a few films that are already in preproduction. They'll go into production very soon.\\" In story, Sonny leaves town to work for his uncle Victor in Europe after his marriage to Will falls apart due to Will's affair with Sonny's boyfriend, Paul Narita (Christopher Sean). Smith appreciated that the character had experienced some pain and drama. \\"Before the story [with Paul and Will] start, I remember thinking, 'Sonny's so happy. Can he just yell once in a while?'\\" Smith insisted that Sonny could definitely return. Only a month after Freddie Smith's final scenes aired, rumors circulated that Guy Wilson's Will Horton was to be killed off in October. Days historian Jason47 reported that Smith would briefly reprise the role of Sonny to help facilitate Wilson's departure. Smith told Soap Opera Digest that he was literally contacted by the series to briefly reprise his role the following week after he finished filming scenes in March 2015. \\"It was very top secret\\" he remarked. A month later, he was contacted again about details of his return and informed that Will Horton was being killed off. \\"It was the last thing I would have imagined.\\" Due to the nature of his swift return, \\"It felt like I was away for a long weekend.\\" Smith filmed four episodes which started airing on October 12, 2015. He last aired on October 22 as a grief-stricken Sonny leaves town again as it is too painful to remain in Salem. \\"With Will being gone, I felt like there was a closure\\" Smith said of his return. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Smith revealed that Guy Wilson had contacted him in secret to inform him of the decision to kill of the character and he was officially contacted by the network after. Smith felt the need to explain his prior statements about how he felt \\"closure\\" at the end of the story. \\"The good closure not on the love story, but the closure in the sense that Sonny has to go back to see his husband. If he didn‚Äôt go back ‚Äì it‚Äôs terrible that he died ‚Äì no one wants that ‚Äì but as the character, you would obviously go back and see your husband. It was just an interesting end to the whole thing.\\" = Return (2016) = On February 3, 2016, a picture of actor Vincent Irizarry and Judi Evans on set showed a person resembling Freddie Smith working in the background. Though Irizarry claimed that the person was just a stagehand, many immediately speculated that Smith was set to return to the series. Soap Opera Digest officially confirmed the news of Smith's return in April 2016. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps reported that Smith had been filming new episodes for several months which would begin airing in July 2016. Smith gave a statement to the magazine about his return. \\"I am beyond excited about returning home to Salem. Sonny is back and it's going to be amazing!\\" On May 27, 2016, Smith's official fan account on Twitter announced that the actor had signed a new deal with the soap. Soap Opera Digest announced that Sonny's return to the canvas was slated for July 26. Of his return, Smith revealed that he was contacted about reprising the role of Sonny in November 2015, shortly after he last aired and said he was happy to be welcome back to the show. Of his return, Smith said \\"you're going to see a mature side to Sonny.\\" =Second departure (2020)= On February 12, 2020, on his podcast, Smith announced that he and Massey had been let go from their roles. Detailing the exit, Smith stated: \\"Essentially what happened is we came back ‚Ä¶ so we had that big two-and-a-half month or nine-week break. I was under the impression ‚Äî I knew this going back, that I was coming back for six episodes and contracts hadn‚Äôt been signed yet. I said, 'Great, there are a lot of things going on over there, a lot of things are up in the air. Great I am coming back for six episodes.' We hit people up [via] DM from the show and Chandler and I were trying to figure out if we were the only two coming back for six or are there other people that are just coming back for six. Once we got confirmation that other people were coming back for six, we figured 'Okay, good, we are not getting written off.' As the scripts started coming in, we started talking more. I just go , 'Man, this doesn‚Äôt look good. This doesn‚Äôt look like we are going to be signed onto a contract.'\\" Smith made his last appearance on September 1, 2020.  Reception  Laurisa Mahlin from Soap Central expressed that \\"Sonny came into town with a bag of awesome slung over his shoulder\\" and that she adores Justin and Adrienne's kid. Tony from Soap Central also stated \\"Sonny has Justin's charm, Adrienne's common sense, and Victor's persuasive streak.\\" The character of Sonny Kiriakis has been received well with critics and the audience. The Will and Sonny romance has also gained a lot of fan support and critical success, TV Guide has said that \\"While it took 45 years for the show to introduce its first openly gay character (Sonny) and another year and a half to find him a male partner (Will) the wait was well worth it. This steamy, star-crossed saga has had its drama to spare (paranoia, blackmail, impossible parents!), but its success lies in the fresh easy charm of these young men.\\" TV Source Magazine named Will and Sonny best couple of 2012 in the Days of Our Lives series, saying \\"One of the most refreshing things about Will and Sonny's relationship is it's portrayed just as any heterosexual couple. Watching them grow from friends to being in love was one of the highlights of the year for DAYS.\\" Smith's portrayal of Sonny earned him a nomination for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series at the 40th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2013. He won that award at the 42nd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2015.

The aircraft was destroyed and the designer killed in a soaring accident on 22 May 2004. Design and development The Scimitar was intended to use new aerodynamic technology to achieve higher performance in a competition sailplane. The aircraft mated a Schempp-Hirth Ventus fuselage with a wing of the same planform as the Schempp- Hirth Discus, outfitted with an electronic boundary layer control system. The aircraft was made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and fiberglass with Kevlar wing skins. Its span wing initially employed a Wortmann FX 79-K-144 airfoil. The sole example was registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration in the Experimental - Amateur-built category. Operational history The aircraft was involved in a minor accident on 25 April 1998 when trying to land after hitting sinking air while ridge soaring near Scrabble, West Virginia. While landing in a short length field the pilot ground looped the aircraft to avoid hitting a tree. The Scimitar was destroyed on 22 May 2004 while flying in the US Nationals near Alexandria, Pennsylvania. Masak was attempting to cross a ridge line and struck a tree, resulting in his death.

He became the second husband of the successful writer Barbara Hofland in 1810. Hofland exhibited 72 paintings at the Royal Academy but the main source of their income was his wife's writing. He was a founder member of the Society of British ArtistsLabel on painting at Derby Museum, read August 2011 where he exhibited over 100 paintings. It was said that he helped found the Society, because he had not been made a member of the Royal Academy.Hofland biography , GAC, accessed August 2011 In 1819 Hofland illustrated a book written by his wife about the Duke of Marlborough's house.A descriptive account of the mansion and gardens of White-Knights: a seat of His Grace the Duke of Marlborough, Mrs. Hofland.

Fishing scene at Dovedale by Hofland In 1839, whilst living beside the Thames he published a book entitled \\"The British angler's manual\\" which set out to describe and advice about all aspects of fly-fishing, angling and trolling. Hofland said that he had spent a long time preparing this book as he had practised his fishing whilst landscape painting. Hofland's book concentrated particularly on trout fishing and is lavishly illustrated with his own paintings and drawings which were engraved by W.R.Smith. Hofland's book describes various counties but Hampshire and Derbyshire are selected for special mention. He lists the rivers of Derbyshire, covering the Erwash (sic) in a few sentences. The River Dove (that inspired Isaac Walton's famous book) and then page after page of Dovedale where he had spent many days sketching and angling in the company of fellow artists like Ebenezer Rhodes from Sheffield.

Unlike most 3D games, every object in 3D Pixel Racing is made of multi-colored voxels that are reminiscent of old 8-bit games from the 1970s and 80's. Gameplay The gameplay in 3D Pixel Racer is similar to other basic driving games. Players choose a driver, car and gameplay mode, and compete in a series of events in that mode to unlock new cars, tracks, and drivers. Every track in the game has several checkpoints at which player's total race times are logged, so players can replay tracks to get the best time. The game controls in the Wii version are nearly the same as those in Mario Kart Wii; the Wii Remote is held in the sideways position and used to simulate a steering wheel. The iOS version of the game uses the iPhone's built in accelerometer as a steering wheel, and two buttons on the touch-screen to control the cars' gas and brake. =Gameplay Modes= There are five different gameplay modes in 3D Pixel Racing: Single Race, Championship, Time Trial, Capture the Flag, and Hot Pursuit. Every gameplay mode supports both single-player and multiplayer games with up to four players. Single Race Players choose a driver, track and vehicle from the ones they have unlocked, and compete against seven computer- controlled drivers, or other players in a three-lap circuit race. Single race is the only mode in the game that does not count towards unlocking items or completing the game. Championship In Championship mode players choose a vehicle and compete against seven other drivers in a series of eight races called a cup. At the end of every race in the series each driver is awarded a set number of points based on their finishing position. The driver with the most points at the end of the last race wins the cup. Winning cups in Championship mode is the easiest way to unlock new items in 3D Pixel Racing, and is mandatory for completing the game. Time Trial Players race against the clock around a series of tracks in Time Trial mode. A time trial event is lost if the time on the clock expires before the set number of laps has been completed. In multiplayer time trials all the players race on the same track, but are clocked and scored separately. Capture the Flag Capture the Flag is similar to a circuit race with the addition of a checkered flag on the ground just past the starting line. The flag is picked up by the first car to touch it and is carried by that car until it is hit by another vehicle. When the car carrying the flag gets hit possession of the flag changes to the offensive car. Gameplay continues in this fashion for the remainder of the three-lap race. The race is won by the player who possesses the flag at the end of the third lap. Hot Pursuit Players are pursued by a police car around any one of the race courses while being timed. The event is lost if the player is caught by the police car, or fails to outrun the police car before the clock runs out. In multiplayer one player drives the police car and the other players must outrun them.

After training as a stonemason in M√ºnster and Munich he worked on various Munich building sites. In 1903 Bleeker received his first public contract to build a monument in Miesbach. He built a fountain with a sculpture of Saint Michael slaying the dragon. \\"This work is still influenced by a typically neobaroque style, represented by his teacher R√ºmann and other numerous artist-colleagues.\\" Later he came under the influence of Adolf von Hildebrand, probably the most significant sculptor of that time. Bleeker is supposed to be one of the main representatives of the Munich School of Sculptors, a significant bust sculptor and a builder of neo-classical monomuents. In 1912 he founded with others the \\"Neue M√ºnchener Secession\\". In 1918 he started teaching at the Munich Academy and became a full professor (\\"Ordentlicher Professor\\") in 1922. \\"During the Third Reich, Bleeker as a well respected artist often participated in propagandistic exhibitions, for example at the Gro√üe Deutsche Kunstausstellung at the Haus der Deutschen Kunst in Munich.\\" He obtained the order to create a bust of Adolf Hitler (Bust at German Historical Museum). He reworked it several times and up to 1944 25 busts were delivered to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). As a result of his connection to the Nazi regime he lost his teaching post at the Munich Academy in 1945. In 1951 he was rehabilitated and became a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and an honorary member of the Munich Academy. In 1968 he died in Munich.

Spanning , it connects Powder Mountain Ski Resort and the towns of Liberty and Eden with Utah State Route 39 in Ogden Canyon in Weber County. A portion of the road is designated as part of the Ogden River Scenic Byway. Route description State Route 158 begins at Eden Junction, its intersection with SR-39 at the Pineview Dam which is at the top of Ogden Canyon. From this point, it travels north across the dam and follows the shore of Pineview Reservoir to the northeast, eventually turning to the north. As it continues north past the end of the reservoir, it passes the town of Eden and former SR-162 which connects to Liberty. Up to this point, the route is part of the Ogden River Scenic Byway. Continuing north, the route passes the Wolf Creek Golf Resort before entering the narrow, steep canyon on its climb to Powder Mountain. The road to Powder Mountain is one of the steepest state highways in Utah with an average grade of approximately 14% over . History The road from Eden Junction (SR-39 at Pineview Dam) north to Liberty was added to the state highway system in 1933 as a southern segment of State Route 163, and was transferred to State Route 162 in 1935. In 1955, SR-162 was extended north to the forest boundary, and truncated back to Liberty again in 1963. In 1965, SR-162 was extended north from Liberty to Avon, ending at the southern terminus of SR-163. In order to maintain continuity in the state highway system, SR-162 absorbed SR-163 the following year, resulting in SR-162 stretching from Eden Junction through Liberty to Hyrum. In 1969, SR-162's northern end was moved back south to Liberty. In the process, the road from Liberty to Paradise was removed from the state highway system, and the road from Paradise to Hyrum was re- designated as part of State Route 165. As part of the same redesignation, the so-called \\"Eden Bypass\\", a short, road providing a shorter connection between SR-162 and the town of Eden was added to SR-162 as a spur/leg. Also in 1969, State Route 166 was added to the state highway system, designated as the road from SR-39 at Huntsville north and east around Pineview Reservoir to SR-162 in Eden (the northern end of SR-166 was the road bypassed by the south leg of SR-162). In 1975, the \\"Eden Bypass\\" section of SR-162 was split off and redesignated as State Route 89 and renumbered as State Route 169 two years later in the 1977 Utah state route renumbering, essentially swapping route numbers with former Utah State Route 169 which followed the alignment of US-89 between Salt Lake City and the north end of Bountiful. These highways remained unchanged until 1990, when UDOT recommended the road from the intersection of SR-162 and SR-166 to the parking lot at Powder Mountain be added to the state highway system in exchange for deleting SR-166, SR-169, and part of SR-162. As a result, the portion of SR-162 north of the SR-162/SR-166 intersection was removed from the state highway system, along with all of SR-166 and SR-169, while the remainder of SR-162 was redesignated as State Route 158 along with the aforementioned road to Powder Mountain.

It is in an ancient part of Nicosia, within city walls built when it was under Venetian rule. It hosts a number of historical buildings and monuments including Faneromeni Church, Faneromeni School, Faneromeni Library, and the Marble Mausoleum. Overview and historical background Faneromeni Church by night, Nicosia, Cyprus Faneromeni Square was the centre of Nicosia before Eleftheria Square superseded it in 1974. Faneromeni Church dominates the centre of the square; it was built in 1872 on the site of an ancient Orthodox nunnery. The church is dedicated to Holy Mary and it is the largest church within the city walls of Nicosia. Architecturally the Church edifice features a mixture of Neoclassical, Byzantine and Medieval Latin styles. Faneromeni School, founded by Archbishop Makarios I in 1857, was the first all-girls school in Cyprus. It was founded to improve rates of literacy among girls and women on the island. The Marble Mausoleum on the eastern side of Faneromeni Church is situated at the front of the building. It was built in memory of four clerics executed by the Ottoman governor in 1821, following the Cypriot revolt after the Greek War of Independence was declared. The square is surrounded by several neoclassical buildings featuring predominantly Greek, as well as, local Cypriot architectural influences. These include the Faneromeni Library. Today the square is a meeting point for the anarchist movement of Cyprus, anti- authoritarians, libertarians, many artists and musicians. It is also a stronghold of the antifascist movement on the island.

It sits east of Charles Village, south of Abell, west of Waverly and north of Barclay. Its boundaries are Guilford and Greenmount Avenues to the east and west, and 25th and 29th streets to the north and south. These streets together encompass about 14 city blocks. History Harwood was originally known as Oxford. In the 1890s, the B&O; Railroad constructed the Baltimore Belt Line through the neighborhood. The line was once the main passenger rail line into Baltimore from Philadelphia and New York, and now serves as a major freight route, with several trains passing through each day. The neighborhood's earliest homes were wood-frame detached houses, many of which are on 26th Street, next to the railroad tracks. The majority of homes are brick rowhouses, and most were built between 1900 and 1920. Harwood was home to many of Baltimore's early professional baseball teams. The original Oriole Park, located at 25th Street and Greenmount Avenue, was home to Baltimore's professional team from 1882 to 1889. The team spent one season at a new ballpark four blocks north, at 29th Street and Greenmount Avenue in the Abell community, before returning to its first home, now christened Union Park, for the 1891 to 1900 seasons. After 1900, Baltimore baseball teams played most of their games at a new stadium at 30th Street and Greenmount Avenue, until Major League Baseball's Orioles began playing at nearby Memorial Stadium in 1954. Demographics According to the 2010 Census, Harwood has a population of about 1,575 people, a 12% decline since 2000. As of the census, 75% of residents are black, 21% are white, and 4% are of other races. Approximately 13% of the neighborhood's 749 houses were vacant as of the Census date. Harwood is a small community, encompassing just 45 acres, but has very little undeveloped space, and its population density is approximately 22,400 people per square mile. The community's median household income is approximately $23,873. Approximately 40% of residents are homeowners with 60% of the neighborhood renting their home. As of 2010, the median home sale price in Harwood was $204,000. Community layout Harwood consists primarily of brick rowhouses along mostly east-west streets. Barclay Street, a north-south thoroughfare the divides the neighborhood in half, also creates divisions in housing style. Most houses west of Barclay Street have large, covered porches, while most of those east of it boast only stoops. Homes fronting Guilford Avenue, on the neighborhood's western edge, tend to be larger and more expensive than most of the rest of the neighborhood. There are a few scattered businesses along the 25th Street and Greenmount Avenue boundaries of the community. The Baltimore Belt Line (a freight train line operated by CSX) runs below grade along 26th Street and creates noticeable noise and vibrations each time a train passes. Harwood has two small neighborhood parks. Transportation As a dense urban neighborhood, many amenities are available in surrounding communities and are a short walk away. With a WalkScore of 91, Harwood is considered a \\"Walker's Paradise\\" by Walkscore.com. According to the website, the neighborhood is the 15th \\"most walkable\\" neighborhood in Baltimore. Harwood is located on the 8 and 12 bus routes, operated by the Maryland Transit Administration, and is a couple blocks from the MTA's 3, 11 and 61 routes, as well as a shuttle operated by Johns Hopkins University. Guilford Avenue, Harwood's western boundary, is the city's only designated \\"bike boulevard,\\" with traffic calming designed to encourage bicycling along the corridor, which connects Charles Village with the downtown area. Revitalization Harwood's population declined steadily in the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century due to white flight, petty crime, drug dealing, drug abuse, and other social ills that negatively affected the neighborhood. However, several revitalization efforts are underway to help the community rebound. Harwood is part of Baltimore's Healthy Neighborhoods program, which offers special loans on designated target blocks within the community. Residents have won grants to complete substantial neighborhood beautification projects in recent years. One of the most notable projects includes mosaic house numbers, mailboxes and signs throughout the neighborhood. The community's main welcome sign, located at 25th Street and Barclay Street, is made of mosaics, as are the majority of house numbers on the 300 blocks of 26th Street, East Lorraine Avenue and 27th Street. The artist, who lives in Harwood, has also completed a decorative mosaic mural over the entrance to The Barclay School, one of the neighborhood's public schools, and most recently another large sign for the neighborhoods 29th Street Community Center. Other small development projects are underway. In 2011 and 2012, 30 Harwood residents participated in the Charles Village Painted Ladies Contest, an occasional project to add vibrant color to the fronts of houses. In 2012, an arts collective called Brickhaus was started on Greenmount Avenue, converting a vacant warehouse in 16 artist studios with exhibition and recording space. In 2013, two developers who own a large number of vacant homes in the community were awarded a $500,000 grant from the State of Maryland to complete at least 18 renovations, mostly on Whitridge Avenue and East Lorraine Avenue. Also in 2013, the City's former Barclay Recreation Center, which had been shuttered, was reopened as a community center. Schools Harwood's public school students attend one of two public schools that serve the neighborhood, Margaret Brent Elementary/Middle School and The Barclay School. Both schools offer pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade education. Both schools are part of the Great Schools Charles Village initiative, a partnership between the two schools and Loyola University Maryland that seeks to create a stronger educational environment. The partnership works with Baltimore City Public Schools and advocacy groups like The Village Parents on issues like curriculum changes, parent engagement, enrollment and teacher training and retention.

He was chief cantor at the Leopoldst√§dter Tempel in Vienna, Austria from 1857 until his death. Biography He was born to Samuel and Maria Goldstein (n√©e Hacker) in Kecskem√©t, Hungary. His father was chorister with Dovidl Brod Strelisker (1783-1848) at Pest [1] and later cantor at Kecskem√©t and then at Neutra, Hungary (now Nitra, Slovakia). Upon his father's death in about 1848, Josef, aged about 12, was so well acquainted with the liturgy and possessed such an exceptional tenor voice that the congregation of Neutra elected him as his father's successor. He remained there for two years and then undertook a four year tour through Austria and Germany, officiating in some of their largest congregations. Upon his return to Hungary, an admirer of his voice sent him to Vienna to be educated for the operatic stage.The Jewish Encyclopedia He received this training from Salvatore Marchesi, husband of the voice teacher Mathilde Marchesi. On the completion of his training and while en route to his first engagement in Italy, he decided to return to the position of cantor and received an appointment at the newly built Leopoldst√§dter Tempel in Vienna in 1857. His published works include the three volume \\"Schire Jeschurun, Ges√§nge der Israeliten;\\" a collection of songs for the Sabbath and festivals (1862), \\"Psalmen und Choralges√§nge;\\" psalms and choral songs (1872), and \\"Requiem f√ºr Cantor-Solo und gemischtem Chor mit Orgel-oder harmonium-Begleitung\\" (1892).

Pauline, Bertha and Arnold all perished at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Arnold and Emil Golz wrote libretti for operettas and burlesques performed on the Viennese stage. These included Die Gaukler (The Juggler, 1909), Die K√∂nigin der Nacht (The Queen of the Night, 1913), Die Unsterbliche Familie (The Immortal Family, 1913), Die Sch√∂ne Ehebrecherin (The Beautiful Adulteress, 1913), Die Meerjungfrau (The Mermaid, 1916), Baron Menelaus (1919), Mamselle Napoleon (1919), Die Fromme Helene (Pious Helene, 1921) Epsteins Witwe (Epstein's Widow, 1923), Der Ledige Schwiegersohn (The Unmarried Son-in-law, 1923), Frau Pick in Audienz (Mrs. Pick in Audience, 1924), Der Autowildling (1925), Hulda Pessl in Venedig (Hulda Pessl in Venice, 1926), Villa Adelheid (1926), Die K√∂nigin-Mutter (The Queen Mother, 1930), Der Jolly Joker (1932), Die Expresshochzeit (The Express Wedding), Der Held ihrer Tr√§um (The Hero of her Dreams), Der Unwiderstehliche Kassian (The Irresistible Kassian), Baronin Fritzi (Baroness Fritzi), Wo die Liebe Bl√ºht (Where Love Blooms), and Der Geldbrieftr√§ger (The Money Order Worker).

Josef's brother Moritz (Morris) Goldstein (1840-1906) was cantor at the K. K. Bene Israel Synagogue in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1881 until his death.

Interview with Kirsten Gillibrand Nov 11, 2010 The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group, gave Gillibrand a score of 80 out of 100 for the 110th Congress (when Gillibrand was in the House),Congressional Scorecard, Measuring Support for Equality in the 110th Congress, Human Rights Campaign, p. 25. and perfect scores of 100 out of 100 for the 111th,Congressional Scorecard, Measuring Support for Equality in the 111th Congress, Human Rights Campaign, p. 9. 112th,Congressional Scorecard, Measuring Support for Equality in the 112th Congress, Human Rights Campaign, p. 9. and 113th Congresses (when Gillibrand was in the Senate).Congressional Scorecard, Measuring Support for Equality in the 113th Congress, Human Rights Campaign, p. 9. While in the House of Representatives, she voted for both the Sexual Orientation Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA) and Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. Following her appointment to the Senate, Gillibrand became the first New York Senator to support same-sex marriage. On the morning of her appointment to the Senate, she called the Empire State Pride Agenda to reiterate her full support for same-sex marriage. Gillibrand also supported the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy.Empire State Pridge Agenda. Pride Agenda statement on Gov. Paterson‚Äôs selection of Kirsten Gillibrand as new U.S. Senator January 23, 2009 In April 2009, Gillibrand endorsed Governor Paterson's proposed legislation to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. In July 2009, Gillibrand announced she was considering introducing an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would impose an 18-month moratorium on the discharge of gays serving in the military.Bellini, J. (July 11, 2009), \\"Don't Ask Fight Hits Senate\\", The Daily Beast She decided against introducing the amendment, as she could not amass the 60 votes required to avoid a filibuster, but told The Daily Beast that she was able to secure the commitment of the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" in the fall of 2009.Bellini, J. (July 27, 2009), \\"Finally, Action on Gay Soldiers\\", The Daily Beast However, the hearings were postponed\\"Levin: Hearings to examine ‚ÄòDon't ask, don't tell‚Äô repeal likely next year\\", The Hill, November 21, 2009 and began on February 2, 2010. The repeal ultimately passed both Houses of Congress and was signed by President Obama on December 22, 2010. In 2010, the Human Rights Campaign gave her a 100% rating from the LGBT advocacy group. On March 16, 2011, Gillibrand, along with Senators Feinstein and Leahy, introduced a bill to repeal DOMA. In 2011, Gillibrand heavily lobbied undecided members of the New York State Senate to pass a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in New York. The bill ultimately passed the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, and was signed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on June 24, 2011. In May 2017, Gillibrand was one of forty-six senators to introduce the Equality Act of 2017, described by Representative David Cicilline as ensuring \\"that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it‚Äôs about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It‚Äôs critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.\\" In October 2018, Gillibrand was one of twenty senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Pompeo to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions which were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \\"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\\" and that the US refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of America upholding \\"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\\" In June 2019, Gillibrand was one of eighteen senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Pompeo requesting an explanation of a decision by the State Department to not issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month nor issue the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also questioned why the LGBTQ special envoy position had remained vacant and asserted that \\"preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTQ rights as a foreign policy priority.\\" Abortion and contraception Gillibrand supports abortion rights, stating on her Senate website, \\"I will always protect a woman's right to choose‚Äîno matter what.\\" Gillibrand has voted in favor of federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, contraception, and supporting United Nations Population Fund programs. In 2010 Gillibrand voted against Ben Nelson's proposed amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which would have prohibited the government from allowing insurance plans that cover abortion in a national healthcare exchange. She expressed strong opposition to House Republicans' No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in early 2011, stating, in her opinion, that the act \\"disregards women‚Äôs rights and restricts the ability of women to access affordable health care.\\"  Agriculture  In March 2019, Gillibrand was one of thirty-eight senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \\"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\\" and urging his department to \\"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.\\" In May 2019, Gillibrand and eight other Democratic senators sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Perdue where they criticized the USDA for purchasing pork from JBS USA and wrote that it was \\"counterproductive and contradictory\\" for companies to receive funding from \\"U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration's trade policy.\\" The senators requested the department \\"ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer‚Äôs bottom line‚Äînot the business interests of foreign corporations.\\" In June 2019, Gillibrand and Republican Lisa Murkowski announced the Summer Meals Act of 2019, legislation altering the Summer Food Service Program of the Agriculture Department to grant more children access to summer meals in addition to providing transportation for children in rural and hard-to-reach areas to aid their access of summer meals along with imposing flexibility to the program so children can have more than one meal. In June 2019, Gillibrand and eighteen other Democratic senators sent a letter to USDA Inspector General (IG) Phyllis K. Fong with the request that the IG investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserted that not conducting an investigation would mean these \\"actions could be perceived as a part of this administration‚Äôs broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists.\\" Gun laws Gillibrand's position on gun rights has changed from being against strict gun control in the House to being more \\"flexible\\" on the issue since she joined the Senate. While in the House, she had received a 100% positive rating from the National Rifle Association, and sponsored an amendment to the 2008 Farm Bill that would have allowed expanded hunting on public lands. On the other hand, Gillibrand worked to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Act. Gillibrand's pro-gun rights positions received scrutiny after her appointment to the Senate and were the object of criticism by some of her fellow New York Democrats, particularly those in the New York City area.\\"Will Gillibrand Shift on Guns?\\", Albany's TimesUnion, Jan. 27, 2009 Within days of her being named to the Senate, Gillibrand indicated that her pro-gun rights position was \\"flexible\\". By late 2010, the NRA had regraded Gillibrand to an F rating, citing her votes against NRA-backed bills. In one of her first votes as a senator, Gillibrand voted to reject a measure that would have expanded gun rights in the District of Columbia. While Gillibrand's spokesman characterized the vote as consistent with her previous view that local governments have the right to determine gun restrictions, the Albany Times Union noted that her position was counter to her vote just five months earlier on an almost identical House bill. She co-authored the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2009 with Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, a longtime advocate of gun control. Gillibrand also opposed federal legislation that would have allowed American citizens to carry concealed firearms across state lines even if they were legally allowed to carry the weapons in their home states. Gillibrand's support of gun rights has been characterized more specifically as support of hunters' rights. Despite her mother being an avid hunter, Gillibrand has never hunted before, though she has shot skeet. In January 2016, Gillibrand was one of eighteen senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and \\"the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it\\" with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps \\"to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public- health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.\\" Following the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, Gillibrand was one of twenty-four senators to sign a letter to National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins espousing the view that it was critical the NIH \\"dedicate a portion of its resources to the public health consequences of gun violence\\" at a time when 93 Americans die per day from gun-related fatalities and noted that the Dickey Amendment did not prohibit objective, scientific inquiries into shooting death prevention. In November 2017, Gillibrand was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill that would form a charge of Domestic Violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions would have to be reported to federal databases with the authority to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) through which convicted abusers retained the ability to purchase firearms. Gillibrand stated that the bill would upgrade American military law and called on colleagues to join her and the other cosponsors \\"in fighting to pass this bill.\\" In January 2019, Gillibrand was one of forty senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense. In February 2019, Gillibrand was one of thirty-eight senators to sign a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham calling on him to \\"hold a hearing\\" on universal background checks and noted Graham's statement in the press that he \\"intended to have the Committee work on ‚Äòred flag‚Äô legislation and potentially also background checks\\", actions the senators indicated their support for. At a June 2019 town hall, Gillibrand referred to the NRA as \\"the worst organization\\" in the United States and charged the NRA with caring more about profits than Americans and cited the enactment of universal background checks and a federal gun trafficking law, and a ban on bump stocks, weapons that were military styled and high-capacity magazines as the steps she would take to address gun violence as U.S. President. She furthered that the NRA was lying to Americans and that sales were the organization's objective as opposed to protecting the Second Amendment.  Census  In June 2019, Gillibrand was one of twenty-eight senators to sign a letter led by Brian Schatz to United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross warning that Ross would \\"further delay and jeopardize the Census Bureau‚Äôs ability to conduct a full, fair, and accurate decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution and the Census Act\\" by continuing to attempt adding the citizenship question to 2020 census materials. The senators urged Ross to \\"allow the Census Bureau to proceed with preparation for a 2020 census without a citizenship question on the questionnaire.\\"  Childcare  In 2019, Gillibrand and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, a bill that created 770,000 new childcare jobs and that ensured families under 75 percent of the state median income did not pay for childcare with higher-earning families having to pay \\"their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have.\\" The legislation also supported universal access to high-quality preschool programs for all 3 and 4-year-olds and gave the childcare workforce a changed compensation and training to aid both teachers and caregivers.  Children's programming  In 2019, following the announcement by the Federal Communications Commission of rules changes to children's programming through modifying the Children‚Äôs Television Act of 1990, Gillibrand and eight other Democratic senators signed a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that expressed concern that the proposed changes \\"would limit the reach of educational content available to children and have a particular damaging effect on youth in low-income and minority communities\\" and asserted that the new rules would see a reduction in access to valuable educational content through over-the-air services.  Criminal justice reform  In February 2013, Gillibrand was one of twenty-four senators to sign a letter asserting that Sikh, Hindu and Arab Americans were often targets of violence because they were mistaken for being radical Muslims and citing the importance of the federal government to \\"begin tracking information about anti-Sikh, anti-Hindu and anti-Arab hate crimes as soon as possible so that law enforcement can more effectively respond to this threat.\\" In December 2018, Gillibrand stated her hope that the No Cash Bail Act would be one of the first bills introduced in the 116th United States Congress, legislation that she said would require states to implement alternative pretrial systems along with a reduction in pretrial jail populations should they request receiving federal funding as part of an incentive program in addition to withholding grant funding from states that continue to utilize cash bail. Gillibrand furthered that the US should not imprison individuals that could not afford their bail and that the US \\"is much better than that and I believe we need to give people the opportunity to thrive, to help them when they're down, to make sure they actually have access to the rehabilitation they might need when things go wrong.\\" In December 2018, Gillibrand voted for the First Step Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners through expanding job training and other programs in addition to forming an expansion of early-release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, \\"to more equitably punish drug offenders.\\"  Disaster relief  In April 2018, Gillibrand was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to FEMA administrator Brock Long calling on FEMA to enter an agreement with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that would \\"stand up the Disaster Housing Assistance Program and address the medium- and longer-term housing needs\\" of evacuees of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The senators asserted that \\"FEMA's refusal to use the tools at its disposal, including DHAP, to help these survivors is puzzling -- and profoundly troubling\\" and that hundreds of hurricane survivors were susceptible to being left homeless if FEMA and HUD continued to not work together.  Drug policy  In December 2018, Gillibrand was one of twenty-one senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the actions of the Food and Drugs Administration to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA \\"to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.\\" In June 2019, Gillibrand unveiled a proposal to legalize marijuana that included the establishment of a process that would both regulate and tax marijuana production in addition to expunging all nonviolent marijuana convictions and expanding medical access to marijuana to every private and most federal health plans. The proposal also included research into the drug's health benefits being financed and allocating funds gained through taxes to both communities of color and women and minority-owned small cannabis businesses. Gillibrand admitted the positive effects that had come through marijuana's statewide legalization in Washington and Colorado, but asserted that \\"a state-by-state patchwork is not enough to tackle the deeply rooted racial, social, and economic injustices within our marijuana laws, or to fully unleash the economic equity and opportunity of marijuana legalization.\\"  Horse racing  In June 2019, Gillibrand and Arizona senator Martha McSally cosponsored the Horse Racing Integrity Act, a bill that would form a national standard for drug restrictions, testing, and enforcement at venues for horse racing that presently operated under both varied and conflicting regulations of their respective states and establish the U.S. Horseracing Anti-Doping and Medication Control Authority to enforce drug bans and rules. The bill was introduced in the aftermath of a spike in racehorse deaths at various tracks that had stirred controversy from animal rights groups.  Truck underride crashes  In March 2019, Gillibrand, along with senator Marco Rubio and Representatives Steve Cohen and Mark DeSaulnier, introduced the Stop Underrides Act. The bill would require underride guards on both the sides and front of a truck in addition to changing standards for underride guards on the back of trucks. Gillibrand spoke of the enabling of Congress \\"to make simple and commonsense changes that would save lives on the roads\\" and said that the bill would \\"protect passengers and help keep our roads safer.\\"  Maternal mortality  In May 2019, Gillibrand was one of six senators to cosponsor the Healthy MOMMIES Act, legislation that would expand Medicaid coverage in an attempt to provide comprehensive prenatal, labor and postpartum care with an extension of the Medicaid pregnancy pathway from 60 days to a full year following birth for the purpose of assuring new mothers have access to services unrelated to pregnancy. The bill also directed Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program's Payment and Access Commission report its data regarding doula care coverage under state Medicaid programs and subsequently develop strategies aimed at improving access to doula care.  Opioids  In February 2017, Gillibrand and thirty other senators signed a letter to Kal√©o Pharmaceuticals in response to the opioid- overdose-reversing device Evzio rising in price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 and requested the company answer what the detailed price structure for Evzio was, the number of devices Kal√©o Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year. In March 2017, Gillibrand was one of twenty-one senators to sign a letter led by Ed Markey to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell which noted that 12 percent of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form or a substance abuse disorder in addition to one third of treatment administered for opioid and other substance use disorders in the United States being financed through Medicaid and opined that the American Health Care Act could \\"very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders\\" due to the insurance coverage lacking and not having the adequate funds to afford care oftentimes resulting in individuals abandoning substance use disorder treatment. In March 2019, Gillibrand and Colorado senator Cory Gardner introduced the John S. McCain Opioid Addiction and Prevention Act, a bill that would require doctors and other medical professionals to limit opioid prescriptions for the first treatment of acute pain to no more than a supply of seven days. Gillibrand stated that too many in her home state of New York and across the US had been affected by the opioid epidemic and they needed to be proactive in addressing the issue.  Workplace harassment  In March 2018, along with Amy Klobuchar and Patty Murray, Gillibrand led a letter signed by all 22 female U.S. senators to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that called for changes to a 1995 statute that formed the present policy for addressing workplace misconduct complaints on Capitol Hill and specified their support for an update to the policy that would streamline the process of reporting sexual harassment in addition to granting staffers more resources in filing reports. In April 2019, Gillibrand signed onto the Be HEARD Act, legislation intended to abolish the tipped minimum wage along with ending mandatory arbitration and pre-employment nondisclosure agreements. The bill also gave workers additional time to report harassment and was said by co-sponsor Patty Murray to come at a time when too many workers are \\"still silenced by mandatory disclosure agreements that prevent them from discussing sexual harassment and longstanding practices like the tipped wages that keep workers in certain industries especially vulnerable.\\" In July 2019, Gillibrand signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's, which detailed workplace violence incidents that included interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms and more. The senators argued that McDonald's could and needed to \\"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.\\" =Fiscal issues= Economy During the height of the global financial crisis in 2008, Gillibrand, then a member of the House of Representatives, voted twice against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, calling it \\"fundamentally flawed\\". However, she did vote for the auto industry bailout in December 2008. At a press conference on January 25, 2009, Gillibrand said that during her first week in the Senate, she would work to ensure that the stimulus bill included relief funds for New York State. She supported the President's recovery plan and budget, and voted for cram down to allow judges to write down mortgages of struggling homeowners. In 2009, as a senator, Gillibrand voted for the Stimulus Package. In August 2011, Gillibrand voted against raising the US debt ceiling, stating: \\"We could have gone further in reducing America‚Äôs debt with a sensible compromise that both cut discretionary spending and raised revenues. It is unfortunate Congress missed that opportunity\\". In the House, Gillibrand supported the Bush tax cuts, in 2012, Senator Gillibrand voted for extending them, but against an amendment extending them for those earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000. In 2017, Gillibrand worked with Sen. Bernie Sanders (among others) to advance employee stock ownership plans, introducing legislation that would help workers form employee-owned businesses. In February 2019, Gillibrand was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice advocating for regulators to renounce a proposed $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, writing that American enforcers have understood for the last thirty years \\"that fostering robust competition in telecommunications markets is the best way to provide every American with access to high-quality, cutting-edge communications at a reasonable price\\" and the merger would result in a return for \\"Americans to the dark days of heavily consolidated markets and less competition, with all of the resulting harms.\\" In May 2019, Gillibrand and Delaware senator Chris Coons introduced the Global Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing Act, a bill that would develop new institutes that supported American manufacturing in technology and grant more federal investment in the national network such as preexisting institutes being made to compete globally as well as continue American economic and national security. Gillibrand said the bill \\"would improve job training programs and support entrepreneurs, creating more opportunities for our workers to succeed in manufacturing.\\" In May 2019, Gillibrand unveiled the Family Bill of Rights, a proposal intended to protect adoption and IVF rights for all parents with disregard of religion, sexual orientation or gender identity through a provision meant to overturn state laws authorizing the aforementioned groups being discriminated against by private adoption agencies. The legislation also included the right to \\"a safe and healthy pregnancy\\" and entitlements to universal pre-K and affordable child care. Gillibrand stated that the bill would \\"make all families stronger ‚Äî regardless of who you are or what your zip code is ‚Äî with a fundamental set of rights that levels the playing field starting at birth\\" and that passing the Family Bill of Rights would be one of the priorities of her first one hundred days as president.  Government shutdown  In March 2019, Gillibrand and thirty-eight other senators signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee opining that contractor workers and their families \\"should not be penalized for a government shutdown that they did nothing to cause\\" while noting that there were bills in both chambers of Congress that if enacted would provide back pay to compensate contractor employees for lost wages before urging the Appropriations Committee \\"to include back pay for contractor employees in a supplemental appropriations bill for FY2019 or as part of the regular appropriations process for FY2020.\\"  Trade  In June 2019, along with Bob Menendez, Tom Cotton, and Marco Rubio, Gillibrand introduced the Equitable Act, a bill that would increase oversight of Chinese and other foreign companies that were listed on American exchanges along with delisting noncompliant firms for three years. Health care Gillibrand voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the Senate's version of health care reform legislation, and also supported the public option, which did not make it into the bill.\\"Sens. Schumer, Gillibrand applaud health care reform bill while Bloomberg, Paterson feel N.Y.'s pain\\", N.Y. Daily News, Dec. 25, 2009 New York Governor David Paterson and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the Affordable Care Act a \\"disgrace,\\" because it gave more money under Medicaid to states like Nebraska, whose senator, Democrat Ben Nelson, held out for more financial support as a condition of voting for the bill. New York State, in contrast, would have a $5.5 billion cut over 10 years. Bloomberg said it would force New York City to close 100 health clinics, would create a $1 billion hole in New York State's budget, and threaten the existence of struggling hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities, and called Gillibrand to complain.\\"Gov. Paterson, Mayor Bloomberg and other NY pols: Health care bill is prescription for disaster\\", N.Y. Daily News, Dec. 22, 2009\\"Health-Care Reform Making Bloomberg, Paterson Sick\\", New York Magazine Daily Intel, Dec. 22, 2009\\"Mayor calls Gilly to rip health fix as bad for NY\\", New York Post, December 24, 2009 Gillibrand said that the problem is that there are more small states in the Senate, so funding formulas tend to favor small states, and New York only gets 79 cents back for every dollar it sends to Washington. The formulas were more favorable to New York in the House, so she and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) were trying to get the final bill closer to the House version in the Conference Committee.\\"Sen Kirsten Gillibrand on The WWRL Morning Show with Errol Louis, Jan. 14, 2010\\", Morning Show with Errol Louis, Jan. 14, 2010 Gillibrand said that the bill would be a net benefit for New York because it would bring in $40 billion to the state, insure 2.7 million New Yorkers, increase the use of preventative care by requiring that it is covered, and give tax credits to 250,000 small businesses to help them afford health care coverage. In September 2017, Gillibrand joined Bernie Sanders and 14 other co-sponsors in submitting a single-payer health care plan to Congress called the \\"Medicare for All\\" bill. The plan also covers vision and dental care, not currently covered by Medicare. In November 2018, amid an increase in cases of acute flaccid myelitis, Gillibrand held a press conference declaring it was \\"good news\\" that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had announced the formation of a task force to research acute flaccid myelitis before tracking it and called on Congress \\"to make sure they have the funding they need to get the job done.\\" In December 2018, Gillibrand was one of forty-two senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \\"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre- existing conditions.\\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \\"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\\" In January 2019, during the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown, Gillibrand was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the effect of the government shutdown on the public health and employees while remaining alarmed \\"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency‚Äôs employees and the safety and security of the nation‚Äôs food and medical products.\\" In February 2019, Gillibrand and twenty-two other Democratic senators introduced the State Public Option Act, a bill that would authorize states to form a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents and thereby grant all denizens of the state the ability to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan if they wished. Brian Schatz, a bill cosponsor, said the legislation would \\"unlock each state‚Äôs Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option\\" and that its goal was \\"to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage.\\" In June 2019, Gillibrand was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Territories Health Equity Act of 2019, legislation that would remove the cap on annual federal Medicaid funding and increase federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures of territories along with more funds being provided for prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors in an attempt to equalize funding for American territories Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands with that of U.S. states. In June 2019, Gillibrand was one of fifteen senators to introduce the Affordable Medications Act, legislation intended to promote transparency through mandating pharmaceutical companies disclose the amount of money going toward research and development in addition to both marketing and executives' salaries. The bill also abolished the restriction that stopped the federal Medicare program from using its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries and hinder drug company monopoly practices used to keep prices high and disable less expensive generics entering the market.  Housing  In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of forty-one senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \\"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \\"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020. =Security= Terrorism Gillibrand has co-sponsored legislation restoring habeas corpus for detainees in the War on Terror. In 2011, she voted for extending provisions of the Patriot Act. She also voted for the NDAA of 2012. Gillibrand also supports closing Guantanamo Bay but, together with Senator Schumer (also of New York), vehemently opposed plans to try those accused of coordinating the 9/11 attacks in New York federal court. Immigration Gillibrand's views on illegal immigration have shifted since she joined the Senate. Noted for having relatively conservative viewpoints while in the House, she quickly switched some opinions upon entering the Senate. As a Representative, Gillibrand opposed granting any sort of amnesty to illegal immigrants and supported empowering local police to enforce federal immigration laws. She also opposed giving federal contracts to employers that hire illegal immigrants and supported increasing the number of border patrol agents. She was a co-sponsor of the SAVE Act, which aimed to increase the number of border guards, increase surveillance, and hasten deportations. Breaking with former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, Gillibrand opposed his plan to issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants. She also voted in favor of legislation targeting and withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities. Americans for Better Immigration, an immigration reduction lobby, graded Gillibrand at a B. Following her appointment to the Senate, Gillibrand's positions were criticized by immigration advocates and Democratic elected officials, especially in New York. She subsequently changed some of her positions, explaining that \\"it‚Äôs a case of learning more and expanding my view.\\" She now opposes deporting illegal immigrants and cutting off funds to sanctuary cities. She also supports an earned path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In 2010 she was a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act, which would have provided pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who arrived under the age of 16, complete at least 2 years of college or 2 years of military service and are under age of 35 at the time of enactment; the proposal was subsequently filibustered in the Senate in December 2010. She also supports a moratorium on home raids until comprehensive immigration reform is passed. In 2018, Gillibrand announced that she was in favor of abolishing ICE, making her the first US senator to do so. She called for a \\"new agency with a very different mission,\\" one that \\"separate[d] the criminal justice from the immigration issues.\\" In August 2018, Gillibrand was one of seventeen senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \\"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\\" In November 2018, Gillibrand was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis concerning \\"the overt politicization of the military\\" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment while urging Mattis to \\"curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement.\\" In January 2019, Gillibrand was one of twenty senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated. In February 2019, Gillibrand was one of sixteen senators to vote against legislation preventing a partial government shutdown and containing 1.375 billion for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border that included 55 miles of fencing. In March 2019, Gillibrand voted to block President Trump's national emergency declaration that would have granted him access to $3.6 billion in military construction funding to build border barriers. In April 2019, Gillibrand signed a letter led by Catherine Cortez Masto to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Enforcement asserting that \\"the civil detention of an expectant mother for potential immigration offenses is never justified\\" due to the \\"absence of compelling evidence that the detention of a pregnant woman is necessary because she is a threat to herself or others, or is a threat to public safety or national security\\". The senators requested the CBP enact measures that would ensure \\"timely and appropriate treatment\\" for pregnant women in custody along with both agencies providing information on how available facilities and doctors are for pregnant immigrants and complete data on the number of those currently in custody. In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of six Democratic senators to sign a letter to Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan expressing concern over memos by Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller in which Neller critiqued deployments to the southern border and funding transfers under President Trump's national emergency declaration as having posed an \\"unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency\\" and noted that other military officials had recently stated that troop deployment did not affect readiness. The senators requested Shanahan explain the inconsistencies and that Shanahan provide both \\"a staff-level briefing on this matter within seven days\\" and an explanation on how he would address Neller's concerns. In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to top members on the Appropriations Committee Richard Shelby and Patrick Leahy and top members of its Homeland Security subcommittee Shelley Moore Capito and Jon Tester indicating that they could not \\"support the appropriation of funds that would expand this administration‚Äôs unnecessarily cruel immigration enforcement policies, its inhumane immigrant detention systems, or its efforts to build the president‚Äôs vanity projects\\" and urging Congress to \\"resist efforts to raid critical and effective public safety programs in order to pay for political theatrics\\" as President Trump's \\"manufactured emergency\\" was not justification for \\"spending taxpayer dollars on an ineffective wall.\\" Gillibrand told Margaret Brennan in May 2019 that she would not use detention system for immigrants if elected president, citing that immigrants would follow the process granted to them as they did when immigration cases were handled by the Justice Department and that she would \\"fund the border security measures that are anti-terrorism, anti-human trafficking, anti-drug trafficking and anti-gun trafficking.\\" In June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federally backed loans, Gillibrand and eleven other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant. In July 2019, along with Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Gillibrand sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency \\"should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children\\" and that it was mandatory that the office \\"ensure that the custody and processing of [unaccompanied migrant children] is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law.\\" In July 2019, Gillibrand and fifteen other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations. Internet privacy Gillibrand was a co-sponsor of the controversial PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to web sites judged to be infringing copyrights.Bill Summary & Status 112th Congress (2011‚Äì2012), ‚ÄúS.968 Cosponsors,‚Äù Bill Summary & Status On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Gillibrand and Charles Schumer, New York's other senator, who also supported the bill.Protesters take anti-SOPA campaign to Manhattan offices of Schumer and Gillibrand; 'The future of the NY tech community is in jeopardy,' the group states By Rolando Pujol, New York Daily News, January 18, 2012Geeks Converge on NYC to Protest Anti-Piracy Bills; Thousands ditched their computers to protest anti-piracy bills outside the offices of New York senators Wednesday. Brian Ries reports on the fight for the future of the Internet. By Brian Ries, The Daily Beast, Jan 18, 2012 Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.Manhattan SOPA/PIPA Protest Blankets Block Fronting NY Senators' Offices , Carole Ditosti, Technorati, January 18, 2012 Gillibrand received $611,141 in campaign contributions from the \\"TV/Movies/Music\\" industry according to OpenSecrets.org.Top Industries - Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 2007 - 2012 The Center for Responsive Politics On her Facebook page, Gillibrand said that she would \\"work to strike a balance between ending online piracy to protect New York jobs & ensuring Internet freedom so our tech community can continue to flourish.\\"  Net neutrality  In May 2014, days before the FCC was scheduled to rewrite its net neutrality rules, Gillibrand was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler charging Wheeler's proposal with destroying net neutrality instead of preserving it and urged the FCC to \\"consider reclassifying Internet providers to make them more like traditional phone companies, over which the agency has clear authority to regulate more broadly.\\" In March 2018, Gillibrand was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley which lambasted a proposal from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program, which provided access to high-speed internet to roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities, citing that it was Pai's \\"obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service\\". In May 2018, Gillibrand voted for a bill that would reinstate net neutrality rules and thereby overturn the FCC's repeal via a law authorizing Congress to reverse regulatory actions by a simple majority vote. =Government= Gillibrand expressed support for preserving the Senate filibuster during an interview in 2019, saying it's \\"useful\\" because it encourages bipartisan consensus seeking, and saying \\"if you‚Äôre not able to get 60 votes on something, it just means you haven‚Äôt worked hard enough, talking to enough people and trying to listen to their concerns and then coming up with a solution that they can support [...] it just means you haven‚Äôt done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder\\". Campaign finance Gillibrand opposed the Supreme Court Decision in Citizens United and supports the DISCLOSE Act. In January 2016, Gillibrand was one of twenty-nine senators to sign a letter to President Obama urging him to issue a final executive order that would require federal contractors to disclose political donations, arguing that form of disclosure was \\"a modest step that would expose an especially troubling type of secret money: campaign contributions that have the potential to influence government contracting practices.\\" Ethics Gillibrand made ethics a central theme of her campaign in 2010, outlining a 4-part plan for reform: * Make Federal Funding Requests Fully Transparent  An earmark database * Reduce Corporate Special Interest Influence on Elections  If a corporation wants to run an advertisement during a political campaign, the CEO would have to appear at the end of the ad and approve the message.  If an advocacy organization is behind the ad, the head of the organization, and whoever is funding the ad would have to appear in the ad and approve it. They would also have to list the top five funders paying for the ad.  Foreign-owned companies would be banned from spending unlimited sums of money through their U.S.-based subsidiaries.  No company with government contracts with over $50,000 could spend money on elections, and no company taking any taxpayer-funded assistance, such as TARP money, could spend money on elections. * End Automatic Congressional Pay Raises * Ban Anonymous Holds on Legislation Transparency Gillibrand's office has published a \\"Sunlight Report\\" since she began her tenure as a member of the House. This document compiles her financial report as well as all meetings and earmark requests. She also pledged as a House member to accept no lobbyist gifts. In May 2010 she cosponsored the Earmark Transparency Act of 2010, which would require hosting of earmark requests online and limit discussion on those requests until they were posted. =Other= * She was the only senator to vote against the confirmation of James Mattis as Secretary of Defense. The vote was held a few hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as President on Jan. 20, 2017. The Senate vote was 98-1 in favor of confirmation. * She opposes the No Child Left Behind Act because she believes it \\"places an unmanageable strain on county and school budgets\\". * She supports doubling the Child and Dependent Care Credit, and eliminating or permanently fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax. * She supports a moratorium on the death penalty. * On June 20, 2008, Congresswomen Gillibrand voted for the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. * In June 2012, Gillibrand urged a blanket ban on all neodymium magnet toys in a letter to U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum, citing serious injuries to children who swallowed them. Critics objected to these restrictions on libertarian grounds. * In August 2013, Gillibrand was one of twenty-three Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning of some payday lenders \\"offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law\\" and asserting that service members along with their families \\"deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.\\" * In December 2018, Gillibrand was one of twenty-one senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie calling it \\"appalling that the VA is not conducting oversight of its own outreach efforts\\" in spite of suicide prevention being the VA's highest clinical priority and requesting Wilkie \\"consult with experts with proven track records of successful public and mental health outreach campaigns with a particular emphasis on how those individuals measure success.\\" * In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of six senators to send a letter to Director of the CFPB Kathy Kraninger expressing concern \\"CFPB leadership has abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities related to federal student loan servicers\\" and opined that such behavior displayed \\"a shocking disregard for the financial well-being of our nation's public servants, including teachers, first responders, and members of the military.\\" The senators requested that Kraninger clarify the role of the CFPB in overseeing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness's student loan servicers handling since December 2017 such as examinations made by the CFPB. * In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of twelve Democratic senators to sign a letter led by Mazie Hirono that questioned the decision of Attorney General William Barr to offer \\"his own conclusion that the President‚Äôs conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice\\" and called for both the Justice Department‚Äôs inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility to launch an investigation into whether Barr's summary of the Mueller Report and his April 18 news conference were misleading.  Environmental policy  In September 2018, Gillibrand was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor Elizabeth Warren as using \\"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy ‚Äî reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\\" In November 2018, Gillibrand was one of twenty-five Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change. In February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Gillibrand was one of twenty senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the agency \\"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\\" In June 2019, Gillibrand was one of forty-four senators to introduce the International Climate Accountability Act, legislation that would prevent President Trump from using funds in an attempt to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and directing the president's administration to instead develop a strategic plan for the United States that would allow it to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement. Foreign policy = Afghanistan = In 2011, Gillibrand called for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. She stated that \\"America cannot afford an endless war in Afghanistan\\".Terkel, Amanda (March 15, 2011). \\"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Presses Administration For Clear Withdrawal Plan From Afghanistan\\", The Huffington Post. = Central America = In April 2019, Gillibrand was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to President Trump encouraging him \\"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\\", asserting that Trump had \\"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\\" since becoming president and that he was \\"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding's helping to improve conditions in those countries. = China = In May 2019, Gillibrand was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act, a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China's consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea. = Cuba = In 2015 Gillibrand supported lifting the travel ban on Cuba. = Iran = In 2010, she supported and voted for sanctions against Iran. In July 2017, Gillibrand voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea. In June 2019, Gillibrand criticized Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran. Gillibrand's spokesperson said it would be illegal for the Trump administration to rely on a 2001 law that authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces against those responsible for the September 11 attacks and any \\"associated forces\\". = Iraq = On May 24, 2007, Gillibrand joined with Republicans in voting against the Democratic leadership for a bill to provide funding for U.S. efforts in Iraq without setting withdrawal deadlines for troops. Of the five freshman Democratic members of Congress from New York in 2007, Gillibrand was the only one to vote yes. In 2008, she once again voted to provide funding for the Iraq War and again was the only New York Democratic congressional delegate to vote with the Republicans. She later voted against the Iraq surge and supported a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq.Weigel, David (March 11, 2010). \\"Attacking 'Paterson-Appointee Kirsten Gillibrand , The Washington Independent. = Israel = Gillibrand's website states \\"Specifically, Senator Gillibrand will continue to strengthen America's close relationship with the State of Israel.\\" She voted for S.CON.RES.23 of 2011‚Äì2012, which was \\"A concurrent resolution declaring that it is the policy of the United States to support and facilitate Israel in maintaining defensible borders and that it is contrary to United States policy and national security to have the borders of Israel return to the armistice lines that existed on June 4, 1967.\\" In 2012, Gillibrand came out against Democrat Charles Barron, a candidate for the state's Eighth Congressional District, because she viewed him as anti-Israel. Barron compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians in Gaza to the Nazi's treatment of Jews.In Brooklyn, a Longtime Provocateur Surges in a Primary Race for Congress , The New York Times, June 15, 2012 Her spokesman said \\"Any candidate who is anti-Israel does not share Senator Gillibrand's values,\\" At the time, Politico wrote that Gillibrand was potentially facing a general election against Rep. Bob Turner (R-NY), \\"best known for winning a special election as something of a single-issue pro-Israel candidate.\\"Gillibrand rebukes Charles Barron, By ALEXANDER BURNS, Politico, 06/15/2012. In December 2016, Gillibrand urged President Obama to veto UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. In May 2017, Gillibrand co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. This bill was criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights proponents including Amnesty International. In direct response to criticisms, Gillibrand said that she would urge changes to the bill so that it would only apply to companies, not individuals. In August 2017 she withdrew her support, and, in 2019, she ultimately voted against the legislation. = Libya = In 2011, Gillibrand supported limited American military action in Libya. = North Korea = In March 2018, Gillibrand stated that a potential meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was \\"a positive step in the right direction because we're talking about engagement of diplomacy and political solutions as opposed to military ones\\" but that she was unsure if Trump would stay the course in negotiations. Following the 2018 North Korea-United States summit in June, Gillibrand said, \\"I‚Äôm very grateful that President Trump is trying diplomacy as opposed to military action because that‚Äôs was what his first take was. So, I am grateful that he is making the effort to try diplomacy and to try to bring people together towards a peaceful resolution.\\" = Russia = In December 2010, all senate Democrats including Gillibrand voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years. During December 2018, in response to President Trump's October announcement that he intended to withdraw the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Gillibrand was one of seven senators to cosponsor the Prevention of Arms Race Act of 2018, legislation prohibiting funding for a U.S. ground-launched or ballistic missile that had \\"a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers\\" until the administration provided a report meeting five specific conditions. Gillibrand also cosponsored this legislation when it was reintroduced by senator Jeff Merkley in the 116th United States Congress. In December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Gillibrand was one of six senators to organize a letter expressing concern over the administration \\"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\\" and calling on President Trump to continue arms negotiations. = Saudi Arabia = In June 2017, Gillibrand voted for a resolution by Rand Paul and Chris Murphy that would block President Trump's $510 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia that made up a portion of the $110 billion arms sale Trump announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia the previous year. In March 2019, Gillibrand was one of nine Democratic senators to sign a letter to Salman of Saudi Arabia requesting the release of human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair and writer Raif Badawi, women‚Äôs rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi, and Dr. Walid Fitaih. The senators wrote, \\"Not only have reputable international organizations detailed the arbitrary detention of peaceful activists and dissidents without trial for long periods, but the systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities and mistreatment of migrant workers and others has also been well- documented.\\" = Syria = In late August 2013 Gillibrand supported limited U.S. strikes against the Syrian Armed Forces after the Ghouta chemical attack, which she blamed on the Syrian government. The U.S. strikes ultimately did not occur. = United Nations = In July 2019, Gillibrand confirmed that as U.S. President she would seek the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a United Nations treaty characterized as a global bill of rights for women, citing the importance of the US \\"to project our values & make sure the world knows we believe in women's equality.\\" = Venezuela = In January 2019, following Juan Guaid√≥'s self-declaration as interim President of Venezuela, a member of Gillibrand's staff told HuffPost that the senator supported recognizing Guaid√≥ and imposing sanctions on the country but opposed military intervention.

It is endemic to Utah in the United States, where it is known from three counties. It faces a number of threats and it is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. This plant is a perennial herb forming a clump just a few centimeters wide and one or two centimeters tall. The rough-haired spatula-shaped leaves are generally under a centimeter long but may be slightly longer. The flower heads lie directly on top of the clump rather than erect on stalks. Each head contains up to 21 ray florets roughly half a centimeter long.Townsendia aprica. Flora of North America. They are yellow orange in color, aging cream or white.Tepedino, V. J., et al. (2004). Reproduction and demography of Townsendia aprica (Asteraceae), a rare endemic of the southern Utah Plateau. Western North American Naturalist 64(4) 465-70. The flower gets its species name from the apricot shade of its ray florets.USFWS. Townsendia aprica Recovery Plan. August 20, 1993. There are many disc florets at the center. The fruit is an achene with a pappus of scales; the ray and disc florets produce fruits that differ in appearance. The flowers are pollinated by several species of bees, including Ceratina nanula, Synhalonia fulvitarsis, Dioxys pomonae, Stelis pavonina, and many species of Osmia. The plant was discovered in 1966 near Last Chance Creek south of the Fremont Junction in Utah. Today there are 15 known occurrences in Sevier, Wayne, and Emery Counties for a total of about 6000 plants.Townsendia aprica. The Nature Conservancy. Some occurrences are in the San Rafael Swell and there is one in Capitol Reef National Park. The plants occur in sparsely vegetated openings in pinyon- juniper woodland habitat. They are generally restricted to pockets of shale lens soils surrounded by less hospitable soil types. The shale soil is derived from the Mancos Formation and is silty and alkaline. Other plants in the habitat include blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). Other rare plants in the area include Despain's pincushion cactus (Pediocactus despainii), Wright's fishhook cactus (Sclerocactus wrightiae), and Barneby reed-mustard (Schoenocrambe barnebyi). Threats to this species include construction of roads, livestock grazing and trampling, off-road vehicle use, and petroleum exploration and development.Townsendia aprica.

Founded in 1846, it also circulates in many other states and countries to seasonal residents of the resort island. History The Gazette was founded by editor Edgar Marchant and first published on Thursday, May 14, 1846. In the pages of the Gazette, Marchant advocated that to supplement native industries the island should market itself as a \\"Watering- Place in the Summer Season\\" and the island later became a summer resort destination. Charles Marchant, the son of Edgar Marchant's cousin Charles, assumed editorship in 1888 and retired in 1920. The newspaper remained in the Marchant family, save for two short interruptions, until 1920. The newspaper was purchased in 1920 by George A. Hough of the New Bedford Standard, as a wedding present for his son Henry Beetle Hough and Henry's new wife Elizabeth Bowie Hough. Henry Hough had won a special Pulitzer Prize for historical research as a Columbia University student in 1918. Hough spent the rest of his life at the Gazette, becoming a celebrated \\"country editor\\", and his wife was his co-editor and collaborator at the Gazette until her death in 1965. By Henry Hough's death, the circulation of the newspaper had increased from 600 to 13,000. The Houghs and the Gazette were strong advocates against development and the Houghs donated land they owned for preservation, founding the Sheriff's Meadow Foundation to preserve it and other natural areas on the island. Gazette offices in Edgartown In 1968, Henry Hough sold the newspaper to James Reston, two-time Pulitzer winner and long-time journalist and editor at the New York Times, who managed it with his wife Sally Reston. Hough sought out Reston, telling him \\"I want it to go into a newspaper family and you have writing sons.\\" Hough continued to write for the newspaper until his death in 1985. In 1975, one of Reston's writing sons, Richard Reston, an experienced foreign correspondent and bureau chief with the Los Angeles Times, took over operations of the paper in conjunction with his wife Mary Jo Reston, and they assumed the title of publisher from the senior Restons in 1988. Under the Restons, circulation increased to 18,000, profits increased drastically, and the newspaper was named Newspaper of the Year eight times by the New England Press Association. The newspaper was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting for their coverage of 1991's Hurricane Bob. Like Henry Hough, Richard Reston was a strong editorial advocate against development and for environmental preservation, and is credited with many victories in those areas. These stances prompted five local business owners to start a competing newspaper, the Martha's Vineyard Times, in 1984. Mary Jo Reston retired in 1999, Richard Reston in 2003. Richard Reston was succeeded by John W. Walter, an editor of USAToday and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In 2011, the newspaper was purchased by businessman Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. and his wife Nancy Kohlberg. They appointed Jane Seagrave, a former Associated Press executive, publisher in April 2011.

Starting in the center of the town at the intersection of Bridger Boulevard and 9100 South, the route travels west for two blocks before turning north along 200 West. The route leaves Paradise, continuing in a northerly direction along the eastern part of the valley, passing through the city of Hyrum as 800 West, through the city of Nibley as Nibley Road, before merging with US-89/US-91 as Main Street just south of the center of Logan, the county seat and largest city in Cache County. History The road from Avon through Paradise to Hyrum, was added to the state highway system in 1933 as State Route 163. In 1965, State Route 162 was extended north from Liberty to Avon, ending at the southern terminus of SR-163. SR-162 absorbed SR-163 the following year, in order to maintain continuity in the state highway system. In 1969, SR-162's northern end was moved back south to Liberty. In the process, the road from Liberty to Paradise was removed from the state highway system, and the road from Paradise to Hyrum was re-designated as part of State Route 165, along with added roadway from Hyrum to Logan.

As a translator he was important for exposing the German-speaking world to the works of Walt Whitman, √âmile Verhaeren and √âmile Zola and is known as a founder of the \\"Whitman Cult\\" in Germany. His literary achievements lie foremost in the scenic-dialogue innovations of \\"sequential naturalism\\" and in the formalization of literary impressionism. He also contributed to the emergence of the \\"intimate theater.\\" Some of his poems have been set to music by composers Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg. He is sometimes mistakenly cited for coining the term \\"The Third Reich\\" in relation to Nazism because of his 1906 novel by that name. The Nazi use of the term comes from a 1923 book Das Dritte Reich by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Childhood Schlaf was the son of a commercial clerk in Querfurt, a town in Saxony-Anhalt. Because his family lived in cramped quarters, he lived temporarily with his grandparents. His Grandmother, an educated woman, supported him in his passion for art and literature at an early age. In an autobiographical sketch from 1902, Schlaf claimed to have written verses and puppet shows at the age of 12 and short stories while an adolescent. He also showed a talent for drawing. In 1875, Schlaf's father took a job in a construction business in the emerging industrialism of nearby Magdeburg. Schlaf returned to his family where his father enforced a strict regime, and where Schalf felt more fear than affection. Education From 1875 to 1884 Schlaf attended the cathedral school in Magdeburg, joining a student club, \\"Covenant of the Living\\" in 1882. With this club he encountered recent writings in the fields of philosophy, science, and literature. In 1884 he graduated and went to study in Halle, the largest city in Saxony-Anhalt. His program of study was theology, German, classicism, and philosophy, but he was more engaged in connecting with other students than his studies. His earliest publications date from his time in Halle. He moved to study in Berlin 1885 and in 1886 joined the literary group Durch of young naturalist writers including Gerhart Hauptmann, Arno Holz, and William B√∂lsche. Throughout his studies he felt torn between his studies and the urge to devote himself entirely to writing. . During this time Schlaf developed a friendship with Arno Holz and around 1887 he agreed to an offer from Holz to share a vacant summer home of a friend from Niederschoenhausen and from there work on his writing. It was then he broke off his formal studies. Early work with Arno Holz Schlaf and Holz presented their first joint work, the anthology, \\"New Tracks\\" in 1892. In it the term \\"Sequential Naturalism\\" (Konsequenter Naturalismus) made its first appearance. The anthology consisted of three parts, each with its own preface. The middle part had been published in 1889 under the pseudonym Bjarne B. Holmsen. It contained the short story \\"Papa Hamlet.\\" The third part of the anthology, the drama \\"The Family Selicke\\" had been published in 1890. In Sequential Naturalism, one encounters a moment-to-moment description of events without a governing overarching narrative or perceiver. The style is also called the \\"Sekundenstil\\" or second-by-second style. In Papa Hamlet, the story is told almost entirely in dialogue, much of it in dialect. There is almost no intervention by the narrator. Dialogue contains contradictions, grammatical inaccuracies, dialect, other elements of a \\"realist\\" atmosphere. The works in the story center on broken families, alcoholism, financial hardship, and sickness. The observance of unity of place and time in the narrative give the works an oppressive atmosphere. The Family Selicke found little success at first when it was first staged in April, 1890. It did have its defenders, however. Holz and Schlaf felt increasing alienation through the 1890s, with early tensions over artistic notions exacerbated by public debate over the relative contributions and merit of both writers. The dispute reached its climate between 1905 and 1906. Today, Schlaf's esteem pales in comparison to Holz's ‚Äì a situation convenient given Schlaf's support of the Nazis in the 1930s (Holz died in 1928 before the Nazi rise to power). At the turn of the century In 1893 Schlaf suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Charit√©, a Berlin hospital. He sustained several visits to the hospital by 1897 and later described his illness as a nervous disorder and depression. Holz used these experiences to discredit his former friend and wrote about his paranoia. In Schalf's novels published after 1900 one can find representations of schizophrenic and psychotic behavior. He also started to investigate the occult and cosmology. Schlaf published his first independent drama, \\"Meister Oelze\\" in 1892, which received its Berlin premiere on February 2, 1894. The play was widely successful. It shows many of the features found in \\"New Tracks,\\" but also a focus on internal psychological processes. He produced several other dramas through the 1890s, with his last published play, \\"Weigand\\" appearing in 1906. Between 1900 and 1914 Schlaf wrote ten novels. His works show the influence of his readings of Whitman and Ernst Haeckel as well as traces of turn of the century decadence. In 1904, Schlaf moved to Weimar. During the Weimar Republic Germany's defeat in the First World War was a great blow to national pride, but they did not significantly alter the ideas developed by Schlaf. Like other authors of the period, he threw himself into his literary work ‚Äì devoting himself to philosophical and cosmological speculation. During the war he had developed ideas connecting war with evolutionary selection as well as patriotic ideas of German cultural hegemony. During this time there developed a contradiction between the relative lack of success of his recent writings and the growth of his public recognition. Especially during birthdays, Schlaf was celebrated in public ceremonies, commemorated in the naming of streets, the foundation of a \\"Society of the Friends of Johannes Schlaf\\" and the construction of a museum. During the Third Reich In the 1930s Schalf confessed to the creed of National Socialism. Before the First World War, Schlaf's naturalism extended into racial aspects, but the vague concept of a Germanic race could apply to virtually every European nation. After the war, Schlaf's notions of biological evolution extended to the superiority of the German people. After the Nazi takeover in May 1933, Schlaf was appointed to the \\"cleaned\\" Prussian Academy of Arts.. In October of that year, Schlaf was among the 88 writers who signed the \\"vow of most faithful allegiance.\\" He aligned with the Nazis to his death. Schlaf returned to Querfurt in 1937. His late writings focused on the Geocentric model and cosmological speculation and remain mostly unpublished. He continued to be honored by numerous awards in his late age, especially for his early works as a naturalist writer. He died at age 78, and high representatives from the National Socialist government attended his funeral. His papers are held by the State Library in Dortmund.

That's the feeling I get when listening to Steve Lieberman the Gangsta Rabbi's latest DiKtatoR 17...If Lieberman is going for any kind of wit or social commentary, the message is lost as the lyrics are too difficult to understand...although (DiKtator 17) was the album that got Lieberman signed to JDub Records, have a listen and decide for yourself whether it was from talent or just sheer persistence' Rating: 0.5/5.0 In his 2009 review of DiKtator 17, writer Wildy Haskell states 'Steve Lieberman AKA The Gangsta Rabbi is about as eclectic as they come.

This was despite the fact that Jeantet was fully aware of La Cagoule being funded by wealthy industrialists such as Jacques Lemaigre-Dubreuil and Louis Renault, all of whom despised the concept of socialism.Soucy, p. 51 Ultimately Jeantet and La Cagoule leader Eug√®ne Deloncle came to endorse a form of national syndicalism in which corporatist trade unions involving workers and management would be central to a planned economy.Soucy, p. 52 As well as his extensive writing on behalf of La Cagoule Jeantet also played a leading in gun-running for the organisation, smuggling weapons into France from like-minded groups Fascist Italy and Nationalist Spain, as well as Belgium and Switzerland.Mour√© & Alexander, p. 90 During the war Following the Battle of France and the establishment of the Vichy Regime Jeantet, who became a supporter of collaboration with the Nazis, was brought into Philippe P√©tain's government as inspecteur g√©n√©ral √† la propagande.John Emsley (2004) Social Control in Europe, Vol. 2, Ohio State University Press, 2004, p. 314. However, when his initial enthusiasm for collaboration waned, due in large part to the high degree of control exercised by the occupying Germans, Jeantet followed the lead of Deloncle in resigning from the Vichy government in 1942. He would later make contact with the French Resistance, such was his disillusionment with Nazism.Soucy, p. 53 =Relationship to Mitterrand= Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who had been a minor functionary under Vichy, maintained a lifelong friendship with Jeantet even during his Presidency.Michael Curtis (2003) Verdict on Vichy, Phoenix, p. 252.

Showcasing the modern direction of electronic music, the duo signed to Street Quality Entertainment, the Canadian-based record label, releasing a self- titled EP of four songs in June 2011. Having toured with the IDentity Festival, Data Romance has released a single titled \\"The Deep\\", which has been featured in NME and Filter Magazines as well as the BBC Radio 1 program. The duo has been likened to The xx, Bat for Lashes, Lykke Li and Florence and the Machine. The pair are currently on indefinite hiatus.  History  Both Victoria natives, Ajay Bhattacharyya and Amy Kirkpatrick, aged 25 (in 2011), have been playing together since 2009. They first met at the Lucky Bar, home to a bustling and tight-knit community of musicians and fans, where Bhattacharyya filled in as a drummer for Kirkpatrick when she was touring her singer/songwriter act throughout coffee houses in Victoria. After both moving to Vancouver, Kirkpatrick worked as a lighting technician at many well- respected clubs in the city while Bhattacharyya studied sound design for film under Robert Grieve, with mentoring from Craig Berkey. As a musical duo, Bhattacharyya and Kirkpatrick called themselves Names, but later rebranded themselves Data Romance, a name which was derived from a song by Berlin techno icon Ellen Allien. Together, their work experiences have influenced their music and live performances, adding to the \\"soundtrack-like\\" vibe and highly visual live show. Data Romance signed to Street Quality Entertainment in September 2010. The duo has put out all of its releases under the label's name. The first is an original soundtrack called \\"Life Cycles\\" released in January 2011. Their follow up EP, self-titled, released in June of the same year debuts their single (and music video), \\"The Deep\\". The EP and single have been featured on NME, Filter and Zane Lowe‚Äôs Radio 1 BBC program. On September 18th, 2012, Data Romance released their first single, \\"Caves\\", along with a remix bundle on iTunes. Data Romance released their first full-length album, \\"Other\\", on February 19, 2013. After the debut album was released, Ajay Bhattacharyya worked as an independent songwriter and record producer under his own stage name Stint, away from the \\"Data Romance\\" project. His first major appearance was with Carly Rae Jepsen on the song \\"LA Hallucinations\\", which was released on Jepsen's 2015 studio album, entitled E-MO-TION. This sparked his collaboration with NAO on the song \\"Girlfriend\\", which was released off of her debut studio album, entitled For All We Know, and with AlunaGeorge on the songs \\"Jealous\\" and \\"Wanderlust\\", which were released off of the duo's second studio album, entitled I Remember. He then went on to produce majority of the tracks on Gallant's critically acclaimed debut album Ology.  Distribution Advancements  Data Romance showcases the utilization of new or existing technologies in unique ways, such as Bluetooth downloads at concerts, created by their marketing team at The Found Group.

It contains mometasone a steroid and formoterol a long-acting beta agonist. It is only recommended in those in who an inhaled steroid is not sufficient. It is used by inhalation. It should not be used for sudden worsening of asthma. Common side effect include headache and sinusitis. More serious side effects may include thrush, immunosuppression, allergic reactions, and cataracts. Use is not recommended in those less than twelve years of age. It has not been studied during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Mometasone works by decreasing inflammation well formoterol works by relaxing smooth muscle in the airways. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. No generic version is available . In 2017, it was the 243rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. It is not approved for use in the European Union. Medical use It is used in the long-term treatment of asthma. It is not for the treatment of acute bronchospasm. To relieve acute symptoms, a rapid-onset short-duration inhaled bronchodilator (such as salbutamol) should be available.  Warnings and precautions  Long-acting Œ≤ adrenoreceptor agonists (LABAs) are subject to a boxed warning against the possibility of an increased risk of asthma-related death. Formoterol belongs to the LABA class of drugs. As there does not exist at the time of the monograph's publication adequate research to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased with formoterol, it is therefore recommended by the FDA that LABAs only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma controlling medications or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of dual therapy.  Side effects  The most commonly reported side effects were: oral thrush, nausea, headache, and pain in the pharynx or larynx. More rarely reported side effects (occurring in <1% of patients during the clinical trial) include: tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, allergic reaction (bronchospasm, dermatitis, hives), pharyngitis, muscle spasms, tremor, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, and hypertension. Patients experiencing an allergic reaction or increase in difficulty breathing while using this medication should immediately discontinue its use and contact their physician. Society and culture = Legal status = Zenhale was approved in Canada in early 2011. Dulera was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in June 2010. Zenhale's marketing application was voluntarily withdrawn from the EU due to the manufacturer's inability to provide additional information in the necessary timeframe. = Formulation = Mometasone/formoterol is available in a pressurized MDI (pMDI) in three strengths (in micrograms of mometasone/micrograms of formoterol): 50/5, 100/5, and 200/5.

At the age of 105, Brown was the oldest survivor of the Bataan Death March at the time of his death in 2011. Biography =Early life= Brown was born on October 26, 1905, in North Platte, Nebraska to parents, Albert and Ida Fonda Brown. His mother was the aunt of actor Henry Fonda. His father was a railroad engineer. Brown was also the godson of Buffalo Bill. He often related the story of sitting on Bill Cody's lap while they shared a bowl of oatmeal. Following his father's death in a locomotive explosion, Brown was raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa, . He joined the R.O.T.C. in high school. Brown received a bachelor's degree in dentistry from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1927. Dr. Brown was the captain of the Creighton football and basketball teams. =World War II= Brown was drafted into active duty in the military in 1937. He left his wife, Helen, children and dental practice behind. Brown and thousands of American and Filipino troops were captured following the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. He survived the Bataan Death March, in which the Japanese forced 78,000 Allied prisoners of war to march 65 miles from Bataan to a POW camp without food, water or medical attention. An estimated 11,000 prisoners died during the march, including those who were killed when they fell in the jungle. Brown recorded the events he witnessed in secret using a small writing tablet and pencil hidden inside his canvas bag's lining. He witnessed the killing of Filipinos who had attempted to throw fruit to the prisoners in the march. Following the Bataan Death March, Brown endured a three-year imprisonment in a Japanese POW camp from 1942 until he was liberated in the middle of September 1945. He ate nothing but rice while in the camp. Brown became afflicted with more than twelve diseases while in the camp, including dengue fever, malaria and dysentery. He also suffered a broken neck and back. He was released from the camp when he was 40 years old. He was nearly blind from maltreatment and had lost more than eighty pounds, then weighing less than one hundred pounds. A doctor told Brown that he would not live to be 50 years old due to the extent of his injuries. However, he lived to be 105 years old. =Post-war years= Brown moved to Los Angeles, California, after World War II. He was unable to return to dentistry or reopen his practice due to the injuries he sustained in the march and the POW camp. Instead, Brown returned to college and became involved in rental properties, which he purchased and became a landlord. He rented houses and other properties to some of Hollywood's major figures of the time, including Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine. He developed personal friendships with Roy Rogers and John Wayne. He even read for some screen tests while dabbling in acting. He later moved from California to southern Illinois in 1998, settling in the town of Pinckneyville to live with his daughter. He did not openly discuss his experience on the Bataan Death March until the 1990s, approximately fifteen to twenty years before his death. In 2007, Brown was recognized as the oldest living survivor of the Bataan Death March by the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor, a veterans organization. The American War Library, which is located in Gardena, California, also named Brown as the oldest living World War II veteran at the time, though that has never been confirmed by other organizations. His experience during the march and war was chronicled in the 2011 book, Heroes of the Pacific War: One Man‚Äôs True Story, by Kevin Moore and Don Morrow. Albert Brown died in a nursing home in Nashville, Illinois, on August 14, 2011, at the age of 105. His wife of fifty-eight years, Helen Johnson Brown, died in 1985. Brown was survived by his daughter, Peggy Doughty; son, Graham; twelve grandchildren, twenty-eight great grandchildren and nineteen great-great grandchildren.

He served as the first elected Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa under former Governor Peter Tali Coleman from 1978 to 1985. The chiefly title of Tufele before Liamatua's name was bestowed on him by the village of Fitiuta in the Manu'a Islands. He was a paramount chief. Biography =Personal life= Tufele Liamatua was born in American Samoa. His 70th birthday gala was held on Saturday, September 4, 2010, at the Gov. H. Lee Auditorium. His wife, Tofiga, is a longtime nurse at LBJ Tropical Medical Center. =Lieutenant Governor= U.S. Rep. Phillip Burton of California introduced a Bill on June 10, 1976, in the U.S. House of Representatives to allow for the popular election of the Governor and Lt. Governor, rather than appointment by the Interior Secretary. The Bill passed the House by a 377‚Äì1 majority. American Samoa Governor Hyrum Rex Lee approved Public Law 15-23 on May 16, 1977, which called on the U.S. Secretary of the Interior to allow the direct election of the Governor and Lt. Governor. On September 13, 1977, the Department of the Interior issued Order No. 3009 which provided a \\"Provision for Elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and Creation of Office of Government Comptroller\\". This paved the way for American Samoa's first popular gubernatorial election in November 1977. Peter Tali Coleman, who had previously served as appointed Governor during the 1950s, and his running mate, Tufele Liamatua, won the 1977 gubernatorial election on November 1, 1977, becoming the first directly elected Governor and Lt. Governor of American Samoa, respectively. Liamatua was inaugurated as Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa on January 3, 1978. Coleman and Liamatua successfully campaigned for a second full term in office in the 1980 gubernatorial election. Liamatua left office on January 3, 1985, and was succeeded by Eni Faleomavaega. =Public career= Liamatua later served as the Governor of Manu'a District. He also held the position of police commissioner at one point. Liamatua was appointed as the chairman of the Future Political Status Study Commission in 2006. American Samoan Senator Tuaolo Fruean was appointed the Vice Chairman of the commission. The commission was created to study the potential political status of American Samoa, which is currently classified as an unincorporated territory of the United States. Liamatua asked for an extended deadline for the commission's findings. Liamatua called for full autonomy for American Samoa in November 2006, citing a list of political weaknesses which needed to be addressed by the Future Political Status Study Commission. Liamatua noted concerns that while the Governor of American Samoa is elected by the people, he or she can be removed by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior at any time. Liamatua also cited three other examples in his argument for complete autonomy for American Samoa. He reiterated that the United Nations lists American Samoa as a non-self governing territory. He also cited American Samoa's application to join the Pacific Islands Forum as an associate member by Governor Togiola Tulafono, which the U.S. State Department wanted to rescind because the application was not handled by the federal government. Finally, Laimatua criticized interference by the U.S. National Park Service on a deal negotiated by Governor Tulafono to construct a McDonald's restaurant on Utulei Beach. In 2009, Governor Tulafono nominated Liamatua to the board of directors of the LBJ Medical Center. He was confirmed by the American Samoa Senate in a 14‚Äì2 vote. Liamatua was elected to the American Samoa House of Representatives in 2006, representing Su'a Number One District. He became the chairman of the House retirement and communications committees. =Secretary of Samoan Affairs= Governor Togiola Tulafono appointed Liamatua as Secretary of Samoan Affairs on January 7, 2009. He succeeded outgoing Secretary Mauga Tasi Asuega. Liamatua simultaneously became the head of the Department of Local Government upon his appointment to the office. Under American Samoan law, the Secretary of Samoan Affairs is selected and appointed by the Governor from the territory's senior matai, or chiefs. The selection of the Samoan Affairs Secretary is the sole discretion of the Governor and does not need the approval of the American Samoa Fono. One of Liamatua's first duties as Samoan Affairs Secretary was to officiate the ava faatupu, which was held on January 9, 2009, for the second inauguration of Gov. Tulafono and Lt. Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia. Secretary Liamatua is also charged with welcoming visiting dignitaries, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her brief visit to American Samoa in November 2010. On November 28, 2010, Secretary Liamatua called on the American Samoan community to help prevent the spread of HIV and AIDs in a keynote speech presented in the run-up to World AIDS Day at a Sunday church service. =Death= Tufele Liamatua died unexpectedly in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 13, 2011, at the age of 71. He was flown back to American Samoa on board a Hawaiian Airlines flight on October 20, 2011.

The lighthouse was built in 1839 and it was decommissioned in 1890. Villa Lighthouse is located on the island of Villa in the Folda sea. The tall tower was built of granite, soapstone, and brick. It was constructed in a hexagonal shape. The lighthouse was built in 1839 and was the first lighthouse in Norway that was built north of the Trondheimsfjord. It was one of the six coal-fired lighthouses built in Norway during the 1800s, and it is generally considered to be the best preserved of them all. In 1859, it was upgraded to burn liquid fuels. When the lighthouse closed in 1890, the lens was moved to the Nord√∏yan Lighthouse. The lighthouse was replaced by the Ellingr√•sa Lighthouse on the nearby island of Bj√∏r√∏ya.

The presiding deity is Soma (moon). However, the main idol in the temple is that of Kailasanathar or Shiva. The temple is considered one of the nine Navagraha temples in Tamil Nadu. Thingalur is the birth place of Appothi Adigal an ardent devotee of saint Thirunavukkarasar, though the temple has no assets related to the saint. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. Mahasivarathri, Margazhi Thiruvadirai, Panguni Uthiram and Thirukartigai are the major festivals celebrated in the temple. The village finds cursory mention in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Vaippu Sthalam. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple is famous for first feeding of rice to infant children. Legend Newly built gopuram of the temple Legend has it that there lived a merchant Appoodi Adikal, a nayanar in the village of Thingalur who was a devotee of Shiva. Appoodi Adikal held Thirunavukkarasar in high regards. He had many establishments in the village named after Thirunavukkarasar. One day, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar) arrived at Thingalur and was surprised to see so many establishments in his name. Apoodi Adigal was fascinated to meet his idol in person and launched a grand feast. He sent his son to pick plaintain leaves who was killed by a venomous snake bite while the saint was being hosted. Appar, moved by Appoodi Adikal's devotion is said to have miraculously restored the lad to life. During the Tamil month of Purattasi (Sep - Oct) and Panguni (March - April), moon light falls directly on the image of the presiding deity. As per another legend, Chandra (moon), the handsome looking deity, married 28 daughters of Dakkan. He showed preference only to the last one among them, which infuriated the others. They all complained it to Dakkan, who cursed moon to lose all his powers. Chandra is believed to have worshiped Kailasanathar at this place and was restored all his powers. Architecture The temple has a recently built three-tiered rajagopuram surrounded by single prakaram, closed precincts of the temple. The place is revered by the verses of Appar, but since there is no mention about the deity, it is not classified as Padal petra stalam. The image of Chandra is located in the first precinct and houses the image made of black granite and usually clad with white cloth. The temple tank is named Chandrapushkarani. The gopuram and the central shrine faces East, while the main entrance faces South. There are other shrines for Ambal, Subramanya, Gajalakshmi and Bhairavar. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Panoramic view of the temple Religious importance The temple is one of the nine Navagraha temples of Tamil Nadu and is a part of the popular Navagraha pilgrimage in the state - it houses the image of Moon (called Thingal locally). The planets are believed to influence the horoscope computed based on time of one's birth and subsequently influence the course of life. Each of the planets are believed to move from a star to another during a predefined period and thus sway over an individual's fortunes. The Navagrahas, as per Hindu customs, are believed to provide both good and bad effects for any individual and the bad effects are mitigated by prayers. As in other Navagraha temples, the common worship practices of the devotees include offering of cloth, grains, flowers and jewels specific to the planet deity. Lighting a set of lamps is also commonly followed in the temple. As per contemporary Saivite belief, the energies distributed cyclically by Navagrahas can be channeled based on remedial measures. As per local legends, Shiva, the overlord of the nine planetary deities, allowed them to freely grant wishes based on devotion of the devotees. The village finds cursory mention in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Vaippu Sthalam. The temple is frequented by devotees with mental illness and familial problems. Worship and festivals The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 8:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Surya, Usha and Chhaya. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Mahasivarathri, Margazhi Thiruvadirai, Panguni Uthiram and Thirukartigai are the major festivals celebrated in the temple. The temple is famous for first feeding of rice to infant children.

The war, which lasted for about a year, largely revolved around a prolonged siege of Baghdad and ended with al-Mu'tazz as sole caliph. Al-Musta'in was abandoned by his supporters and forced to abdicate; in spite of a guarantee that his life would be spared, he was executed shortly afterward. The outcome of the war was a major victory for the Turkic military establishment, which had been responsible for al-Mu'tazz's rise to power, and allowed the Turks to maintain their effective power over the government and military of the caliphate. The partisans of al-Musta'in, namely the Tahirid family, the Arab military factions, and the citizens of Baghdad, continued to be excluded from the politics of the central government after their surrender, although they were allowed to keep the positions they had before the war. Central Iraq, where most of the fighting took place, was devastated by the activities of both sides. The historian al-Tabari provided a lengthy and detailed account of the war.Saliba (1985) pp. 33-63, 66-108 Other Muslim historians, such as al-Mas'udiMas'udi, pp. 363-7 and al-Ya'qubi,Ya'qubi, p. 610 also mentioned the war in their works. Background Family tree of the Abbasid caliphs of the ninth century The caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861) had created a plan of succession that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al- Muntasir, then by al-Mu'tazz and third by al-Mu'ayyad.Bosworth, \\"Mu'tazz,\\" p. 793 In 861 al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a group of Turkish military officers, likely with the support of al-Muntasir. During al-Muntasir's short reign (861-862), the Turks pressured him into removing al-Mu'tazz and al- Mu'ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkish officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph's cousin al-Musta'in on the throne.Bosworth, \\"Muntasir,\\" p. 583 The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of the disenfranchised al-Mu'tazz; the rioters were put down by the military but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta'in, worried that al-Mu'tazz or al-Mua'yyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy them off and then threw them in prison.Saliba (1985) pp. 6-7 After the suppression of al-Mu'tazz's supporters, the caliph's reign continued largely unabated until 865. The continual inability of the government to pay the soldiers, however, combined with infighting among the ranks of the Turks, threatened the stability of the regime. At the beginning of 865, a quarrel among the Turkish officers broke out, and the general soldiery quickly became involved. When one of the officers was killed, the soldiers turned violent, and soon they were rioting throughout the streets of Samarra. Faced with this hostile situation, al-Musta'in and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha al-Sharabi, decided to leave Samarra for Baghdad, where they were arrived in the first week of February 865. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by the city's powerful Tahirid governor, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, in whose palace the caliph took up his residence.Saliba (1985) pp. 28-31, 34 When the Turks in Samarra realized that al-Musta'in had departed from the city, they cut off traffic to Baghdad.Saliba (1985) p. 33 A delegation of Turks then went to see the caliph; when they arrived, they asked for forgiveness for their actions and for the caliph to return with them to Samarra. Al-Musta'in, while promising the Turks that they would continue to be paid, refused to leave Baghdad, and he and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah mocked them for their perceived insolence. The humiliated Turks angrily returned to Samarra and told their compatriots what had happened; they then decided to depose al-Musta'in. The soldiers released al-Mu'tazz from his prison and acknowledged him as their caliph. Al-Mu'tazz agreed to the proposal and an oath of allegiance was drawn up; many of the officials in Samarra then swore allegiance to him.Saliba (1985) pp. 34-9 Beginning of hostilities With two members of the Abbasid dynasty now claiming to be caliph, war became inevitable. On al-Musta'in's side, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah quickly took command of the military effort. He ordered that all food shipments from Baghdad to Samarra be halted, and instructed allies in the Mosul region to do the same. Letters were sent by Muhammad to friendly commanders calling on them to mobilize their forces, and a recruitment drive was initiated in Baghdad. In preparation for a siege, the city was fortified, with the work being completed by February 22. The bridges and canals around al-Anbar were destroyed, flooding the area and hindering any possible enemy troop movements there.Saliba (1985) pp. 39-42 Muhammad also wrote to the tax officials throughout the empire, instructing them that their revenues were to be sent to Baghdad instead of Samarra.Shaban, p. 82; Saliba (1985) p. 41 For his part, al-Mu'tazz wrote to Muhammad, urging him to declare allegiance to him.Saliba (1985) pp. 41-2 Soon after, al-Mu'tazz put his brother Abu Ahmad (the later al-Muwaffaq) in command of an army and instructed him to fight against al-Musta'in and Muhammad. The army, consisting of five thousand Turkish and Ferghanan (Faraghinah) soldiers under the leadership of Kalbatikin al-Turki and two thousand North African (Magharibah)On this term see Gordon, p. 38 and n. 260 soldiers under the leadership of Muhammad b. Rashid al-Maghribi, departed Samarra on February 24. Six days later they arrived in Ukbara, where Abu Ahmad led the prayers in the name of al-Mu'tazz. The Turks and North Africans began looting the area between Ubkara and Baghdad, causing many of the local residents to abandon their estates and fields. On March 10, Abu Ahmad and his army appeared before the Shammasiyah gate on the East side of Baghdad,Saliba (1985) pp, 43-6 and the siege of the city began. Strategies and military strength =Al-Musta'in= Neither caliph participated in the direct military operations of the war. In Al- Musta'in's case, he was generally content to leave the responsibility of conducting the war effort to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah. As commander, Muhammad opted for an overall defensive strategy. Relying on his position in Baghdad, he was reluctant to engage in any sort of offensive operations outside the city and its surrounding districts, even when he was advised by others to do so. While he did make an effort to securing the nearby towns that controlled access to the city, there is no mention of any attempt to attack Samarra. By staying within Baghdad and keeping the city's supply routes open, while at the same time cutting off foodstuffs and tax receipts meant for Samarra, Muhammad likely believed that he could outlast al-Mu'tazz's armies. A massive amount of work was done to prepare Baghdad for a siege. Walls and trenches were constructed on both the east and west sides of the city, at a cost of over three hundred thousand dinars. Ballistas and mangonels were installed on the walls, and \\"war engines\\" designed to hinder enemy movement were placed in front of the city gates. The market awnings were removed so as to prevent them from being set on fire, and the areas outside the city were ploughed so that the mud would entrap the attackers.Saliba (1985) pp. 40-1 A few days after the fighting began, Muhammad ordered the razing of a large area behind the walls, so that the defenders would have more room to operate in. Muhammad had numerous sources of manpower in his allies and in the people of Baghdad. He could rely on many friendly military commanders to heed his call for assistance, and in the early months of the war several small regiments from Iraq, the Jazira, the Jibal, the Arab-Byzantine frontier and elsewhere arrived in Baghdad.Saliba (1985) pp. 59, 62, 67, 71, 76 Muhammad also had an ally in his nephew Muhammad b. Tahir, who was the governor of most of the eastern provinces, although at the time the latter was largely preoccupied with the rebellion of Hasan b. Zayd in Tabaristan.Bosworth, \\"Tahirids,\\" pp. 102-3 In order to augment the ranks of his soldiers, Muhammad instituted a draft in Baghdad and called on for volunteers to serve al-Musta'in. A group of Khorasani pilgrims en route to Mecca at the time the war began were asked to stay and fight. Many of the city's brigands were also recruited and provided with weapons. At first they were given mats to protect themselves and bags of rocks or bricks to attack the enemy with;Saliba (1985) p. 41 later they were given clubs, placed under their own chief and registered in the military roll so that they could be paid.Saliba (1985) p. 66 Arab Bedouins and Kurdish tribesmen from the surrounding regions also fought for al-Musta'in.Saliba (1985) pp. 46-7, 75-6 In keeping with normal Abbasid court practice,Stillman, pp. 42-3 gifts were routinely bestowed upon officers and soldiers by both al- Musta'in and Muhammad. Tabari's narrative of events contains numerous instances of commanders being rewarded for their service. They were given gifts on a number of occasions, such as their initial arrival in Baghdad with their troops, distinguishing themselves on the battlefield, or being selected to lead an important mission. Traditional robes of honor were regularly given out; other gifts included jewelry, ceremonial swords, money, and increased allotments for the troops.Saliba (1985) pp. 43, 46, 49, 59, 62, 67, 69, 71-2, 75, 77-8, 90 The exact size of the army under Muhammad's command is not explicitly stated, but it was likely much greater than al-Mu'tazz's forces.Kennedy, \\"Muslim World,\\" p. 279 As many of his units were irregulars, however, their conduct in battle was not always reliable, and they were disciplined often for their failure to follow orders. In addition, while many army commanders were willing to pledge themselves to al-Musta'in's cause, not all of them were willing to take orders from Muhammad; there are multiple instances of pro-Musta'in regiments outside Baghdad acting independently and engaging the Turks on their own initiative. =Al-Mu'tazz= From the start of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was concerned with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince the people that they could switch their allegiance to him without breaking the oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, and went through the effort to explain in detail how this could be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah. Al-Mu'tazz was initially accommodating toward those in Samarra who opposed his bid for the caliphate, and did not compel anyone to swear the oath to him if they refused to do so.Saliba (1985) pp. 38-9 He did, however, write to commanders stationed throughout the empire requesting their support, and soon reinforcements were arriving in Samarra.Saliba (1985) pp. 42-3 As the conflict progressed, he steadily gained followers as members of al-Musta'in's camp began to defect to him.Saliba (1985) pp. 86-7 He also made efforts to entice al-Musta'in's officers, writing offers to them and promising substantial rewards if they would switch their allegiance to him.Saliba (1985) pp. 89-90 Al-Mu'tazz's brother Abu Ahmad was put in charge of the Samarran forces at the beginning of the war. He was charged by the caliph with defeating al-Musta'in and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, and was given the authority to command the army in any manner he pleased.Saliba (1985) p. 43 Abu Ahmad's overall strategy was to keep Baghdad under constant attack from his troops, and to gain the surrender of the city by either assaulting it or starving its inhabitants until they lost the will to fight any longer. Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any revenue shipments heading toward the city.Saliba (1985) pp. 58-9, 76 The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly wrote him a letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation,Saliba (1985) p. 73 but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict. Abu Ahmad's army at the beginning of the siege numbered approximately 7,000 soldiers. Additional troops sent from Samarra a short time later increased its size to 11,000, though a large number of the reinforcements were killed soon after their arrival.Saliba (1985) pp. 48-9 At a later point in the war, a spy for Muhammad b. 'Abdallah reported that the besieging armies on the East and West sides of Baghdad totaled 19,000 men, and that al-Mu'tazz had very few additional troops to put in the field, since Samarra had been almost completely emptied of soldiers.Saliba (1985) p. 72 Major events of the war Fighting during the war lasted for slightly less than a year, with hostile engagements occurring everywhere from the Jazira in the north to the borders of Khuzestan in the southeast.Saliba (1985) p. 74-5, 87 Most of the battles of the war, however, took place in Iraq; specifically at Baghdad, where al-Musta'in had made his residence, and the districts surrounding the city. =Baghdad= Northern Baghdad as it existed at the time of the siege, showing the location of the walls of al-Musta'in For the first few days after the arrival of Abu Ahmad and his army before the gates of Baghdad, the two sides refrained from directly engaging each other in combat. On March 14, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah approached the enemy camp and called on the Samarrans to depart; if they did, he guaranteed that al-Musta'in would recognize al-Mu'tazz as heir-apparent. If they refused to leave, however, Muhammad intended to initiate hostilities the following morning.Saliba (1985) pp. 45-6 The next day, the Samarrans approached the Shammasiyyah and Khorasan gates along the eastern wall and attempted to force their way through them. The Baghdadis responded by firing upon them with arrows, mangonels and ballistas, inflicting heavy casualties upon the attackers. At the Khorasan Gate, the Turks attempted to move up an artillery piece into firing range, but a charge by the regular and irregular Baghdadi forces dislodged the enemy from their position. By the end of the day, the Samarrans withdrew back to their camp; both sides had sustained hundreds of casualties from the fighting.Saliba (1985) p. 47 On March 20 a second army sent from Samarra, consisting of 4,000 Turks, North Africans and Ferghanans, arrived in front of the western side of Baghdad and made camp near the Gates of the Fief and Qatrabbul. The next morning, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah ordered a large contingent of infantry and cavalry to battle them. At first the Samarrans had the upper hand, and were able to force the Baghdadis into a narrow area near the Gate of the Fief. Baghdadi reinforcements soon arrived, however, and the combined forces were able to drive the Samarrans back. Having gained the initiative, the defenders charged and forced the Samarrans to retreat to an area where yet another Baghdadi force lay in ambush. At this point, the Samarran retreat turned into a rout, and the troops began to flee for their lives. Many attempted to swim across the Tigris to Abu Ahmad's camp, but were seized by boats patrolling the river. The rest turned north, with some of the soldiers going all the way back to Samarra. The battle for the Qatrabbul Gate had been a massive victory for the Baghdadis. Of the four thousand Samarrans stationed on the western side of the city, two thousand of them had been killed, with several of their heads being hung around Baghdad, and many others were taken prisoner. In Samarra, news of the defeat was met with rioting; many among the populace apparently considered the battle to be a sign of the weakness of al-Mu'tazz's forces.Saliba (1985) p. 61 Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, however, refused to follow up on his victory. Rejecting the council of his advisors to press his advantage and pursue the fleeing soldiers, his only order after the battle was to have proclamation of victory drawn up and read in the Jama Mosque of the Round City.Saliba (1985) p. 50 Meanwhile, Abu Ahmad's army, which is not mentioned as having participated in the battle that day, remained encamped on the eastern side. As a result, the siege of the city continued. After the battle for the Qatrabbul Gate, the siege effectively turned into a stalemate. Throughout the late spring and summer, the Samarrans and Baghdadis regularly engaged each other around the defensive fortifications of the city and inflicted many casualties on each other, but neither side was able to gain a clear advantage.Saliba (1985) pp. 59-61, 63, 66-70, 72, 90-1 Over the following months, the fighting spread to the districts neighboring Baghdad, as both sides fought to control the routes leading into the city. The Samarrans were able to limit the level of supplies reaching the defenders, but were unable to prevent the Baghdadi armies from moving in and out of the city. The stalemate around Baghdad remained unbroken until early September. On the morning of September 8, however, the Samarran armies on both sides of the city engaged in a major assault on the fortifications. While the Samarrans on the eastern side attacked the Shammasiyyah Gate, the Turks and North Africans on the western side managed to punch through the initial line of defenses and advance to the Anbar Gate. Despite being caught unaware, the defenders at the Anbar Gate put up a staunch resistance, but eventually they were forced to retreat and the Anbar Gate was set on fire. The Samarrans then entered Baghdad and spread throughout the Harbiyah quarter of the city, setting fire to the areas that they entered. The residents of the neighborhoods that the Samarrans passed through fled for their lives, and the Samarran troops planted flags in the parts of the city that they conquered. In response to the assault Muhammad b. 'Abdallah gathered his commanders together, and then sent men to the gates all along the western side of the city. The reinforcements engaged the Samarrans and, after killing a large number of them, forced them back to the gateways. Fighting continued until the late afternoon, with the defenders finally managing to expel the Samarrans from the gates and forcing them to flee back to their camp. The areas in the wall where the Samarrans had broken through were ordered repaired. The assault on the eastern side of the city also failed, as the Baghdadis were able to force the attackers back. As with the fighting on the western side, many Baghdadi and Samarran soldiers were killed in the battle for the Shammasiyyah Gate.Saliba (1985) pp. 91-2 The assault having therefore failed, the Samarrans returned to their siege positions. As the siege continued into autumn, Muhammad worked with his lieutenants to plan a sally in an attempt to break the stalemate. The mangonels and ballistas along the walls were prepared for action, and in late November the city gates were opened. The entire Baghdadi army then came out of the city, while river boats loaded with bowmen and artillery moved up the Tigris. They attacked the Samarran army and routed them, forcing them to flee. The Samarran camp was plundered and the irregulars began cutting off the heads of the slain. The Samarran position was saved only when Abu Ahmad made a stand and rallied the troops to regroup; at the same time, the Baghdadis lost their focus and their charge stalled. The Samarrans soon returned to their camp, while the Baghdadis retreated back to the city.Saliba (1985) pp. 95-6 =Al- Nahrawan= The town of al-Nahrawan lay just to the east of Baghdad. Its importance lay in the fact that it was the first stage on the road from Baghdad to Khorasan,Le Strange, \\"Lands\\" p. 61 the latter of which was governed by Muhammad b. 'Abdallah's nephew; whoever controlled the town would therefore be able to stop or allow transportation between the two locations. Before the siege of Baghdad began, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah sent five hundred infantry and cavalry to al-Nahrawan to defend it against the Turks. Later, another seven hundred soldiers were dispatched to the town to reinforce the first group. On March 19, nine days after Abu Ahmad had arrived in front of Baghdad, a force of Turks marched to al-Nahrawan challenge Muhammad's control of it. The defenders decided to meet the Turks on the field, and a battle ensued. The Turks soon gained the upper hand, and the defenders turned and fled to Baghdad. Fifty of the defenders had died in the battle, and the Turks sent their heads to Samarra, along with mounts and weapons that the defenders had abandoned. With the Turks victorious, they gained control of the Khorasan road, and traffic between there and Baghdad was cut off. When Muhammad learned of the defeat, he recalled troops stationed further down the road at Hamadan and ordered their return to Baghdad.Saliba (1985) pp. 47-8 Although Muhammad is not recorded as having made any attempts to retake al-Nahrawan, the town continued to suffer during the conflict. At some date after the battle, a group of Samarrans returning from deployment in the Jibal entered al-Nahrawan. For unstated reasons, the Samarran commander ordered his troops to plunder the town. The soldiers then began attacking the local residents, and most of the citizens were forced to flee.Saliba (1985) p. 59 =Al-Anbar and Qasr ibn Hubayrah= Al-Anbar, lying on the Euphrates to the west of Baghdad, was a major town in the early Abbasid era.Le Strange, \\"Lands,\\" pp. 65-6 At the outbreak of hostilities, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah ordered its ruler to prepare for its defense. The canals and bridges around the town were cut, and the surrounding area was turned into a large swamp. By the middle of spring the commander of al-Anbar had raised a force of several thousand Bedouin recruits, and he sent a request to Muhammad for reinforcements. Muhammad promptly ordered over a thousand more cavalry and infantry to depart for the town.Saliba (1985) pp. 75-6 In Samarra, meanwhile, plans were developed to attack al-Anbar, and soon al-Mu'tazz sent a force of Turks and North Africans under Muhammad ibn Bugha to take the town. The defense at al-Anbar was split into two groups, with the reinforcements stationed outside the town and the Bedouins within. When the Samarran army arrived before al-Anbar, they caught the reinforcements by surprise and quickly fell upon them. Some of the defenders put up a fight, but they soon fled, with many of them killed or becoming prisoners. When the commander of the town saw the reinforcements flee, he decided to abandon his post. He and his troops crossed over to the other side of the river, cut the pontoon bridge, and made their way back to Baghdad.Saliba (1985) pp. 76-7 With al-Anbar now lacking any defense, its residents decided to surrender on terms. After giving guarantees of safe conduct to the Anbaris, the Turks and North Africans entered the town, and allowed the people to go about their business. The next day, however, the soldiers seized a shipment of goods arriving from Raqqa and began looting the town. They sent the heads of the slain to Samarra, along with the prisoners that had been captured, and unsuccessfully attempted to dam a water route running between the Euphrates and Baghdad.Saliba (1985) p. 79 When the defeated armies of al-Anbar arrived at Baghdad, Muhammad gave orders that the town was to be retaken. A contingent of troops was sent to Qasr ibn Hubayrah further down the Euphrates and awaited orders to advance. Meanwhile, an army of over a thousand men was raised in Baghdad and put under the command of al- Husayn b. Isma'il, who was instructed to head directly to the town and defeat the Samarran garrison stationed there. After a delay caused by an issue with the troops' pay, the army departed in late June.Saliba (1985) pp. 77-80 The Baghdadi army was assailed almost immediately after their departure by the Turks and North Africans, who attempted to prevent their reaching al-Anbar. In spite of stiff resistance, the Baghdadis were able to construct a bridge across a canal guarded by the Turks and fight them off, but after twelve days they had still failed to reach al-Anbar. Eventually the Turks, who had spies in the al-Husayn's army, were able to ambush their camp. Despite inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers, the Baghdadi army soon fell in disorder, and many of the soldiers were either killed or drowned in the Euphrates. The cavalry turned tail and fled, and when the officers realized that they had lost control of the situation they retreated as well. The Turks then plundered the enemy camp and rounded up the prisoners they had captured. Both sides suffered hundreds of dead and wounded from the fighting.Saliba (1985) pp. 80-2 The remnants of the defeated army retreated back to Baghdad, encamping in the city suburbs in the first week of July. Muhammad gave orders that al-Husayn was to be refused entry to Baghdad, and that any of al-Husayn's men that did not promptly leave the city for his camp would be flogged and denied pay. Al- Musta'in also sent a letter to the encamped soldiers, chastising them for their failure and accusing them of disobedience and mutiny. Al-Husayn was told to gather his men and make another effort to retake al-Anbar. By mid-July, al- Husayn's forces were ready, and for the second time they headed to retake the town.Saliba (1985) pp. 82-4 Al-Husayn's second campaign was to end as badly as the first. Once again the Turks defending the land between Baghdad and al- Anbar attacked the Baghdadi army. Al-Husayn was able to fight them off for several days, but eventually the Turks were able to outmaneuver him and rout the guards stationed on his flanks. When they attacked al-Husayn's army itself, they quickly defeated his men and overran his camp. Al-Husayn himself managed to escape on a river skiff, but a hundred of his men were killed and 170 had been taken prisoner, including several of the officers. Al-Husayn and the other survivors returned to Baghdad,Saliba (1985) pp. 84-6 and there were no further attempts to retake al-Anbar. Qasr ibn Hubayrah, the other western town garrisoned by Muhammad's forces, was taken by the Turks shortly after. Following the conquest of al-Anbar, the Samarran army headed to Qasr ibn Hubayrah and intended to expel the Baghdadis stationed there. Instead, its commander decided to flee the town, giving it up to the Turks without resisting.Saliba (1985) p. 93 =Al-Mada'in= Al-Mada'in, to the south of Baghdad in the direction of Wasit, was a series of settlements lying in the midst of the ancient Persian imperial centers of Ctesiphon and Seleucia.Wheatley, p. 402 n. 78 On April 21, on the orders of Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, Abu 'l-Saj Dewdad departed Baghdad for al-Mada'in at the head of three thousand cavalry and infantry units. He arrived in the area and settled his troops there. Later he wrote to Muhammad requesting reinforcements, which were sent to him.Saliba (1985) p. 75 Over the course of the summer, the Turks began appearing in the vicinity of al-Mada'in in strength. Abu 'l-Saj responding by advancing further south, to the district of Jarjaraya, where in August he defeated a contingent of Turks and killed their commander.Saliba (1985) p. 87 In October he again fought the Turks near Jarjaraya and killed or captured a large number of them. Despite these victories, Abu 'l-Saj was reportedly unsatisfied with the performance of his troops during the fighting, and Muhammad arranged for more reinforcements to be sent to assist him. The reinforcements set out on October 23 and, after marching the entire day, arrived at al-Mada'in just as an army of Turks also appeared before the city. Combat between the two sides began, but the defenders were quickly overwhelmed when the Turks found a breach in the city wall and forced their way through it. The defenders tried to implement an orderly retreat, with the infantry being loaded onto boats and moved along the river while the cavalry covered their withdrawal, but the Turks continued to engage them and the commander of the reinforcements died in the chaos. With al-Mada'in now lost to them, the survivors made their way to Abu 'l-Saj's camp. Muhammad was angered by the result of the battle, and ordered several of those who had fought at al- Mada'in to be placed under house arrest.Saliba (1985) pp. 93-4 End of the war As the siege of Baghdad wore on, it began to have its intended effect. Food and money slowly became scarce, and discontent among the populace began to emerge. As early as August, a group of members of the Abbasid family complained to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah that their stipends were not being paid.Saliba (1985) pp. 87-8 As conditions in the city deteriorated, Muhammad gradually became convinced that victory through force of arms was impossible. By November at the latest, and without the knowledge or permission of al- Musta'in, he had opened negotiations with al-Mu'tazz regarding al-Musta'in's surrender. Muhammad and al-Mu'tazz had already started negotiating with each other when the former launched his failed sally. After the battle, al-Mu'tazz criticized Muhammad for acting in bad faith, and the Samarran army intensified the siege. Soon the city was running low on resources. Crowds began appearing before Muhammad's palace, crying \\"hunger!\\" and demanding a resolution to their problems. Muhammad held off the crowds with promises, and at the same time sent an offer of peace to al-Mu'tazz. This was responded to favorably, and beginning on December 8 a representative from Abu Ahmad's camp began meeting Muhammad in private to discuss how to end the conflict.Saliba (1985) pp. 96-7 As the siege progressed into December, the population of Baghdad became more agitated. On December 16, some of the regular infantry and commoners gathered together, with the former demanding their pay and the latter complaining about how food prices had skyrocketed. Muhammad was able to convince them to temporarily disperse, but riots broke out in the city two days later and it was only with difficulty that they were quelled. Meanwhile, negotiations between Muhammad and Abu Ahmad continued; emissaries were sent by Muhammad to Abu Ahmad's camp, and Samarran prisoners of war were released. Toward the end of December, a provisional agreement between the two sides to depose al- Musta'in was reached, and Abu Ahmad sent five ships loaded with foodstuffs and fodder to relieve the shortages in the city.Saliba (1985) pp. 97-8 When the citizens of Baghdad learned that Muhammad had agreed to depose al-Musta'in, they angrily assembled outside his palace. Out of loyalty to al-Musta'in and fears that Muhammad's surrender could result in the Samarrans plundering the city, they attacked the palace gates and fought against the guards. In order to calm the protestors, al-Musta'in appeared above the palace gate with Muhammad at his side, and he gave assurances to the crowd that he was still caliph and that he would lead the Friday prayers the next morning. The following day, December 28, he failed to appear; in response, the houses of Muhammad's subordinates were looted and a large crowd again approached Muhammad's palace, forcing al-Musta'in to make another public appearance. Shortly after this he moved out of Muhammad's palace to another residence in the city,Saliba (1985) pp. 99-102 and on January 2, 866, he led the prayer for the Feast of Sacrifice.Saliba (1985) p. 104 Muhammad, for his part, strove to convince the people that he was still acting in al-Musta'in's best interests,Saliba (1985) p. 102 while at the same time continuing to negotiate with Abu Ahmad regarding the terms of surrender. On January 7, Muhammad and Abu Ahmad met in person under a canopy outside the Shammasiyah gate, and the two men agreed that the state revenues would be split among the parties, with two thirds going to the Turks and one third going to Muhammad and the Baghdadi army, and al-Musta'in should be held liable for part of the soldiers' pay.Shaban, p. 84; Saliba (1985) pp. 104-5 On the following day, Muhammad went to al-Musta'in and attempted to convince him to abdicate. At first al-Musta'in adamantly refused, but when the Turkish officers Wasif and Bugha stated that they had sided with Muhammad, he agreed to step down.Saliba (1985) pp. 106-7 As part of the terms of al-Musta'in's abdication, he was to be given an estate in the Hijaz, and allowed to travel between the cities of Mecca and Medina. On January 12, Muhammad brought a group of judges and jurists to witness that al- Musta'in had entrusted his affairs to him. Delegates carrying the terms of abdication were sent to Samarra, where al-Mu'tazz personally signed the document and agreed to the conditions. The delegates returned to Baghdad with the signed document on January 24, accompanied by a group of emissaries sent to secure al-Musta'in's allegiance to al-Mu'tazz.Saliba (1985) pp. 106-8 On Friday, January 25, al-Mu'tazz was acknowledged as caliph in the mosques throughout Baghdad.Saliba (1985) p. 113 Aftermath The outcome of the war did nothing to solve the problems that had been responsible for it in the first place. The revenues of the state were still massively insufficient to pay the soldiers' salaries,Saliba (1985) p. 143 causing violence to break out among the troops. The military continued to demand complete control over the affairs of the state, and met with hostility the attempts to the caliphs to reduce their authority. As a result, the government soon reverted to the state of instability it had been in before the war. The war was, at least economically speaking, extremely destructive for the empire.Saliba, p. xii The costs of campaigning for both sides, including paying for soldiers' and officers' salaries and other wartime expenses, was enormous. The cutting of the canals around al-Anbar contributed to a long term economic decline in the region,Kennedy, \\"Muslim World,\\" pp. 277-8 and the numerous acts of plunder and forcing people from their fields disrupted the productivity of the empire's richest province,Waines, p. 300. For Iraq's status as the chief source of revenue for the caliphate, see Levy, p. 317 putting additional financial strain on the state. Baghdad was devastated, with the eastern side of the city never fully recovering from the damage it incurred during the war.Le Strange, \\"Baghdad,\\" pp. 247, 313-4 Within the city, the populace had gone several months without adequate supplies, and price inflation and deprivation became common.Gordon, p. 96 The human cost of the war is difficult to determine, since no comprehensive casualty figures are mentioned, but at the very least it ranged in the thousands.Saliba (1985) p. 49 contains the largest casualty count of a single battle, at 2,000 In spite of the terms of abdication, al- Musta'in was not allowed to go into exile to the Hijaz, but was instead moved to Wasit.Saliba (1985) p. 115 In October 866 he was ordered to travel to Samarra, but on October 17, when he had arrived in the vicinity of the city, he was intercepted by a group of men sent to kill him and was quickly executed.Saliba (1985) pp. 132-3 Al-Mu'tazz's caliphate after the war was to prove to be short and violent. His brothers Abu Ahmad, who had been responsible for his victory in the war, and al-Mu'ayyad were both thrown in prison in 866, with al-Mu'ayyad dying a short time later. Meanwhile, infighting among the military soon flared up again, and numerous officers, including Wasif and Bugha, were killed. Finally, due to the inability of the caliph to pay them, in July 869 a group of Turkish, North African and Ferghanan soldiers forced al-Mu'tazz to abdicate and he died from maltreatment a few days later.Bosworth, \\"Mu'tazz,\\" pp. 793-4 The only member of the Abbasid family to benefit from the conflict in the long term was Abu Ahmad. He developed strong connections with the Turkish leadership, and this relationship was what possibly prevented al-Mu'tazz from killing him when he was imprisoned the following year.Saliba (1985) pp. 131-2 In spite of his imprisonment and subsequent exile, he remained a powerful figure in the government and was a possible contender for the caliphate in 869.Waines (1992) p. 4 From the ascension of al-Mu'tamid in 870, he was the de facto ruler of the empire with the title of al-Muwaffaq, although he never formally became caliph.Kennedy, \\"Muwaffak,\\" p. 801 Thanks to his close ties to the Turks, he became the chief military commander of the state. His son al-Mu'tadid actually did become caliph in 892, and all subsequent Abbasid caliphs were descended from him. Al-Musta'in's defeat resulted in Samarra remaining the capital city of the caliphate. It would continue to serve as such until 892, during the caliphate of al-Mu'tadid; thereafter the seat of the caliphs remained at Baghdad.Christensen, p. 93; Northedge, p 696 Notes References  *Christensen, Peter.

During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005) he signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement of 1997 as representative for the Union of Sudan African Parties (USAP). Early years Samuel Aru Bol was born in Rumbek, Lakes State in 1929. He was first elected to the Parliament of Sudan in 1968. He had a complicated political career during the presidency of Gaafar Nimeiry (1969-1985). On 3 May 1972 the Addis Ababa agreement was ratified as \\"The Southern Provinces Regional Self-Government Act 1972\\", bringing an end to the First Sudanese Civil War. Samuel Aru Bol and Joseph Oduho were appointed to the southern executive. Samuel Aru Bol was made vice-president of the High Executive Council (HEC), the government of the autonomous southern Sudan. As HEC vice-president and speaker of the Assembly he became involved in a scandal related to the handling of 30,000 Sudanese pounds intended for refugee resettlement. On 4 January 1982 Samuel Aru Bol was among 21 leading politicians who were arrested in Juba, charged with forming an illegal party, the \\"Council for Unity of Southern Sudan\\". Others arrested were Clement Mboro, Michael Wal and Martin Majier. After Nimeiri was ousted in the coup of April 1985, Samuel Aru Bol was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the Transitional Military Government of President Sowar al-Dahab. He created the Southern Sudanese Political Association (SSPA), which won ten seats in the 1986 elections. In July 1987 the SSPA joined forces with four other southern parties in a coalition called the Union of Sudanese African Parties (USAP), led by James Eliaba Surur. Omar al-Bashir regime Samuel Aru Bol and other senior politicians were arrested after the coup of 30 June 1989 that brought Omar al-Bashir to power. He was held for six months without charge or trial. After the coup, James Eliaba was imprisoned, tortured, then allowed to go into exile in Uganda. In 1991, Samuel Aru Bol was 62 years of age, married with eight children. He was arrested in Khartoum on 14 October 1991 for criticizing a government decision that schools in South Sudan, and schools in the north set up for Internally Displaced People (IDPs) from the south, would use Arabic rather than English. This was seen as another step in the move to Arabicize the country and submerge the cultural identity of southerners who had in the past been instructed in English. From 1994 to 1998, Samuel Aru Bol spent time in Nairobi, Kenya with John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army. However, in a 1998 interview he cast doubts on Garang's sincerity in seeking peace. In 1996 Samuel Aru Bol agreed to sign the Preliminary Peace Charter, and on 21 April 1997 he signed the Khartoum Agreement as representative of the USAP, assuming an authority that may not have been justified.

Relations between Japan and North Korea have not been formally established, but there have been diplomatic talks between the two governments to discuss the issue of kidnapped Japanese citizens and North Korea's nuclear program. Relations between the two countries are severely strained and marked by tension and hostility. According to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, 91% of Japanese people view North Korea's influence negatively, with just 1% expressing a positive view; the most negative perception of North Korea in the world.2014 World Service Poll BBC History See History of Japan‚ÄìKorea relations for the pre-1945 history. In the first years after the proclamation of the North Korean state, relations between Pyongyang and Tokyo were mostly hostile and practically non-existent. In 1949-1950, the North Korean leadership vehemently condemned the economic and political negotiations between Japan and the administration of Syngman Rhee.Bruce Cumings, The Origins of the Korean War II: The Roaring of the Cataract 1947-1950 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990), pp. 458-459. Later, however, North Korea sought to take advantage of the conflict that erupted between Japan and South Korea over the Syngman Rhee Line. In response to the initiative of Japanese Prime Minister Ichir≈ç Hatoyama, who sought to achieve a rapprochement with the Soviet Union and other Communist countries, in February 1955 North Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il issued a statement calling for economic and cultural cooperation with Japan. From 1955 to 1964, Japanese- North Korean economic relations underwent gradual expansion, partly because Pyongyang sought to prevent a Japanese-South Korean rapprochement by adopting a cooperative attitude toward Tokyo, and partly because North Korea tried to reduce its economic dependence on the Soviet Union.Kiwon Chung, Japanese-North Korean Relations Today, Asian Survey, Vol. 4, Issue 4 (April 1964), pp. 788-803. In 1955, North Korea assisted in establishing the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, Chongryon in Korean, which serves as an advocacy organization for ethnic Koreans in Japan who identify with the DPRK and acts as North Korea's de facto embassy in Japan. Voluntary repatriation of Korean residents from Japan to North Korea progressed slowly but smoothly after the conclusion of the Red Cross agreement of 1959. By late 1960, almost 50,000 of the estimated 600,000 Korean residents had arrived in North Korea aboard chartered Soviet ships. The repatriation program was extended for another year in October 1960 to accommodate the estimated 60,000 still wishing repatriation. In 1965, the North Korean government sharply criticized the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea. Under Premier Eisaku Sat≈ç, Japanese-North Korean relations underwent a deterioration, but in 1971-1972, the process of Sino-Japanese rapprochement induced Japanese companies to broaden their economic cooperation with the DPRK. Under Premier Kakuei Tanaka, the Japanese government adopted a policy of equidistance toward North Korea and South Korea, and refused to take sides with Seoul against Pyongyang during the Mun Se-gwang affair. Nevertheless, it still refrained from establishing diplomatic relations with North Korea. Under Takeo Miki and his successors, Japan switched back to a policy that clearly favored the ROK over the DPRK. The North Korean leadership felt increasingly isolated when Takeo Fukuda concluded the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China, and Yasuhiro Nakasone visited South Korea in 1983. In periods of Japanese-ROK cooperation and Japanese-DPRK friction, Pyongyang often expressed its dissatisfaction by raising the issue of the Liancourt Rocks dispute.Bal√°zs Szalontai, \\"Instrumental Nationalism? The Dokdo Problem Through the Lens of North Korean Propaganda and Diplomacy,\\" Journal of Northeast Asian History, Vol. 10, Issue 2 (Winter 2013), pp. 128-139. On Japan's attitude toward the Mun Segwang affair, see Victor D. Cha, Alignment Despite Antagonism: The United States- Korea-Japan Security Triangle (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1999), pp. 124-130. Until the late 1980s, North Korea's policy toward Japan was mainly aimed at minimizing cooperation between South Korea and Japan, and at deterring Japan's rearmament while striving for closer diplomatic and commercial ties with Japan. Crucial to this policy was the fostering within Japan of support for North Korea, especially among the Japanese who supported the Japanese communist and socialist parties and the Korean residents of Japan. Over the years, however, North Korea did much to discredit itself in the eyes of many potential supporters in Japan. Japanese who had accompanied their spouses to North Korea had endured severe hardships and were prevented from communicating with relatives and friends in Japan. Japan watched with disdain as North Korea gave safe haven to elements of the Japanese Red Army, which Japan designates as a terrorist group. North Korea's inability or refusal to pay its debts to Japanese traders also reinforced popular Japanese disdain for North Korea. Japan‚ÄìNorth Korea relations turned more antagonistic in the late 1980s. The two governments did not maintain diplomatic relations and had no substantive contacts. The opposition Japan Socialist Party nonetheless had cordial relations with the North Korean regime. Japan allowed trade with North Korea only through unofficial channels, reportedly exceeding US$200 million annually in the 1980s. Issues in Japan‚ÄìNorth Korea relations that produced tensions included North Korean media attacks on Japan, Japan's imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea for terrorist acts against South Korea in the 1980s, and unpaid North Korean debts to Japanese enterprises of about $50 million. As of 2017, Japan‚ÄìNorth Korea relations are at an all-time low after North Korea, on two separate occasions, test-launched nuclear capable ballistic missile into Japanese waters. =Normalization talks= In the early 1990s, Japan conducted lengthy negotiations with North Korea aimed at establishing diplomatic relations while maintaining its relations with Seoul. In September 1990 Japanese political delegation led by former deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru of the Liberal Democratic Party visited North Korea. Following private meetings between Kanemaru and North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, a joint declaration released on September 28 called for Japan to apologize and to compensate North Korea for its period of colonial rule. Japan and North Korea agreed to begin talks aimed at the establishment of diplomatic relations. In January 1991, Japan began normalization talks with Pyongyang with a formal apology for its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The negotiations were aided by Tokyo's support of a proposal for simultaneous entry into the United Nations by North Korea and South Korea; the issues of international inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities and the nature and amount of Japanese compensations, however, proved more difficult to negotiate. Coincidental with the changing patterns in its relations with China and Russia, North Korea has moved to improve its strained relations with Japan. Pyongyang's primary motives appear to be a quest for relief from diplomatic and economic isolation, which has caused serious shortages of food, energy, and hard currency. Normalization of relations with Japan also raises the possibility of North Korea's gaining monetary compensation for the period of Japan's colonial rule (1910‚Äì45), a precedent set when Japan normalized relations with South Korea. The first round of normalization talks was held January 30‚Äì31, 1991, but quickly broke down over the question of compensation. Pyongyang has demanded compensation for damages incurred during colonial rule as well as for \\"sufferings and losses\\" in the post-World War II period. Japan, however, insists that North Korea first resolve its differences with South Korea over the question of bilateral nuclear inspections. Other points of contention are North Korea's refusal both to provide information about Japanese citizens who had migrated to North Korea with their Korean spouses in the 1960s, and the issue of Japanese soldiers taken prisoner by the Soviets during WWII and sent to North Korea. Abductions The abductions of Japanese citizens from Japan by agents of the North Korean government occurred during a period of six years from 1977 to 1983. For many years North Korea denied the abductions, but it admitted to 13 of them in 2002. In one instance, Yi Un Hee, a Korean resident of Japan, was kidnapped to North Korea to teach Japanese in a school for espionage agents. In 2002 and 2004, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made two high- profile visits to Pyongyang to press for their return. North Korea eventually returned five of the thirteen kidnapped, claiming the other eight had died. The positive effect on relations disintegrated when Japan claimed that a DNA test had proved that the returned remains of Megumi Yokota, kidnapped at 13 and said by North Korea to have committed suicide, were in fact not hers. Japan has pressed North Korea to come clean on the abduction, but Pyongyang insists that the issue has already been resolved. Many North Korean citizens rely on money sent from relatives in Japan. Some in Japan believe that the government should threaten to cut off those remittances to force Pyongyang to make concessions. Others believe that the political right in Japan is exploiting that and other issues to advance its own nationalist agenda. President Trump brought up the issue at his meeting with Chairman Kim at the request of Prime Minister Abe and he said that \\"it will be worked on.\\" No further elaboration was given.https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180612_55/ Other activity There have been several confrontations between the two nations over North Korean clandestine activity in Japan besides the abductions including drug smuggling, marine poaching, and spying. North Korean missile tests are a concern for Japan because the missiles sometimes travel through Japanese airspace and territory. In 1998, North Korea successfully fired a Taepodong-1 ballistic missile that crossed over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. This test launch was viewed as an act of political defiance as negotiations on the future of North Korea's nuclear program development were taking place between North Korea and the United States in New York. On March 17, 2017, Japan held the first ever evacuation drill after North Korean missile tests. On the same day, President Trump told North Korea that it was ‚Äúbehaving very badly‚Äù shortly after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hinted at striking North Korea while on a visit to South Korea. In November 2019, North Korea‚Äôs state media warned that Japan may see a real ballistic missile in the near future after the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Pyongyang‚Äôs latest test of multiple-rocket launcher a ballistic missile launch. Six-party talks On February 13, 2007, the six-party talks produced an agreement in which North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards normalization of relations with both the United States and Japan. Recent bilateral talks The two states held bilateral talks in September 2007, which were resumed in June 2008.

Page Brown in 1892. A. Page Brown, born Arthur Page Brown (December 1859 - January 21, 1896), was an American architect known for buildings that incorporated classical styles in the Beaux-Arts manner. Having first worked in the office of McKim, Mead and White in New York City in 1879, he established his own firm in 1884 and hired a young Willis Polk as a draftsman. In 1889 Brown moved his office to San Francisco, California to take advantage of the city's growth. Brown is best known for designing the San Francisco Ferry Building, which opened in 1898, and at the time was the largest project ever undertaken in San Francisco. He is credited with introducing the Mission Revival style to Santa Barbara, with his designs for residences along Garden Street. The style was widely adopted in Santa Barbara and has shaped its visual identity. Early life and education Arthur Page Brown was born in Ellisburg, New York, in Jefferson County; he was descended from Yankees from New England. His formal education in architecture consisted of a year at the Cornell University School of Architecture, but he left in 1879 to join the newly established architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White. From 1883 to 1884 he traveled extensively through Europe, where he was influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture, based on Neoclassical and Renaissance styles. Marriage and family He married Lucy Pryor on February 25, 1886, at the Church of the Transfiguration in Manhattan, also known as \\"The Little Church Around the Corner.\\"; she was the daughter of Sara Agnes Rice and Roger Atkinson Pryor. Lucy and her six Pryor siblings were all born in Petersburg, Virginia; her father was a general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. Their family moved to New York City in the late 1860s to recover from postwar poverty. Roger A. Pryor became a successful attorney, active in Democratic Party politics, and later was appointed as justice to the New York State Supreme Court. Sara Agnes Rice Pryor founded several heritage organizations and was active in civic affairs. She also had several books, including novels, histories and memoirs, published by the Macmillan Company in the early 1900s. Her memoirs were the basis of joint biography of her and her husband by John C. Waugh, which was published in 2002. The Browns had three children together. Career One of Brown's earlier works, the William Berryman Scott House at 56 Bayard Lane, Princeton, New Jersey, in the Princeton Historic District (1888) In New York, Brown joined the office of McKim, Mead & White in 1879; he left for a brief period, returning in 1882. After an extensive tour of Europe (1883-1884), Brown rejoined the firm in 1884. At that point, he started doing some additional work for Nancy Fowler McCormick, a Chicago philanthropist. Under her patronage, he opened his own office in December 1884, under the name A. Page Brown, and hired the young Willis Polk as a draftsman. In 1889 Brown was commissioned by Mary Ann Deming Crocker to design a mausoleum for her late husband, the wealthy California industrialist, Charles Crocker. The massive granite structure is located on \\"Millionaire's Row\\" at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. Mrs. Crocker also commissioned him to design the Crocker Old People's Home in San Francisco. These opportunities allowed Brown to move his office to San Francisco where the city's rapid development would offer greater opportunities. He persuaded Willis Polk to go with him to San Francisco, California, and the two were among a number of talented architects who moved from the East Coast at the end of the 19th century and established firms in San Francisco. With his newly established office, his highly regarded upper-class social contacts, a developed East Coast portfolio, and a talented staff that included not only Willis Polk, but Bernard Maybeck and A. C. Schweinfurth, Brown was the favored architect of San Francisco society. His reputation for bringing the most contemporary design aesthetic from the East Coast created the perception that he led the \\"reorientation of San Francisco architecture from the Victorian to the academic sphere,\\" popularizing the Beaux-Arts style.Longstreth (1983/1998), On the Edge of the World, pp. 6-7 In 1892 Brown designed the San Francisco Ferry Building, a ferry terminal for both commuters and travelers who visited San Francisco. When completed in 1898, the Ferry Building was the largest single project undertaken in the city up to that time. Located on the Embarcadero at the foot of Market Street, it was a prominent structure intended to be a symbol of the city, and its 245-foot clock tower, which Brown designed after the 12th-century Giralda bell tower in Seville, Spain, could be seen across the city and the bay. Prior to the 1930s (when both the Golden Gate and Bay bridges were completed), the Ferry Building was the second busiest transportation terminal in the world, seeing an average of 50,000 commuters a day. In 1894, Brown introduced the Mission Revival style to Santa Barbara, where it became popular for a variety of building types, shaping the visual identity of the city to this day. Brown, Polk, Maybeck, and Schweinfurth were also associated with the First Bay Tradition, which they helped popularize along with other architects. In 1896 Arthur Page Brown died at his home in Burlingame, California of severe injuries suffered in a runaway horse and buggy accident. At the time of his death, the Ferry Building was still under construction; it was opened in 1898.

It grows in coastal strand, just above the high tide mark, and is widely cultivated as an ornamental throughout South America. Allagoptera arenaria is relatively short, reaching about tall. The plant is moneoecious, with male and female plants in distinct spirals in the same spike. The leaves emerge right out of the ground from a subterranean trunk that is rarely visible, and grow in a swirling pattern, spreading out on different and seemingly random planes. There are 6‚Äì15 bright green to silvery green pinnately compound (feather-like) leaves long, with each leaflet about long. Its fruits are yellowish green and shaped like small coconuts, about long and in diameter. Etymology The generic name of the seashore palm, Allogoptera, comes from the Ancient Greek words ('), meaning change, and ('), meaning wing, and refers to the swirled, changing pattern of the feathery leaves. The species name, arenaria comes from the Latin, for \\"sandy\\" or growing in sandy sites. Uses Allagoptera arenaria is cultivated extensively in South America for the edible fruits which are eaten fresh or made into a drink or jam. The leaves are used to make baskets and other woven objects. =Horticulture= Allagoptera arenaria is one of the best palms for beach and coastal situations in subtropical and tropical settings. It requires moderate to full sunlight and is used as a beach screen, being very tolerant of extreme coastal and beach exposure, as well as salt spray. In its native environment, the seashore palm is highly tolerant of poor soils that have good drainage, thriving in soils that are thoroughly moist. Considered a slow grower when it is young, the seashore palm propagates by seeds and responds well to fertilizer and water.

Part of the Silly Symphonies series, the film is an adaptation of The Ant and the Grasshopper, one of Aesop's Fables. It was directed by Wilfred Jackson and stars Pinto Colvig as the voice of the grasshopper \\"Hop.\\" The film introduced the song \\"The World Owes Me a Living\\" (later \\"I Owe the World a Living\\") by Leigh Harline and Larry Morey, which later became associated with the character Goofy who was also voiced by Colvig. According to Leonard Maltin on the Walt Disney Treasures: Silly Symphonies DVD, this was an early example of the idea of having a character turn blue with cold, when full-spectrum Technicolor was still new at the time. Plot Hop entertains the ant colony after they take him in during the winter The grasshopper is playing his fiddle, dancing and eating leaves. He notices some ants working hard collecting food. He laughs and calls an ant to him. He tells the ant that there is food on every tree and he sees no reason to work. He dances and sings that The world owes us a living. The ant begins to dance too. The queen ant arrives, carried in a sedan chair, and sees the ant playing instead of working. The ant notices the queen and immediately goes back to work. The angry queen warns the grasshopper that he will change his tune when winter comes. The grasshopper blithely dismisses the queen's warning, saying that winter is a long way off. Autumn passes and winter arrives. The grasshopper trudges through the snow, cold and hungry. He finds one withered leaf, but it blows away before he can eat it. Meanwhile, the ants are feasting on their stored food. The grasshopper knocks on their door and collapses. The ants carry him inside and warm and feed him. The queen ant approaches him. He begs to be allowed to stay. She tells him that only those who work may stay, and tells him to take his fiddle. Thinking that he is being dismissed, he starts to leave, but the queen tells him to play the fiddle. While the ants dance, he happily plays and sings I owe the world a living!

History SME was formed in 1946 under the title The Scale Model Equipment Company Limited to manufacture scale models and detail parts for the model engineering trade. During the 1950s the company moved away from model making to precision engineering, principally parts for aircraft instruments and business machines. In 1959 Alastair Robertson-Aikman, the Company's founder, required a pick-up arm for his own use and an experimental model was built. It received such an enthusiastic reception from friends in the sound industry that it was decided to produce it commercially and the first SME precision pick-up arm appeared in September 1959. Production was 25 units per week composed entirely of individually machined components. At this time a new factory situated in Mill Road, Steyning was opened and the Company's name was changed to SME Limited, a less committal title to suit its new activities.Company History In December 2016 the company was acquired by Ajay Shirke with a view to preserve the brands legacy and extend research and development activities, appointing a new CEO and a distributor for the UK market, Padood. In May 2018 the company acquired the rights to the Garrard Transcription Turntable brand as well as Loricraft Audio, the only officially authorised Garrard service agent. Intending to develop the Garrard audio brand in the near future. Products =Series II= The company is notable for its 3009 and 3012 (9\\" and 12\\" respectively) tone arms which were widely adopted for audiophile and broadcast use during the 1960s and 1970s, at the higher end of the market. These arms featured a polished, bright-anodised aluminium http://hometheaterreview.com/sme-series-i-ii-iii-tone-arms-reviewed/ main tube with a lightweight headshell, knife edge horizontal bearings, and an anti skating bias provided by a weight that hung by a nylon filament. Versions were produced with both fixed and interchangeable headshells; the SME headshell mount (based on an Ortofon design) became the de facto industry standard, and is still widely used today on consumer and especially DJ decks. Audiophile arms today tend to not use the SME mount, but this is not due to other standards replacing the SME but because audiophile arms now tend to not have interchangeable headshells at all in an effort to reduce mass and improve rigidity, though at slight expense of user flexibility. Some cartridges were produced that mounted directly into the SME headshell mount of the arm (rather than into a headshell), notably from Ortofon. =Series III= The Series III was introduced in the late 1970s incorporating changes from the Series II models (which continued in production) covering both styling and its exceptionally thin and lightweight main tube, the entire arm being interchangeable rather than just the headshell. The Series III had very low effective mass to fit high compliance cartridges such as the Shure V15 IV. Although technically advanced, the Series III never achieved the market dominance of the Series II. =Series V= The Series V arm was developed as a medium mass arm more suited to emerging moving-coil cartridges with lower compliance than previously available moving magnet cartridges. The removable headshell was eliminated, and the horizontal knife bearing was replaced with ball bearings, both in order to provide a more rigid structure for the cartridge. In recent decades, as with many of their competitors, the company's products have tended to move further and further upmarket. Recent products include the SME V tonearm, and extremely expensive (and consequently relatively rare) decks. The company bucked their upmarket move with the M2 tonearm which sits at the bottom of their current range .

He was hired in 1918 to design the Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House at Stanford University but was dismissed after prematurely publicizing the assignment without the Hoovers' consent. Mullgardt born in Franklin County, Missouri on January 18, 1866. His earlier years were spent in St. Louis, where he began the study of architecture. Subsequently, he continued his studies at Harvard University. Following this, he went to Chicago, where he began designing. In 1893, he entered private practice in St. Louis. In 1895, he made an extended trip to Europe for further study. He married Laura R. Steffens in Chicago on June 9, 1897, and they had two children. In 1902, he was commissioned to go to Manchester, England, and in 1903, to London and Scotland. He moved to San Francisco in 1905 and established a solo office. Mullgardt was active in several organizations of architects and artists. He served as president of the San Francisco Society of Architects, president of the California Society of Etchers, vice-president of the San Francisco Society of Artists, director of the San Francisco Art Association, and Secretary of the Group Jury for Etchings and Engravings of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. He died in San Francisco on January 12, 1942. Art historian Robert Judson Clark was the leading expert on Mullgardt until his death in 2011. He wrote the catalog essay on the architect for a 1966 exhibition at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.\\"Robert Judson Clark, father of Arts and Crafts revival, dies\\".

In 1906, he designed the Edwin H. Hewitt House in the Stevens Square neighborhood of Minneapolis, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. He was born in Red Wing, Minnesota. After a partial course at Hobart College he entered the University of Minnesota in the sophomore class in 1893, graduating with the degree of A.B. in 1896. He then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied during the winter of 1896-1897. The next three years were spent in the offices of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Wheelwright & Haven, and others. He was married in 1900 and went at once to Paris, where he entered the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in May, 1901 where he became a member of the Atelier Pascal. In October, 1904, he returned to the United States, but he had completed his work at the Ecole. Arriving in Minneapolis, he was almost immediately offered a commission and at once started in on private practice, not having an opportunity to return to Paris for over eight years. As time went on he realized the importance in architectural work of the allied science of engineering in all its branches, and in September, 1910, he formed a partnership with Edwin Brown under the name of Hewitt & Brown, architects and engineers. Hewitt was instrumental in the work which culminated in the completion of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. He was president of the Minnesota State Art Society. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1913, and was president of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The practice of Hewitt and Brown continued until Brown's death in 1930. Hewitt resumed private practice, but as business declined during the Great Depression, he closed his office and became the chief architectural supervisor for the Federal Housing Administration for the Minneapolis area.

According to interviews, he engaged in rampant violations of NCAA rules over eight years as a booster for University of Miami athletes. Shapiro allegedly provided football players cash, goods, prostitutes, assorted favors, and purchased a yacht on which sex parties with prostitutes were held. Early life Shapiro was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family and moved with his family to Miami Beach, Florida at an early age. He graduated in 1986 from Miami Beach Senior High School in the same class as film director Brett Ratner. Shapiro, who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall, was a member of the school's basketball and wrestling teams. A year after he graduated his mother married Richard Armand Adam, who operated RAA International, a real estate loan company. Adam moved the family to Lighthouse Point and bought two yachts. In 1997 Adam was charged in Canada with business fraud and was accused of stealing $6 million by collecting fees on loans that never materialized. Adam eventually served six years in Canadian prisons. Ponzi scheme Shapiro subsequently started Capitol Investments USA, which he claimed bought wholesale groceries and shipped them to more expensive markets (although he subsequently said that he never actually sold the groceries). Shapiro's Ponzi scheme was based on attracting investors to Capitol Investments. He promised investors they would make 10 to 26 percent commissions every month. In 2003, his business grew very quickly through connections with Sherwin Jarol in Chicago, Craig Currie in New Jersey, and Sydney \\"Jack\\" Williams who had real estate in Naples, Florida and Indianapolis. According to FBI Special Agent Gregory Yankow in a Federal Criminal Complaint dated April 20, 2010 (Case No. 10-8082), Shapiro \\"directed others to create and show to the investors documents fraudulently touting Capitol's profitability. Those documents included: financial statements; profit and loss figures fraudulently representing that Capitol's wholesale grocery business was generating tens of millions of dollars in annual sales; personal and business tax returns for Shapiro and Capitol also fraudulently reflecting those sales; and numerous invoices fraudulently reflecting transactions between Capitol and other companies in the wholesale grocery business.\\" According to the criminal complaint, Shapiro incurred \\"millions of dollars in debts resulting from illegal gambling on sporting events; more than $400,000 for floor seats to the Miami Heat professional basketball team; approximately $26,000 monthly for mortgage payments on his residence in Miami Beach which was recently appraised at approximately $5.3 million; approximately $7,250 monthly for payments on a $1.5 million Riviera yacht; approximately $4,700 monthly for the lease of a Mercedes-Benz automobile;\\" and an undisclosed amount \\"for a pair of diamond-studded handcuffs, which he gifted to a prominent professional athlete.\\" The FBI reported that he had diverted $35 million for his personal use from 2005 to 2009. Shapiro allegedly rented his yacht to NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade, and Kevin Garnett and pledged $150,000 to the University of Miami to have his name placed on the student lounge. The scheme fell apart in November 2009 during the late-2000s recession when Chicago real estate investor Sherwin Jarol sued to force him into involuntary bankruptcy after Shapiro had stopped making payments to his investors. More than 60 investors (largely from Naples, Indianapolis, and Chicago), including Barry Alvarez, filed claims (Alvarez had $600,000 in the scheme). On April 21, 2010 he was charged in New Jersey with securities fraud and money laundering. On September 15, 2010, he pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton in Newark, New Jersey in U.S. v. Shapiro, 10-cr-00471 to one count of securities fraud and one count of money laundering. On June 7, 2011, he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison and ordered to make $82,657,362.29 in restitution. He currently is serving time at FCI Jesup (inmate #61311-050), and is scheduled for release in November 9, 2027 (as of September 2019). The civil case in Miami is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Shapiro, 10-cv-21281. University of Miami scandal In August 2010, Shapiro told the Miami Herald that he was writing a book The Real U: 2001 to 2010. Inside the Eye of the Hurricane in which he promised to tell how Miami had violated NCAA rules affecting more than 100 players. \\"Once the players turned pro, they turned their back on me. It made me feel like a used friend,\\" he said. Shapiro was reported to have spent $2 million from 2002 to 2010 boosting Miami sports‚Äîprimarily football‚Äîbut also included contact with the basketball team under Frank Haith. In 2002 he paid $1.5 million for 30% in a sports management company called Axcess Sports, started by Michael Huyghue. The agency signed several Hurricanes, including Vince Wilfork. On August 16, 2011 in a jailhouse interview with Yahoo! Sports writer Charles Robinson (conducted over 100 hours), Shapiro made good on the promise for the revelations exposing a lack of NCAA-mandated institutional oversight at the university that apparently allowed his illegal and unethical behavior to continue unimpeded for years. Thus far, 72 athletes are alleged by Shapiro to have received \\"impermissible\\" benefits from him between 2002 and 2010. The players include Vince Wilfork, Jon Beason, Antrel Rolle, Devin Hester, Willis McGahee and the late Sean Taylor. The school imposed significant penalties on itself, including the suspension of eight football players, and removed itself from post-season bowl contention for one year. On October 22, 2013, after two-and-a-half years of investigation, the NCAA announced that the University of Miami football team would be docked three scholarships in each of the next three seasons, a three-year probation, recruiting restrictions, a five-game suspension for the men's basketball coach, and a two-year show-cause order on a total of three former assistant football and basketball coaches. Considering such a long investigation yielded very little incriminating evidence, it was widely viewed that the NCAA investigation and the media attention to the case did not match the relatively minor infractions that were proven to be committed. Before the NCAA penalties were announced, it had been revealed that enforcement staff for the NCAA had paid Shapiro's lawyer $25,000 to call in University of Miami personnel, during an unassociated legal deposition for Shapiro's bankruptcy, and ask a specific list of questions related to the University's scandal. Shapiro's attorney used her subpoena power in the bankruptcy case to question two witnesses who were crucial to the NCAA's case. The NCAA had no subpoena power, and neither witness had any obligation to talk to the association. The backlash from the revelations about the NCAA's activities, coupled with the university's unprecedented self-imposed sanctions, helped the Miami Hurricanes escape additional harsh penalties from the NCAA.Andrea Adelson, ESPN.com October 22, 2013 Photos in the Yahoo article showed him with Kellen Winslow Jr. and Joe Kolchinsky in the VIP section of the Opium Garden Nightclub in 2005; Shapiro with Haith, Joe Kolchinsky and University of Miami President Donna Shalala in 2008 as he donated $50,000 to the basketball program as well as $3 million in other donations to undisclosed recipients and with Vince Wilfork in 2002.

It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok, as well as other sources. The allegory can be summarized as follows: :In each location, the inhabitants are given access to food, but the utensils are too unwieldy to serve oneself with. In hell, the people cannot cooperate, and consequently starve. In heaven, the diners feed one another across the table and are sated. The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are various interpretations of the fable including its use in sermons and in advice to lonely people.  Interpretation  The story suggests that people have the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people treat each other. Given the same level playing field one group of people who treat each other well will create a pleasant environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer Dawn Eden suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.  Variations  The long spoons allegory has become part of the folklore of several cultures, for example: Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, \\"Oriental\\" (Middle-Eastern) and Christian. In medieval Europe, the food in the story is a bowl of stew; in China, it is a bowl of rice being eaten with long chopsticks. In some versions of the story the diners are using regular cutlery but are unable to bend their arms, with a story attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok describing how \\"both arms were splinted with wooden slats so he could not bend either elbow to bring the food to his mouth\\". Art and popular culture While the parable itself is seldom depicted in art, it is well known and used in sermons when referring to hell, where the fashion for depicting hell in terrible, painful, gruesome terms is fading in recent times. The parable is told by Norman McCay in the novelization of Kingdom Come. In the 2011 Boardwalk Empire episode \\"Under God's Power She Flourishes\\", Father Brennan tells Margaret the allegory of the long spoons while Emily is fitted for leg braces. A scene in the 2013 thriller The East draws strong comparisons to the allegory when protagonist Sarah is depicted as selfish for neglecting to feed her adjacent diner while in a straitjacket.

He portrays a unique character, wearing a kariyushi shirt to the ring, wearing a mask that has a cartoonish bowl of Ramen noodles on top of it, and drinking a brand of beer (Orion) which is brewed in Okinawa. Oyaji's character has been described as comedic as well as \\"mellow\\" and \\"drunk,\\" in some cases forgetting to put down his can of beer before wrestling a match. Essentially, Oyaji's character is a compilation of several stereotypes of Okinawan people held by those from elsewhere in Japan. In addition to wrestling on Okinawa Pro Wrestling cards, Oyaji will occasionally sing for audiences who have gathered to watch the company's wrestling shows. Oyaji has received multiple title shots thus far in his wrestling career.

It is best known as the theatre where Alfred Jarry‚Äôs nihilistic farce Ubu Roi premiered in 1896. Founded in Paris in 1893, the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre was among the first theatrical venues in France to provide a home for the artists of the Symbolist Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. Modeled on the experimental structure of the Th√©√¢tre Libre, the venue was directed by Lugn√©-Poe, a prominent Parisian actor and stage manager from its opening through 1929. History Lugn√©-Poe had embraced symbolism's \\"subjectivity, spirituality, and mysterious internal and external forces\\" as a source of profound truth after working as an actor at the Th√©√¢tre d'Art. The first of the independent Symbolist theatre, the poet Paul Fort, then just seventeen years old, formed the company to explore the performance potential of found texts such as The Iliad, The Bible, and his own lyric verse. When Fort left the group in 1892, his work was carried on by what would become the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre with Lugn√©-Poe at the helm. Unlike Fort's project which catered to the intellectual elite, Lugn√©-Poe sought to create a \\"theatre for the people,\\" and customarily offered free tickets to most of the public, reserving only 100 seats for his subscription holders. Under his direction, the company first performed Maurice Maeterlinck's Pell√©as et M√©lisande on May 17, 1892. According to theatre historian Oscar Brockett: With the help of poet and critic Camille Mauclair and the painter √âdouard Vuillard (with whom Lugn√©-Poe was sharing an apartment), the director dedicated the theatre to presenting the work of the young French Symbolist playwrights in addition to introducing new foreign dramas. The group established themselves that same year, renting a small room atop the cit√© Monthiers called the salle Berlioz and calling themselves Maison de l'≈íuvre, or literally, the \\"House of Works.\\" La salle Berlioz in 1907 In addition to those of Maeterlinck, the theatre also produced Sanskrit dramas in addition to works by foreign authors such as Oscar Wilde, Gerhart Hauptmann, August Strindberg, and Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio, alongside works by young French dramatists like Henry Bataille, Henri de R√©gnier et Alfred Jarry. Lugn√©-Poe was also instrumental in introducing Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs plays to French audiences. Just as in the description of the theatre's initial performance, the majority Lugn√©-Poe's stage settings were simple, non-realistic representations of line and color on canvas backdrops. He sought to create a theatre of poetry and dreams while staying true to his motto, \\"The word creates the decor.\\" The staging was atmospheric and the acting stylized; costumes were usually simple and ‚Äútimeless.‚Äù Some designers included Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Maurice Denis, Odilon Redon, Pierre Bonnard, and Vuillard himself. On December 10, 1896, Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre presented Alfred Jarry's legendary Ubu Roi, with actor Firmin G√©mier in the title role. Jarry had finished this epochal play about human greed, cowardice, and stupidity just six months before it would shock the audiences with its unapologetic opening line, \\"Merdre.\\" Though Jarry affected an attitude of political indifference, his revolutionary ideas challenged assumptions about society, propriety, and existence. Brockett notes that \\"Ubu Roi shows in all its grotesqueness a world without human decency.\\" In this lithograph announcement by Jarry for the performance of Ubu Roi, King Ubu appears as a shadow puppet with a segmented arm. He brandishes a scimitar in one hand and clutches a sack of gold in the other. Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi. =Temporary Closures= By 1899 the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôOeuvre had presented 51 programs and toured England, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. In spite of this success, Lugn√©-Poe had come to feel that the work of the Symbolists was juvenile and limiting to his artistic development. He closed the theatre in 1899, marking an end to the first major phase of the anti- realism movement in the theatre. Lugn√©-Poe revived the theatre December 22, 1912 with a production of Paul Claudel's L'Annonce faite √† Marie. Following that were several works by the Dadaist and Surrealist writers of the era. The group was off to a running start, but activity was interrupted again with the beginning of World War I in 1914. They reopened again in 1919 with the help of financing from the actor Marcelle Frappa and ran the theatre continuously until his final retirement in 1929. Through their productions, tours, and critical reviews the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôOeuvre, under the direction of Lugn√©-Poe, had managed to influence \\"almost every departure from realism between 1893 and 1915.\\" Lucien Beer and Paulette Pax succeeded Lugn√©-Poe in 1929 and served as the theatre's directors until the beginning of World War II. Shortly after the conflict began, Hitler conquered France and the Vichy Regime under Jacques H√©bertot made most theatres illegal in the occupied zone. After the Liberation of Paris in 1944, Raymond Rouleau rejoined Lucien Beer, and together they ran the theatre until 1951, when they were both replaced by Robert de Ribon. In 1960 Pierre Franck and Georges Herbert took over direction. They ran the theatre until 1978, when they were replaced by Georges Wilson as Artistic Director and principal scenic designer. He remained until 1995 when G√©rard Maro, who had been Artistic Director of the Com√©die de Paris since 1981 took over as chef of the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre. He is still in charge today.

Ettinger.Ettinger Bracha L. (1995). The Matrixial Gaze. Feminist Arts & Histories Network, It is a work of feminist film theory that examines the gaze as described by Jacques Lacan. Beginning in 1985, Ettinger's artistic practice and her articulation of her ideas culminated in what she called the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity, a concept that has influenced debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women's studies and cultural studies. Publication and response Ettinger's work follows the Freudian and Lacanian traditions of psychoanalysis and challenges their phallocentric conceptualizations. Her book also examines Emmanuel Levinas, \\"Object- relations\\" theory and Gilles Deleuze/F√©lix Guattari and also critiques them, reformulating subject and feminine difference. Ettinger's book is considered the initiator of the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply \\"The Matrixial\\". The book influenced discussions of subjectivity as encounter, the matrixial gaze, matrixial time, matrixial space, co-poiesis, borderlinking, borderspacing, co-emergence in differentiating and differentiating, transconnectivity, matrixial com-passion, primary compassion, compassionate hospitality, wit(h)nessing, co-fading, severality, matrixial transformational potentiality, archaic m/Other, fascinance, encounter-event, besideness, primal Mother-phantasies of Not-enoughness, devouring and abandonment, empathy within compassion, empathy without compassion, seduction into life, and metramorphosis. Scholar Griselda Pollock writes, \\"The matrixial gaze emerges by a simultaneous reversal of with-in and with-out (and does not represent the eternal inside), by a transgression of borderlinks manifested in the contact with-in/-out and art work by a transcendence of the subject‚Äìobject interval which is not a fusion, since it is based on a-priori shareability in difference.\\"Pollock, Griselda (1996).

The Matrixial Borderspace. University of Minnesota Press, The matrix and the phallus The matrixial gaze uses the matrix to counter Lacan's phallic gaze. Similar to Lacan's formulation, which is a metaphorical reference to anatomy to discuss symbolic masculine power, the matrix is a metaphorical reference to the uterus in order to discuss relationality. This shift was \\"not just to exchange an organ (penis) and its image for another (womb), but to conceive of an alternative to the phallus in terms of structure, mechanism, functions, logic\\". According to Pollock, the matrix allows us to escape the \\"notion of the discrete and singular subject formed by the establishment of the boundaries that distinguish it from an oceanic or undifferentiated otherness of the world or the maternal body\\". Pollock notes that thinking in terms of the phallus and castration anxiety casts subjects in terms of \\"separations, splits, cuts, and cleavages\\". Venn adds that the matrix allows the concept of the gaze to extend beyond the visual realm to touch, sound, and movement.

The Jicarilla War began in 1849 and was fought between the Jicarilla Apaches and the United States Army in the New Mexico Territory. Ute warriors also played a significant role in the conflict as they were allied with the Jicarillas. The war started when the Apaches and Utes began raiding against settlers on the Santa Fe Trail. Eventually, in 1853, the American army retaliated which resulted in a series of battles and campaigns that ended in 1854 when a large military expedition managed to quell most of the violence. However, some minor skirmishing continued into 1855.Tiller, \\"The Jicarilla Apache Tribe: a history, 1846-1970\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/oldguardmuseum/3694655329/ War Dolores Gunnerson argues that \\"the Jicarillas would have transferred their allegiance to the Americans and served them as faithfully as they had served the Spaniards if the Anglos had been willing to accept them as \\"friends\\" and allies.\\" She further states that \\"the Jicarilla were at war with the United States for only a year and a half and spent nearly all that period eluding the troops rather than fighting.\\" Gunnerson, Dolores A., The Jicarilla Apaches: a study in survival, Northern Illinois University Press, DeKalb, Illinois, 1974, p.295 The war began in 1849 when a wagon of settlers was killed by a band of Jicarillas and Utes. The event, sometimes referred to as the White Massacre received considerable publicity at the time and did much to prejudice the Anglo population against the tribe. A year later a group of mail carriers were killed in what is called the Wagon Mound Massacre. Various incidents in the next half decade would raise the tensions between the Americans and the Jicarillas, leading both sides to increasingly mistrust the other until the winter of 1853 to 1854 when the army began operations. In February 1854 a government beef contractor employed by the government, New Mexico reported to the army that several of his cattle had been stolen by the Jicarillas so in response, a troop of dragoons from the 2nd Dragoons were sent to retrieve the stolen property. On March 5, Lieutenant Bell encountered a group of warriors under Chief Lobo Blanco, out on the Canadian River. It was uncertain whether Lobo Blanco and his followers were responsible for the stolen property but the army had long suspected Lobo Blanco's band of killing white and Hispanic settlers. A battle then ensued which left the chief and four of his warriors dead while the Americans lost two men. On the next day, the conflict escalated when a band of Jicarillas and Utes raided a herd of cattle near Fort Union, killing two herdsmen in the process. After that the United States Army 1st Dragoons launched an expedition into Apacheria. The first engagement was fought on March 30 when First Lieutenant John Davidson's launched an unauthorized attack on a Jicarilla village near the present day Pilar, New Mexico. In the subsequent Battle of Cieneguilla, sixty American cavalrymen fought an estimated 250 Apaches and Ute warriors under the war chief Flechas Rayada. Fighting began at around 8:00 am and lasted for over three hours, by the end of which, twenty-two soldiers were killed and another thirty-six were wounded. Davidson's command was forced to retreat having inflicted about twenty deaths on the native force. A week later, on April 8, a large force of about 200 American cavalrymen, 100 men of the 3rd Infantry, and thirty-two scouts, found the Jicarillas of Chief Chacon in Ojo Caliente Canyon. During the battle that followed, commander Philip St. George Cooke defeated about 150 warriors, killing five of them and wounding six others without sustaining any casualties to his own command. The Jicarillas where dispersed at that point and without a camp many of them died in the extreme cold weather. The battle was also notable for having involved Kit Carson, who guided the American army during the expedition, and First Lieutenant George Sykes, who later commanded the V Corps, Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War. After the Ojo Caliente battle the war was mostly over with the exception of a few smaller raids and skirmishes over the next several months.Utley, pg. 144Carter, pg.134-139 References Bibliography  Jicarilla Jicarilla Jicarilla Jicarilla Jicarilla 1849 in New Mexico Territory 1850 in New Mexico Territory 1853 in New Mexico Territory 1854 in New Mexico Territory 1855 in New Mexico Territory Jicarilla Conflicts in 1849 Conflicts in 1850 Conflicts in 1853 Jicarilla Jicarilla ","title":"Jicarilla War"},{"id":"32773673","text":"Sheeel.com is a Kuwaiti deal-of-the-day website generally offering one discounted product a day, covering several categories such as, Electronics, Household Goods, and Toys.

Jawahar Singh Kirpal Singh and Company, Amritsar Early life As a youth, Natthu Ram was apprenticed to a Muslim teacher, Hayat Shah, son of Punjabi poet Hashim, to teach him the Persian language. Whilst at junior school, he saw Sikh soldiers and was so impressed with them that he decided to keep unshorn hair. In 1906, when he was in the ninth grade he became Amritdhari and gave himself the name of \\"Sahib Singh\\". At that time he stopped learning Persian and started learning Sanskrit, which later on helped him in understanding Guru Granth Sahib. Later life After passing the tenth grade, Sahib Singh joined a local school. Later he applied for a job with the postal department, and got the job, borrowing 20 Rs from his house maid as traveling expenses. Later he left home to pursue higher education. He had nowhere to go, having very little money. He later met Pundit Vesta Parsad, a scholarly teacher for help. Sahib Singh passed his FA and BA and started work at Frakka college and later joined Gujranwala Khalsa college. It was at this college that he met Bava Harkrishan Singh and Bhai Jodh Singh. Sahib Singh's financial situation had improved by this time so that he was able to pay back his debts. Employment The death of his father made the situation hard for him. He entered Dyal Singh College, Lahore, and then the Government College, LahoreGurabni Vyakaran by Sahib Singh, where he obtained his bachelor's degree.

At this time he moved to Amritsar and joined the Khalsa college as a lecturer in Punjabi. At the college he met fellow Sikh scholars like Teja Singh, Ganda Singh, Veeram Singh and Mohan Singh. In 1952 he retired from this college to take up a post as Principal at Shaheed Missionary college, Amritsar. In 1962 he left to join his son at Sidhwan Bet near Jagroan. When his son moved to Patiala, he took classes at Gurmat college in Patiala. He was awarded a Doctorate of Letters by Punjabi University, Patiala in 1971.Bhagat Bani Steek by Professor Sahib Singh, Health and illness Sahib Singh was often afflicted with illnesses.

These very large butterflies have long and rounded wings of brown and orange color, with very variable markings due to its capacity of mimicry with several species. The caterpillar is white with black spots and black thorns. Biology H. numata is known for its mimicry of Melinaea butterflies. Both H. numata and the species of Melinaea it resembles are unpalatable to predators, making this a case of M√ºllerian mimicry, a mutualistic reinforcement of the same negative signal. Both males and females are attracted to red or orange flowers, or indeed to pieces of cloth colored red or orange. Eggs typically are found on low-growing vines of Passiflora. Caterpillars mainly feed on plants from the subgenera Granadilla, Astrophea and Distephana (Passifloraceae) and from the genera Tetrastyli and Dilkea.

Way (of) the Fathers), is an ancient north south route traversing the land of Israel. The name is used by biblical scholars because of mentions in biblical narratives that it was frequently travelled by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is also called the Hill Road or the Ridge Route because it follows the watershed ridge line of the Samarian and Judaean Mountains. It runs from Megiddo and Hazor south to Beersheba by way of Shechem, Bethel, Jerusalem, Ephrath and Hebron. Unlike the Via Maris and the King's Highway which were international roads crossing the territories of many peoples, the Ridge Route was wholly within the territory of ancient Israel. We already find Abraham using this route. After entering the land he goes to Shechem, and then via Beth El to Hebron and finally to Beer-Sheva. Modern equivalent The modern Highway 60 follows roughly the route of the Way of the Patriarchs (without the more recent bypasses), passing through Afula, Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Halhul, Hebron and Dhahiriya. Archaeological findings =Ritual baths= Roman milestone adjacent to mikve near Alon Shvut Way stations were discovered along the route between Beersheba and Jerusalem from the time of the ancient Temple and later during the Hellenistic and Roman eras. Ritual baths (mikvaot, Hebrew: ◊û◊ß◊ï◊ï◊ê◊ï◊™) served pilgrims during their journey. =Milestones= Milestones have been discovered along the route signalling that, even in Roman times, the route was used as a major road. The stones represent the distance to Jerusalem. Biblical events =The Maccabees' Battle of Beth Zechariah= The Way of the Patriarchs passes by Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah, a small Palestinian village near the Israeli settlement of Alon Shevut, possibly the site of the Battle of Beth Zechariah between Judas Maccabeus and the Seleucid Greeks. It was there that Judah's brother, Eleazar Avaran, was killed after stabbing and killing one of the Greek elephants. This incident is commemorated by the name of the adjacent community, Elazar. =Battle of Gibeah= The biblical story of the Concubine of the Hill from the Book of Judges, leading up to the battle of Gibeah (), tells of a small family caravan journeying on the ridge route from Bethlehem towards Jerusalem. Gibeah is generally identified with Tell el-F≈´l. Route near ancient Jerusalem Ancient Jerusalem (today's Old City) was not situated on the mountain watershed. Indeed, the Ridge Route did not pass directly through the ancient city but was situated just to the west, about a 20-minute walk from the city walls. The route from Bethel southwards would have passed through today's neighborhoods of Beit Hanina, Shuafat, French Hill, Givat HaMivtar and Kerem Avraham, crossing Jaffa Road at the center of modern down-town Jerusalem behind the HaMashbir Department Store building, and continuing along Shmuel HaNagid St. (peak height: Ratisbonne Monastery), King George St., Keren HaYesod St., and finally the Hebron Road to Bethlehem.

Today's eastern leg of Route 57 roughly follows the ancient track. The \\"Red Ascent\\" ( Ma'ale Adumim) ( and ) formed a boundary of the tribe of Judah ascending from the Valley of Achor to Debir and turning north to Gilgal. It takes its name from the red rock lining the ascent. Highway 1 between Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley follows the ancient route. To the west of Shechem, the ancient \\"Aphek Ascent\\" from the Via Maris and the coastal plain passed through Aphek, Soco and today's Kfar Saba and Qalqilyah. Highway 55 duplicates the eastern part of this route. \\"The Bethoron Ascent\\" ( Ma'ale Beit Horon) () from the coastal plain passes today's Ben Gurion Airport, then rose along an offshoot of the watershed ridge leading to today's Beit Hanina as it approached Jerusalem. Today's Route 443 follows the ancient road with minor deviations. The ascent from Jaffa to Jerusalem through the Plain of Ayalon is now duplicated by Route 412, Highway 44 and Route 1.

It is his ninth solo record and his third major label national release with Centricity Music. It was produced by Jason Ingram and Rusty Varencamp, the same production team from his previous release, Everything Sad Is Coming Untrue. The lead single released to radio was the album opener, \\"Remind Me Who I Am\\". An accompanying music video directed by Jason's frequent collaborator Doug McKelvey and Daren Thomas was released in July 0f 2011. The video features various people holding cardboard signs that signify their understanding of themselves and explores the idea of identity and where it is found. The video is viewable here. Other songs on the album cover themes ranging from fear, shame, hope, and God's love as the basis for our identity. A series of song diary videos was also produced to promote the project on YouTube and other video outlets featuring \\"Good To Be Alive\\" and \\"Remind Me Who I Am\\". Jason was also featured in a series of webisodes produced by Centricity Music that cast their artists in humorous situations with the label's head of A&R; John Mays in a fictional school called Centricity U. The webisodes were part of a promotional campaign for the artist's and projects of Centricity Music and were written and directed by Doug McKelvey. The episode featuring Jason and the lead single from A Way To See in the Dark can be seen here. A limited, special edition of the album was also released in a commemorative hard cover-style book that includes eight additional tracks of demos, alternate versions, and new songs as well as a 32-page booklet with Jason's reflections about the meaning behind each of the songs. The supplemental tracks were produced by Matt Patrick in Minneapolis, MN.

Don't be deterred by catchy melodies; this is music too deep to be merely consumed or played in the background. It's a collection of songs to be experienced, contemplated, and shared. A hooky melody can beg to sing along, then a lyrical twist can move to tears.\\" Hurst of Christianity Today noted A Way to See in the Dark \\"has a title that could almost double as the name of a self-help or spiritual how-to book. The music has all the solemnity and seriousness that might entail; Gray writes catchy pop songs, but they aren't breezy, summery jams so much as the soundtrack for introspection. These songs are encouraging reflections for dark times, but they come up just short of being straight worship music\\". Lennie of Cross Rhythms wrote that the \\"main strengths of the album are the radio-friendly production, Jason's fine vocals and, most notable of all, the original, thoughtful lyrics that attend every one of these dozen tracks.\\" However, Lennie also said it was unoriginal and like Steven Curtis Chapman's works, but did go onto say \\"this is still a fine album.\\" Caldwell of Jesus Freak Hideout says A Way to See in the Dark that it \\"delivers on all those levels, and then some,\\" and notes the similarities to Chapman. Davies of Louder Than the Music gave his journey with respect to A Way to See in the Dark that \\"It took a while for this album to grow on me, not because they are bad songs or 'growers', but it took me a good few listens to get what the message and themes of the album were trying to convey. Once I got that, and sat back and took in the songs as they were, I understood what Jason is trying to do with this album. Even when we are in hard times and dark places, God is still there\\". Davis of New Release Tuesday plainly said about A Way To See in the Dark that \\"I've been very blessed to enjoy Jason's songs and get to know his heart for God. I get welled up praying along with several of the songs. I love albums that have a consistent message and theme and that move me emotionally, such as Ocean by Bebo Norman, See You by Josh Wilson and Leaving Eden by Brandon Heath. In fact, if you like those albums, then you must get A Way To See in the Dark by Jason Gray.\\"  References  2011 albums Centricity Music albums Jason Gray (musician) albums ","title":"A Way to See in the Dark"},{"id":"32774326","text":"Kumbalam may refer to places in India: * Kumbalam, Ernakulam, Kerala * Kumbalam, Kollam, Kerala * Kumbalam, Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu ","title":"Kumbalam"},{"id":"32774336","text":"Lalganj may refer to: * Lalganj, Bihar, a town in the Indian state of Bihar * Lalganj Raebareli , Uttar Pradesh, a town in the Raebareli district of Indian state of Uttar Pradesh * Lalganj (Lok Sabha constituency), Uttar Pradesh *Lalganj (Assembly constituency), Uttar Pradesh * Lalganj, Bihar (Vidhan Sabha constituency), Bihar * Katghar Lalganj, a town in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, India ","title":"Lalganj"},{"id":"32774338","text":"Cantarell is the default typeface supplied with the user interface of GNOME since version 3.0, replacing Bitstream Vera and DejaVu. The font was originated by Dave Crossland in 2009. History In 2009 the Cantarell fonts were initially designed by Dave Crossland during his studies of typeface design at the University of Reading. In 2010, the fonts were chosen by GNOME for use in its 3.0 release, and the font sources were moved to GNOME's Git repository. The fonts are maintained there, allowing contributions from a variety of designers including Jakub Steiner and Pooja Saxena. In 2013 Pooja Saxena joined the GNOME foundation's \\"Outreach Programme for Women\\" internship, and was tasked with improving the design and language support. In 2014 Pooja was given financial support by Google Fonts to extend the design to Devanagari, but due to unavoidable vertical metrics adjustments the family was published with a new name, Cambay. In GNOME 3.28 the font had been re-designed with two additional weights, light and extra bold. Distribution Operating Systems that ship GNOME 3 include this typeface family by default, like Fedora. Google includes the font family in its Google Fonts directory, making the typeface available for use in Web sites. Criticism Cantarell initially received both criticism and support from the free software community. It was argued that GNOME's use of Cantarell reduced legibility in desktop applications, it was not kerned and has deformed glyphs. Other users enjoyed the design, calling it \\"stylish and beautiful, but most importantly, crisp and easy to read.\\" The initial release notes stated that it was designed for legibility on screens. GNOME's choice was also criticized since Cantarell only supports some Latin languages, far fewer than the previously used DejaVu fonts. When the fonts were first published, Crossland invited others to extend the language support and this finally began in 2013 when Saxena began applying the design to the Cyrillic script.

He served as 48th Druk Desi (Deb Raja, the secular executive) of Bhutan (1870‚Äì1873), and held the hereditary post of 10th Penlop of Trongsa. He was called the Black Ruler.Bhutan  Marriage  Son of Dasho Pila Gonpo Wangyal and his second wife, Ashi Sonam Pedzom, Desi Jigme Namgyal was born in 1825 at Lhuntse Dzong and died in 1881 at Semtokha Dzong. He was an outstanding military commander. The qualities of loyalty, bravery, integrity and risk-taking were crucial factors in the rise of Jigme Namgyal. Desi Jigme Namgyal was from Kurtoe Dungkar, from where the ancestry of Wangchuck dynasty originates. He was a descendant of Khedrup Kuenga Wangpo (b. 1505), the son of Tert√∂n Pema Lingpa (1450-1521) and his second wife, Yum Bumdren,Bhutan studiesArchive and Khedrup‚Äôs consort, Wangmo, from Khadro Chodung clan,Carchu who was a descendant of Tert√∂n Guru Choewang (1212-1270). Around 1846, he joined the Trongsa administration that governed eastern Bhutan, which consisted then of the Assam Duars. He rose rapidly through the ranks to become the Trongsa Penlop in 1853. While he was a high official of Trongsa, Jigme Namgyal married Ashi Pema Choki, the daughter of the 8th Trongsa Penlop (Tamzhing Choji family), Dasho Ugyen Phuntsho, by his wife, Aum Rinchen Pelmo (a daughter of Sonam Drugyel, 31st Druk Desi). His marriage to Pema Choki further enhanced Jigme Namgyal‚Äôs noble lineage. The ancestry of Jigme Namgyal‚Äôs wife also went back to Pema Lingpa as she was the daughter of Tamzhing Choji. Jigme Namgyal and Pema Choki had three children: * Dasho Thinley Tobgay (b. 1857), 22nd Penlop of Paro. * Dasho Ugyen Wangchuck, King of Bhutan. Ancestor of King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. * Ashi Yeshay Choden, wife of Dasho Chimi Dorji, Dzongpon of Thimphu. Ancestor of the following Queens consorts of Bhutan:  Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck.  Pema Dechen Wangchuck (Phuntsho Choden's younger sister).  Jetsun Pema Wangchuck.Royal Family Tree  The Raven Crown  While Jigme Namgyal was the Zimpon (Chamberlain) of Trongsa, he met his root Lama, Jangchub Tsundru (1817-1856). Lama Jangchub Tsundru had a significant influence on him as a spiritual companion. The Lama designed the sacred Raven Crown for Jigme Namgyal. The Raven Crown has symbolized the Kings of Bhutan since then.  The Duar Wars 1864-65  As the Trongsa Penlop, from 1853 to 1870, Jigme Namgyal was concerned about the festering tension between British India and Bhutan over the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, which were the most fertile part of Bhutan in those days. For economic reason, and to secure the borders of their empire, the British attempted to extend their boundaries up to the foothills of Bhutan. The Assam Duars were annexed in 1841 although a formal treaty ceding it did not take place until 1865. In 1864, the British unilaterally declared that, in addition to the Assam Duars that were already annexed, the Bengal Duars would be annexed permanently. Following this, the British sent forces to occupy vital passes into Bhutan such as Deothang, Sidli and Buxa. Jigme Namgyal launched a counter offensive with about 5000 men and succeeded in dislodging the British Imperial Force at Deothang. He was successful in the January and February 1865 attacks on the British outpost in Deothang. However, later that year Bhutan was forced to sign the Treaty of Sinchula, 1865. The treaty brought stability to the relationship between the two countries. The Duars were incorporated permanently into the British Empire and an annual subsidy of Rs 50,000 to Bhutan was instituted from that year.  Three Legacies of Desi Jigme Namgyal  The most important contribution of Desi Jigme Namgyal made was the ushering of peace, through a reduction of local feuds among the top leadership by gradually unifying the state over three decades, from 1850s to 1870s. The reduction of internal conflicts, especially after 1878, allowed for laying the foundation of the monarchy that in turn brought a peaceful era in Bhutan. In terms of external relationship, especially with British India, Desi Jigme Namgyal left an identifiable centre of power that made it possible for treaties to be revised constructively and foreign relationships to be improved over the course of time. His son, the first King of Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck amply fulfilled that role later on. After Jigme Namgyal‚Äôs reign, foreign relations could be conducted in a systematic and co-ordinated way, because the fragmentation of power among the top leadership could be avoided. The Treaty of Sinchula, 1865, which went back to Jigme Namgyal‚Äôs time, became the crucial, guiding bilateral legal instrument between Bhutan and British India and later, Independent India. It was updated and revised in 1910, 1949, and 2007.1907 to 2007 ‚Äì Bhutan Through 100 Years Jigme Namgyel made not only political but architectural impacts. He restored the Tongsa Dzong, and built Sangwa Duepa temple in it. He founded the Wangducholing Palace in Choekhor valley in 1856. Wangducholing Palace was the main residence of the Royal Family from Desi Jigme Namgyal‚Äôs time to that of the Crown Prince Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1929-1972). It was the political epicentre of the country for over a century, from the late 1850s to the early 1950s. Death In 1881, Desi Jigme Namgyal died, aged 55‚Äì56, at Semtokha Dzong in the Thimphu valley (first built in 1629) from a fall from a yak. His 21-year-old son, then the Paro Penlop, Ugyen Wangchuck (1862-1926), conducted the grandest funeral Bhutan had ever seen for his father. Notable descendants Jigme Namgyal is the father of the first Druk Gyalpo King Ugyen Wangchuck, who founded the Bhutanese monarchy in 1907 after besting his rivals, the Penlop of Paro and allies, ending protracted civil war. Jigme Namgyal is thus the forefather of all subsequent Kings of Bhutan: Jigme Wangchuck, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Several monarchs of the House of Wangchuck have borne Jigme Namgyal's names. Crown Princes of Bhutan traditionally take the title Penlop of Trongsa (also called \\"Chhoetse\\" Penlop), reflecting the hereditary position and historical significance of the office of Jigme Namgyal. Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck, the current Crown Prince of Bhutan, is named after him.

He was one of the charter members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (\\"BBWAA\\") upon its founding in October 1908 and held membership card No. 1 in that organization for many years. Early years Batchelor was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in September 1883. His father, Joseph Branch Batchelor Jr, was an officer in the United States Army. His mother was Mary (Gouge) Batchelor (born October 1858 in Massachusetts); he had and two younger sisters, Winifred (born December 1885 in North Carolina) and Dorothy (born September 1893 in Arizona). As a result of his father's service, Batchelor lived in nine states in the first ten years of his life. He recalled that he lived for a time in Arizona while his father's regiment was assigned \\"to subdue an unruly group of Apaches. In the late 1890s, his father was stationed at Fort Slocum on Long Island. In April 1898, following the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Batchelor's father was promoted to the rank of captain. His father was assigned to the Philippine Islands where he led three companies of the African-American 24th Infantry during 1899 and 1900 in combat operations against Filipino insurgents in the Pangasinan and Nueva Vizcaya provinces on Luzon. For his service and for gallantry in action, Captain Batchelor (Brevet Major) was posthumously awarded two Silver Stars. While his father was serving in the Philippines, Batchelor graduated from New Rochelle High School in 1901 and enrolled at Brown University. Sportswriter in Providence Batchelor worked part-time for The Providence Journal while attending Brown. His son later described Batchelor's challenge in reporting while attending college: \\"It meant conflict with his classes at Brown and the classes lost. At the end of a year, he terminated his formal schooling (it is understood at the request of the faculty) and threw himself into full-time newspaper work.\\" According to another account, Batchelor's father told a fellow Army officer that he wanted his son to be a newspaperman. Batchelor's father died in the Philippines in August 1902. According to the second account, the friend in whom Batchelor's father confided returned to the United States and \\"rescued Eddie from an auditor's desk and found a spot for him in the sports department of the Providence Journal. Batchelor career in journalism actually began as a general reporter with The Providence Journal, covering local fires, crime, and social events. He eventually was assigned to sports stories and became the paper's sporting editor. Batchelor recalled that his assignment to sports came after the Journals sports writer \\"went off the deep end,\\" leading Batchelor to say that he credited \\"booze for any success I had in life.\\" Sportswriter in Detroit In 1906, Batchelor was hired by the Detroit Free Press at a salary of $25 per week. He began as a general reporter in Detroit before being assigned to assist the paper's sports editor, Joe S. Jackson. Batchelor became the paper's sports editor in 1910 when Jackson left Detroit to become the sporting editor of The Washington Post. Batchelor covered the Detroit Tigers from 1907 to 1917 during the years when Ty Cobb dominated the sport. Batchelor wrote extensively about Cobb, and the two became friends. Well into his 80s, Batchelor insisted that Cobb was the greatest ball player of all time. Interviewed in 1939, Batchelor said, \\"There never was such a combination of brains and skill. Others might have been able to imagine the plays Cobb made, but only Cobb could execute them.\\" When asked by The Sporting News in 1965 to pick his all-time American League All-Star team, Batchelor emphasized his view that Cobb was the greatest player of all-time: \\"He was the best two players I ever saw.\\" In 1916, Cobb became angry over a call during a game in which Batchelor was acting as the official scorer. Batchelor ruled that a line drive to the shortstop by Tris Speaker was a hit, costing Cobb percentage points in the race for the American League batting championship. Batchelor later recalled that the ball was hit so hard that it nearly turned the shortstop (Donie Bush) around, but Cobb wrote a six-page letter to Batchelor stating that \\"if Batchelor didn't value his friendship any more than that‚Äîto aid the opposition‚Äîthen he was through talking to him.\\" The two did not speak for two years after the incident. One of the highlights of Batchelor's career came in 1912 when the Detroit Tigers went on strike to protest the suspension of Cobb. The team was in Philadelphia when the players went on strike, and manager Hughie Jennings spent the morning visiting Philadelphia's sandlots to recruit replacement players for a 3:00 p.m. game. Batchelor covered the game and called the replacement players \\"the worst bunch of clowns ever to wear major league uniforms.\\" He opined that the only reason the replacement Tigers scored in the 24-2 defeat was because \\"the Athletics were laughing so hard they couldn't field.\\" Batchelor also befriended Babe Ruth. He covered Ruth when he was a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Batchelor later recalled Ruth's generosity: \\"Whenever the Babe would come to Detroit, he'd say, 'A little short? How about a hundred bucks? How about fifty?' You'd say, 'No thanks, Babe, I'm okay.' And he'd say, 'Well, how about a box of cigars‚Äîhere y'are take a cigar.'\\" Batchelor's baseball articles were also published during the 1910s in The Sporting News. Batchelor also covered the Michigan Wolverines football team for the Free Press. After a predominantly Irish Notre Dame football team defeated Michigan, 11‚Äì3, in November 1909, Batchelor opened his report on the game with a line that gave the Notre Dame their nickname. Batchelor wrote, \\"Eleven fighting Irishmen wrecked the Yost machine this afternoon. These sons of Erin, individually and collectively representing the University of Notre Dame, not only beat the Michigan team, but they dashed some of Michigan's fondest hopes ...\\" Notre Dame football historian, John Kryk, later wrote: \\"With that flowery lead, E.A. Batchelor of the Detroit Free Press popularized a moniker Notre Dame teams would later come to embrace - and aptly summed up the greatest athletic achievement to that point in Notre Dame history.\\" Kryk noted that, according to Notre Dame folklore, Batchelor had overheard a Notre Dame player trying to motivate his teammates at halftime by pleading, \\"What's the matter with you guys? You're all Irish and you're not fighting worth a lick.\\"Kryk, Natural Enemies, p. 51. War correspondent in Europe After the United States' entry into World War I, Batchelor was hired by The Detroit News and reported on the war from France. Batchelor later described the reason for his decision to take the job with the News: \\"Somehow, with a war going on, it didn't seem important if the Tigers were in first place or last.\\" Two of Batchelor's articles from France, one reporting on soldiers' efforts to play baseball during lulls in the combat, and another about an Illinois school teacher who taught the French forces to play baseball, were published by The Sporting News. He returned from Europe in May 1919 as a passenger on the SS Noordam.Passenger record for Edward A. Batchelor, age 35, born July 21 in Raleigh, N.C., employed by Detroit News. Ancestry.com.

Later years After returning from Europe, Batchelor went into the advertising business. And in 1920, he formed his own advertising firm, Batchelor, Mason & Brown. He later worked for the advertising department at Chrysler Corporation. As of the 1920 United States Census, Batchelor was living at 281 Agnes Avenue in Detroit with his wife, Frida Batchelor (age 35, born in New York), their son, Edward A.

Throughout his various advertising jobs, Batchelor was able to keep his membership in the BBWAA active by writing a monthly sports column for the Detroit Athletic Club News. In the 1930s, he also served as the publicity director for the University of Detroit football team. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Batchelor was living at 69 Moran Road in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, with his wife, Frida S. Batchelor (age 45, born in New York), his son, Edward A.

In 1939, The Sporting News published a lengthy feature story on Batchelor's 30 years of covering baseball in Detroit. In July 1958, the Detroit Tigers held a Hall of Fame Day at Briggs Stadium honoring the team's inductees into the Baseball Hall of Fame and also honoring Detroit's two surviving charter members of the BBWAA. Batchelor appeared in person to accept a plaque from Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick. By 1962, Batchelor was the oldest active member of the BBWAA and held membership card No. 1 with that organization.(\\"Eddie Batchelor holds card No. 1 in the Baseball Writers' Association and in Detroit he is No. 1 in the hearts of his fellow writers.\\") In 1965, the Tigers celebrated their 10,000th game in the American League. The team honored Batchelor on the occasion by presenting him with a television set and driving him around the field at Tiger Stadium in a 1915 Ford Model T along with Davy Jones, a member of the outfield with Ty Cobb and the first player to face Walter Johnson in a major League game. For many years, Batchelor resided in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In his final months, Batchelor lived in a nursing home in Detroit. Sportswriter Joe Falls remained close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home: > \\"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, but his mind > was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... But before you could > feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd pull you close to the bed > and whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They > couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. > Pour me a drink' Batch went out the way he would have wanted, with his > lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at > the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid.\\" Batchelor was married to Frida Isabella Stirling in 1913. Their son, E.A. Batchelor, Jr., was a sportswriter in Detroit from the 1950s to the 1960s.

Focal adhesions are multi-protein intracellular signalling complexes that link the cellular actin microfilament cytoskeleton, through the cell membrane via transmembrane integrin proteins, to the extracellular matrix. Focal adhesions form and dissipate as cells attach and detach from matrix during cell adhesion and cell migration. The FAK focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain is a C-terminal region necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions, allowing FAK to regulate cell adhesion and migration by localizing its protein kinase activity at the junction of internal cytoskeleton and external cell attachment points. The crystal structure of FAT shows it to form a four-helix bundle that binds specifically to Leucine-Aspartate (LD)-repeat motif peptides in the related focal adhesion proteins paxillin (PXN), leupaxin (LPXN) and TGFB1I1/Hic-5. FAT domains with a similar 4-helix bundle structure are also found in other proteins that localize to paxillin-containing focal adhesions and are involved in cell adhesion and migration, including the FAK-related protein kinase PTK2B/FAK2/PYK2, and alpha-catenin, vinculin, Programmed cell death protein 10 (PDCD10)/Cerebral Cavernous Malformation protein 3 (CCM3) and GIT1/GIT2.

It was located at the east end of the Carr√© Marigny of the Champs-√âlys√©es, close to the Avenue Marigny, but faced west toward the Cirque National on the other side of the square. In 1855 the Salle Lacaze became the home of Jacques Offenbach's Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, where he first built his reputation as a theatre composer. It was subsequently used unsuccessfully by several companies until 1864, when it again became a profitable operetta theatre called the Folies-Marigny. When this company diminished in popularity, the theatre was closed. It was demolished in 1881 and replaced with the Panorama Marigny which was converted into the Th√©√¢tre Marigny in 1893. Salle Lacaze The first recorded entertainment use of the site dates to 1835, when a showman set up attractions at the Marigny junction. After the French Revolution of 1848 a small theatre called the Salle Lacaze was built for a magician named Lacaze.Levin 2009, p. 401, identifies the theatre as the \\"Salle Lacaze\\". Yon 2000, p. 111, describes it as a \\"petit th√©√¢tre de magie que le 'physicien' Lacaze a rouvert...\\" (\\"little theatre of magic that the 'conjurer' Lacaze opened...\\"). In this context, \\"physicien\\" has been translated as \\"conjurer\\"; see Faris, p. 48; Kracauer 2002, p. 166; Spiers 1908 (A New French-English General Dictionary), p. 537. \\"Conjurer\\" is chiefly a British term, meaning \\"magician\\". It was a summer theatre, and in it he presented \\"legerdemain and amusing physical representations.\\"Galignani 1852, p. 495. His theatre was also known as the Ch√¢teau d'Enfer (Castle of the Underworld).Duneton 1998, p. 921. Lacaze began losing money, and sometime after 1852 he closed down. Bouffes- Parisiens Palais de l'Industrie on the far side the Champs-√âlys√©es and the Carr√© Marigny with the Cirque de l'Imp√©ratrice at the front slightly left of center and the small Salle Lacaze (the first theatre of Offenbach's Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens) across the square at the left In the spring of 1855 the composer Jacques Offenbach decided that the position of this modest wooden theatre was perfectly situated on the Carr√© Marigny to catch overspill traffic from the Universal Exposition of 1855; after some modifications to the site he opened the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens on 5 July 1855. The theatre had a capacity of only 300 spectators.Lamb 1992, p. 653, gives the capacity of the Salle Lacaze as 300. Gammond 1980, p. 37, says it had a seating capacity of 50. At the inaugural performance, Offenbach conducted four of his own works, the last of which was Les deux aveugles, a one-act bouffonerie musicale about two swindling \\"blind\\" Parisian beggars. This little piece soon acquired an international reputation due to visitors from the Exposition and due to some controversy over its subject matter. Another notable premiere that summer was Le violoneux. Further performances in the summer of 1855 were primarily of satirical sketches which only included a few musical numbers. The season, however, was so successful that Offenbach was able to resign his position as conductor of the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais.Faris 1980, pp. 51‚Äì52. This theatre was soon renamed Bouffes d'√ât√©, as during the winter Offenbach directed the Bouffes d'Hiver in the Salle Choiseul on the rue Monsigny. The company also used the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857, and 1859 summer seasons, and a total of 16 Offenbach pieces were premiered here by the Bouffes-Parisiens.Yon 2000, pp. 760‚Äì762. Offenbach sublet the hall to the mime Charles Deburau in 1858Yon 2000, p. 201. for one unsuccessful summer season (5 June to 14 October), when it was known as the Th√©√¢tre DeburauLecomte 1905, p. 23. or the Bouffes- Deburau.G√§nzl 2001, p. 915. Deburau's season included the premieres of three 1-act pieces with music by Herv√©: Le voiturier (3 September), La belle espagnole (22 September), and Simple histoire (10 October). After Deburau, the theatre was again used by the Bouffes-Parisiens (1859). During the summer of 1860 Offenbach's company performed in Brusssels in June, while Offenbach himself went to Berlin to conduct the Berlin premiere of Orph√©e aux enfers, and from July to early August the company performed in Lyon, leaving the Salle Lacaze empty.Yon 2000. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the Bouffes-Parisiens from continuing to use both theatres, and their appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.Levin 2009, p. 401. Th√©√¢tre F√©erique On 1 January 1861 Raignard, inventor of a novel system of d√©cors and tricks, applied for permission to use the theatre for presentations between 2 and 5 p.m. at reduced prices targeted at the \\"numerous persons of a variable population\\", whose occupations and limited means kept them from attending the theatre in the evening. He also intended it to help young authors, composers, and actors. By a ministerial order of 5 February his repertory was limited to one- and two-act com√©dies-vaudevilles and operettas (with at most 5 characters) and one- and two-act f√©eries (melodramas with magic) with tableaus, choruses, and dances. Performances were given under the name Th√©√¢tre F√©erique des Champs-√âlys√©es or Petit Th√©√¢tre F√©erique des Champs-√âlys√©es. After the failure of this enterprise, the director was dismissed by a decree of 3 August 1861, and on 7 August a second decree authorized the artists to continue performances as a society under the direction of Octave Guillier. This effort was abandoned, however, by 31 August.Wild 1989, p. 139. The theatre was next used by Charles Bridault, who brought his Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢let des √éles in. This troupe had previously performed in the Bois de Boulogne from 13 June to 31 August. Their run of performances on the Champs-√âlys√©es was short, however, only lasting from 3 to 10 September.Wild 1989, p. 69. Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es The theatre was next acquired by C√©leste Mogador (Mme Lionel de Chabrillan), who had it renovated and rechristened as the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es (not to be confused with the later Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es on the avenue Montaigne). She gave its direction to Eug√®ne Audray-Deshorties, who received his authorization on 20 January 1862 and reopened the theatre on 19 April. His repertory was confined to one-, two-, and three-act com√©dies and vaudevilles (with interm√®des of song and dance) and operettas of one act, and was mainly borrowed from the Folies-Dramatiques (from the Boulevard du Temple), the Bouffes-Parisiens, and the Vari√©t√©s. Due to poor management, he retired in September, and the theatre was rented to the troupe of the Folies-Dramatiques from 14 September to 6 November. Mme Chabrillan took over again in 1863. She applied for permission to open a caf√©, with vocal concerts inside and instrumental concerts outside on the terrace, and provisionally entrusted its direction to Auguste Armand Bourgoin, who began on 22 June 1863. The theatre was sold to Louis-√âmile Hesnard (the actor known as Montrouge) on 27 February 1864.Wild 1989, pp. 70‚Äì71. Folies- Marigny The Folies-Marigny (blue) on an 1869 map of Paris Montrouge and his future wife Mlle Mac√©, turned it into a popular success as the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Marigny (26 March 1864).Lecomte 1905, p. 28. Several early operettas of Charles Lecocq were performed here. The tenor Achille-F√©lix Montaubry, who had formerly performed at the Op√©ra-Comique but had experienced a decline in the allure of his voice, purchased the Folies-Marigny in 1868, and produced an operetta of his own composition called Horace.F√©tis 1881, p. 234. In April 1870 the theatre was taken over by Leduc.The Musical World (23 April 1870), p. 289. The last performance was in April 1881, and shortly thereafter it was demolished, to be replaced with a panorama designed by the architect Charles Garnier. In 1893 Garnier's panorama was converted by the architect √âdouard Niermans into a new theatre, which opened on 22 January 1896 under the name Folies-Marigny, but this was soon shortened to Marigny-Th√©√¢tre or Th√©√¢tre Marigny.Lecomte 1905, pp. 28, 39.

Geography, climate and geology  Port St. Johns is situated on the Wild Coast on a coastline of about 270 km long. It lies at the mouth of the Mzimvubu River, a river flowing through a gorge known as the \\"Gates of St John\\" into an estuary located on the Indian Ocean. On both sides of the river ravine are high sandstone mountain peaks: Mount Thesiger (342 meter above sea level) and Mount Sullivan (304 meter), named after two British Military officers. It is the main settlement in the Port St. Johns Local Municipality which forms part of the O.R. Tambo District Municipality in Pondoland of the former Transkei. According to the 2011 census it had a population of 6,441, of whom 90% where Xhosa-speaking. The climate is humid subtropical (K√∂ppen: Cfa).

Later seafarers mistakenly identified the mouth of the Umzimvubu River as the site of this wreck. In the mid 1800s the local Mpondo Chief, Ndamase, allowed a few white traders to settle at the mouth of the Umzimvubu River. When Chief Ndamase died in 1876, the Mpondo Great House in Lusikisiki tried to take over the area. On 17 July 1878, Chief Ndamase's oldest son Nqwiliso, reacted by ceding the western bank of the Umzimvubu River to the Cape Colony in return for being recognised as an independent ruler and he and his people were promised protection.http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/nqwiliso-cedes- land-cape-governmenthttp://www.portstjohns.org.za/history.htm The river mouth was used as a port, however this activity was abandoned in the 1940s due to siltation, which caused the river to become too shallow for vessels. The town was the principal port of the defunct Republic of Transkei (1976-1994).  Tourism and road access  Port St. Johns is known as the centre of tourism on the Wild Coast. It is known for deep sea fishing and shore angling. Near to the town are three beaches. From Mthatha in the West and Flagstaff in the North the R61 road connects to Port St. Johns.

James I despatched him to Rome towards the close of 1621, in quality of agent to the papal court, to solicit a dispensation for the marriage of Prince Charles with the Spanish infanta Maria Anna (see the Spanish Match). The Jesuits strove to retard the dispensation, and if possible to prevent the completion of the match.

The story was uncovered by investigative reporters at Yahoo! Sports. Past scandals The University of Miami, particularly its football team, have experienced a number of past scandals. In 1994, The Miami Herald reported that 2 Live Crew member Luther Campbell and several NFL players had offered a \\"pay-for-play\\" scheme from 1986 through 1992, giving cash rewards to Miami players for acts such as scoring touchdowns and big hits. This allegation was verified in the subsequent NCAA investigation, which also found that Miami's \\"head football coach and the associate director of athletics for compliance and internal operations were aware\\" of the payments. Also in 1994, former Miami academic advisor Tony Russell pleaded guilty to helping 57 football players and more than 23 other scholarship athletes in falsifying applications for Pell Grants. From 1989 to 1992, Russell had helped players receive more than $220,000 of grants, which federal officials later called \\"perhaps the largest centralized fraud ... ever committed\\" against the Pell Grant program. As a result of the scandal, Alexander Wolff wrote a Sports Illustrated cover story suggesting Miami should temporarily shutter its football program and that athletic director Paul Dee should be fired. In 1995, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) announced that Miami had also provided or allowed \\"more than $412,000 of excessive aid\\" to student-athletes between 1990 and 1994, failed to implement its drug testing program, and lost institutional control over the football program. That December, the NCAA announced that Miami's multiple infractions would result in severe sanctions, including a one-year ban from postseason play and a 31-scholarship reduction from 1996 to 1999. In addition to the football team, the violations also involved Miami's baseball, men's tennis, and women's golf teams. Nevin Shapiro Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1969, Nevin Shapiro's family moved to south Florida when he was young, and he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School. Some time between 1999 and 2003, under the cover of a grocery business called Capitol Investments USA, Shapiro operated a $930 million Ponzi scheme which eventually collapsed in November 2009. On April 21, 2010, Shapiro was charged in New Jersey with securities fraud and money laundering, and he pleaded guilty to one count of each on September 15, 2010. On June 7, 2011, he was sentenced to twenty years in federal prison and ordered to make $82,657,362.29 in restitution. In 2002, Shapiro paid $1.5 million for thirty percent in a sports management company called Axcess Sports, which had been started by Michael Huyghue. The agency signed several Miami athletes, including Vince Wilfork. Shapiro was a major booster of Miami's athletic programs, and reportedly spent $2 million from 2002 to 2010 in support primarily of the football and men's basketball teams. In August 2010, Shapiro told The Miami Herald that he was writing a book titled, The Real U: 2001 to 2010. Inside the Eye of the Hurricane in which he promised to tell how Miami had violated NCAA rules affecting more than 100 players. \\"Once the players turned pro, they turned their back on me. It made me feel like a used friend,\\" he said. Word of the potential violations was also reported in an August 31, 2010, article by Marcus Session in the Bleacher Report https://bleacherreport.com/articles/446988-nevin-shapiro-ponzi-scheme- is-there-a-new-scandal-brewing-at-the-u On August 16, 2011, Yahoo! Sports writer Charles Robinson published an article based on 100 hours of jailhouse interviews with Shapiro, detailing his allegations regarding his illegal and unethical behaviors and the lack of oversight in the Miami athletics department. Allegations Shapiro allegedly used investor funds to finance donations to Miami's athletic program, and claimed that he gave an estimated $2 million in prohibited benefits to at least 72 current or former football/basketball players and coaches from 2002 to 2010. The Yahoo! Sports report alleges that Shapiro, through his donations, violated at least four major NCAA bylaws: * Bylaw 11, involving impermissible compensation to coaches; * Bylaw 12, involving amateurism of athletes; * Bylaw 13, involving improper recruiting activity; and * Bylaw 16, involving extra benefits to athletes. Shapiro saw his involvement as a direct continuation of Campbell's activities. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, he explained: > Here‚Äôs the thing: Luther Campbell was the first uncle who took care of > players before I got going. His role was diminished by the NCAA and the > school, and someone needed to pick up that mantle. That someone was me. He > was ‚ÄòUncle Luke,‚Äô and I became ‚ÄòLittle Luke.‚Äô NCAA sanctions on players On August 25, 2011, media reports indicated that Miami had declared as many as thirteen current football players ineligible, including projected starting quarterback Jacory Harris, as a result of the investigation. Miami then petitioned the NCAA for reinstatement of at least some of the players involved. The following day, head coach Al Golden confirmed these reports, though not naming any players or indicating the number of reinstatements sought. Under NCAA rules, these players were still allowed to practice until the NCAA notified Miami about its decisions. Depending on the scale of each player's violations, penalties may include sanctions that do not require missing games, suspension for a fixed number of games, or permanent ineligibility. Miami began the process in hopes that the NCAA would make its decisions on all players before their season opener at Maryland on September 5. On August 30, the NCAA announced the results of Miami's petition. It cleared one of the named players, Marcus Robinson, but found that the other twelve had received impermissible benefits. All of these players were required to make restitution before being reinstated. Four who were found to have received less than $100 were not suspended, and would be eligible to play once certified as having made restitution. In total, Miami players repaid about $4,000 in restitution, with the greatest single amount being $1,200. The three who drew the longest suspensions accepted gifts from Shapiro during their recruitment, and had received the greatest amount of improper benefits among the group. * Brandon McGee, JoJo Nicholas, Micanor Regis, Vaughn Telemaque ‚Äî No suspension * Travis Benjamin, Marcus Forston, Jacory Harris, Adewale Ojomo, Sean Spence ‚Äî Suspended one game * Ray-Ray Armstrong, Dyron Dye ‚Äì Suspended four games * Olivier Vernon ‚Äì Suspended six games Reaction Due to the nature of the allegations and the prominence of Miami's football team, as well as the history of scandals surrounding the program, reactions to the expose were rapid. Paul Dee, whose term as University of Miami athletic director from 1993 through 2008 encompassed both the current scandal and the violations uncovered in 1995, came in for heavy criticism. Sports Illustrateds Stewart Mandel summed up Dee's involvement as follows: > Dee, you may recall, was the Committee on Infractions chairman for USC's > much-publicized case last summer involving former stars Reggie Bush and O. > J. Mayo. It was Dee who, in announcing some of the stiffest penalties of the > last 20 years (a two-year bowl ban and 30 docked scholarships), closed with > the preachy reminder that \\"high-profile athletes demand high-profile > compliance\\". Dee, Miami's AD during most of the period covering Shapiro's > allegations, is retired and no longer under NCAA jurisdiction. Still, it > seems only fair he should spend a day at USC's Heritage Hall wearing a > sandwich board with the word \\"Hypocrite.\\" According to NCAA President Mark Emmert, the organization began investigating the situation \\"four or five months\\" prior to the publication of Robinson's article, and NCAA investigators had conducted multiple interviews with Shapiro. Many sportswriters, including Charles Robinson and Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports, speculated that if the allegations were found to be true, Miami could face the NCAA's \\"death penalty\\", which was last given to a major program in 1987 when the Southern Methodist University Mustangs had their football season cancelled. According to the NCAA, \\"A school is a repeat violator if a second major violation occurs within five years of the start date of the penalty from the first case. The cases do not have to be in the same sport.\\" According to several sources at Miami, NCAA investigators had started probing for a \\"pattern of willful violations,\\" which would allow it to investigate back to the date the earliest infractions occurred. The violations would overlap with the Miami baseball team's two-year probation from 2003 to 2005, which would make the football and basketball teams eligible for the \\"death penalty.\\"Robinson, Charles; Wetzel, Dan. Source: Willful violators clause could apply at Miami. Yahoo! Sports, August 18, 2011 However, NCAA Vice President for Enforcement Julie Roe Lach has said discussion about using the death penalty has been limited. Wolff, who had suggested in 1995 that the Miami football program should be shuttered, again called for Miami to temporarily drop football in an open letter to university president Donna Shalala, published in the August 29, 2011, issue of Sports Illustrated. In the letter, Wolff noted that Dan Wetzel had described the Miami program as a \\"de facto professional team\\" run by Shapiro, but that no NFL owner, in contrast to Shapiro, would have \\"stocked hotel rooms and his own yacht with prostitutes and strippers for players' pleasure and sprung for an abortion when one of the women got pregnant.\\" Wolff also had praise for Randy Shannon, who had been fired as Miami head coach after the 2010 season, noting that he \\"seems to have been the only person in Coral Gables who wanted nothing to do with Shapiro, reportedly warning his players to avoid him and threatening to fire assistants caught dealing with him.\\" On November 20, Miami announced that it was withdrawing from bowl consideration for the 2011 season due to the ongoing NCAA probe.Miami won't play in a bowl game. ESPN, November 20, 2011. With the NCAA yet to announce its results as the end of the 2012 season approached, Miami again chose to withdraw from postseason play, giving up a berth in the ACC Championship Game. = Miami statement on NCAA Notice of Allegations = Miami received the Notice of Allegations from the NCAA on February 19, 2013.

NCAA announces final sanctions  The NCAA announced its sanctions against Miami and four former coaches on October 22, 2013: As stated by the NCAA, these sanctions were brought about by Miami's lack of institutional control in the poorly monitored activities of a major booster, the men's basketball and football coaching staffs, student-athletes and prospects. * Entire athletic program  Three years of probation. * Football  No further postseason ban.  Loss of 9 total scholarships over the 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons. The program may divide those as it chooses.  Players on unofficial visits may be provided only one complimentary ticket to one home game in both 2014 and 2015. * Men's basketball  Loss of one scholarship in each of the 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, and 2016‚Äì17 seasons. * Coaches  Former Miami men's basketball coach Frank Haith, who by that point in time was the head coach at Missouri (and took the same position at Tulsa in 2014), was suspended for the first five games of the 2013‚Äì14 season.  Three former Miami assistants‚ÄîAubrey Hill (football), Clint Hurtt (football), and Jorge Fern√°ndez (men's basketball)‚Äîeach received a two- year show-cause penalty.

The Agua Caliente Tourist Complex formed in the late 1920s along Agua Caliente Boulevard when a road was built that led from the historic Rio Zone to a natural hot springs two miles up the Tijuana River Valley. Paramount icons of Tijuana developed in Agua Caliente such as the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel and the Agua Caliente Racetrack. Today Agua Caliente is one of Tijuana's paramount tourist centers, the location of some of the city's most affluent neighborhoods, and also contains commercial and other offices along Boulevard Agus Caliente. History The hot springs around which the Agua Caliente Tourist Complex grew was a well known location and prior to major development, was the site of small hotels and cabins. With the development of the casino and resort in 1928, Agua Caliente developed as a premier tourist attraction that drew the likes of Charles Chaplin, Rita Hayworth, and Laurel and Hardy. The resort was designed in a Mexican and Californian colonial style, fitted with gardens, its own airstrip, bungalows, minarets, baths, and the casino and hotel itself. The Agua Caliente Club was a golf course adjacent to the city that later became the Tijuana Country Club. In 1930 the golf course had its first PGA Tour event at the Agua Caliente Open, won by Gene Sarazen. The Agua Caliente Racetrack was constructed one year later in 1929 and was the site of the Agua Caliente Handicap. The race attracted wealthy Southern Californians and was the richest race in North America. In 1935, then Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas outlawed gambling and the resort was closed. The resort was converted into a technical school and the site gradually fell into a state of disrepair as the resort furnishings were stripped away. Though the race track continued to operate, gambling was not legalized until 1938. In 1971 the original structure of the racetrack was destroyed in a fire. It was later repaired and continues operation today, though horse racing has been replaced with Greyhound Racing, as the Racetrack of Agua Caliente (). Plaza Aguacaliente & Grand Hotel Tijuana are a set of twin towers built adjacent to the Tijuana Country Club, constructed in 1982. It was the first major complex built in Agua Caliente after the original Tourist Complex. The early 2000s saw the establishment of Estadio Caliente on the grounds of the racetrack, though the stadium does not interfere with races. The development of the stadium brought Club Tijuana to the city, its first professional association soccer team. Agua Caliente today In the contemporary era Agua Caliente is one of Tijuana's most developed districts. Along with Avenida Revolucion, it is one of the city's tourist centers and is the site of luxury hotels and numerous shopping centers. It is the city's primary athletic center being home to the only golf course in the city, Auditorio Fausto Gutierrez Moreno, Estadio Caliente, and the Agua Caliente Race Track. Commercial area / edge city Part of Agua Caliente along Boulevard Agua Caliente functions as an extension of the city's main commercial district, the Zona R√≠o. The Agua Caliente submarket had, in 2016, of class A and B office space, while the contiguous Zona R√≠o submarket had , for a total of .

He and his two brothers later set up and ran a factory manufacturing and exporting full lead mouth blown crystal. The company had to close its doors after four years. Bradley then turned to his interest in art and fashion. He opened his own clothes shop in the trendy university area of the city. Called ‚ÄúRetro‚Äù the shop was soon a leader in fashion for the clothes conscious of Belfast. Terry‚Äôs was the first shop to stock Red or Dead shoes and he had a regular Saturday DJ playing in the tiny outlet. He sold hand painted jeans and one-off shirts and jackets that he imported from all over the world. A few years later he moved to Dublin in 1989. Bradley initially started modelling clothes for friends to make ends meet. During this time however, he was busy painting and drawing in his spare time. A chance conversation with John Reynolds, the owner of the famous POD club in Dublin, lead to Bradley‚Äôs first solo art exhibition. The night was a huge success and Terry started to make some money. He now exhibits in Dublin, Belfast, London and Spain and is planning his first solo exhibition for the USA later this year. Followed by Roma Chang. His natural aversion to the establishment has made it difficult for him to fit into a typical art gallery mould, and he still likes to exhibit in the bars and clubs that he feels most at home in. He sells his work all around the world and his art has been used by Nokia for the cover of a limited edition mobile phone. Bradley is able to paint full-time and explore the voyeuristic side of his nature that he first discovered as a child. His work mostly centres on strong women and ex-models from Dublin, and more recently Paris. His latest work is inspired by the era of the Belle √âpoque in France and the contrasts and similarities with the Burlesque dancers of New York.

It stars Beans the Cat in the character's second solo cartoon. Porky also made a cameo. Plot Beans presenting himself to the guard One day in Hollywood, actors come to the studio to do their routines. Also coming to the studio is Beans who travels in his rough-riding car, but the guard will not permit him to enter. Not backing out, Beans disguises himself as Oliver Hardy, and passes through the gate without causing suspicion. Taking off his cover, Beans enters a sound stage where Oliver Owl is directing a film. Looking from a catwalk, Beans watches Little Kitty perform a scene where an actor tries to court her. Suddenly, a passing worker accidentally knocks him off and Beans falls on top of the actor, much to the annoyance of Oliver, who tosses Beans away. Beans lands in a scene room where a Frankenstein-esque robot is on the table. As he frightenedly moves back, the cat lands on a switch. As a result, the robot activates and rises. The robot goes on a rampage and everyone flees the studio. Beans tries to whack it with an iron bar but the robot is very sturdy and throws him across the sound stage. As Beans lands next to a giant fan, he switches it on, generating a gale force at the robot. The robot resists the draft, but walks straight into the fan getting smashed to bits.

Rossi (September 24, 1922 ‚Äì November 3, 2009) was a pioneering feminist and sociologist. Biography Alice Emma Schaerr was born on September 24, 1922, in Brooklyn, New York. Rossi's scholarship focused on the status of women at work, in the family, and their sexual life. Her writings helped to build the foundations of the feminist movement. Her early advocacy of abortion and reproductive rights caused her to gain a lot of national attention. One of her main academic pursuits was the study of people's lifecourse from youth to age, particularly in the case of women. One of her most influential feminist articles was ‚ÄúEquality Between the Sexes: An Immodest Proposal.‚Äù First presented in 1963 at a meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, it was published the next year in the academy's journal Daedalus. In the article, Professor Rossi argued that for most women motherhood had become a full-time occupation, a state of affairs that hurt not only women but also the larger society in which they lived. For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she wrote, parity of the sexes is essential. This article's publication coincided with the publication the same year of The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan, which dealt with similar issues. Familiar today, Professor Rossi's argument was considered subversive at the time. As a result, she was called a monster, an unnatural woman and an unfit mother, as she recalled in interviews afterward. Her article can be found in the anthology ‚ÄúLife Cycle and Achievement in America‚Äù (Harper & Row, 1969), edited by Rose Laub Coser. In 1966, Rossi, along with a group that included Betty Friedan, founded the National Organization for Women (NOW). In later work, also controversial, Professor Rossi argued that the cultural divide between men and women was not the product of socialization alone, as the prevailing view held, but was partly rooted in inborn biological differences between the sexes. Professor Rossi held appointments at Harvard, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins University and Goucher College before finally joining the University of Massachusetts faculty, where she was appointed the Harriet Martineau professor of Sociology. She remained there from 1974 until her retirement in 1991, at which point she became an emerita professor. She also was the 74th president of the American Sociological Association.

It was completed in 1929 by the design of the city architect Vilho Kolho, and built using local red granite. The tower stands 75 meters above the level of the adjacent lake Pyh√§j√§rvi (152 meters above the sea level) on the Pyynikki ridge crest. The top can be reached by a lift, but walking up the stairs offers various observation windows. The open top offers a clear view of the city of Tampere as well as lake N√§sij√§rvi on the north and lake Pyh√§j√§rvi in the south. Entrance to the park and cafe is free but climbing the tower costs 50 cents for children or 2 euros for adults. The Cafe has its own historic donut recipe which has remained unchanged for 80 years.  History  Pyynikki has been a park and place of natural beauty since the 1830s and the first cafe within Pyynikki was opened in 1868. The first observation tower was built in 1888 by the design of the architect Georg Schreck, but it was damaged in the 1918 Battle of Tampere. Rebuilding plans started from 1925 and the new tower and cafe was opened in 1929 for the city's 150th anniversary. The opening ceremonies were postponed due to the sinking of the steam ship Kuru which caused the loss of 136 lives. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the city of Tampere built the modern N√§sinneula tower which replaced Pyynikki's role as a tourist attraction aimed at foreign tourists, leaving Pyynikki mostly for local visitors and other Finns and as a hidden gem for foreign tourists. Pyynikki observation tower is listed as a Cultural environment of national significance by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities.

He wrote a treatise on medicine called the Rosa Medicin√¶. Career John was born about 1280, and wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. He took his name from Gaddesden on the borders of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire, where an ancient house, opposite that gate of Ashridge Park which is nearest to the church of Little Gaddesden, is shown as his. He was a member of Merton College (Wood), and a doctor of physic of Oxford. He began to study medicine about 1299, and soon attained large practice in London. He treated a son of Edward I, probably Thomas of Brotherton, for smallpox. Between 1305 and 1307 he wrote a treatise on medicine, which soon became famous, entitled Rosa Medicin√¶. He chose the name, he said, because as the rose has five sepals, so his book has five parts, and adds that as the rose excels all flowers, so his book excels all treatises on the practice of medicine. The title was probably suggested by Bernard de Gordon's Lilium Medicin√¶, which appeared at Montpellier in 1303, and is quoted in the Rosa. Gaddesden's book is often spoken of as Rosa Anglica. It is crammed with quotations from Galen, Pedanius Dioscorides, Rufus of Ephesus, Haliabbas, Serapion, Al Rhazis, Avicenna, Averroes, John of Damascus, Isaac, Masawaiyh, Gilbertus Anglicus, and from the Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum; but also contains a good many original remarks which illustrate the character of the author more than his medical knowledge. The book begins with an account of fevers based on Galen's arrangement, then goes through diseases and injuries beginning with the head, and ends with an antidotarium (a treatise on remedies). It contains some remarks on cooking, and innumerable prescriptions, many of which are superstitious, while others prove to be common-sense remedies when carefully considered. He cared for his gains, and boasts of getting a large price from the Barber Surgeons' guild for a prescription of which the chief ingredient is tree frogs (Rosa, ed. Pavia, p. 120). His disposition, his peculiarities, and his reading are so precisely those of the \\"Doctour of Phisik\\" in Geoffrey Chaucer's prologue that it seems possible that Gaddesden is the contemporary from whom Chaucer drew this character. Many manuscripts of the Rosa Medicin√¶ are extant. It was first printed at Pavia in 1492, again at Venice, 1502, and at Pavia, 1517, and for the last time at Augsburg in 1595 (two volumes). It was translated into Irish. Gaddesden was in priest's orders, and was appointed to the stall of Wildland in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 1 Aug. 1342. He died in 1361. The best account of his writings is in John Freind's History of Physick, 1726, ii. 277. This account contains the error, repeated by John Aikin's Biographical Memoirs of Medicine, 1780, p. 11, that he held the stall of Ealdland. The John de Gatesdone who held this stall was another person, and died before 1262.

Mario Borrelli (19 September 1922, in Naples ‚Äì 13 February 2007, in Oxford) was a Neapolitan priest, sociologist and educationist. Mario Borrelli received the attention of press and television for decades, overseas more than in Italy, his own country. The popularity of his social undertakings is demonstrated by hundreds of publications presently in the phase of being catalogued. Mario Borrelli fits with the definition of organic intellectual according to Gramsci‚Äôs terminology: his historical and social studies mark the most significant stages of his life but especially his work in society. Editor and Director of Lo Scugnizzo, media outlet of La Casa dello Scugnizzo (The House of the Urchins), he harboured multiple interests other than that for the social sciences. He was author of autobiographies, poems, scripts and educational projects until the 1980s when he principally narrowed down his interests to peace research and education. His works still remain partly unpublished. The documents and articles indicated below can only partly be found in Italian and foreign libraries, while the entire collection of publications is stored in his private archive of the Borrelli-West family, which continues to spend time and dedication to the catalogueing of Mario Borrelli‚Äôs main biographies and especially of his rich historical and critical production. It should be stressed that the list of documents and publications indicated below, although representative of Mario Borrelli‚Äôs works, is by no means complete. Autobiographies Mario Borrelli was already popular in Anglophile countries since the 1950s thanks to the biographical novel Children of the Sun written by Morris West, in which his undertakings as priest-street urchin had been celebrated as an example of heroism and Christianity. When, in 1963, he wrote together with A. Thorne his first autobiography, A Street Lamp and the Stars, it was with the aim to share with his trustees, around the world, both the story behind the foundation of the Casa dello Scugnizzo (House of the Urchins) and the spirit with which he continued to welcome and raise so many maladapted children. In 1967, Un Prete nelle Baracche, was inspired by the diary he had kept between 1962‚Äì63, the first years he had spent in the slums of Naples, where the street urchins most commonly came from. =Books= *Mario Borrelli and Anthony Thorne, A street lamp and the stars, London, Peter Davies, 1963 (Italian translation: Mario Borrelli and Anthony Thorne, Napoli d'oro e di stracci, Rome, Borla Editore, 1965.) *Mario Borrelli, Un prete nelle baracche, Vicenza, La Locusta, 1967. *Mario Borrelli, The continuing story from Morris West, Children of the sun, Fontana Books Ltd., 1983. *Mario Borrelli, Marciapiedi, Molfetta, Edizioni La Meridiana, 1995.

Borrelli spent at the London School of Economics to obtain a Master in Social Administration. From the socio-political analysis of the sub-proletarian reality of Naples (1973) to the basic concepts for a communitary action on the urban underclass (1974) we find the basic principles, which inspired M. Borrelli in all his activities at the Materdei Community Centre. In addition, between 1969 and 1978, his idea of a participative democracy was a guideline for all his actions of social intervention among the people of the lower classes of the Neapolitan population: the CCM (Materdei Community Centre) worked for the awareness of the underclass taking inspiration from the method of Paulo Freire.

The fibrous material is fixed with an upper and lower stitching thread on a base material. Compared to other textile manufacturing processes fiber material can be placed near net-shape in curvilinear patterns upon a base material in order to create stress adapted composite parts. History TFP technology was introduced in the early 1990s by the IPF Dresden.Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites June 1998 vol. 17 no. 9: \\"Tailored Fiber Placement-Mechanical Properties and Applications\\" At the beginning handmade stitched reinforcement structures (preforms) were manufactured initialized by an industry inquiry about stress adapted fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) parts with a curvilinear pattern. An adaptation of this method to industrial embroidery machines, by using the sewing capabilities of those automates, was implemented in the mid-90s. The technology was named Tailored Fiber Placement, which describes the variable axial near-net-shape fibre placement capabilities. Nowadays, the Tailored Fiber Placement is already in a few companies a well-established textile technology for dry preform manufacturing.Hightex Verst√§rkungsstrukturen GmbH Principle of the technology Sketch of the principle of the tailored fiber placement manufacturing process Based on embroidery machinery used in the garment textile industry, the machines have been adapted to deposit and stitch fiber roving material onto a base material. Roving material, mostly common carbon fibers, from about 3,000 up to 50,000 filaments can be applied. The preform is produced continuously by the placement of a single roving. The roving material pulled off a spool is guided by a pipe which is positioned in front of the stitching needle. The roving pipe and the frame, where the base material is fixed onto, move synchronized stepwise to perform a zigzag stitch relative to needle position. The stitching head equipped with roving spool, pipe and needle can rotate arbitrarily 360 degrees. During each stitch the upper thread is pulled through the base material and looped around the lower thread spool. Hence a double backstitch is performed. Currently, up to 800 stitches per minute can be achieved. The base material can be a 2D-textile such as woven or non-woven fabric or a matrix-compatible foil material for thermoplastic composites. The stitching path can be designed in form of a pattern either with the help of classical design embroidery software or more recently by use of 2D-CAD systems. Afterwards necessary information of the stitch positions are added to the pattern with the help of so-called punch software and finally transferred to the TFP machine. The infiltration of TFP-preforms can be done with conventional processing techniques such as resin transfer moulding, vacuum bag molding, pressing and autoclave moulding. In the case of thermoplastic composites the matrix material and the reinforcement fibers can be placed simultaneously e.g. in the form of films or fibers. The base material can then be a thermoplastic foil which melts during the consolidation process and becomes part of the matrix. This type is ideally suited for deep-drawn TFP- preforms. Advantages of the TFP technology :‚Ä¢ Net-shape manufacturing reduces costs and waste of valuable reinforcement fibers, e.g. carbon fibers :‚Ä¢ Automatic deposition ensures high accuracy and repeatability of amount and orientation of fibers :‚Ä¢ TFP machines with multiple heads can be applied to achieve a reasonable productivity; each head is manufacturing in a synchronized way the same preform :‚Ä¢ Fibers can be orientated in an arbitrary direction in order to manufacture highly stress adapted composite parts :‚Ä¢ A variety of fibers such as carbon, glass, basalt, aramid, natural, thermoplastic, ceramic fibers and also metallic threads can be applied and combined within one preform Applications for structural parts TFP manufactured prefoms made of carbon and glass fibers for structural FRP parts The TFP technology allows the fabrication of preforms tailored for specific composite components or reinforcements. Applications range from highly accelerated lightweight parts for industrial robots or blades for compressors up to CFRP aircraft parts, e.g. I-beam for the NH-90 helicopter, automotive structures and bicycle parts. TFP for self-heating tooling and components Preform of a carbon layer heating structure Using the carbon roving as an electric heating element offers the possibility to manufacture composite structures with embedded heating layers. Due to the high flexibility in the design of the heating pattern an overall nearly equal heat distribution can be achieved. In terms of applications this technology embedded in solid composite molds is very beneficial for resin consolidation and binder activation in out- of-autoclave processes. Composite molds show similar heat expansion properties as the manufactured composite parts. The lower thermal mass of composite tools compared to common metal molds help to shorten the manufacturing cycle of FRP parts and decrease the energy need for the production process. Further the TFP heating elements can be applied in CFRP wing structures of airplanes or blades of wind mills for anti- and de-icing tasks. The TFP structure embedded in elastomeric heating bags can applied to manufacturing or repairing processes of composite parts.Qpoint Composite GmbH References  External links  * EU-Project \\"Embroidery\\" * EU-Project \\"Green Tooling\\" * Tailored Fiber Placement at the IPF Dresden * LayStitch Technologies - Automated Tailored Fiber Placement Machines and Solutions Composite material fabrication techniques ","title":"Tailored fiber placement"},{"id":"32775099","text":"King's Theatre (1 May 1991 - 13 June 2011) was an Irish-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was trained in the United Kingdom and the United States during a racing career which lasted from July 1993 to June 1996, winning five of his seventeen races. He is best known for winning the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1994, a year in which he was named European Champion Three-year old colt. King's Theatre later became a sire of both flat racers and jumpers. Background King's Theatre was bred in Ireland by Michael Poland. He was from the sixth crop of the fourteen times Champion sire Sadler's Wells out of the mare Regal Beauty, making him a half-brother to the Royal Lodge Stakes winner High Estate, who was European Champion Two-Year-Old in 1988. He was sent into training with Henry Cecil at Newmarket. Racing career =1993: two-year-old season= King's Theatre made his first appearance in July 1993, finishing fifth in a maiden race at Newmarket. A five-length win in a Yarmouth maiden race was followed by a four-length win in the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes at Newbury. He was then moved up to the highest level to contest the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, in which he defeated the Fillies' Mile winner, Fairy Heights. =1994: three- year-old season= King's Theatre went into the winter of 1993-4 as a leading Derby candidate. On his 1994 debut, however, he proved himself to be a serious contender for the 2000 Guineas by taking a narrow victory in the Craven Stakes. Sent off as 9-2 favourite for the Guineas, he led early but faded into 13th place behind Mister Baileys. A well-beaten fourth place behind Erhaab in the Dante Stakes followed, and his price for the Derby drifted out to 14‚Äì1. At Epsom, however, he showed himself to be a top-class middle-distance performer, taking the lead a furlong from home and finishing second of the twenty-five runners behind Erhaab. As a result of his Epsom performance, he was sent off evens favourite for the Irish Derby and duly defeated his male rivals, but could only manage second place to the European Champion filly Balanchine. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes he was sent off at 12-1 and produced his best performance. Always prominent, he was taken wide to make his challenge in the straight, took the lead a furlong out, and won by one and a quarter lengths from White Muzzle, with Erhaab well-beaten in seventh. The race was marred to some extent by the performance of Ezzoud, who unseated his jockey at the start and went on to interfere with several runners. King's Theatre continued to be tried at the highest level, but never won another race. Following his victory at Ascot, he finished third to Ezzoud in the International Stakes and tenth (beaten less than four lengths) behind Carnegie in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. =1995: four-year-old season= For the 1995 season, King's Theatre was moved to the US to be trained by Bill Mott. He failed to win in three starts, the best of them being a third place behind Kiri's Clown in the Sword Dancer Invitational Stakes at Saratoga. =1996: five-year-old season= In the winter of 1995‚Äì1996 he was transferred to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation and was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. He made only two starts as a five-year-old, finishing second in a minor stakes race at Newbury and third of four to Strategic Choice in the Gran Premio di Milano. He was then retired to stud. Assessment King's Theatre was rated the third best juvenile colt in Europe in 1993. At three he was rated at 128 by Timeform and named best three-year-old colt in the Cartier Racing Awards. Stud career Retired to stand at stud in Ireland in 1997, King's Theatre had a long and reasonably successful career as a stallion. For several years he was a \\"shuttle\\" stallion- standing at the Ballylinch Stud, Kilkenny for part of the year, before being \\"shuttled\\" to stand at the Glenlogan Stud Queensland, for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. His winners on the flat included King's Drama (Sword Dancer Invitational Stakes), Young Mick (Cumberland Lodge Stakes), King's Ironbridge (Craven Stakes), Royal Code (Alister Clark Stakes) and Red Rioja (C. L. Weld Park Stakes). Later in his stud career he became better known as the sire of several prominent jumpers, including Riverside Theatre (Ascot Chase, Ryanair Chase), Captain Chris (Arkle Challenge Trophy), Menorah (Supreme Novices' Hurdle), Wichita Lineman (Spa Novices' Hurdle), Voler la Vedette (Hatton's Grace Hurdle), Cue Card (Champion Bumper, Ascot Chase, Ryanair Chase, Betfair Chase) and The New One (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle). King's Theatre died on 13 June 2011 after suffering complications following an operation for colic.

Released to mark the opening of the reactor at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center Poster by Paul Kor Paul Kor (Kornowski, , August 1, 1926 - May 24, 2001) was an Israeli painter, graphic designer, children's author and illustrator who won many prizes in Israel and worldwide.  Biography  Paul Kornowski was born in Paris to a non-observant Jewish family who had emigrated from Poland. His father, Yitzhak, a tailor by trade, was murdered in the Holocaust in Auschwitz, and the young Paul was smuggled to Geneva, Switzerland, together with his brother, where he lived as a refugee in a Jewish orphanage until the end of the war. During that time he studied art and graphics at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva, and subsequently at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. At the beginning of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war he immigrated to Israel and joined the IDF as a volunteer in MAHAL (Foreign Volunteers). After his marriage to Pnina Tovbin, whom he met while in the IDF, he remained in Israel. Paul Kor retained his family name Kornowski, but used Kor to sign his works. In 2001, Kor died of lung cancer, at the age of 75. He was buried in the Kiryat Sha'ul Cemetery in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his wife Pnina and his two sons. In June 2008, a street was named after him in Tel Aviv, the city in which he worked and created for most of his life. Art career Kor was awarded first prize - the \\"Golden Siren\\" sculpture - for his poster for the promotion of tourism at the Fourth International Tourism Posters Competition in 1966, in Milan, Italy. In addition to his constant activity as an artist in Israel and the world, Kor worked for many years in illustration and graphic design. He designed some of the banknotes and stamps of the State of Israel, and also designed and produced booklets and posters in Israel and in France. In 1968, his illustrated text-less book T√™te-√†-Queue was awarded the \\"Beautiful Book\\" prize in France, and was also exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. At the beginning of the 1970s, Kor painted and designed the last series of the Israeli Lira banknotes, which was the basis for the first series of the Israel Shekel banknotes. The notes he designed show portraits of Henrietta Szold (5 Israel Lirot), Montefiore (10 Israel Lirot), Chaim Weizmann (50 Israel Lirot) and Herzl (100 Israel Lirot). He was always searching for his identity and combined two worlds: the realistic one and the world of dreams. His paintings were exhibited in Paris, Oslo Norway and London. In Israel, his works were shown at Gallery Rosenfeld, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Petach Tikvah Museum of Art, and Yad Layeled. On the tenth anniversary of his death, Kor's oil painting The Cellist was exhibited at the Yad LaYeled Children‚Äôs Museum at the Ghetto Fighters' House, alongside the children's books he wrote and illustrated. Two of his monotypes dated 1995 are in the Israel Museum‚Äôs collection in Jerusalem.  Children's books  Paul Kor In 1974, Kor began focusing on painting and illustrating children's books. From the 1980s Kor was considered one of the most popular and most-loved children's authors in Israel. In 1986, he published, through the Keter Publishing House, the book The Fish that Didn't Want to be a Fish, which creates the effect of changing characters. Later on, he wrote and illustrated The Hawk's Story. His best known book, Caspion the Little Fish, published by Zmora Bitan, starred for the first time a small silver fish which became the character most identified with Paul Kor as a children's author. Kor tells it: ‚ÄúOn the table in my studio there lay an open box of cigarettes and a ray of sunshine fell on the silver paper and sparkled inside it and in a fraction of a second the idea was born to write a book about a silver fish\\".A. Cohen-Vardi, Father of Caspion, Yedioth Ahronoth, February 23, 2003 Caspion, which won the Ben-Yitzhak illustration prize from the Youth Wing of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, subsequently became a 3-book series (the other books in the series are Caspion in Danger and Caspion's Great Journey). In addition, Paul Kor published through \\"Zmora Bitan\\" the book The Magic Zoo, which was awarded the Nahum Guttman prize for illustration by the Tel Aviv Municipality. From then on, more children's books were published one after the other by \\"Kinneret Zmora Bitan\\", all of which enjoyed great success. Caspion was joined, among others, by Ben-Ben and the Fledgling, The Elephant who Wanted to be the Best, The Sultan who Wanted to Fly, The Boy who Loved the Moon, Flower, Flower, Don't Cry, Little Frog, Go to Sleep, The Most Beautiful Color in the World, The Little Climber and the Glowing Flower and other illustrated stories which enjoyed great popularity among both children and parents. A number of books were made into DVDs and children's plays which are still being played successfully to this day. Commemoration Street sign, Paul Kor Street in Tel Aviv After his death, Paul Kor's family made two animated films based on the books: The Elephant who Wanted to be the Best and Caspion, produced by \\"Classikaletet\\".

Following the theft of livestock by a band of Tonto Apaches, a troop of United States Army soldiers was dispatched to track the natives and recover the stolen property. The Americans found the raiders at Sunset Pass, in Coconino County, Arizona, where a small skirmish ensued. Battle In October 1874 a Tonto band stole some livestock from a settler in the Tonto Basin so on the morning of November 1, 1874 about forty men of the 5th Cavalry, including some Apache scouts, left Camp Verde to pursue the hostiles. The patrol reached Sunset Pass, near the Little Colorado River, that same day so the commander, First Lieutenant Charles King, decided that the spot would be a good place to make camp for the night. However, shortly after the Americans stopped, King took a few men with him on a hike up a nearby mesa in order to have a better view of the surrounding terrain.Rodenbough, Theo F., ed.

King and his men were about a half a mile away from camp when suddenly a volley or arrows and bullets was fired from the Tontos hiding behind rocks and boulders. King was badly wounded within the first few minutes of the fight, having been hit in the head twice by arrows and one by a bullet to his right arm. Under a heavy enemy fire, Sergeant Bernard Taylor raced forward and rescued King who was almost unconscious. Sergeant Taylor then carried the wounded King all the way back to camp. By which time the remainder of the patrol moved in to engage. Second Lieutenant George O. Eaton assumed command at that point and he fought the Apaches for some time before disengaging. In the end, King's probe was regarded as a failure though Sergeant Taylor, George Deary, and Rudolph von Medem later received the Medal of Honor for their conduct in this battle and other engagements.Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.

Aftermath Because the pursuit of the Tonto Apaches failed, the garrison of Camp Verde launched another expedition on November 17 of 1874. In it, Second Lieutenant Eaton led a detachment of the 5th Cavalry which was accompanied by the famous frontiersman Al Sieber and his Apache scouts. The expedition first headed east from Camp Verde along West Clear Creek before heading roughly northeast above the Mogollon Rim. Several days later, on November 24, Eaton and his command encountered a patrol under Captain Robert H. Montgomery who had been patrolling farther to the east. Though Eaton had no orders to proceed further east, he continued on and found the Apache's trail which Captain Montgomery had missed. The expedition followed the trail and two hours before sunset they found the hostiles. Another skirmish ensued and it resulted in the deaths of two warriors and the capture of six women and children, the Americans suffered no casualties.Michno, pg. 289 As for First Lieutenant King, he later became a captain only to retire from the regular army shortly afterwards, due to his wounds sustained at Sunset Pass. King then became a well known novelist before volunteering to fight in the War of 1898 and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War as a general.

Description and history The nave Although the church has early 14th-century origins, it is mainly late 14th and early 15th century, being built for the Greene family of Drayton House. A large heraldic shield dominates the nave, and the chancel bears the arms of the Greene family, and also that of John Heton, rector from 1406 to 1415. The list of clergy (see below) shows the appointments from Nicholas de Nevil in 1217, so the current building must have been a replacement for an earlier one. The tower is topped with an octagonal lantern, flying buttresses and 12 pinnacles with golden weathervanes. Simon Jenkins noted that \\"the tower with its octagonal top is visible for miles around, a forest of pinnacles topped by golden weathervanes. From a distance they seem to flutter in the sun, like pennants summoning us to some forgotten Tudor tournament\\". An entry in the churchwardens' accounts records taking down the rood-loft and filling the holes in May 1644. In July 1645 payment was made for the \\"glazing of the windows when the crucifixion and scandalous pictures were taken down\\". There were Victorian restorations in 1868‚Äì72 by Richard Herbert Carpenter and William Slater which consisted of repairs to roof and walls and re-seating, and further work in 1887. The reredos was made in 1930‚Äì31 as a memorial to Sackville George Stopford-Sackville, who died in 1926, to the design of the architect William Randoll Blacking. More repairs were carried out by the architect Eric Arthur Roberts in 1973‚Äì75. Stained glass and memorials The north aisle windows have reset panels of a Jesse window from around 1330‚Äì40 depicting 16 figures. Some medieval glass also survives in the south chancel windows. There are six windows with 19th-century stained glass in the north and south aisles and also in the chancel. South chapel In the chancel floor is the gravestone for John Heton, rector of Lowick from 1406 to 1415. The slab has a border inscription > Hic jacet Dominus Johannes de Heton quondam rector ecclesie de benyfelde et > nuper de Lufwyck cujus anime propicietur Deus Amen. Credo quod Redemptor > meus vivit et in novissimo die de terra surrectus sum et in carne mea videbo > deum salvatorem. Sir Ralfe Greene who died in 1417. He was Knight of the Shire for Northamptonshire, High Sheriff of Northamptonshire and Sheriff of Wiltshire. The memorial is by Thomas Prentys and Robert Sutton at a cost of ¬£40. It is a pair of alabaster effigies on chest tomb in north chapel, with angels under canopies around the sides. A vaulted canopy is above the head of each figure, base of shafts to support canopy over whole. Chest tomb of Sir Ralfe Greene and wife from above. Chest tomb of Sir Ralfe Greene and wife from side. In the south transept, a chest tomb memorial to Henry Green who died 22 February 1467 or 1468 and his wife. He wears a suit of armour with spurs, and his wife has a head-dress with horns. The shield of arms bears a chequered coat quartering an engrailed cross: small brass scrolls repeat the motto Da gloriam Deo. Tomb of Edward Stafford, 2nd Earl of Wiltshire In the South Chapel on the south side is the memorial to Edward Stafford, 2nd Earl of Wiltshire, died 1499, who refounded the chantry and had the chapel rebuilt. His memorial is an alabaster effigy on chest tomb with lozenge panels inside cusped squared panels in the south transept. The inscription is formed by letters knotted in allusion to the badge of the house of Stafford. A plain tablet in the north chapel remembers William, infant son of John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough who died in 1625. Inscribed tablets in the chancel floor commemorate Roger Lane who died in 1690 and John Halford who also died in 1690. In front of the east window is the memorial for Mary Howard, Duchess of Norfolk (d. 1705). She was the daughter of the Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough and first wife of Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet (died 1718). The memorial is a semi-reclining white marble figure on chest tomb with bolection-moulded pilasters. Memorial to Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet On the north wall is the tomb of Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet who died in 1718, set as a semi-reclining marble figure in armour on a chest tomb. There is an inscribed brass tablet to Lady Elizabeth Germain who died in 1760. In the South Chapel in front of the east window is the memorial of Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset who died in 1843. It is a white marble chest-tomb by Richard Westmacott and has draped mantle, shield and coronet with lifesize angel seated alongside. Bells The tower has a ring of six bells. The second and third bells were cast in about 1595 by a member of the Watts family of bellfounders of Leicester. The fifth bell was cast by an unknown founder in about 1599. The tenor was cast in 1619 by Hugh II Watts of Leicester. The fourth bell was recast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1884. The tower had a ring of five bells until the present treble bell was added in 1896, cast by John Taylor & Co. The organ Organ The church had a pipe organ by Forster and Andrews installed in 1861. A specification of the organ can be found on the British Institute of Organ Studies National Pipe Organ Register at K00608. This organ has since been transferred to Warmington Methodist Church, and then to St. Mark's parish church, White Hills. The current two-manual pipe organ is by Wordsworth and Maskell and dates from around 1900. A specification of the organ can be found on the British Institute of Organ Studies National Pipe Organ Register at D02178. Churchyard The gravestones in the churchyard are mostly of the 18th and 19th centuries. A decorative coffin lid that dates from the 15th century survives by the wall of the South Chapel. At the east end of the church are a series of memorial graves of the Stopford Sackville family, who have lived in Drayton House since the late 18th century.

It was released in a shortened version in the US as Man About Town (see below). The film marked Clair's return to working in France after twelve years abroad in Britain and the USA.

(New York: Orion Press, 1970). p.8.) and much of the action takes place in a silent film studio. √âmile, a director, advises his shy young employee Jacques to adopt his own carefree attitude towards women (\\"one lost, ten found\\"). √âmile takes under his wing Madeleine, the daughter of his old friend C√©lestin, when she arrives from the country; he offers her a place to stay and a job at his studio, and he starts to fall in love with her. When Jacques returns from military service, he and Madeleine are drawn to each other but they feel guilty about betraying the fatherly √âmile. √âmile finally realises the truth and decides that he must not stand in the young couple's way.

(London: Octopus Books, 1982). p.224. Clair chose as the background for his story the very early days of silent film-making. In his introduction to the published screenplay he wrote, \\"Without doubt some memories of youth have given birth to the comedy that follows. The action of this film takes place during the heroic period of French cinema. The advent of this industry does not form the subject of our story. It is, at the very most, only the background for the action. The author, who has a moderate taste for exceptional subjects, thinks, in effect, that making a film consecrated to the cinema is as dangerous as writing a play the heroes of which are comedians or a novel the main character of which is a novelist. It would be fortunate, however, if the reader understood that, by prompting remembrances of the artisans who, between 1900 and 1910, gave birth, in France, to the first cinema industry in the world, their pupil wanted to render homage to their memory.\\"Ren√© Clair. Introduction to \\"Le Silence est d'or\\", in Four Screenplays; translated from the French by Piergiuseppe Bozzetti. (New York: Orion Press, 1970). pp.5-6..

Review in The New York Times, 22 October 1947. but after his unexpected death in 1946 it was taken on by Maurice Chevalier, who was making his first film for seven years. =American version= For the release of the film in the United States under the title Man About Town, Clair experimented with an 'English-language' version which did not use either subtitles or dubbing. Working with the American screenwriter Robert Pirosh, he produced a running English commentary on the action and the dialogue which was spoken on the soundtrack by Maurice Chevalier during the pauses in the French dialogue. The effect was supposed to be that of sitting next to a friend who explained what was being said when necessary, but in the event audiences were put off by finding the same voice/character feature both within the action on-screen as well as commenting on it off-screen, which seemed to diminish credibility. For this version, an additional musical scene was filmed in which Maurice Chevalier sang \\"Place Pigalle\\". The American version was however shortened to a running time of 89 minutes (compared with 106 minutes for the original French version). When the film was shown in London in 1948, it appeared under its original French title and was subtitled; the running time was however recorded as 99 minutes.Monthly Film Bulletin, August 1948. pp.119-120. Reception In France Le Silence est d'or was welcomed for marking not just the return of Clair to France but his resumption of the preoccupations and the wit and elegance of his pre-war films.Georges Sadoul. Le Cin√©ma fran√ßais (1890-1962). (Paris: Flammarion, 1962). pp.106-107.Raymond Chirat. La IVe R√©publique et ses films. (Renans: 5 Continents, 1985). p.34. In the UK the film received some qualified enthusiasm, alongside a feeling that it did not represent Clair at his best. For example: \\"...film and audience most enjoy themselves when the action is confined to the studio with sets and all the parphernalia of primitive film- making perpetually collapsing and a quartet of hands, strayed from some Gallic crazy gang, eternally playing cards... This is not a major film of Clair's, but it is an authentic one...\\";Review in The Times, 9 August 1948, p.7. \\"This film is absolutely enchanting.... There is some wonderful slapstick.... It must be admitted that this is not the best work of Ren√© Clair, and because of this many may be disappointed with the occasionally flagging dialogue and slowing up of the tempo\\". In the USA the film did poor business with the public, possibly hampered by the experiment with a hybrid-language version. The critic of The New York Times said, \\"He has treated a rather small idea in a small and generally unimaginative way, and the only faint touch of irony in it is a typical 'happy ending,' well contrived.\\" Clair himself, while retaining an affection for the film, admitted to some shortcomings, particularly in respect of a certain heaviness in the exposition of the opening scenes. For the resolution of the story, he felt that he had not satisfied the maxim that \\"the public must always be surprised by what it expects\\". He also expressed reservations about the prominence of dialogue especially in a film which both characters and setting explored the virtues of silence: \\"I am convinced that in a work for the cinema the dialogue should have no more importance than it has in a novel, and that it is always more worthwhile to express oneself with images than with words.\\"Ren√© Clair.

Biography Gagnier was born in Paris about 1670, and educated at the College of Navarre. His tutor, Le Bossu, showed him a copy of Brian Walton's ‚ÄòPolyglott Bible‚Äô. This led him to master Hebrew and Arabic. After taking orders he was made a canon regular of the Abbey of St. Genevieve. Finding the life irksome, he retired to England, and ultimately became an Anglican clergyman. In 1703 he was created M.A. at Cambridge by royal mandate. William Lloyd, appointed him his domestic chaplain and introduced him at Oxford. Gagnier subsequently settled at Oxford, and taught Hebrew. In 1717 he was appointed by the vice-chancellor to read the Arabic lecture at Oxford in the absence of the professor, John Wallis. The Lord Almoner's Professorship of Arabic at Oxford was conferred on Gagnier in 1724. Death Gagnier died on 2 March 1740. He left a son, John, born in 1721, who died on 27 January 1796, aged 75. Bibliography In 1706 he was enabled through Lloyd's liberality to publish in quarto an edition of the fictitious Joseph ben Gorion's ‚ÄòHistory of the Jews,‚Äô in the original Hebrew, with a Latin translation and notes. In 1707 he published at the Hague ‚ÄòL'√âglise Romaine convaincue de d√©pravation, d'idolatrie, et d'antichristianisme.‚Äô In 1710, at the insistence of Sharp, archbishop of York, he assisted John Ernest Grabe in studying the Arabic manuscripts in the Bodleian Library relating to the Clementine constitutions, on which Sharp had engaged Grabe to write a treatise against William Whiston. In 1718 his ‚ÄòVindici√¶ Kircherian√¶, sive Animadversiones in novas Abrahami Trommii Concordantias Gr√¶cas versionis vulgo dict√¶ LXX.

In 1723 he issued in folio Ab≈´ Al-FidƒÅ's ‚ÄòLife of Mahomet,‚Äô in Arabic, with a Latin translation and notes, dedicated to an early patron, Lord Macclesfield. He prepared an edition of Ab≈´ Al-FidƒÅ's ‚ÄòGeography,‚Äô and in 1726 or 1727 printed as a specimen seventy-two folio leaves, but was unable to proceed, lacking support. The fragment was noticed in the Journal des Savants for 1727. For the benefit of those who were unable to read his Latin translation of Ab≈´ Al-FidƒÅ's ‚ÄòMahomet,‚Äô he compiled a ‚ÄòLife‚Äô in French, which was published in two volumes by Jean Le Clerc at Amsterdam in 1732. A later edition in three volumes appeared at Amsterdam in 1748; and a German translation in two volumes at was published at K√∂then in 1802‚Äì4.

Gahagan belonged to a good family of Westmeath, Ireland; was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, but took no degree, and then proceeded to study for the Irish bar. His parents had brought him up as a Protestant, but he was converted in youth to Roman Catholicism, and was thus prevented from being called to the bar. He soon married a rich heiress, whom he treated very cruelly, and a separation followed. His relatives were alienated by his conduct, and he came to London, where he tried to make a livelihood out of his classical scholarship. He edited in Brindley's beautiful edition of the classics the works of Horace, Cornelius Nepos, Sallust, Juvenal, Persius, Virgil, and Terence, all published in 1744; Quintus Curtius Rufus in 1746; Catullus, Propertius, and Tibullus, issued in 1749. He also translated into good Latin verse Pope's ‚ÄòEssay on Criticism‚Äô (‚ÄòTentamen de re critica‚Äô), which appeared in 1747 with a Latin dedication to the Earl of Chesterfield, and a poem descriptive of the earl's recent reception in Dublin as lord-lieutenant. Gahagan fell into very bad company in London. A compatriot, Hugh Coffey, suggested to him a plan for making money by filing coins or ‚Äòdiminishing the current coin of the realm.‚Äô Another Irishman, of some education, Terence Connor, who is variously described as Gahagan's servant or lodger, was introduced into at the end of 1748. Coffey turned informer, and Gahagan and Connor were arrested in a public-house at Chalk Farm early in January 1748‚Äì9. The trial took place at the Old Bailey on Monday, 16 Jan. 1748‚Äì9, and both were convicted on Coffey's evidence. While awaiting execution in Newgate, Gahagan translated Pope's ‚ÄòMessiah‚Äô and ‚ÄòTemple of Fame‚Äô into Latin verse, and this was published immediately (1749), with a dedication to the Duke of Newcastle, praying for pardon. Gahagan also addressed Prince George to the same effect in English verse, while Connor wrote a poetic appeal in English to the Duchess of Queensberry. These effusions are printed in the ‚ÄòNewgate Calendar.‚Äô But all efforts failed, and the young men were hanged at Tyburn on Monday, 20 Feb. 1748‚Äì9. Some verses lamenting Gahagan's fate are quoted in the ‚ÄòNewgate Calendar.‚Äô In the preface to the collected edition of Christopher Smart's poems, ‚Äòunfortunate Gahagan‚Äô is described as Smart's immediate predecessor in the successful writing of Latin verse.

Gainsford belonged to the Surrey family of Gainsford. He inherited property in Lombard Street in the City of London. He and Edward Stene apparently purchased of the crown Alne manor, Warwickshire, and a cottage in Stutton, Yorkshire, on 27 November 1599 (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1598‚Äì1601, p. 347). He is known to have served in Ireland under Richard de Burgh, fourth earl of Clanricarde, as \\"third officer\\" of the \\"earl's regiment\\" when the Spaniards were dislodged from Kinsale on 24 December 1601. He was also engaged in the war against Tyrone in Ulster. As captain, Gainsford undertook to occupy land in Ulster at the plantation of 1610 (Irish State Papers, 1608‚Äì10, p. 367). Gainsford is reputed to have been the first London periodical news editor. Ben Jonson, associating the source of these publications with the stationer Thomas Archer's bookshop in Pope's Head Alley between the Exchange and Lombard Street, referred to his work as 'Captaine Pamphlet's horse and foot that sally Upon the Exchange at Pope's Head AlleyM. Eccles, \\"Thomas Gainsford, 'Captain Pamphlet'\\", Huntington Library Quarterly, 45 (1982), 259‚Äì63; B. Jonson, 'Execration upon Vulcan', 1623 or 24, in Ben Jonson: The Man and His Work, ed. C. H. Herford and P. Simpson (Oxford, 1925/1954), 2, 174. Gainsford became associated with the publications of the news syndicate formed in 1622 by Nathaniel Butter, Thomas Archer, Nicholas Bourne, William Sheffard and Bartholomew Downes and was responsible for taking control of the style, organization and presentation of the news. He helped readers to understand news from many cities, armies and battle scenes that could otherwise have been confusing to those unfamiliar with European dynasties and armies but concerned by news of catholic advances in the Counter Reformation. In this way he played a part in educating them about military affairs and the progress of the Thirty Years' War.J. E, E. Boys, London's News Press and the Thirty Years War (Woodbridge and Rochester, NY., 2011), 127-142, 159-161, 171-5 He also wrote many editorials 'To the Reader', establishing a relationship with readers and addressing them and their anxieties directly.N. Brownlees, 'Spoken discourse in Early English Newspapers', in News Networks in Seventeenth Century Britain and Europe, ed/ J. Raymond (London and New York, 2006), 69-74. On 4 September 1624 Chamberlain wrote to Carleton that the deaths of the week in London included \\"Captain Gainsford, the gazette maker\\"Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1623‚Äì5, 334 'Chamberlain', vol. 2, 579, Chamberlain to Dudley Carleton, 4 September. Other editors were employed by the London newspapers, including William Watts who is credited with editing The Swedish Intelligencer in the early 1630s, but none achieved the same level of notoriety and interest. Known works Gainsford published the following: * The Vision and Discourse of Henry the seventh concerning the unitie of Great Britaine, London, by G. Eld for Henry Fetherstone, 1610, in verse of six-line stanzas; dedicated to \\"the truly religious and resolute gentlemen of England\\". An address from Henry VII to James I figures in the poem. Only two copies are now known, one at Bridgewater House, the other at the British Museum (Collier, Bibliogr. Manual, i. 300‚Äì1; Corser, Collectanea, vol. vi.). * The Historie of Trebizond in foure books, by Thomas Gainsforde, esquier, Lond., 1616, a collection of romantic stories. The books are separately dedicated to the Countess Dowager of Derby, the Countess of Huntingdon, Lady Frances Egerton, and Lady Chandos respectively. * The Secretaries Studie; or directions for the ‚Ä¶ judicious inditing of Letters, London, 1616; no copy is in the British Museum. * The True and Wonderfull History of Perkin Warbeck, London, 1618, dedicated to the Earl of Arundel; reprinted in The Harleian Miscellany, vol. iii. * The Glory of England, or a true Description of many excellent Prerogatives and remarkable Blessings whereby she triumpheth over all the Nations of the World, London, 1618, dedicated to Buckingham. All \\"the eminent kingdoms of the earth\\" are here compared with England to their disadvantage. A curious account of Ireland from the author's own experience concludes book i. Book ii. treats of Russia, and compares London with Paris, Venice, and Constantinople. A revised edition appeared in 1619, and was reissued in 1620. * The True Exemplary and Remarkable History of the Earl of Tirone, London, 1619, dedicated to the Earl of Clanricarde; of no great value, but interesting as a nearly contemporary record. Works attributed to Gainsford Mr. W. C. Hazlitt also conjecturally assigns to Gainsford The Rich Cabinet furnished with varietie of excellent discriptions, exquisite characters, witty discourses and delightfull histories, deuine and morrall, London, for Roger Iackson, 1616. An appendix‚Äî\\"an epitome of good manners extracted out of the treatise of M. Iohn della Casa called Galatea\\"‚Äîis signed T. G., together with a Latin motto. This signature resembles those in Gainsford's undoubted books, but the question of authorship is very doubtful. Some hostile remarks on players, ff. 116‚Äì18, are interesting. The book was popular; a fourth edition is dated 1668, and a sixth 1689. The Friers Chronicle, or the True Legend of Priests and Monkes Lives (Lond., for Robert Mylbourne, 1623), has a dedication to the Countess of Devonshire, signed T. G., and has been attributed to Gainsford. But Thomas Goad (1576‚Äì1638) is more probably the author.

One day, when he is coming back to his village on a vacation with his bosom friend Deepak, a car accident changes his life dramatically. Deepak, who is driving the car, happens to run over a villager, Shankar, who subsequently succumbs to his injuries. Arjun, however, insists on taking the blame on himself and surrenders to the police. Even as he does this, he is aware that by doing so, he is not merely distancing himself from his dreams but also from his beloved Rajni (Sharbani Mukherjee). In his darkest hour, SP Kunal Singh (Ajay Devgan) enters his life like sunlight and obtains his conditional freedom. What also draws Arjun and Kunal close to each other is their distaste for the activities of the village bully, Veer Mongia. Kunal inspires Arjun to fight Veer Mongia in the village election.

Smith made his first film in 1917, Our Friends, the Hayseeds. He went on to become one of the most prolific and popular Australian filmmakers of the silent era. Among his films were adaptations of the works of Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson. His 1933 comedy The Hayseeds featured the first screen appearance of Cecil Kellaway. Smith was famous for making his films quickly ‚Äì sometimes he would complete shooting and post production within one month for budgets ranging from ¬£600 to ¬£1,200. His wife Elsie would comment on his scripts and his brother Gordon looked after company finances. He was sometimes known as \\"One Shot Beau\\" or \\"That'll Do Beau\\".Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years, Currency Press, 1989 p 50-51. Biography =Early life= Smith was born in Hallett, South Australia, named after a popular single at the time, Armes Beaumont. He was educated at East Adelaide Public School. Smith won writing competitions as a teenager. He first worked as a journalist, writing for The Critic and The Register. When he was around 19 he established a small newspaper, Seaside Topics in the Victor Harbor region, which had a short run. Smith then helped C. J. Dennis found The Gadfly, which ran for several years. Smith moved from Adelaide to Sydney in 1907 to work for The Bulletin. He also worked at Lone Hand. He was secretary to Fordyce Wheeler and worked as advertising manager for The Bulletin as well as writing for it. =Theatre Work= Smith moved into theatre, becoming secretary for theatrical entrepreneur William Anderson. He also worked as press secretary for Anderson's representative. He toured Europe in 1909 and 1911. During the latter visit he arranged for a European troupe of midgets, \\"Tiny Town\\", to tour Australia. It was enormously successful, making a profit of 425%. Smith later toured the show in South Africa, where it was a success, and Canada, where it flopped due to opposition from existing circuses. He also toured a show by suffragette Muriel Matters which was not a success because the main market, suffragettes, could see her at women's clubs for free. Smith tried playwriting, working on an adaptation of On Our Selection by Steele Rudd. He wrote the first act on his own and then collaborated with Rudd. The play was eventually rewritten by Bert Bailey to great success. In 1914 he went into theatre management. He toured the plays Mr Wu (1914), The Barrier by Rex Beach, No Mother to Guide Her, A Girl's Cross Roads, The Glad Eye. He was a fan of the works of Henry Lawson and adapted several of his stories for stage and film including While the Billy Boils. He adapted Seven Little Australians into a play and toured it in 1914-15. He also wrote a play with Edward Dyson, Two Battlers and a Bear and a review Stop Your Nonsense. =Film career= Our Friends, the Hayseeds (1917) was shot in South Australia. Many of the cast had appeared in Beaumont Smith's theatrical productions of While the Billy Boils and Seven Little Australians. Smith followed it with The Hayseeds Come to Sydney (1917), shot in Sydney, The Hayseeds' Back-blocks Show (1917), shot in Brisbane, and The Hayseeds' Melbourne Cup (1918), filmed in Melbourne. Smith's first non-Hayseed film was a wartime melodrama, Satan in Sydney (1918). He followed it with Desert Gold (1919), a race horse story, and the comedy Barry Butts In (1919) starring Barry Lupino. In May 1919 he stopped producing films until better terms for exhibiting them could be found. He recommenced production in October. He spent a number of months in Hollywood, then returned to Australia to make The Man from Snowy River (1920). Smith travelled to New Zealand to make the inter- racial romance The Betrayer (1921), then back in Australia did While the Billy Boils (1921), adapted from the stories of Henry Lawson (which Smith had previously adapted for the stage). He made a bushranging drama The Gentleman Bushranger (1922), then returned to Hayseed comedies with Townies and Hayseeds (1923) and Prehistoric Hayseeds (1923). Smith made two films starring Arthur Tauchert, The Digger Earl (1924) and Joe (1924). Then he did two comedies starring Claude Dampier, Hullo Marmaduke (1925) and The Adventures of Algy (1925). =J C Williamsons= Shrinking profits led to Smith retiring from film-making in 1925. He moved to New Zealand and became managing director of Williamson Films (New Zealand) Ltd (later J. C. Williamson Picture Corporation Ltd), Wellington. =Return to Filmmaking= Smith returned to filmmaking to make The Hayseeds (1933), giving Cecil Kellaway his first lead in a film, and Splendid Fellows (1934). He went back to Williamsons but eventually he and his wife sold out their interests in 1937 for ¬£15,000 with an additional ¬£7,000. He retired to Killara, Sydney in 1938. Personal life Smith was married to Elsie Fleming from 1911, until his death. She was often an uncredited contributor with his work, helping him write scripts. His brother Gordon managed his finances.Shirley, Graham, 'Smith, Frank Beaumont (Beau) (1885‚Äì1950)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 17 January 2012. = Death = Smith died on 2 January 1950 in Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards. He was survived by his wife Elsie, he was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium. Legacy The National Library of Australia tracked down a collection of 300 reels of Smith's films, including all his features. However, when the researchers arrived to collect it they were told that the entire collection had been burnt within the previous weeks, on the advice of an insurance company because of the film's inflammable nature.

Early life Richard Dennis was born in West Ham, Essex, the son of a local butcher. During World War One he served with the Royal Flying Corps. After the war he joined London‚Äôs Metropolitan Police rising to the rank of Detective Sergeant, stationed at Paddington, West London. He was married twice and had one son, Richard Junior. British Municipal Police, Tientsin In 1934 Dennis applied to work for the British Municipal Police in the British Concession of the Tientsin (Tianjin) treaty port. He was given the job following a reference from Lord Trenchard, Marshall of the Royal Air Force and Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Dennis was appointed Chief Inspector of Police with the British Municipal Council, Tientsin arriving to take up his duties in July 1934 with the new rank of DCI. During his time as chief of the Tientsin police Dennis investigated the infamous Pamela Werner murder in January 1937 in Beijing. The murder was to be both sensational and revelatory of a number of scandals in Beijing and Tianjin at the time. The murder and Dennis‚Äôs investigation are featured in the book Midnight in Peking by Paul French. Dennis was also a central figure in the so-called Tientsin Incident of June 1939 after the manager of the Japanese-owned Federal Reserve Bank of North China was assassinated by Chinese nationalists at Tientsin‚Äôs Grand Theatre in the city‚Äôs British Concession. The killers were thought to be hiding out in the British Concession, and the area was surrounded by the Japanese army. The British authorities refused to hand the accused over, the Japanese blockaded the British section. Eventually the Tientisin police were ordered by Sir Robert Craigie, Britain‚Äôs Ambassador in Tokyo, to hand over the accused men. DCI Dennis as the senior policeman in Tientsin performed this duty. The Chinese men were all executed by the Japanese on the same day. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, on December 8 Dennis was arrested at his home by Japanese soldiers and taken to the Victoria Road Police Station and then placed under house arrest and told to report daily to the Japanese. On December 20 he was formally stripped of his uniform and then told that his services had been terminated and he was to remain under house arrest. On May 4, 1942, Dennis was arrested once again and this time imprisoned at Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters for the next 94 days in solitary confinement. Dennis was accused of espionage and forced to sign a confession ‚Äì in Japanese - that was never translated to him. Eventually, in early August, the Swiss Consul in Tientsin managed to secure Dennis‚Äôs release and repatriation. In a greatly weakened state he was taken to Shanghai and put aboard an overcrowded evacuation ship (the Kamakura Maru)personal papers of H G Mende, Reuters correspondent to Tientsin - Public Record Office, Kew to Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese East Africa. From there he was eventually transferred to another ship bound for London. Post-War Life In London Dennis was assigned to work for the Ministry of Food. Dennis was assigned to the United Nations War Crimes Commission International Military Tribunal for the Far East and sent back to Asia to work on the trials of senior Japanese military personnel, a list that included those who had imprisoned him in Tientsin. Dennis returned again to England after the tribunals. He divorced and married a third time, ran a hotel in West London called The Dennis that had an active bridge club, ran several pubs in the area and was regularly to be seen propping up the bar at the Chepstow Arms near Notting Hill Gate.

Suutei tsai (, , ) (literally \\"tea with milk\\") is a traditional Mongolian beverage. The name suutei tsai in Mongolian means milk tea. The drink is also known as s√º√ºtei tsai, tsutai tsai, or Mongolian salty tea.Mongolia, by Michael Kohn, 2008, page 43 ‚Äús√º√º (milk) may be cow, sheep, or goat milk.... Mongolian tea (tsai in Mongolian; shay in Kazakh)\\" Preparation The ingredients to suutei tsai are typically water, milk, tea leaves and salt. A simple recipe might call for one quart of water, one quart of milk, a tablespoon of green tea, and one teaspoon of salt. But the ingredients often vary. Some recipes use green tea while others use black tea. Some recipes even include butter or fat. Milk in Mongolia is typically fresh, whole milk, and using half milk and half cream instead of only processed milk produces a rich beverage close to the authentic. The amount of salt in the tea is also often varied. Another common addition to suutei tsai is fried millet.The ethnomusicologists‚Äô cookbook: complete meals from around the world, Sean Williams, 2006, page 58The National Geographic magazine, Volume 24, Issues 1-6, National Geographic Society (US), 1913, page 669 The way of preparing the drink can also vary. The traditional way of cooking it includes stirring it by scooping it up while it is boiling and pouring it back in from a height. However, many today omit this step.Mongolia, Guek-Cheng Pang, 2010, page 129 The tea that the Mongolians use for suutei tsai commonly comes from a block. The block consists of a lower quality of tea that is made up of stems or inferior tea leaves and is compressed into a block that can be easily stored. When needed, the tea is chipped off and added to the suutei tsai.The changing world of Mongolia‚Äôs nomads, Melvyn C. Goldstein, Cynthia M. Beall, 1994, page 43 History Milk continues to be a very important part of the Mongolian diet. The milk that Mongolians drink comes from many sources including cattle, camels, horses, yaks, goats, and sheep,page iii; viewed using Google quickview though milk from cattle is now the norm. An old tradition among many Mongols was to not drink water straight. This could have been a result of the Mongols‚Äô belief that water was sacred.the Mongols believed that bodies of water were like gods. (Mongols, by Galadriel Findlay Watson, 2005, page 6) At one time, the polluting of rivers or other flowing water was punishable by death. (Daily Life in the Mongol Empire, by George Lane, 2006, page 186) During the mid-thirteenth century, a Franciscan friar, William of Rubruck, set out to the Mongol Empire to make an account of the Mongols. In his account, Rubruck noted the Mongols‚Äô drinking habits with water, saying that the Mongols were ‚Äúmost careful not to drink pure water‚Äù.William of Rubruck‚Äôs account of the Mongols, by Rana Saad, 2005, page 19 In a land where juice and wine were not readily available, many Mongols opted to drink milk-based products like suutei tsai or airag (a type of milk alcohol made from fermented mares milk) instead of pure water. Popularity While many Mongolians enjoy suutei tsai, some Westerners have a hard time adjusting to its distinctive flavor. This is particularly because of the salt in the drink.With the Russians in Mongolia, by Henry George Charles Perry- Ayscough, Robert Bru√®re Otter-Barry, 1914, page 76Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws, by George Crane, 2006, 276 ‚ÄúSalty and weak, Mongol milk tea was an acquired taste I‚Äôd never acquired.‚Äù Suutei tsai is one of the most common drinks in Mongolia. It is often drunk at meals and throughout the day. It is usually served to guests when they arrive at a Mongolian home, known as a yurt or ger. Upon arriving, guests are usually served suutei tsai with a hospitality bowl filled with snacks.Teen life in Asia, by Judith J.

It is the best preserved house from this period in Paris.Blunt 1999, p. 93. Since 1969 it has been the home of the Biblioth√®que Historique de la Ville de Paris and its garden, H√¥tel-Lamoignon - Mark Ashton Garden, is opened to the public.  History and description  The lot of the h√¥tel is located outside the limits of medieval Paris, north of the wall of Philip Augustus. In the second quarter of the 16th century, under the influence of Francis I, the royal H√¥tel Saint-Pol and its gardens were divided into lots, and, after 1543, constructed upon. A vigorous movement of construction of h√¥tels particuliers and wealthy townhouses followed in the Saint-Paul quarter, which set up the Marais as the most favoured Parisian neighbourhood by the high nobility. = Construction by Diane de France = Diane de France, legitimised daughter of Henry II of France and his young mistress Filippa Duci, was created Duchess of Angoul√™me in 1582. Her new title brought with it considerable wealth, and, when in 1584 she inherited a large lot near the intersection of the rue des Francs-Bourgeois and the rue Pav√©e in the Marais district, she decided to use it as the location of her main urban residence.Surirey de Saint-Remy, Henry de (1969). \\"II. Une ancienne demeure seigneuriale : l'h√¥te d'Angoul√™me, puis de Lamoignon\\"Ayers 2004, p. 99. Construction of the H√¥tel d'Angoul√™me began in 1584, but was likely interrupted by the Wars of Religion, and only completed by a second phase of construction in 1611. Its architect is still uncertain: long attributed to Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau on stylistic grounds, an archival discovery of 1984 led some historians to name Louis M√©tezeau as the architect.Thomson 1984, p. 152; Ballon 1991, p. 43. It is now suggested that Louis' father, Thibault M√©tezeau, more likely designed it.Gady 2008, p. 180.Ayers says the architect is unknown (Ayers 2004, p. 99). Another hypothesis suggests Philibert Delorme built the h√¥tel a little earlier in the century.Leproux 2008, pp. 17‚Äì22. Guillaume (2014) however refutes this hypothesis, based on the location of the lot: Delorme may have built a different h√¥tel in the vicinity, but, according to the author, to the south of the H√¥tel d'Angoul√™me. Southern half of the courtyard facade with the south pavilion The house stood between its entrance courtyard to the west and its garden to the east, a layout reminiscent of a small ch√¢teau. The courtyard facade, richly ornamented and precisely designed, comprised a corps de logis four storeys in height with five bays and two end pavilions. It is the only part of the house to survive more or less at it was originally built. The h√¥tel was among the first in France to use Corinthian pilasters based on the writings of Vitruvius, translated in 1567, a few years before, by Daniele Barbaro.Gady 2008, p. 181. The use of the giant order for these pilasters, then an unusual feature for an h√¥tel particulier, aims to give the facade a majestic appearance, fitting and expressing the social dignity of its royal inhabitants. The design of the facade is highly Mannerist with the entablature broken from above by the lower part of the tall dormer windows and a Grecian motif connecting the capitals. The central bay, where the principal entrance was originally located, is surmounted by an open-bed pediment, and the curved pediments at the top of the pavilions are decorated with carved reliefs (heavily restored), which feature deer and hound heads, reflecting Diane de France's keen interest in the hunt. The appearance of the garden facade, preserved in an engraving after Claude Chastillon and an engraving by Isra√´l Silvestre, was then quite different from its current state: the entrance was served by a double Italian-style straight staircase facing a large parterre which stretched to the current rue de S√©vign√©; the facade also featured two pavilions on each side, and the same pilasters as the courtyard facade.

He commissioned architects Fran√ßois Boullet and Jean Thiriot to enlarge the h√¥tel, altering the original plan, between 1624 and 1640. A new wing north of the entrance courtyard was added, facing the rue des Francs- Bourgeois; a small watchtower cabinet, corbelled into the street corner wall, allowed the fidgety Charles d'Angoul√®me to spy on both streets. A bellicose commander during the troubled era of the Wars of Religion, Charles kept in the building a large number of weapons, carabins, muskets, using it as a military structure.

One of its tenants in the late 17th century was Guillaume de Lamoignon, President of the Parlement of Paris. He managed there to gather a small salon, frequented by Madame de S√©vign√©, Racine, Boileau, Bourdaloue, Regnard or Guy Patin. The h√¥tel remained among the Lamoignon family until 1750, this long- lasting occupation giving the building its current and usual name. As such, it was the birthplace of Malesherbes. After renting it for many years, , son of Guillaume, finally acquired the whole h√¥tel in 1688. Chr√©tien-Fran√ßois thereafter commissioned prominent royal architect Robert de Cotte to rearrange it. In 1708, De Cotte and his agency carried out several repairs, and built the current portal. He also planned a bold reconstruction, which included the displacement of the rue Pav√©e in front of the building to enlarge the courtyard, the construction of a new curved portal and a new wing, featuring a monumental staircase, instead of the previous main courtyard, and the modification of the garden facade. Two plans of the project have been retrieved from the papers of the agency and are still preserved at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.BnF, d√©partement Estampes et photographie, RESERVE HA-18 (C, 7)-FT 6 (fonds Robert de Cotte 211 et 331) The project would have completely changed the orientation of the h√¥tel , from north/south to east/west. This was not followed by any further major modifications, probably due to the death of Chr√©tien-Fran√ßois de Lamoignon in 1709. The current building is still close to its 17th-century arrangement, the courtyard being largely untouched. However, possibly in preparation for the fulfilment of the project, the garden facade was modified, its pediment, all its ornaments removed, the front steps moved (probably to fit the projected symmetry of the new building), the south forepart destroyed. This modification resulted in the austere, asymmetrical facade currently visible from the rue des Francs- Bourgeois and the public garden adjoined.

It was then rented by , prosecutor for the King and the city of Paris. Moriau, a bibliophile and scholar, used it to keep his large private library, which included a vast collection of preserved documents on the history of Paris. At his death in 1759, he bequeathed 14,000 volumes to the city, which, in 1763, opened the collection to the public. It is historically the first public municipal library of Paris. In 1774, the Lamoignon family sold the h√¥tel, which thereafter belonged to architect . = Period of decline after the French Revolution = After the French Revolution, like many of the Marais' h√¥tels particuliers, the building entered a progressive decrepitude. Divided into several tenuous residences, the building housed throughout the 19th century workshops, stores, and factories, among which was the headquarters of an alembic and distillation instruments company.The company belonged to Jules Salleron and bore his name. Jules Dujardin, Lucien Dujardin, Ren√© Dujardin, Notice sur les instruments de pr√©cision appliqu√©s √† l‚Äôoenologie, √† la Pomologie et √† la Brasserie, Paris, chez l'Auteur, 1864 The east part of the garden, including a pond, was built up. Among the many tenants was Alphonse Daudet, who lived in the h√¥tel with his family from 1867 onwards, and who invited over such friends as Tourgueniev, Flaubert or Edmond de Goncourt. = Becomes a recognised historic landmark = In 1872 and 1873, the idea emerged in the municipal council to buy and restore the building, to extend the nearby Carnavalet Museum. This was not realised until March 1928: the City of Paris acquired the h√¥tel in exchange, as compensation for the previous owner, of a larger vacant lot near the Porte de Champerret. Despite the initial project, the City decided to move its municipal historical library into the building, the Biblioth√®que Historique de la Ville de Paris, previously housed in the H√¥tel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau, allowing the latter to be annexed to the Carnavalet Museum. Between 1955 and 1968,The restoration project was set as early as in 1941, the occupation, the war and its consequences postponing it. the building was restored and extended to finally house the library. The heritage site architects, , Jean Creuzot and Andr√© Vois first strengthened the h√¥tel, which was in danger of collapsing, destroyed all the 19th-century additions in the courtyard and gardens,However, new construction was added to the east part of the garden, giving place to Hausmann-style buildings. and restored the h√¥tel to its early-modern appearance, including the interior and its painted panellings. From 1964 onwards, a new wing was added to the south, which serves as a conservation area for the growing archival collections. The new construction was deliberately kept simple and austere to highlight the original and restored Renaissance h√¥tel. Two more basement floors were also dug under the foundations.

She was the mother of Diane de France. Life Her father was Gian Antonio Duci. During the Italian Wars in 1537, the French dauphin Henry (later Henry II of France) stayed with a squire, Filippa's brother, Gian Antonio Duci. Henry was seduced by Filippa on first sight, and she became his mistress. When Henri heard Duci was pregnant, he arranged for her to be maintained until she gave birth. Duci gave birth to their daughter, Diane de France, in Paris in 1538. This proved that Henry was not sterile; he had been married to Catherine de M√©dicis, yet had still not produced an heir due to urological problems. The baby was named Diane after Henry's love, his mistress Diane de Poitiers, who raised the child along with her own two children. In 1541 Francis I of France granted Duci 400 'livres tournois' a year for life in an Ordinaire de Touraine and allowed her to retire to a convent. She married the Italian gentleman and privy councillor Jean Bernardin de Saint-Severin in 1546. After Diane was legitimized, Filippa was known as dame de Bl√©r√© en Touraine.

His work has been shown throughout East Africa, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Australia, and France, as well as in Denmark and Norway. He has been a lecturer at Makerere University since 1992. Kasule opened the Nagenda International Academy of Art and Design (NIAAD), a school of higher education in art, in 2006. Early life Kizito Maria was born on 1967 a rural village in Uganda. He was the youngest among 12 brothers and sisters. His parents owned a small family-run coffee plantation. At the age of 11 his father demanded that his son quit school and work in the family plantation instead. The young Kizito refused to quit his studies and in return was forced by his father to leave his home. The next few months Kizito lived as a street child, knocking on random doors and offering to work in return for food and shelter. Eventually he was picked by a local man and allowed to reside with him. The next couple of years Kizito spent studding in the morning and working in several coffee plantations at the afternoon in order to pay for his tuition and keep. In 1987 a civil war broke out in the north of Uganda. Two years later, at the age of 16, Kizito was arrested and sent to a military camp. He labored as a grave digger for fellow prisoners who were executed. One day, after finishing digging several graves, he and his cellmates were ordered to stand at the edge of the graves in front of a firing squad. The soldiers then started executing the prisoners one-by-one, sparing only Kizito's life due to the acquaintance between his dad and one of the camp's officers, who allowed Kizito's escape. He then escaped Uganda with a fake ID. He returned three years later and attended Makerere University in Kampala. In 1992 Kizito graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art. thumb Career In 1994 he held his first solo exhibition, which received positive reviews. In 2003 Kizito completed his PhD in art history from Makerere University and won a scholarship to Burren College of Art in Ireland. Kizito Maria is also a philanthropist and community activist. His main community project is the art college of NIAAD which educates teens and other young Ugandans. In 2009 NIAAD joined with the Israeli non-profit organization Brit Olam to create the \\"Muse Uganda\\" project. The project houses and educates disadvantaged youth from Uganda and enables them to join the NIAAD academy as regular students at a subsidized price.

Causes: Infectious Stunting Syndrome ‚Äî ISS ‚Äî Baby Chick Nephritis ‚Äî BCN. The virus has been reported in Japan, Europe, USA and New Zealand. The disease is mainly transmitted horizontally by the oro-faecal route, but rarely vertical transmission may occur. Clinical signs of the disease are normally only seen in chicks less than two weeks old, and these signs should be mild unless the chick is immunosuppressed. Clinical signs and diagnosis In mild cases diarrhea, stunted growth and skin lesions are the common clinical signs. Clinical signs are more severe in immunosuppressed, under-nourished or stressed chicks, with infection causing nephrosis, emaciation and even sudden death. On postmortem examination nephritis with accumulation of uric acid (gout) and enteritis are commonly present. A presumptive diagnosis may be based on clinical signs. For definitive diagnosis the virus or viral antigens must be demonstrated in the affected tissue(s). Diagnostic techniques used are virus neutralisation, ELISA, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Treatment and control There is currently no effective treatment for avian nephritis. Hygiene measures such as the use of an \\"all-in-all-out\\" policy and thorough disinfection of housing between batches should be employed to control disease. Adequate nutrition and a stress-free environment should decrease the amount of clinical disease seen in flocks.

They currently field a single junior football, two junior hurling and previously a ladies football team. At juvenile level they field at hurling only with teams at Under 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16. In Los Angeles there is a Gaelic football club who also go by the same name and at Lakenheath U.S. air force base there is a hurling club also called Wild Geese. History The club was established in 1888 by Patrick Archer making it one of the oldest in Dublin. Other GAA clubs in the surrounding area at the time would have been the Garristown Liberators and Magh go Bragh of Naul. The club in Oldtown was called Wild Geese to commemorate those Irish who had travelled abroad to serve in the militaries of other countries. Royal Irish Constabulary records show that the club had 40 members in 1889 and 1890 meeting in Oldtown and Ballyboghill. P. Mahon was secretary and treasurer at the time and E. Gorman was captain. Wild Geese were one of nineteen clubs represented at Charles Stewart Parnells funeral in 1891. In 1893 P. Sutton attended the Dublin county boards annual convention as the club's delegate on March 19. However in 1896 the club's name is missing from a list of those affiliated to the county board suggesting the club may have disbanded sometime between 1893-1896. In 1906 the nearest club to Oldtown was Naul but the club was affiliated along with Naul and Garristown in 1911 and again in 1915 and for the 1924-1925 season with the club disbanding once again. While absent from the field of play in 1931 the club was reformed by Father Lennon and played their games in a field owned by Jim Hughes. Players were from not just Oldtown but also Rolestown and Ballyboughal. The team captain was Stephen Griffin. They won the Feis Cup beating Donabate in the final. Some time after however a dispute arose those from Ballyboughal and the rest in the club with those from Ballyboughal deciding to leave and set up their own club. In order to see who would keep the set of jerseys both sides agreed to a game to resolve the issue with Wild Geese winning meaning they kept the jerseys which are the club's colours to this day, black and amber. However the club was to disband sometime shortly after and this the years to come a club was established in nearby Rolestown called Fingal Ravens. Patrick Archer reformed the club in 1935 but it disbanded again sometime before 1947 before regrouping again in a year where the GAA appeared to undergo something of a revival in the area with Fingal Ravens, Garristown and Man O‚ÄôWar also affiliating. Ballyboughal had won a Junior Football Championship in that year. However both Wild Geese and Fingal Ravens were finding it difficult to field and Fingal Ravens joined up with Wild Geese. The club disbanded some years after and in 1952 Fingal Rovers hurling club was established in Rolestown with many players having previously played with Wild Geese among their membership. Meeting were held in Hurley makers Owen and Tommie Butlers and they travelled to matches in their van. Fingal Rovers were runners up in the Fingal Hurling League, losing to Portrane but won a County special competition defeating Porton Docks in Islandbridge. Wild Geese reformed some years after and continued to compete on and off through the years. Club facilities The name Wild Geese made an appearance in ‚ÄòGaelic weekly‚Äô in 1954 where it was revealed the club had purchased a field and sown a crop of wheat. They had also plans to sow a crop of spring oats and it was hoped that this would make the ground easier to level and sow grass. Wild Geese played Ballyboughal on a challenge game at Damastown Sports in 1954 also with a picture of the team featuring in the Irish independent. Wild Geese were listed as one of eleven clubs who owned or leased their grounds in a special report by the county board. In 1968, the club started work on the first full size indoor handball alley in the country, this was completed in 1969, Oldtown subsequently produced a series of world champions. Although largely unused in recent years, the alley was refurbished in advance of its 50th birthday. In 2009 and 2010 the club refurbished their changing rooms, added a meeting room and public toilets, replaced pitch side fencing and upgraded their pitch. Gaelic football Since 1982 the club has fielded a single football team. In 1986 they were competing at the intermediate grade in the Fingal league and won the McArdle Cup in the same year. in 2007 they were relegated to Division 10. In 2008 they reached the Junior E Football Championship Final, losing out to Park Rangers. In 2009 they again made the final and defeated St. Brendan‚Äôs of Grangegorman. The club also enjoyed successive promotions in 2009 they were promoted from Division 10 North to Division 9. In 2010 they were promoted to Division 8. The club won the Sheridan Cup in 2007 and 2009. In 2010 they were defeated by Stars of Erin of Glencullen in the Junior D Football Championship. ;Football Roll of Honour * 2014 Promoted to Dublin AFL Div. 7 * 2010 Dublin Junior D Football Championship Runners Up * 2010 Promoted to Dublin AFL Div. 8 * 2009 Dublin Junior E Football Championship Winners * 2009 Dublin AFL Div. 10: Runners Up * 2008 Dublin Junior E Football Championship Runners Up * 2007, 2009 Sheridan Cup Winners * 1986 McArdle Cup Winners * 1931 Feis Cup Winners Hurling Hurling in Oldtown dates back to the 19th century. Founding member Patrick Archer found that the older people in the area were able to recall that hurling was a popular sport in Fingal up to around the 1820 and called camanacht, a word still used in Scotland describing their own native stick game, shinty. The decline of hurling coincides with the Tithe war, the O‚ÄôConnell campaign, the resulting decline in landlord-tenant relations and the farmers unwilling to lend their fields for games to be played as they at times ended in melees. Another influence was the Catholic Church who disapproved of the dances that took place after games. In 2008 Wild Geese set up a hurling team and entered into Division 7 of the 8 divisions at the time and the Junior E Championship. Members of the hurling team did not all play football with the club with some playing with Fingal Ravens, Garristown, Clann Mhuire, Ballyboughal. They failed to win a game that season and were relegated to Division 8. The following year was to be their most successful to date. Wild Geese won Division 8 defeating Setanta of Ballymun in the league final. They also took part in the Leinster hurling league and entered an Under 21 team into the hurling championship. They hosted the first ever Gus Warren Challenge Cup game against Erin go Bragh winning 2-9 to 2-5. Mattie Lambe was also selected for the Fingal hurling panel. In subsequent years Oriol Hally-Garcia, Dara O'Brien and Nathan McCaffrey have been selected for the Fingal hurling panel. Former Clare manager Ger Loughnane took the team for a training session. 2010 was to be another hard year for the club and for the 2012 season the club dropped from Division 7 to Division 9 and the Junior F Championship. Aidan Lenehan wrote a book called 'There is a F in Hurling' which was published in November 2012. The book was about the setting up of a hurling team in the club, the challenges and difficulties encountered and the highs and lows experienced since the team's inception in 2007. 2018 was a very successful year for the Wild Geese hurlers. Not only are they fielding several underage teams, they now have two adult hurling teams. As of 2019 they will be participating in AHL7 and AHL9 respectively. 2018 saw the 1st team win Division 8 and go unbeaten throughout the campaign. They also lost out in the Quarter Finals of the Championship to eventual winners St. Joseph's OCB, who on their day would have been a match for many senior teams. Former Fingal hurling manager Mick Kennedy came on board and offered the team additional coaching experience. ;Roll of Honour * 2018 Dublin Hurling League Division 8 Winners * 2016 Dublin Junior E Hurling Championship Runners up * 2009 Dublin Hurling League Division 8 Winners * 2009 Gus Warren Challenge Cup Winners Juvenile section Wild Geese set up a hurling juvenile section in 2008 with Under 9, 10 and 11 teams.

These photos can be displayed as an interactive animation on web pages and apps, allowing a user to control the rotation of an object. The photos can also be displayed as an infinitely looping GIF or video. 360 photography is used primarily by ecommerce websites, to give shoppers a more realistic impression of a product than static images. The use of interactive 360 spins has been linked to an increase in sales conversions and lower returns of unwanted goods. Types of 360 spin There are 3 types of 360 photography spin: single-row spins, multi-row spins and twin-axis spins. Single-row spins are the most commonly used type of 360 spin because they are the easiest to create. One row of photos is usually sufficient to give a lifelike impression of an object. These spins can be moved left and right only. They are often composed of 36 images (each separated by 10 degrees), though any number of images can be used. More frames per rotation will feel smoother; fewer frames will feel more jumpy. While the cost of 360 photography falls, spins with 72 or more frames are becoming more commonplace, for their smoother, sophisticated experience. Multi-row spins (also known as 3D spins) can be rotated up and down as well as left and right. They usually have 3 or 4 rows of photos, with 12 or 18 images per row. Each row is photographed at a different camera angle, allowing the product to be viewed from multiple perspectives. Multi-row spins require more time and effort to photograph, so they are suited to products that benefit from being viewed from above. Capture Photographers typically capture 360 photography in a photography studio by using a turntable, camera, tripod, lights and a white background. To obtain a pure white background, a white lightbox or light tent can be used to help light the object evenly, though these can flatten the image, so some photographers use a white sheet or white card in the background. Turntables used by 360 product photographers are usually powered, for automatic, precision rotation. A product is placed in the centre of the turntable and a camera, typically mounted on a tripod, captures photos of the product as the turntable rotates. Some turntables pause the rotation when each photo is captured, ensuring a sharp image. Basic turntables rotate continuously, which can cause slightly blurred photos but are suitable for capturing video, which can later be converted to a 360 spin. Some turntables can be connected by USB cable to computer and/or camera, allowing remote shutter release or USB to capture the images. Such automation speeds up the photography process, which is an important consideration when hundreds or thousands of products are to be photographed. Further automation can be achieved by employing robotic arms to move the camera up and over an object, to quickly capture multi-row spins. Robotic equipment is typically employed by specialist 360 photography studios, enabling them to capture high quality photos in rapidly. Such equipment has helped reduce the cost of 360 photography to approximately 20-40 USD per product for simple products such as shoes, when photographed in large batches. Prices are higher for reflective objects, large objects and garments worn on a model or mannequin. All-in-one lightbox machines are a simpler method for capturing spins. These machines have an automated rotating turntable with lighting all around and above. They connect to a camera and computer, for automated capture. Amateur photographers can capture 360 spins on a low budget by using a simple lazy susan instead of a powered turntable. The photographer can manually rotate the turntable between each frame. This is a slow process, thus impractical for large volume of making it an uncommon method of capturing 360 spins. The final method of creating 360 degree spins is by using 3D CAD modelling software. A product model can be constructed by a skilled 3D model designer, then rendered as a series of static JPEG/PNG images ready for use. Editing Once all the images for a complete rotation have been captured, they normally require refinement in a photo-editing program with batch editing capability. The typical edits required are to crop closer to the object edge, mask out any background objects, adjust the colour balance to match the products true colour and adjust colour levels to whiten the background. Most ecommerce sites wish to display 360 spins against a pure white background, which is not usually achieved direct from the camera. Batch editing can be applied in dedicated 360 photo software or in common photo editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom. If adjusting colour levels and colour balance is insufficient in obtaining a pure white background, background removal may be required, either with an automated tool or by manual masking by a human editor. Professional photo retouching services are often employed for this manual work. Publication To display images as an interactive spin on a web page, a JavaScript image viewer is required. The JavaScript works by displaying one image after another, giving the feeling of the object rotating. The user can drag the image left/right (or up/down) as if moving a real object. JavaScript image viewers are either part of a hosted 360 image service or a standalone script. Hosted services work by uploading images to the service, from where they are served with the scripts. Upon upload, hosted services automatically create the spin, resize and optimise the images for fast loading. Image optimisation is of particular importance for 360 spin because the total file size of 36 or more images is considerable. Hosted services reduce file size and often deliver the images from a CDN, helping the spin to download quickly. Hosted 360 services can also serve spins as GIFs or videos, which are suitable for embedding spins in social media and other websites where JavaScript is not permitted. Standalone scripts are installed on a web server, with some basic configuration. Images should be resized and optimized either before upload or on the server by an image processing service. Some ecommerce sites automatically resize and optimize images on upload, which can accelerate the configuration process. If using an ecommerce platform there are plugins to make it faster to configure and embed 360 spin scripts in product pages.

History Apley Castle was a moated, fortified manor house in Hadley near Wellington.Mackenzie, p.125. By the early 14th century the manor was owned by the Charlton family, who had become major landowners in the region, and in 1327 Sir Alan Charlton received a licence to crenellate the manor house.Emery, p.507. The building work occurred shortly afterwards, producing a square building set around a central courtyard.Emery, p.507. Charlton's descendants expanded the castle considerably into an Elizabethan mansion during the late 16th and early 17th century, using grey ashlar stone.Emery, pp.506-7. In 1642 the castle passed by marriage to Thomas Hanmer, who married Francis Charlton.Emery, p.507. With the outbreak of the English Civil War that year between the supporters of King Charles and Parliament, Hanmer, a royalist, fortified the mansion, which formed a valuable strategic stronghold close to Shrewsbury.Emery, p.507; Mackenzie, p.125. Encouraged by Francis Charlton's younger brother, the castle was sacked by Parliamentary forces during the war: ¬£1,500 of damage was done and the lead from the roof was stolen for use at Shrewsbury Castle.Emery, p.507; Mackenzie, p.125. A second mansion, also called Apley Castle, was subsequently built between 1791 and 1794 for the Charltons, and the repaired first castle was reused as the stableblock for this building.Emery, p.507. This building was demolished in 1955, and the stables fell into disrepair.Emery, pp.507-8. In 1996, the stables, including their medieval elements, were renovated and turned into a private house.Apley Castle Park , Apley Preservation Association, accessed 17 August 2011.

Background Belmez was a medium-sized, strongly- built bay colt, with a prominent white stripe and a white sock on his off-fore leg. He was bred by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud in the US, a product of the second crop of foals sired by El Gran Senor. He was trained throughout his career by Henry Cecil and ridden in most of his starts by Steve Cauthen. Racing career Belmez began his racing career with an upset, winning the Carlsberg Stakes at Newmarket in November 1989 as an unconsidered 50-1 outsider. By the time he re-appeared as a three-year-old in the Burghclere Stakes in April 1990, his reputation preceded him, and he won \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths at odds of 4‚Äì5. Belmez was then moved up in class for the Chester Vase and defeated Quest for Fame by a length to become favourite for the Derby. An injury ruled Belmez out of the Derby which was won easily by Quest For Fame. Belmez returned with a third place to the filly Salsabil in the Irish Derby (with Quest For Fame fifth) and was then aimed at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Steve Cauthen, who had ridden Belmez in his previous four races chose to partner Old Vic, with the ride on Belmez going to Mick Kinane. Such was the quality of the entry, that Belmez was the only three-year-old in the field, but he produced a career-best effort, moving up to contest the lead early in the straight and prevailing by a neck from his stablemate Old Vic, with top-class performers like Assatis, Cacoethes, In The Wings, Sapience, Terimon and Legal Case among the also-rans. A month later Belmez won the Great Voltigeur Stakes, getting up on the line to beat the future St Leger winner Snurge by a short-head. He finished fifth behind Saumarez in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and seventh behind Better Loosen Up in the Japan Cup before being retired to stud. Assessment Belmez was given a rating of 132 by the Racing Post. Stud career Belmez was retired initially to stand at the Queens stud in Norfolk, England but was later transferred to Haras du Pin in Normandy. He made little impact as a stallion, but he did sire one important winner in Caramba, winner of the Falmouth Stakes and Nassau Stakes. He is the damsire of the Racing Post Trophy winner Kingsbarns.

Sambalpuri dance is most popular dance of western Odisha.  Laudi Khela  Laudi Khela, also known as Gauda Nacha is a martial dance practiced in some coastal districts of Odisha, including Cuttack, Jajapur, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda, Bhadrak, Baleswar, Dhenkanal, and Angul. Traditionally, the performers are young boys of the 'Gauda' or 'Gopal' (Yadav) castes. This dance is performed during Dola Purnima (Holi). The dance is dedicated to Krishna and his consort Radha. The dancers wear clothes associated with Krishna, ghagudi (small bells as girdles), and peacock feathers. Each dancer carries two sticks, striking each other's sticks in a rhythmical manner. Singha (buffalo's horn) and flute usually accompany the dance.  Other folk dances  Ghumura Dance (or Ghumra Dance) is one of the most sought and leading folk dance form in Odisha. It is classified as folk dance as the dress code of Ghumura resembles more like a tribal dance, but recent researchers argue different mudra and dance form present in Ghumura bear more resemblance with other classical dance form of India. The timeline of Ghumura dance is not clear. Many researchers claim it was a War dance in ancient India and used by Ravana in Ramayana. Ghumura dance is depicted in Sun Temple of Konark confirming this dance form is since the medieval period. In the 'Madhya Parba\\" of \\"Sarala Mhabharata\\" Ghumura has been mentioned as: Dhola Madala Gadi je Ghumura Bajai Ghumura je Ghumu Ghumu Hoi Garajai'' In Chandi Purana mentions: Biratwara Biradhola Daundi Ghumura Kadamardala Bajanti Mari Galatura'' Ghumura was also used as a Darbari dance in the princely state of Kalahandi and played by the erstwhile Kalahandi state during war times. The typical mixed sound that comes out of the musical instruments like Ghumura, Nishan, Dhol, Taal, Madal etc. and the expressions and movements of the artists make this dance to be a \\"Heroic Dance\\". Since thousands of years Ghumura dance has evolved from a war dance to a dance form for cultural and social activities. The dance is associated with social entertainment, relaxation, love, devotion and friendly brotherhood among all class, creed and religion in the present days. Traditionally this dance is also associated with Nuakhai and Dasahara celebration in Kalahandi and large parts of South Western Odisha. Ghumura dance is still hidden in the village level in South Western Orissa and some parts of bordering Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Kalahandi region has taken a leading rule in popularizing and retaining its unique identity of Ghumura dance. Kalahandi is mainly known as land of Ghumura. Ghumura dance has got the opportunity to represent the nation in various international events Delhi, Moscow, Kolkata, and various other cities in India. Ghumura dance is also one of the most researched folk dance form in Orissa. K.B. Nayak, \\"Ghumura\\" Folk Dance-A Glory of Kalahandi, in Tribal Dances of India, Edited by R.D. Tribhuwan, P.R. Tribhuwan, New Delhi, 1999, p. 79‚Äì89 Ruk Mar Nacha (& Chhau dance): This dance is originated and performed in the Mayurbhanj District of Odisha and also in Nilagiri of Baleswar district it has its base in the martial arts tradition. The dance is a stylized mock battle in which two groups of dancers armed with swords and shields, alternatively attack and defend themselves with vigorous movements and elegant stances. Especially notable is the accompanying music, noted for its rhythmic complexities and vigorous percussion. The instruments include 'Mahuri' - a double reeded instrument, 'Dhola' - a barrel shaped two-sided drum, 'Dhumsa' - a hemispherical drum and 'Chadchadi' - a short cylindrical drum. Goti Pua: Gotipua Dancers perform at Sterling Resort Puri, Odisha The goti puas are boy dancers who dress up as girls. They are students of the akhadas, or gymnasia, established by Ramachandradeva in Puri, in the periphery of the temple. As they were offshoots of the akhada system, goti puas also came to be known as akhada pilas - boys attached to akhadas. Another reason often given to justify the emergence of the goti pua system is that some followers of the Vaishnava religion disapproved of dancing by women as a pretext for worship - they introduced the practice of dancing by boys dressed as girls. The word goti means 'one', 'single' and pua, 'boy', but the goti puas always dance in pairs. Boys are recruited about the age of six and continue to perform till they are 14, then become teachers of the dance or join drama parties. Goti puas are now part of professional teams, known as dals, each headed by a guru. The boys are trained for about two years, during which, after having imbibed the basic technique, they learn items of dance, ornamental and expressional. The goti puas, being youngsters in their formative years, can adapt their bodies to the dance in a far more flexible manner as opposed to the maharis. A goti pua presentation is ably supported by a set of three musicians, who play the pakhawaj, the gini or cymbals and the harmonium. The boys do the singing themselves, though at times the group has an additional singer. Nacnƒ´: female performers who sing and dance professionally in rural areas, accompanied by male ·∏çhulkƒ´ and nagarƒÅ drummers. Baagha Naacha or Tiger dance Sambalpuri folk dance is performed in Binka and Sonepur of Subarnapur district during the month of chaitra. The dancer (only males) paints his bare body with yellow and black stripes like that of a tiger and attaches a suitable tail. One or more dancers move from house to house and after a crowd gathers the dance begins. The dancers are accompanied by a drummer and a bell player who provides the music. The dance is nothing but acrobatic movement in rhythm. They make hissing sounds while dancing. Tiger dance is also performed in Berhampur during the Thakurani Jatra. Dalkhai: Mainly dalkhai is named after a goddess \\"dalkhai Devi\\". Though Dusserah is the occasion of Sambalpuri folk dance Dalkhai, it's the most popular folk-dance of Odisha, its performance is very common on all other festivals such as Bhaijiuntia, Phagun Puni, Nuakhai, etc. This is mostly danced by young women of Binjhal, Kuda, Mirdha, Sama and some other tribes of Sambalpur, Balangir, Sundargarh, Bargarh and Nuapada districts. During this dance men join them as drummers and musicians. The dance is accompanied by a rich orchestra of folk music played by a number of instruments known as Dhol, Nisan, Tamki, Tasa and Mahuri. However, the Dhol player controls the tempo while dancing in front of the girls. It is known as Dalkhai because in the beginning and end of every stanza the word is used as an address to a girl friend. The love story of Radha and Krishna, the episodes from Ramayana and Mahabharata, the description of natural scenery are represented through the songs. The song associated with this dance is sung in the SambalpuriOdia. The young women dance and sing intermittently. The songs are of special variety with the additive 'Dalkhai Go' which is an address to a girlfriend. While dancing to the uncanny rhythms of the Dhol, they place the legs close together and bend the knees. In another movement they move forward and backward in a half-sitting position. Sometimes they make concentric circles clockwise and anti-clockwise. The women generally dress themselves in colourful Sambalpuri Saris and wear a scarf on the shoulders holding the ends below in both the hands. Bedecked with traditional jewellery, their robust frames sustain the strains of the dance for long hours. The Dalkhai dance has several adjunctive forms for all ages and groups : Dances performed by female children: Chhiollai, Humobauli and Dauligit. Dances Performed by teenagers: Sajani, Chhata, Daika and Bhekani. Dances Performed by Youths: Rasarkeli, Jaiphul, Maila Jada, Bayamana, Gunchikuta . The man who worship work, composes \\"Karma\\" and \\"Jhumer\\" invigorating Lord Vishwakarma and the Karamashani goddess. Dhap dance: This Sambalpuri folk dance is mostly performed by the Kandha tribe of Western Odisha region. Both men and women participate in the dance. Men of one village dance with women of another village. Usually unmarried boys and girls take part. The dance is performed during marriage ceremony and more often for the sake of recreation. The dance is named so because of the accompanying instrument called ‚ÄòDhap.‚Äô The dhap is in the shape of a Khanjari made up of wood with one side open and the other side covered with a piece of animal skin. The dhap dancer holds the dhap with his left hand, the sling slung over his left shoulder, and beats with his right as well as left hand. Karma Naach: Karam or Karma literally means 'fate' in SambalpuriOdia. This pastoral Sambalpuri folk dance is performed during the worship of the god or goddess of fate (Karam Devta or Karamsani Devi), whom the people consider the cause of good and bad fortune. It begins from Bhadra Shukla Ekadasi (eleventh day of the brightmoon of the month of Bhadra) and lasts for several days. This is popular among the scheduled class tribes (e.g., the Binjhal, Kharia, Kisan and Kol tribes) in the districts of Balangir, Kalahandi, Sundargarh, Sambalpur and Mayurbhanj. This dance is in honour of Karamsani, the deity who bestows children and good crops. After the puja is done it is followed by singing and dancing in accompaniment of drum (maandal), cymbal etc. The dance performance full of vigour and energy combined with charm of the youth decked with colourful costumes in exuberance of red cloth, set in peacock feathers, skillfully designed ornaments made of small conch shells, brings the onlookers as well as the performers to a mood of trance and ecstasy. In this dance both men and women take part and continue to engross themselves for the whole night. The skillful movement of the young boys with mirror in hand indicates the traditional pattern of love-making in course of dancing and singing. The dance is performed sometimes by boys in group, sometimes by girls in group and sometimes both the sexes together. The subject matter of songs constitutes the description of nature, invocation to Karmasani, desires, aspiration of people, love and humour. Jhumair: Jhumair is a folk dance of North Odhia and Western Odisha. It is performed during harvest season and Festivals. Keisabadi: Only men can take part in this form of the Sambalpuri folk dance .Some of them holding a stick two feet in length.

It was designed by the world-famous architect Jean Nouvel and is a major addition to Nicosia's landmarks owing to its original design and location. Standing 62 meters tall, Tower 25 is the fourth tallest building in Cyprus. The ground floor, the mezzanine areas and the six floors above them are offices of Ernst & Young (EY) with amazing views of the city in all directions. The next seven floors contain unique luxurious apartments overlooking the whole capital. The penthouse occupies two top floors. Its unique design resembles the traditional Cypriot architecture. A swimming pool is an additional feature which makes the apartment unique and probably the most expensive in the city. Most of apartments, including the penthouse, were sold before construction commenced. The building cost approximately 25 million euros and was finished by the beginning of 2013. Architecture Tower 25 by night from Stasinou avenue. A full length balcony on each floor offers views of the historic city and walls, also allowing natural light in the living spaces and offices below. The varying width and depth of balconies on each floor creates a natural image as well as the illusion that the building is not static but actually 'breathing'. These balconies' glass doors will each be able to expand in and out beyond the concrete decks they will sit upon to increase the area of either the balcony or the interior. The other facades feature a seemingly random pattern of square voids serving as windows as well as openings for natural ventilation needed due to the hot climate of the city. On the south facade a vertical garden will be created with planting space on each floor instead of a balcony making Tower 25 an environmentally conscious building. At the same time this vertical garden gives a more pleasant atmosphere inside the building, something much needed when living in the centre of a city.https://www.dezeen.com/2016/03/14/ateliers-jean-nouvel-nicosia-cyprus- tower-25-plants-perforated-walls-office-housing-block/ Location The building's location facing the venetian fortifications of the city and next to the new Eleftheria Square redesigned by Zaha Hadid and currently under construction allows the owners of the apartments and offices to be very close to the medieval heart of the city with its picturesque architecture and neighbourhoods. At the same time though, its proximity to the main retailing avenues of the city, Makariou Avenue and Themistokli Dervi Avenue offer owners the chance to shop and dine at the centre of the city. The building itself will attract more developments on the ring avenue around the walls on which it is located.

The period began no later than 1861, with the arrival of American settlers on Yavapai and Tonto land. At the time, the Yavapai were considered a band of the Western Apache people due to their close relationship with tribes such as the Tonto and Pinal. The war culminated with the Yavapai's removal from the Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos on February 27, 1875, an event now known as Exodus Day. Settler-Yavapai conflict With the Mohave people's power greatly diminished, Tolkepaya saw that they needed to make new alliances to protect their safety. In April 1863, Quashackama, a well-known Tolkepaya, met with Arizona Territory superintendent of Indian affairs Charles Poston, along with representatives of the Pimas, Mohaves, Maricopas and Chemehuevis, at Fort Yuma, to sign an agreement intended \\"to promote the commerce in safety between the before mentioned tribes and the Americans.\\" However, the agreement was not an official treaty, so therefore not legally binding in any way.Braatz, p.87 Despite this, the growing numbers of settlers (very quickly outnumbering Yavapai) began to call for the government to do something about the people occupying the land that they wanted to occupy and exploit themselves. The editor of a local newspaper, the Arizona Miner, said \\"Extermination is our only hope, and the sooner it is accomplished the better.\\"Braatz, p.89 Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided a number of ranches that supplied cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As a result of this and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What followed was an infamous footnote in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident. According to Braatz, \\"In December 1864, soldiers from Fort Whipple attacked two nearby Yavap√© camps, killing 14 and wounding seven.\\" The following month, Fort Whipple soldiers attacked another group of Yavap√©, this time killing twenty- eight people, including their headman, Hoseckrua. Included in the group were employees of Prescott's US Indian agent John Dunn. Reservation wars Grave in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery, also referred to as the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Cemetery In 1864, Arizona Territory Governor John Goodwin advised the territorial legislature that all tribes be subdued and sent to reservations.Campbell, p. 104 The same year, a dispatch from the US Army stated \\"All Apache [Yavapai were routinely lumped in with their neighboring Apache] Indians in that territory are hostile, and all Apache men large enough to bear arms who may be encountered in Arizona will be slain whenever met, unless they give themselves up as prisoners.\\"Gifford, pgs. 275-6 Not long after, in retaliation for the murder of a Pai headman by Americans, a group of Pai attacked some wagon trains, and closed the road between Prescott and Fort Mohave to all traffic. In response, the US Army declared all Indians in lands beyond east of the Colorado River (the great majority of traditional Yavapai territory) to be \\"hostile\\" and \\"subject to extermination\\".Braatz, pg. 92 On November 5, 1871, the ambush of the Wickenburg stage-the Wickenburg massacre in which a driver and five of seven passengers killed led to the relocation of the Yavapai from Prescott to San Carlos Reservation in February 1875. =Yavapai War= The Yavapai War, was an armed conflict in the United States from 1871 to 1875 against Yavapai and Western Apache bands of Arizona. It began in the aftermath of the Camp Grant Massacre, on April 28, 1871, in which nearly 150 Pinal and Aravaipa Apaches were massacred by O'odham warriors and American settlers. Some of the survivors fled north into the Tonto Basin to seek protection by their Yavapai and Tonto allies. From there followed a series of United States Army campaigns, under the direction of General George Crook, to return the natives to the reservation system. The conflict should not be confused with the Chiricahua War, which was fought primarily between the Americans and the Chiricahua warriors of Cochise between 1860 and 1873. In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts to find the cave near the Salt River Canyon that was being used by Guwevkabaya as a hideout from which to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, accompanied by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at the roof of the cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group.Braatz, p.138 The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. This was the start of the Tonto Basin Campaign. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, by then named Skeleton Cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.Fenn, p.12 Exodus Day In 1886, many Yavapai joined in campaigns by the US Army, as scouts, against Geronimo and other Chiricahua Apache.Braatz, p. 3 The wars ended with the Yavapai's and the Tonto's removal from the Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos on February 27, 1875, now known as Exodus Day.Braatz, pg, 88 1,400 where relocated in these travels and over the course the relocation the Yavapai received no wagons or rest stops. Yavapai were beaten with whips through rivers of melted snow in which many drowned, any Yavapai who lagged behind was left behind or shot. The march lead to 375 deaths.

Sasheen has made him her personal diplomat and showing him the Head of Lucian which is kept alive by being immersed in a jar of Royal Milk also gave him his first taste of the Royal Milk which is a powerful narcotic. Ash attempts to assassinate Sasheen during a procession with a crossbow but doesn't go through with it as she is surrounded with glass, which Ash suspects is strong enough that only explosives can break it. He follows her till she boards a ship and after much thought he follows her by diving into the water. Ch√© meets Guan, the priest on the flagship of the fleet heading towards Khos. Guan and his sister, Swan are part of Sasheen‚Äôs travelling entourage. Ash is hiding in the bilge of one of the ships staying alive by stealing food and water in the night not knowing where he's heading. Sasheen assigns Ch√© a diplomatic task, to make an example of the lover of General Romano in retaliation to him slandering her son while intoxicated. The party reaches the island of Lagos, whose entire population was put to death on the orders of the Matriarch. While the General taking care of formalities as they near the harbor (Chir) Ch√© goes to his room and strangles his lover (Topo) and deposits his body in the water heater not knowing he is still alive once he realizes topo is still alive & and is being boiled alive he leaves him there.

The next morning soldiers looking for the person who killed the guard question Ash but Mistress Cheer covers for him. He parts ways with her after refusing to answer her questions. Sasheen sends Alarum as her ambassador to General Creed. He lays out the terms of surrender to creed with the threat that if he refuses every person of Khos will be killed and also offers him an ornate ceremonial dagger of Mann whose purpose is to take once own life.

Once it became clear that the Tume cannot be held, Creed and the soldiers abandon Tume, However, there are still several people in the city itself including Ash, Ch√© and Curl. Sasheen has been poisoned by Ch√©'s bullet. Only the Royal Milk is helping her survive. General Romano who became aware of this is plotting his coup.

Championship Live was TV3's chief programme in this regard as it carried live coverage of one or more of the day's big championship games. This was complemented by Championship Throw-In, a midweek Gaelic games programme initially presented by Matt Cooper which featured studio-based discussion and analysis about upcoming games. This programme eventually dropped the studio element and became a magazine-style programme. It aired for three series until 2010. In 2011 it was replaced by The GAA Show. Format The GAA Show usually features a preview of the big game of the weekend. Both presenters travel to rival camps and interview the respective managers and a key player.

After winning twice as a two-year-old in 1981, she developed into a classic filly in the following year, finishing second in the 1000 Guineas before winning The Oaks in record time. Later that year she won the Sun Chariot Stakes before beating a field of colts and older horses by seven lengths in the Champion Stakes. As a four-year-old she won England's premier weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and successfully conceded seven pounds to the outstanding French filly All Along in the Prix Foy. In 1984 she recorded an impressive four length victory in the Coronation Cup and was retired from racing at the end of the year having won nine of her twenty races. She later became a very successful broodmare. Background Time Charter was a powerfully built bay mare with a white star and snip and four white socks bred in Ireland and owned throughout her career by the Barnett family. Her sire Saritamer was an American-bred, Irish-trained sprinter who won the Cork and Orrery Stakes, July Cup and Diadem Stakes in 1974. Time Charter was the first foal of her dam Centrocon a high-class racemare who won the Lancashire Oaks in 1976 and was a half-sister to several winners including Nicholas Bill (Geoffrey Freer Stakes, Princess of Wales's Stakes, Jockey Club Cup), Centroline (Jockey Club Cup) and Tale Quale (Jockey Club Cup). Like all the Barnett's horses, the filly was trained by Henry Candy at Kingstone Warren in Oxfordshire. She was ridden in most of her races by William \\"Billy\\" Newnes. Racing career =1981: two-year-old season= After finishing third over five furlongs on her racecourse debut, Time Charter won a six furlong race at Leicester Racecourse in July. In September she carried top weight of 133 pounds in a nursery handicap over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse and won by three-quarters of a length from Lamlash. On her final appearance of the season she finished seventh when carrying top weight in another nursery handicap at Lingfield Park Racecourse in October. =1982: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Time Charter contested the Masaka Stakes over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse in early April and won by five lengths from Epithet. She was then moved up sharply in class for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 April. Starting at odds of 11/1 she disputed the lead with the sprinter Hello Cuddles until being overtaken by On The House two furlongs from the finish. She stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish second, two and a half lengths behind On The House and three lengths clear of Dione in third. At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 5 June, Time Charter was one of thirteen fillies to contest the 204th running of the Oaks Stakes. Despite her performance in the 1000 Guineas, she was not among the favourites and started at odds of 12/1, probably because, as the daughter of a sprinter, she was thought unlikely to be effective over one and a half miles. Billy Newnes (who was still an apprentice jockey at the time) restrained Time Charter at the back of the field before moving up on the outside in the straight. She took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Slightly Dangerous, with Last Feather third, Awaasif fourth and All Along fifth. Her winning time of 2:34.21 was a record for the race and was faster than that recorded by Golden Fleece when winning the Derby over the same course and distance three days earlier. Time Charter reappeared in the Nassau Stakes (then a Group Two race) over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in late July. As a Group One winner she carried a seven-pound weight penalty and finished second, beaten two lengths by Dancing Rocks. It had been expected that Time Charter would run at York Racecourse in August, contesting either the Yorkshire Oaks or the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup but was sidelined by a respiratory infection, described as \\"a dirty nose\\". She eventually returned for the Sun Chariot Stakes, a Group Two race over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October, in which she was again asked to concede weight to her rivals. Time Charter took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won \\"smoothly\\" by three-quarters of a length from Stanerra an Irish four-year-old who went on to win the Japan Cup in 1983. Two weeks later, Time Charter ran in the Champion Stakes over the same course and distance and started second favourite at odds of 9/2 behind Kalaglow the winner of the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The other runners included the 2000 Guineas winner Zino and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Buzzard's Bay. Newnes settled Time Charter towards the rear of the field before moving forward along the rails three and a half furlongs from the finish. The filly was initially unable to obtain a clear run and Newnes had to force her through a gap between Montekin and the tiring Kalaglow, appearing to bump the latter. Once in the clear, Time Charter quickly took the lead and accelerated away from the field to win impressively by seven lengths, the biggest margin in the history of the race. It had been intended to retire the filly at the end of the season and have her covered by Northern Dancer, but following her win at Newmarket, it was decided that she would remain in training. =1983: four-year-old season= Time Charter took time to reach her best form in the spring of 1983 when the weather in Britain was unusually cold and wet. She had suffered from an \\"internal abscess\\" early in the year and was clearly short of full fitness when she reappeared in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 29 April. She was beaten a head by the colt Electric, being given a very gentle ride by Newnes. A leg injury ruled her out of an intended run in the Coronation Cup at Epsom, and she did not race again until the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 2 July. Newnes held up the filly in a slowly run race, and despite making ground in the straight she finished sixth behind Solford, Muscatite, Tolomeo, Guns of Navarone and Stanerra. Three weeks after her disappointing run in the Eclipse, Time Charter was one of nine horses to contest the thirty-third running of Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half mile at Ascot. The 48-year-old veteran Joe Mercer took over from Newnes, who had been seriously injured in a fall on the training gallops nine days earlier. She started third favourite at odds of 5/1 behind the three-year-olds Caerleon and Sun Princess with the other runners including Awaasif, Lemhi Gold, Diamond Shoal and Lancastrian. Mercer held the filly up at the back of the field and was still five lengths behind the leaders when Diamond Shoal struck for home two furlongs from the finish. Time Charter made rapid progress on the outside to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length and a length from Diamond Shoal and Sun Princess. Time Charter was then aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse and prepared for the race in the Prix Foy over the same course and distance in September. With Newnes again in the saddle, she overcame trouble in running to take the lead inside the last 200 metres and won easily by three-quarters of a length from All Along, who was carrying seven pounds less than the winner. On 2 October, Time Charter started the 3.25/1 favourite in a field of twenty-six runners for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was in contention throughout the race and finished fourth, beaten a length, a neck and a nose by All Along, Sun Princess and Luth Enchantee, with female racehorses filling the first four places. =1984: five-year-old season= Time Charter's training in the early part of 1984 was disrupted by a hip injury and she began her final season in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June. She was matched for the third time against Sun Princess, with the other runners including Shearwalk (third in the Epsom Derby) and the top-class Irish filly Flame of Tara. Ridden by Steve Cauthen, she produced what was described as a \\"breathtaking performance\\", travelling very easily throughout the race before sprinting clear of her rivals in the final furlong to win by four lengths from Sun Princess. Time Charter was unable to add to her success in her three remaining races. At Sandown in July she appeared to be an unlucky loser in the Eclipse Stakes, failing to obtain a clear run in the straight and finishing very strongly to take second place, a neck behind Sadler's Wells. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes later that month she ran well, but never looked likely to repeat her 1983 victory finishing fourth behind Teenoso, Sadler's Wells and Tolomeo. Time Charter suffered from a \\"runny nose\\" in September, and on her final racecourse appearance she made little impact, finishing eleventh behind Sagace in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Assessment As a two-year-old, Time Charter was given a rating of 103 by the independent Timeform organisation. In the following year, Timeform rated her on 131, making her the equal-best three- year-old filly of the season alongside Akiyda and the best three-year-old of either sex trained in the United Kingdom. In the official International Classification she was rated six pounds inferior to Akiyda, an assessment which Timeform described as \\"impossible to understand\\" and \\"nonsense\\". As a four-year-old Time Charter was rated 130 by Timeform making her the second- best older horse of the season behind All Along (134). In the International Classification she was the third best older horse, behind All Along and Diamond Shoal. Timeform rated her on 125 in 1984, and following the announcement of her retirement, commented that her record \\"stands comparison with that of any British-trained middle-distance performer of her sex since the war\\". In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Time Charter a \\"superior\\" winner of the Oaks and the twenty-fourth best British or Irish female racehorse of the 20th century. Breeding record Time Charter was retired from racing to become a successful and influential broodmare. She produced ten foals and seven winners and is the direct female ancestor of several major winners. Her foals included: *By Charter (bay filly, foaled in 1986, sired by Shirley Heights), won one race, dam of Anton Chekhov (Prix Hocquart) and First Charter (Lonsdale Cup), granddam of Best Terms (Lowther Stakes) *Dar Charter (filly 1988 by Darshaan) *Zinaad (brown colt, 1989, by Shirley Heights), won G2 Jockey Club Stakes, sire of the Oaks winner Kazzia *Not Before Time (IRE) (bay filly, 1991 by Polish Precedent), dam of Time Away (Musidora Stakes) and great grandam of Cursory Glance. *Time Allowed (bay filly, 1993, by Sadler's Wells), won Princess Royal Stakes, Jockey Club Stakes *Illusion (bay colt, 1994, by Green Desert), won one race *Generous Terms (chestnut colt, 1995, by Generous), won two races *Time Saved (bay filly, 1996, by Green Desert), won one race, dam of Plea Bargain (King Edward VII Stakes) and Lay Time (Winter Hill Stakes) *Charterhouse (bay colt, 1997, by Shirley Heights) ‚Äì unplaced in 2 races in England 2000 *Time Honoured (bay filly, 2000, by Sadler's Wells) won one race Time Charter was pensioned from broodmare duties in 2001 and died in her sleep at the age of twenty-six at Fair Winter Farm in Buckinghamshire on 7 July 2005.

(September 21, 1913 ‚Äì July 26, 2011) was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and missionary to China. Father Ruiz founded Casa Ricci Social Services, and later the Caritas Macau charity. His work in the 1950s focused mainly on refugees from mainland China. As Casa Ricci's works developed, it spawned Caritas Macau and Ruiz turned the focus of Casa Ricci to work with lepers and their families, and still later to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. He came to be known by several nicknames ‚Äì \\"Luk Ngai\\" (in Cantonese), \\"Father of the Poor\\", and \\"Angel of Macau.\\"  Early life  Luis Ruiz Suarez was born in Gij√≥n, Asturias, Spain, on September 21, 1913. He joined the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, in 1930. As a young Jesuit he taught at Belen College in Cuba, where he had Fidel Castro as one of his students. Then in 1941 the Jesuits sent him to China as a missionary. He studiedMandarin Chinese in Beijing and philosophy in Shanghai. He was forced to cease his work due to the escalation of World War II and the Japanese occupation of China. After 1945 his superiors stationed him in Xian County in Hebei province. He was arrested, briefly imprisoned, and expelled from the newly formed People's Republic of China in 1949 following the Chinese Communist Revolution. While in prison, Ruiz contracted typhoid before his expulsion from China. He left China for Hong Kong in 1951.  Macau, Casa Ricci Social Services, Caritas Macau  In 1951, Ruiz's Jesuit provincial sent him to Macau, a Portuguese colony along the southern Chinese coast, to recover from his typhoid; he would be based there for the rest of his life. The roots of Jesuit social work in Macau go back to 1569 when Melchior Carneiro, the first bishop of Macau, founded there the first Western-style hospitals in Asia. Ruiz's first major work was with refugees fleeing from the People's Republic of China. He used the official Jesuit residence in Macau, which was called Casa Ricci, as a temporary shelter for the mainland Chinese refugees. This led to the establishment of Father Ruiz's first charity in Macau, the Ricci Center for Social Services, which offered a variety of social services. The center furnished refugees with housing, educational opportunities, documentation, child care, and employment. For their children the centre set up the ‚ÄúColegio Mateus Ricci School‚Äù and ‚ÄúEscola de Santa Teresa do Menino Jesus School.‚Äù When the refugees were able to leave the Portuguese territory, Father Ruiz began work with other groups in Macau. He founded the first housing in Macau specifically established to house the elderly, ‚ÄúBetania Home‚Äù for men and ‚ÄúSanta Maria Home‚Äù for women. He also extended services to the north of the peninsula and Taipa Island to alleviate family poverty and child labor. Casa Ricci later spawned the Caritas Macau charitable organization during the 1970s. For Caritas, among other services, Ruiz opened five centers throughout Macau which provided services for the mentally disabled. Ruiz had learned early on from his experiences in China to avoid political involvement, but engage in dialogue, and he advocated this approach among his fellow workers.  Throughout China; Ricci Social Service Foundation  Father Ruiz was invited by a Chinese priest and former prisoner, Father Lino Wong, to Dajin Island of Taishan, Guangdong province, where 200 lepers had been exiled in 1986. The visit began Ruiz's ministry for lepers in the country, along with an order of Catholic religious sisters, the Sisters of Charity of St. Anne. When Christian social workers were again admitted to China, Casa Ricci was one of the first to address the needs of disabled persons and lepers. Ruiz began by obtaining medical care, food, water, and help with housing, while religious sisters joined his efforts. This work extended to Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces of China. The anniversary of these new efforts, under the now established name of Casa Ricci Social Services, was celebrated in 2017. Ruiz emphasized reintegrating into society the children of lepers, securing their education along with other children. He established orphanages where they would not be associated with the stigma of leprosy. It is estimated that Father Ruiz worked with more than 8,000 leprosy patients living in 140 leper colonies located throughout China. His work with lepers proved so time-consuming that he voluntarily handed over control of Caritas Macau to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau in 1994, and continued to develop programs for Casa Ricci Social Services. Ruiz went on to establish charitable institutions for the elderly, the disabled, and the mentally handicapped, and to educate social workers throughout much of China. At the same time, Caritas Macau, which was an offshoot of his original work grew by 2014 to become \\"one of the city‚Äôs largest non-government organisations; it operates 34 centres with 800 staff and 500-600 volunteers. Its charity work extends beyond the city boundaries, to Anhui province, Bangladesh, and East Timor. In 1995, the government of Hongjiang, Hunan province, invited Father Ruiz to establish a center for HIV and AIDS patients in the Chinese province. He would found other centers for AIDS patients in mainland China, including one in Hunan province in 2006 for HIV/AIDS terminal patients and Joy Children's Home in Lufeng, Guangdong in 2007. After 2005 his efforts extended to helping lepers in Vietnam and Burma. He was widely known for his ability to appeal to people for help, with his list of benefactors estimated at about 2,500, as he made appeals in places like Hawaii and the US, He used silk screen prints crafted by refugees to help raise funds. While Caritas Macau worked mainly in the city, Ruiz founded the Ricci Social Service Foundation to foster the widespread work of Casa Ricci Social Services, \\"to help the people living in the Chinese mainland and the Macao SAR on the margins of poverty and society, ... and contribute to the development of the country as a whole.\\" For the Ricci Social Service Foundation, the revised text of the \\"articles of association was filed in the Department's 2010/ASS/M2 file group on May 6, 2010\\". On a personal level, Father Ruiz was said to be an ardent fan of Formula One, Real Madrid and Rafael Nadal. Father Luis Ruiz Suarez died in Macau on July 26, 2011, at the age of 97. Chief executive of Macau, Fernando Chui, in his condolences described Ruiz as \\"a great philanthropist and citizen of Macau ...(whose) work was worthy of recognition and respect by the entire society. ... (He) will remain an example of the great values of solidarity and unconditional dedication to others.‚Äù He was buried at San Miguel cemetery on August 3, 2011. In 2015 the Ricci Social Service Foundation was running 50 programs distributed in 13 provinces of China with 64 leprosy centers for a total of 4,000 patients and 5 HIV homes with a total of 300 HIV+ mothers/adult. It was also caring for 1500 students from poor families.

Under him he acquired a considerable knowledge of the classics and mathematics. His natural bent was towards astronomy, and in his after life he was reputed as one of the best proficients in the less recondite branches of that science in the north of England. In 1745 he became associated with Joseph Randall in the management of the academy at Heath, near Wakefield. The academy, though of good repute, did not pay, and was given up in 1754. Gargrave then started at Wakefield a mathematical school, with such success that in 1768 he retired on a handsome competency. He died on 7 December 1785, and was buried in the churchyard at Wensley. Personal Gargrave was a musician of some skill, and his handwriting was remarkably clear and fine.

The scales are large and there is no externally visible lateral line.United Nations Environment Programme: Liza ramada It maximum length is around 70 cm, with the common specimen being around 35 cm. The largest specimens recorded weighed over three kilograms.European Federation of Sea Anglers Spawning takes place at sea, near the coast between September and February. Distribution The thinlip mullet is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Cape Verde and Senegal north to the Baltic Sea. It is also found in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Azov Sea. It is a pelagic species, usually occurring inshore, entering lagoons and estuaries and rivers. It feeds on epiphytic algae, detritus and small benthic or planktonic organisms. It is common between 0-10m, rarely deeper than that. Fishing Thinlip mullet is commercially caught mainly with gill nets, trammel nets, beach seines and sometimes cast nets. In recreational fishing, spearguns and rods and reels with floats are used. Hooks are baited with bread, various pastes, fish guts and similar baits. One must be careful when pulling and reeling in larger mullets since hooks can sometimes hook only soft lips and catch can be easily lost. Cuisine Meat is white, tender and very soft. Since Thinlip mullet can be found in polluted waters too, taste and quality of the meat vary. Specimen caught in clear waters have great taste and can be prepared in many ways. It is the best barbecued with some olive oil and lemon juice and as part of mixed fish stew with boiled potatoes and/or polenta.

He was part of South Sudan liberation Early years 1927-1963 Joseph Oduho was born into the Otuho tribe community of Lobira situated in what is now Ikotos County, Eastern Equatoria State, EES, in the Republic of South Sudan on 15 December 1927. He was educated at Isoke Catholic Missionary Elementary School and Okaru Catholic Intermediate School, and became one of the first students at Rumbek Secondary School. He studied in Nyapeya in Uganda, then in Bakht Al Ruda Teacher's Institute, earning a Diploma in teaching in 1950. Following this he was a headmaster in intermediate schools in Maridi, Okaru and P'Lotaha. In 1953 Joseph Oduho led a protest against the lack of representation of southern Sudanese non-Arab people in the negotiations over Sudan's independence. He was arrested in Maridi after the 1955 mutiny in Torit, (his home town, now capital of EES), accused of conspiracy and sentenced to death. He was released in the general amnesty after independence on 1 January 1956. Oduho was elected to the first post-independence parliament in 1957. He spoke in favor of a federal organization for the underdeveloped regions of the south. The army seized power in 1958 and Joseph Oduho fled the country in 1960. In 1963 and as Joseph Oduho and his colleagues officially launched the Anyanya Movement in Kampala, Uganda, a book was co-authored by him and William Deng Nhial. The book is entitled \\"The Problem of the Southern Sudan\\" Joseph Oduho, William Deng. The 60-pages book was published by Oxford University Press, London, United Kingdom, in 1963. Exile leader 1960-1972 Joseph Oduho was a founding member and the first president of the Sudan African National Union (1962-1964). He and William Deng published the first formal declaration of Southern Sudan objectives in The Problem of the Southern Sudan (1962). In this paper they argued for independence of the non-Muslim south from the Muslim north of Sudan. Joseph Oduho was one of the leader of the exiles seeking independence. Between 1965 and 1967 he was president of the Azania Liberation Front. He finally broke with the exile groups in 1971 due to disagreement with Joseph Lagu, commander of the Anyanya guerrilla fighters, who wanted to subordinate the political wing of the movement to the military wing. Oduho was committed to the unity of Southern Sudan, while Lagu wanted to withdraw into a smaller \\"Equatoria\\" region. Southern Sudan government member 1972-1983 On 3 May 1972 the Addis Ababa agreement was ratified as \\"The Southern Provinces Regional Self-Government Act 1972\\" (SPRGA-1972), bringing a temporary halt to the civil war. Joseph Oduho and Samuel Aru Bol were appointed to the southern executive. He was given the position of Minister of Housing in the Southern Regional Government, Juba (1972‚Äì75). It was Oduho who, on behalf of the SPRGA-1972, negotiated and signed an agreement with the Yugoslavian Government to construct Ministries and Ministers' quarters in Juba in 1973. Both the Ministries and Ministers' quarters have currently accommodated over 90% of the Government of South Sudan cabinet. In 1975, Joseph Oduho was accused of plotting for southern secession and was arrested, but was released in 1977 after an amnesty declared by President Jaafar Nimeiry when the Sudan Socialist Union (SSU) and northern political parties had come to an agreement. Joseph Oduho ran successfully for election in 1977. He was appointed Minister of Cooperative and Rural Development (1978-1980) and Minister of Labour and Administrative Reforms (1980-1982). He was a member of the SSU Central Committee. In 1982 there were disturbances across the south, with some ethnic minority leaders calling for greater decentralization. Joseph Oduho was opposed to this, consistently advocating southern unity. He thought that decentralization and tribalism were being fostered by northern politicians in order to weaken the south. Second civil war 1983-1993 In 1983, President Nimeiry dissolved the Southern Region that had been established following the 1972 Addis Ababa agreement. Joseph Oduho went into exile again and became a founding member of the SPLM. When the party was established on 16 May 1983, Joseph Oduho was made chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee and Colonel John Garang, a Dinka army officer, was made Chief of Staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Later Garang made himself leader of the SPLA/M. For several years Oduho was imprisoned by the SPLA. He was released in 1992 to bury his late son, Cdr. Kizito Omiluk Oduho, in Lobira, Oduho's home village. He was smuggled to Uganda in East Africa after a failed attempt on his life by the SPLM/A Mainstream. He was picked up by his son, Ohiyok David Oduho, who worked as an Information Consultant With UNICEF's Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) from Madiopei in Northern Uganda. He was flown to Nairobi where he organized a conference whose main objective was to reunite the fragmented SPLM/A. Dr. Garang was opposed to the entire move. In March 1993 he flew to Panyagor, in Kongor, Jonglei State, with among others, Cdr. Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, Cdr. Arok Thon Arok, Cdr/Dr. Lam Akol Ajawin, Cdr/Dr. Richard K. Mulla and Peter Abd Al-Rahman Sule, for further consultations with a view to broadening the base of SPLM leadership. An attack was launched at their meeting place On 27 March 1993 by SPLM/A Mainstream's Bright Star Campaign Commanded by Cdr. Kual Manyang Juk. In this attack, Oduho was caught alive and executed almost immediately. (he was killed with Cdr.

Gazeau,Coherent States in Quantum Physics, Wiley-VCH, Berlin, 2009.). However, they have generated a huge variety of generalizations, which have led to a tremendous literature in mathematical physics. In this article, we sketch the main directions of research on this line. For further details, we refer to several existing surveys.S.T. Ali, J-P. Antoine, J-P. Gazeau, and U.A. Mueller, Coherent states and their generalizations: A mathematical overview, Reviews in Mathematical Physics 7 (1995) 1013-1104.S.T. Ali, J-P. Antoine, and J-P. Gazeau, Coherent States, Wavelets and Their Generalizations, Springer- Verlag, New York, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2000.S.T. Ali, Coherent States, Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, pp. 537-545; Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006.  A general definition  Let mathfrak H, be a complex, separable Hilbert space, X a locally compact space and d u a measure on X. For each x in X, denote xrangle a vector in mathfrak H. Assume that this set of vectors possesses the following properties: # The mapping x mapsto  x rangle is weakly continuous, i.e., for each vector phirangle in mathfrak H, the function Psi (x) = langle x phirangle is continuous (in the topology of X). # The resolution of the identity : int_X  xranglelangle x; d u (x) = I_{mathfrak H} holds in the weak sense on the Hilbert space mathfrak H, i.e., for any two vectors  phirangle ,  psi rangle in mathfrak H, the following equality holds: :int_X langlephi xranglelangle xpsirangle; d u (x) = langlephipsirangle;. A set of vectors  xrangle satisfying the two properties above is called a family of generalized coherent states. In order to recover the previous definition (given in the article Coherent state) of canonical or standard coherent states (CCS), it suffices to take Xequivmathbb{C}, the complex plane and d u (x) equiv frac{1}{pi} d^2x. Sometimes the resolution of the identity condition is replaced by a weaker condition, with the vectors  x rangle simply forming a total set in {mathfrak H}, and the functions Psi (x) = langle x  psirangle, as  psi rangle runs through {mathfrak H}, forming a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The objective in both cases is to ensure that an arbitrary vector  psi rangle be expressible as a linear (integral) combination of these vectors. Indeed, the resolution of the identity immediately implies that :  psi rangle = int_X Psi (x) xrangle; d u (x); , where Psi (x) = langle x  psirangle. These vectors Psi are square integrable, continuous functions on X and satisfy the reproducing property : int_X K (x,y )Psi (y); d u (y) = Psi (x), , where K (x, y) = langle x  y rangle is the reproducing kernel, which satisfies the following properties : quad K (x, y) = overline{K (y, x)}; , qquad K (x, x) > 0; , :int_X K(x,z); K(z, y) ; d u (z) = K(x,y); .  Some examples  We present in this section some of the more commonly used types of coherent states, as illustrations of the general structure given above. = Nonlinear coherent states = A large class of generalizations of the CCS is obtained by a simple modification of their analytic structure. Let varepsilon_1 leq varepsilon_2 leq ldots leq varepsilon_n leq ldots be an infinite sequence of positive numbers (varepsilon_1 eq 0). Define varepsilon_n ! = varepsilon_1 varepsilon_2 ldots varepsilon_n and by convention set varepsilon_0 ! =1. In the same Fock space in which the CCS were described, we now define the related deformed or nonlinear coherent states by the expansion : vert alpharangle = {mathcal N}(vert alphavert^2)^{-frac 12}; sum_{n=0}^infty frac {alpha^n}{sqrt{varepsilon_n !}} nrangle, . The normalization factor {mathcal N}(vert alphavert^2) is chosen so that langle alpha vert alpha rangle = 1. These generalized coherent states are overcomplete in the Fock space and satisfy a resolution of the identity : int_{mathcal D} vert alpha ranglelangle alpha vert; {mathcal N}(vert alphavert^2); d u (alpha, overline{alpha} ) = I; , mathcal D being an open disc in the complex plane of radius L, the radius of convergence of the series sum_{n=0}^inftyfrac {alpha^n}{sqrt{varepsilon_n !}} (in the case of the CCS, L= infty.) The measure d u is generically of the form dtheta;dlambda (r) (for alpha = re^{itheta}), where dlambda is related to the varepsilon_n ! through the moment condition. Once again, we see that for an arbitrary vector  phirangle in the Fock space, the function Phi(alpha) = langle phi  alpharangle is of the form Phi(alpha) = {mathcal N}(vert alphavert^2)^{-frac 12}f(alpha), where f, is an analytic function on the domain mathcal D. The reproducing kernel associated to these coherent states is : K(overline{alpha}, alpha' ) = langle alpha alpha'rangle = left[{mathcal N}(vert alphavert^2) {mathcal N}(vert alpha'vert^2)right]^{-frac 12} sum_{n=0}^infty frac {(overline{alpha} alpha')^n}{varepsilon_n!}; . = Barut‚ÄìGirardello coherent states = By analogy with the CCS case, one can define a generalized annihilation operator A by its action on the vectors  alpharangle, : A alpha rangle = alpha alpha rangle; , and its adjoint operator A^dagger. These act on the Fock states  nrangle as : A  nrangle = sqrt{varepsilon_n} n -1 rangle; , qquad A^dagger n rangle = sqrt{varepsilon_{n+1}} n+1 rangle; . Depending on the exact values of the quantities varepsilon_n, these two operators, together with the identity I and all their commutators, could generate a wide range of algebras including various types of deformed quantum algebras. The term 'nonlinear', as often applied to these generalized coherent states, comes again from quantum optics where many such families of states are used in studying the interaction between the radiation field and atoms, where the strength of the interaction itself depends on the frequency of radiation. Of course, these coherent states will not in general have either the group theoretical or the minimal uncertainty properties of the CCS (there might have more general ones). Operators A and A^dagger of the general type defined above are also known as ladder operators . When such operators appear as generators of representations of Lie algebras, the eigenvectors of A are usually called Barut‚ÄìGirardello coherent states. A typical example is obtained from the representations of the Lie algebra of SU(1,1) on the Fock space. = Gazeau‚ÄìKlauder coherent states = A non-analytic extension of the above expression of the non-linear coherent states is often used to define generalized coherent states associated to physical Hamiltonians having pure point spectra. These coherent states, known as Gazeau‚ÄìKlauder coherent states, are labelled by action-angle variables. Suppose that we are given the physical Hamiltonian H =sum_{n=0}^infty E_n  n rangle langle n, with E_0 = 0, i.e., it has the energy eigenvalues E_n and eigenvectors  nrangle, which we assume to form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of states {mathfrak H}. Let us write the eigenvalues as E_n=omegavarepsilon_n by introducing a sequence of dimensionless quantities {varepsilon_n} ordered as: 0=varepsilon_0<varepsilon_1<varepsilon_2<ldots;. Then, for all J geq 0 and gamma in mathbb R, the Gazeau‚ÄìKlauder coherent states are defined as : J ,gammarangle =mathcal N(J)^{-frac 12}sum_{n=0}^infty,frac{J^{n/2} e^{-ivarepsilon_n gamma}}{sqrt{varepsilon_n !}}nrangle; , where again mathcal N is a normalization factor, which turns out to be dependent on J only. These coherent states satisfy the temporal stability condition, : e^{-iHt}vert J, gamma rangle = vert J, gamma + omega t rangle; , and the action identity, : langle J, gamma  H J, gamma rangle_{mathfrak H} = omega J; . While these generalized coherent states do form an overcomplete set in {mathfrak H}, the resolution of the identity is generally not given by an integral relation as above, but instead by an integral in Bohr's sense, like it is in use in the theory of almost periodic functions. Actually the construction of Gazeau‚ÄìKlauder CS can be extended to vector CS and to Hamiltonians with degenerate spectra, as shown by Ali and Bagarello. =Heat kernel coherent states= Another type of coherent state arises when considering a particle whose configuration space is the group manifold of a compact Lie group K. Hall introduced coherent states in which the usual Gaussian on Euclidean space is replaced by the heat kernel on K. The parameter space for the coherent states is the \\"complexification\\" of K; e.g., if K is SU(n) then the complexification is SL(n,C). These coherent states have a resolution of the identity that leads to a Segal-Bargmann space over the complexification. Hall's results were extended to compact symmetric spaces, including spheres, by Stenzel. The heat kernel coherent states, in the case K=mathrm{SU}(2), have been applied in the theory of quantum gravity by Thiemann and his collaborators. and other papers in the same sequence Although there are two different Lie groups involved in the construction, the heat kernel coherent states are not of Perelomov type.  The group-theoretical approach  Gilmore and Perelomov, independently, realized that the construction of coherent states may sometimes be viewed as a group theoretical problem.A. M. Perelomov, Coherent states for arbitrary Lie groups, Commun. Math. Phys. 26 (1972) 222‚Äì236; arXiv: math-ph/0203002.A. Perelomov, Generalized coherent states and their applications, Springer, Berlin 1986. In order to see this, let us go back for a while to the case of CCS. There, indeed, the displacement operator D(alpha); is nothing but the representative in Fock space of an element of the Heisenberg group (also called the Weyl‚ÄìHeisenberg group), whose Lie algebra is generated by X,, P and I. However, before going on with the CCS, take first the general case. Let G be a locally compact group and suppose that it has a continuous, irreducible representation U on a Hilbert space {mathfrak H}, by unitary operators U(g), ; g in G. This representation is called square integrable if there exists a non-zero vector  psi rangle in {mathfrak H}; for which the integral : c(psi) = int_G vertlanglepsi  U(g)psiranglevert^2; dmu (g) converges. Here dmu is the left invariant Haar measure on G. A vector  psirangle for which c(psi) < infty is said to be admissible, and it can be shown that the existence of one such vector guarantees the existence of an entire dense set of such vectors in {mathfrak H}. Moreover, if the group G is unimodular, i.e., if the left and the right invariant measures coincide, then the existence of one admissible vector implies that every vector in {mathfrak H}; is admissible. Given a square integrable representation U and an admissible vector psirangle, let us define the vectors :  grangle = frac 1{sqrt{c(psi )}}; U(g) psi rangle , mbox{ for all } gin G. These vectors are the analogues of the canonical coherent states, written there in terms of the representation of the Heisenberg group (however, see the section on Gilmore-Perelomov CS, below). Next, it can be shown that the resolution of the identity : int_G  g ranglelangle g ; dmu (g) = I_{mathfrak H} holds on {mathfrak H}. Thus, the vectors  grangle constitute a family of generalized coherent states. The functions F(g) = langle g phirangle for all vectors  phi rangle in {mathfrak H}; are square integrable with respect to the measure dmu and the set of such functions, which in fact are continuous in the topology of G, forms a closed subspace of L^2 (G, dmu ). Furthermore, the mapping phi mapsto F is a linear isometry between {mathfrak H}; and L^2 (G, dmu ) and under this isometry the representation $U$ gets mapped to a subrepresentation of the left regular representation of G on L^2 (G, dmu). = An example: wavelets = A typical example of the above construction is provided by the affine group of the line, G_{text{Aff}}. This is the group of all 2times2 matrices of the type, : g = begin{pmatrix} a & b  0 & 1 end{pmatrix}; , a and b being real numbers with a eq 0. We shall also write g = (b,a), with the action on mathbb{R} given by (b,a)cdot x = b+ax. This group is non-unimodular, with the left invariant measure being given by dmu (b,a ) = a^{-2};db;da (the right invariant measure being a^{-1};db;da). The affine group has a unitary irreducible representation on the Hilbert space L^2 (mathbb R, dx ). Vectors in L^2 (mathbb R, dx ) are measurable functions varphi(x) of the real variable x and the (unitary) operators U(b,a) of this representation act on them as : (U(b,a)varphi )(x) = frac 1{sqrt{vert avert}};varphi left(frac {x-b}aright) = frac 1{sqrt{vert avert}};varphi left((b,a)^{-1}cdot xright); . If psi is a function in L^2 (mathbb R, dx ) such that its Fourier transform widehatpsi satisfies the (admissibility) condition : int_{mathbb R} frac {vertwidehatpsi (k)vert^2}{vert k vert}; dk < infty; , then it can be shown to be an admissible vector, i.e., : c(psi ) = int_{G_text{Aff}} vertlangle psi  U(b,a)psi rangle vert^2 ; frac {db;da}{a^2} < infty; . Thus, following the general construction outlined above, the vectors :  b, arangle = frac 1 {sqrt{c(psi)}};U(b,a)psi; , qquad (b,a) in G_{text{Aff}} define a family of generalized coherent states and one has the resolution of the identity : int_{G_text{Aff}} b, aranglelangle b,a;frac {db;da}{a^2} = I on L^2 (mathbb R, dx ). In the signal analysis literature, a vector satisfying the admissibility condition above is called a mother wavelet and the generalized coherent states  b, arangle are called wavelets. Signals are then identified with vectors  varphi rangle in L^2 (mathbb R, dx ) and the function : F(b,a) = langle b,a varphirangle; , is called the continuous wavelet transform of the signal varphi.

This concept can be extended to two dimensions, the group G_{text{Aff}}; being replaced by the so-called similitude group of the plane, which consists of plane translations, rotations and global dilations. The resulting 2D wavelets, and some generalizations of them, are widely used in image processing. J-P. Antoine, R. Murenzi, P. Vandergheynst, and S.T. Ali, Two-Dimensional Wavelets and their Relatives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (UK), 2004. = Gilmore‚ÄìPerelomov coherent states = The construction of coherent states using group representations described above is not sufficient. Already it cannot yield the CCS, since these are not indexed by the elements of the Heisenberg group, but rather by points of the quotient of the latter by its center, that quotient being precisely mathbb R^2. The key observation is that the center of the Heisenberg group leaves the vacuum vector 0rangle invariant, up to a phase. Generalizing this idea, Gilmore and Perelomov consider a locally compact group G and a unitary irreducible representation U of G on the Hilbert space {mathfrak H}, not necessarily square integrable. Fix a vector psirangle in {mathfrak H}, of unit norm, and denote by H the subgroup of G consisting of all elements h that leave it invariant up to a phase, that is, : U(h)mid psi rangle = e^{iomega (h)}midpsirangle, , where omega is a real-valued function of h. Let X = G/H be the left coset space and x an arbitrary element in X. Choosing a coset representative g(x) in G, for each coset x, we define the vectors :  xrangle = U(g(x))psiranglein {mathfrak H}. The dependence of these vectors on the specific choice of the coset representative g(x) is only through a phase. Indeed, if instead of g(x), we took a different representative g(x)' in G for the same coset x, then since g(x)' = g(x)h for some h in H, we would have U(g(x)') psirangle = e^{iomega (h)} xrangle. Hence, quantum mechanically, both  xrangle and U(g(x)') psirangle represent the same physical state and in particular, the projection operator  xranglelangle x  depends only on the coset. Vectors  xrangle defined in this way are called Gilmore‚ÄìPerelomov coherent states. Since U is assumed to be irreducible, the set of all these vectors as x runs through G/H is dense in {mathfrak H}. In this definition of generalized coherent states, no resolution of the identity is postulated. However, if X carries an invariant measure, under the natural action of G, and if the formal operator B defined as : B = int_X  xranglelangle x; dmu (x); , is bounded, then it is necessarily a multiple of the identity and a resolution of the identity is again retrieved. Gilmore‚ÄìPerelomov coherent states have been generalized to quantum groups, but for this we refer to the literature.  Further generalization: Coherent states on coset spaces  The Perelomov construction can be used to define coherent states for any locally compact group. On the other hand, particularly in case of failure of the Gilmore‚ÄìPerelomov construction, there exist other constructions of generalized coherent states, using group representations, which generalize the notion of square integrability to homogeneous spaces of the group. Briefly, in this approach one starts with a unitary irreducible representation U and attempts to find a vector  psirangle, a subgroup H and a section sigma : G/H to G such that : int_{G/H}  xranglelangle x; dmu (x) = T; , where  xrangle = U(sigma (x)) psi rangle, T; is a bounded, positive operator with bounded inverse and dmu is a quasi-invariant measure on X = G/H. It is not assumed that psirangle be invariant up to a phase under the action of H and clearly, the best situation is when T is a multiple of the identity. Although somewhat technical, this general construction is of enormous versatility for semi-direct product groups of the type mathbb R^n rtimes K, where K is a closed subgroup of GL(n, mathbb R ). Thus, it is useful for many physically important groups, such as the Poincar√© group or the Euclidean group, which do not have square integrable representations in the sense of the earlier definition. In particular, the integral condition defining the operator T ensures that any vector  phi rangle in {mathfrak H}; can be written in terms of the generalized coherent states  xrangle namely, :  phi rangle = int_X Psi (x)  xrangle ; dmu (x); , qquad Psi (x) = langle x  T^{-1}phi rangle; , which is the primary aim of any kind of coherent states.  Coherent states: a Bayesian construction for the quantization of a measure set  We now depart from the standard situation and present a general method of construction of coherent states, starting from a few observations on the structure of these objects as superpositions of eigenstates of some self- adjoint operator, as was the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian for the standard CS. It is the essence of quantum mechanics that this superposition has a probabilistic flavor. As a matter of fact, we notice that the probabilistic structure of the canonical coherent states involves two probability distributions that underlie their construction. There are, in a sort of duality, a Poisson distribution ruling the probability of detecting n excitations when the quantum system is in a coherent state zrangle, and a gamma distribution on the set mathbb C of complex parameters, more exactly on the range mathbb R^{+} of the square of the radial variable. The generalization follows that duality scheme. Let X be a set of parameters equipped with a measure mu and its associated Hilbert space L^2(X, dmu) of complex-valued functions, square integrable with respect to mu. Let us choose in L^2(X, dmu) a finite or countable orthonormal set mathcal{O}={phi_n, , , n = 0, 1, dots }: : langle phi_m  phi_n rangle = int_{X}overline{phi_m(x)}, phi_n(x), dmu(x) = delta_{mn}, . In case of infinite countability, this set must obey the (crucial) finiteness condition: : 0< mathcal{N}(x) := sum_{n} vert phi_n (x)vert^2 < infty , quad mathrm{a.e.}, . Let mathfrak{H} be a separable complex Hilbert space with orthonormal basis {e_nrangle, , , n = 0, 1, dots } in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of mathcal{O}. The two conditions above imply that the family of normalized coherent states mathcal{F}_{mathfrak{H}}= {xrangle, , , x in X } in mathfrak{H}, which are defined by : xrangle = frac{1}{sqrt{mathcal{N}(x)}}sum_n overline{phi_n(x)}, e_nrangle, , resolves the identity in mathfrak{H}: : int_X dmu(x) ,mathcal{N}(x) , xrangle langle x  = I_{mathfrak{H}}, . Such a relation allows us to implement a coherent state or frame quantization of the set of parameters X by associating to a function X i x mapsto f(x) that satisfies appropriate conditions the following operator in mathfrak{H} : : f(x) mapsto A_f := int_Xmu(dx) ,mathcal{N}(x) , f(x), xrangle langle x , . The operator A_f is symmetric if f(x) is real-valued, and it is self-adjoint (as a quadratic form) if f(x) is real and semi-bounded. The original f(x) is an upper symbol, usually non-unique, for the operator A_f. It will be called a classical observable with respect to the family mathcal{F}_{mathfrak{H}} if the so- called lower symbol of A_f, defined as : check{f} (x):=langle x  A_f  x rangle = int_Xmu(dx') ,mathcal{N}(x') , f(x'), vertlangle x x'ranglevert^2 , . has mild functional properties to be made precise according to further topological properties granted to the original set X. A last point of this construction of the space of quantum states concerns its statistical aspects. There is indeed an interplay between two probability distributions: (i) For almost each x, a discrete distribution, : n mapsto frac{vert phi_n (x) vert^2}{{mathcal N} (x)}. This probability could be considered as concerning experiments performed on the system within some experimental protocol, in order to measure the spectral values of a certain self-adjoint operator A, i.e., a quantum observable, acting in mathfrak{H} and having the discrete spectral resolution A = sum_n a_n e_nranglelangle e_n. (ii) For each n, a continuous distribution on (X,mu), : X i x mapsto vert phi_n (x) vert^2,. Here, we observe a Bayesian duality typical of coherent states. There are two interpretations: the resolution of the unity verified by the coherent states xrangle introduces a preferred prior measure on the set X, which is the set of parameters of the discrete distribution, with this distribution itself playing the role of the likelihood function. The associated discretely indexed continuous distributions become the related conditional posterior distribution. Hence, a probabilistic approach to experimental observations concerning A should serve as a guideline in choosing the set of the phi_n(x)'s. We note that the continuous prior distribution will be relevant for the quantization whereas the discrete posterior one characterizes the measurement of the physical spectrum from which is built the coherent superposition of quantum states e_nrangle.

The game was developed by a two- man team under the studio MinMax Games using the Torque engine. The game was later ported for Mac OS X and Linux systems. A sequel, Space Pirates and Zombies 2, was announced on February 5, 2014, and was set to be released in the 1st quarter of 2015, but it was delayed until 2016. Space Pirates and Zombies 2 has been in Early Access on Steam until its release on November 7, 2017. Gameplay S.P.A.Z. integrates top down shooter gameplay with role- playing video game and real-time strategy elements within a futuristic space setting. The game also features large-scale randomly generated galaxies to explore. Players command a fleet of ships, and may control any one of their ships individually at a time. The galaxy is organized into systems, each system containing a star and a set of planet bodies and areas which may be \\"warped\\" to via an in-game map. These areas may contain faction stations where trade, missions, or sieges may take place. The player's standing with the faction affects what services the station will give you. Players can improve their faction standings through missions and level up their fleet through missions and combat. When controlling the craft players can fire the craft's main weapons, fire alternative weapons such as missiles, or launch shuttlecraft filled with marines. The view of the game world can be scrolled in or out, enabling a distant view or a closer view for combat. Combat involves positioning your ship to hit the enemy with your weapons while dodging enemy fire, and tactically deploying larger weapons such as minefields and mass bombs. Each vessel has different shields, armor and hull types and each is strong or weak against certain types of weapon, encouraging players to diversify within their own fleets in order to engage different enemies. Initially gameplay involves interacting with the UTA or Civilian factions, depending on the player's standing with them in the current star system. Shortly into the game a faction of Bounty Hunters is introduced, and later in the game the eponymous and extremely dangerous zombie force appears. Three types of resources are available in-game; Rez, Goons and Data. Rez is the material that is mined from asteroids and is used to build ships and buy technology. Goons are crew members found in ejected escape pods or bought from colony worlds, and are used to crew your ships and can be gifted to factions to improve relations. Data represents gathered technology and forms the basis for the game's experience system; the more the player destroys enemies and completes quests, the more Data is rewarded which can then be spent on upgrading the various aspects of the fleet. There are currently 43 different types of controllable ships split into 5 size categories; Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge. These can be fitted with a variety of weaponry such as lasers, cannons, torpedoes, guided missiles, mass bombs, fighter drones and mines whilst the ships themselves can be customised with different types of propulsion, reactors, shields, stealth technology and various utility boosters making them more effective in certain situations. Synopsis Humanity has expanded throughout the galaxy after the discovery of the miraculous Element 126, colloquially known as 'Rez', which enabled matter replication technology (including cloning), advanced artificial intelligence and faster than light travel in the form of the warp gate network. With more of the new element found near the galactic core, the outer worlds, including Earth, have become neglected backwaters. With humanity now numbering in the thousands of trillions across thousands of planets, the spread of interplanetary diseases caused the collapse of many human governments. A totalitarian militaristic police force called the United Terran Alliance (or UTA) stepped in to fill the void and began to strictly police access to the warp gates. Civilian access to interstellar travel was abolished in what was described as a 'temporary move' but this state of affairs has existed for over 1000 years. With humanity living in the decaying remnants of its past glory the civilian populations of many sectors rose up against the UTA in the vicious 'Lockdown Wars' over control of space travel and the supply of Rez. There has always been rumoured to be an endless and hidden motherlode of Rez in the galactic core, but none have ever managed to find it. Chasing this dream, thousands of miners and pirates in the Earth system band together to take on the UTA and claim their fortune. =Plot= For years the Pirates of the Earth system, under the command of explorer Don Gibson, second-in-command Elsa Young and former UTA scientist Dr. Carl Memford, have been constructing a massive armed mothership named the Clockwork to take on the warring UTA and Civilian fleets between them and the galactic core. After allying with the Rez miners in the Earth system, the Clockwork crew blast their way through the UTA blockade at the system's warp gate and head into the wider galaxy. This brings them into conflict with the high ranking UTA commander Admiral Jamison who doggedly attempts to stop them reaching the heavily guarded Core Worlds. After acquiring the technology necessary to access the Core Worlds the Clockwork crew discover that the Core Worlds are overrun with a horrific biomechanical pandemic that fuses living tissue into ship systems to create an all consuming hiveminded fleet of Zombies. It becomes apparent that the UTA had been battling this infection for over 200 years and the added security measures for accessing the Core Worlds were not to keep Civilians and Pirates out but to keep the Zombie infection in. The Clockwork battles on and eventually discovers a hidden alien warp gate into the galactic center - there it discovers an extremely ancient and hostile alien intelligence known as the 'Dark Entity' which is both the source of all Rez in the galaxy and the controlling intelligence of the Zombies. To the horror of his crew, captain Don Gibson immediately defects to the Dark Entity and the Clockwork is infected and transformed into a Zombie superweapon. The remaining crew are only saved by the intervention of Admiral Jamison, who then retreat in shock. Don reveals that he had encountered the Dark Entity over 200 years ago and was enslaved and dispatched as a means of securing the success of its infection by destroying the UTA's blockade on interstellar travel, with the Entity prolonging his lifespan in order to do so. The Zombie infection quickly spreads throughout the entire galaxy, with the crew of the Clockwork becoming widely hated and cursed for bringing about the apparent end of humanity. Seeking to save the galaxy, and to get revenge on Gibson, Elsa Young takes command of the Pirates and spends the next 2 years creating a new mothership - Clockwork 2. With the help of Admiral Jamison and other allies, the Pirate fleet fights its way back through Zombie space to the realm of the Dark Entity and destroys it, Gibson and the original Clockwork. The fate of humanity is left in question, as the Rez it so desperately depended on can now no longer be replenished. Choosing not to dwell on this the Pirates instead devote themselves to destroying every trace of the Zombie infection. Development The game was developed by Andrew Hume and Richard Clifford, who had previously shared an office for five years as technical designers at Radical Entertainment in British Columbia, Canada. They were working on the unreleased Scarface 2, the sequel to Scarface: The World Is Yours, for two years before the project was cancelled. Following this the pair worked on an undisclosed project for a year, before this too was canceled. On this Clifford stated \\"Having years of your life flushed because of a graph projection and watching 60 of your friends get laid off can destroy the magic feeling.\\" Soon after the second project's cancellation they shared their ideas for a debut video game of their own making, whereupon they left Radical Entertainment and formed MinMax Games. Taking on development of S.P.A.Z. required a full-time commitment from both men. As a result of this, neither received any kind of payment for a period of twenty two months. The project was initially planned to take six months. The self-funding nature of the project eventually required the developers to use the equity of their homes in order to continue. The development of a game through a two-man independent studio as opposed to being part of a much larger team offered both positive and negative changes. Because Hume and Clifford lacked the staff resources of a larger company they were forced to take on tasks which would have been handled by a more specialist staff member should they still been employed at Radical Entertainment. Decision making, however, required short conversations and agreements rather than meetings and risk assessments, simplifying this facet of development. S.P.A.Z. was modeled on video games from what the developers consider \\"..the golden age of gaming..\\", including series such as X-com, Star Control and Mechwarrior, but given \\"..a modern twist.\\" Various aspects of these titles and others were combined to form S.P.A.Z. The top-down perspective space combat aspect was influenced by Star Control, the physics and emphasis on craft design from Mechwarrior was added to this to form the base of the game. The components for spacecraft, it was decided, would need to be unlocked during play. The role-playing game style skill tree of Diablo was combined with the tiered research system of X-com to produce the required effect. The science fiction television series Babylon 5 was the inspiration behind the thruster- based space combat. The in-game universe was inspired by the exploration aspects of Freelancer and Homeworld, producing \\"..a top down space action RPG\\" similar to a simplified descendant of Escape Velocity. The game's universe was originally designed to accommodate several different races, however after several months the developers had not progressed far beyond humans. At this point it was decided to retain \\"..the zombified ship aspect..\\" and refocus on that. A plant-based race and a crystalline race were dropped from the game. The zombies' organic weapons proved difficult to define, ideas such as egg- laying and infestation from creatures entering the players' ships were considered. The developers decided to produce \\"zombified versions\\" of each human-controlled ship within the game, resulting in the final design of the zombies. The zombies' reproduction was inspired by spiders, some of which \\"..reproduce and have their offspring crawling all over them.\\" The developers incorporated this, allowing zombie ships to effectively reproduce by infecting the players' craft similar to Homeworld: Cataclysm's antagonist. The spacecraft were originally created by Clifford combining shapes then drawing over the top of the resultant silhouette. Due to his lack of artistic training a lot of the designs \\"..looked bad at first.\\" After repeated attempts the craft started to improve visually, resulting in a collection of ships with different areas to deploy weapons. These areas, hard points, were adjusted throughout development. It was decided that each craft should perform a specific role within each size class, additional craft were created to fill any gaps. Weapons from Babylon 5 and Star Trek were added to the game, whenever the team saw examples which were not emulated within the game they attempted to create them. The randomly generated galaxies were not originally intended. After a time the developers discovered that creating the game's world was too time-consuming. Although the creation of the procedurally generated galaxy aspect took time in itself, once it was completed it grew along with the rest of the project. Balancing the randomly generated galaxies would have proven difficult, but because S.P.A.Z. is an open-world game it allows players to choose which tasks to undertake during play. Reception Space Pirates and Zombies received both positive and mixed reviews and previews from video game critics, covering both the beta version of the game and the final release. In a preview by Jeff Mattas of Shacknews, he stated \\"I have no reservations recommending that anyone looking for a solid space-based shooter with retro flair, a ton of customization options, and a lot of replay value.\\" In another preview, by Quintin Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun, the author stated \\"While this is a good game and well worth your attention (and when it emerges from the beta, it might even be a great one), oh my Lord is it irritating.\\" Smith also stated \\"I think a lot of modern PC gamers would cheer at any dev trying to breathe life into the frozen body of the space shooter genre..\\", but added \\"..S.P.A.Z. isn‚Äôt simply resuscitating a genre. It‚Äôs also following quite an old-fashioned and miserly approach to learning curves and content.\\" Atomic Gamer's Jeff Buckland gave the game an overall rating of 9 of 10. He stated \\"..while a lot of changes have gone into v1.0, I'd still be recommending the game even without them.\\" In regards to the update he added \\"We get quite a few new accessibility and convenience features, more missions, a specialist system, and more - along with some bug fixes, many addressing specific issues that I and many players had in the beta.\\" He summed up by recommending the game to \\"..serious fans of games like Master of Orion, Star Control 2, Space Rangers 2, or other space-based, genre-bending games..\\". GamePro's Tony Capri gave an overall rating of 7 of 10, stating \\"The combat is fun, the controls are solid, and there's ample content -- unfortunately, SPAZ is not actually as expansive as its premise suggests.\\" He also stated \\"There‚Äôs plenty of content already under the hood, and MinMax is intent on offering a steady stream of meaningful updates. Unfortunately, the game at present doesn‚Äôt fully satisfy in terms of presentation or variety..\\".

Since the Meiji period, they had been in possession of the Yamauchi family. Materials were gradually transferred from the Yamauchi family to the custody of K≈çchi Prefecture since April 28, 1995; a process that was completed in July 2004 with the simultaneous transfer of about 36,000 items. Since then, the complete material ancestral heritage of the family, amounting to about 67,000 items, has been held by the archives. In addition the archives have received materials entrusted or donated by temples and shrines. The museum exhibits the collected items, conducts research and runs training and educational courses. A dedicated department is in charge of restoration and preservation of materials. Regular and special exhibitions on a variety of topics are changed periodically, with about 100 items on display at any given time.

It is signed \\"TICIANUS F.[aciebat]\\" and is dated to 1523‚Äì1526. The painting is set on the island of Andros. A sleeping nymph and a urinating boy are seen in the lower right foreground while men and women celebrate with jugs of wine. The absence of Bacchus from the painting is explained by Erwin Panofsky, who suggests that the god must be on the departing ship seen in the center background. Due to the artistic liberties Titian took in painting these figures, it is difficult to identify them. The musical score in the foreground is the canon Chi boyt et ne reboyt il ne seet que boyre soit (\\"who drinks and does not drink again does not know what drinking is\\"), attributed to Ferrarese court musician Adrian Willaert. The painting is now held at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but it was commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este for his Camerini d'alabastro ('chambers of alabaster') in Ferrara. The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating Bacchus and Venus, the gods of wine and love. Like its predecessor Bacchus and Ariadne, The Bacchanal of the Andrians was inspired by the Imagines of Philostratus. The Bacchanal of the Andrians has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it in versions that are housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.

The film stars British actress Jill Adams and an indigenous-Australian actor Robert Tudawali as Emu Foot. Synopsis Justin Bayard, a Northern Territory policeman, is escorting an aboriginal warrior, Emu Foot, to Alice Springs to be tried for a tribal killing. They are attacked by some Aborigines and forced to take refuge at an isolated cattle station. Julie, the bored wife of the station owner Tad Kirkbridge, sets Emu Foot free and is later murdered. Bayard romances stockman's daughter Chris. Emu Foot is killed by aboriginals and Bayard exposes Julie's murderer.

It was meant to be used as a basis for their television company, Australian Television Enterprises, but it was used for this film. They optioned Jon Cleary's novel Justin Bayard. Robinson later recalled: > On that film we were aiming to do very well in the English market, because > we had always done well there. For instance King of the Coral Sea earned > much more than its production cost out of England whilst it earned its > production cost in Australia. Walk into Paradise had also gone terribly well > in England. England was a very strong market for us at that time. In fact it > was probably a better market for us than the United States. Casting This was the fourth feature from Lee Robinson and Chips Rafferty but the first one in which Rafferty did not act, although he was originally meant to, with Charles Tingwell to play the second lead, a station manager. According to Tingwell, Rafferty decided against playing the lead when Robinson wanted to increase the emphasis on the romantic subplot involving Bayard as he thought it was too old. Robinson then offered the lead to Tingwell, who claimed he was too short and wrong for the role, and he suggested Ken Wayne. Tingwell went on to act in The Shiralee (1957). Robinson was originally reluctant to work with Wayne and instead cast New Zealand actor Walter Brown.Larkins p 111-112 Brown had just appeared on stage in Teahouse of the Autumn Moon. (At one stage American star John Ericson was sought to play the lead role.) Jill Adams was imported from England to play the female lead. Robinson said he cast her on the basis of her performance in Doctor at Sea. She arrived in Sydney on 11 September 1956. Maureen Lanagan was a Sydney model making her first film ‚Äì Robinson also used models turned actors in The Phantom Stockman and King of the Coral Sea. (He often expressed frustration at what he saw was a lack of good looking young women who could act in Australia.) This was Robert Tudawali's second film role after Jedda. His contract was negotiated by Southern International, Actors Equity and the Department of Native Affairs. In September 1956 he signed to play his role at ¬£40 a week plus a bonus of ¬£50 if the film was televised. Production Jill Adams flew out of Sydney on 13 September 1956 for seven weeks of filming near Alice Springs. Shooting took place in the studio at Bondi and on location near Alice Springs in October and November 1956.\\"Drama of out back: DUST IN THE SUN.\\" The Australian Women's Weekly 23 Jan 1957: 40 accessed 16 December 2011 Three weeks into filming Robinson and Raffety decided to fire Brown because he seemed \\"too soft\\". They offered his role to Tingwell, who declined, and then cast Ken Wayne.Larkin p 113 Release The film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival in 1958 where the Bulletin called it \\"the worst film shown\\" at the festival with \\"a cheap, improbable story... crudely acted and edited, lapsing at times into absurd cliches.\\" It did not achieve a general release in Australia and England until 1960. It did not perform well at the box office.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 226. According to Raffety's biographer \\"with television making serious inroads into movie attendances world wide and no Chips Rafferty to exploit for distribution, Dust in the Sun was just another badly made independent cheapie, and gathered its own dust on the shelf for some four years.\\"Larkin p 116 Lee Robinson later said, \\"I don't think it was a good script and I don't think that we had a very strong supporting cast and it was the first picture that we had done in which Chips didn't play the lead... I think our mistake there was to make a picture not geared for Chips.\\" Filmink later called the film \\"a kind-of Western that should have been more of a Western.

Plot The Pilot and His Wife portrays the life of the sailor both at home and abroad and describes varied experiences out on the stormy deep as well as in distant ports. The work is noted for its vigor of description. With a background of ocean waves, it is a story of married life. Salve Kristiansen loves a beautiful woman named Elisabeth and is evidently loved in return. But for a time Elisabeth is attracted to a young officer who wishes to marry her. The old love for Salve prevails, however, and Elisabeth spurns the officer, but Salve has already left his native land in desperation and is sailing toward foreign shores. When he finally, after some years, returns to his old home, he finds that Elisabeth, after all, has been true to him. He marries her. It would seem that all is well, but such is not the case. The thought of Elisabeth's momentary hesitation does not leave Salve, and this unfortunate circumstance makes life miserable for both. Ten years elapse before the husband and wife finally come to a clear understanding and a genuine appreciation of one another, and now at last are enabled to lay the foundation for a happy life together. The novel emphasizes the need of implicit confidence and trust, if two persons united in wedlock are to live happily together.

It was shot on location in Tahiti. There are French and English versions of the film. The French version is known as Le Passager clandestin. Synopsis A group of adventurers compete with one another to find the missing heir Rene Marechal, thought to be near Tahiti. Major Owens, a middle aged Englishman with a shady past, discovers the island on which Marechal lives but is murdered by the criminal Mougins. Mougins sets out for the island with Colette, a night club singer who is Marechal's former mistress. She is rescued by Jean, who had earlier helped Colette stow away on the boat to Tahiti. Jean and Mougins fight and Mougins falls overboard and is eaten by a shark. Jean and Collette decide to give up the search for Marechal and live on the islands.

The first two would be co productions with Rafferty and Robinson:, starting withWalk into Paradise, which would be shot on location in New Guinea, in English and French versions. The second film would be made in Tahiti with French director Yves Allegret as the principal director and Robinson as director of the English version. This movie would be shot in Cinema-Scope and would hopefully star Gerard Philippe. \\"I was told that the Pacific was very wide, and its capital was Sydney* so I came here,\\" said Decharne.\\"I also heard that Australians appreciated French films better than any other country outside Europe. 'La Ronde' made more money in Australia than it did in France.\\" At one stage the film was called Vahini Tahiti. The film was shot towards the end of 1957 in Tahiti and the Society Islands.

It depicts Christ and a Pharisee at the moment in the Gospels(, , ) when Christ is shown a coin and says \\"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\\". It is signed \\"Ticianus F.[ecit]\\", painted on the trim of the left side of the Pharisee's collar.Jaff√©, 156; Hale, 162; Penny, 264 It is possibly the earliest representation in art of this scene, which had a personal significance for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who commissioned it. Subject and purpose The subject is rare in art, and some authorities have said that this is its first representation in art.Penny, 264; Schiller, 157: It was later painted by Van Dyck, Rubens \\"and a few others\\". The famous fresco The Tribute Money by Masaccio shows a different episode. The novelty is explained by the special significance of the subject for the patron, who is presumed to have suggested it. With one level of appropriateness, it was created for the door of a cupboard or cabinet containing the collection of medals and ancient and modern coins of Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. In the following years the duke became a very important patron of Titian, partly because he was impressed by this first commission.Jaff√©, 156; Hale, 162; Penny, 264, with the fullest account of the door setting, quoting Vasari \\"nella porta d'un armario\\". At another level, the story had a political relevance. Duke Alfonzo's territories were partly in the Holy Roman Empire, and partly in the Papal States,Hale, 171. The Duchy of Ferrara was a papal fief, but Reggio Emilia and Modena were imperial. giving the subject a particular meaning to him; the trap set for Christ by the question was one that Alfonso had been living in for some years. At the time the painting was produced he had been excommunicated and deprived, at least in theory, of some of his territories by the Papacy, after not following the papacy when it changed sides in the War of the League of Cambrai. For most of this period he was opposed to the papacy, which had been aggressively expanding the Papal States, and wanted to absorb the Duchy of Ferrara (as it eventually did when Alfonso's grandson died in 1597). For Alfonso the message of the injunction of Christ in the \\"Tribute Money\\" episode was probably that the Papacy should concentrate its attention on church matters, as opposed to expanding its territory. He included part of the gospel text of the episode on his gold coinage.Jaff√©, 156; Hale, 162, 170‚Äì173; Penny, 264 Date and signature Titian's later composition, c. 1543‚Äì1568, National Gallery. Unusually for an early Titian, the painting can be dated with confidence, as Titian and two assistants or servants spent some five weeks staying at Alfonso's Castello Estense in Ferrara from 22 February 1516 until the end of March.Hale, 161 Titian normally painted on canvas, but the original use of the painting as a door necessitated the panel support here. It is Titian's earliest signed painting, and was perhaps signed to show he was not a court painter, as well as advertising his name in a prominent court outside Venice and its territories. The location of the signature on the pharisee's collar may support it being a self-portrait (see below), with the signature \\"identifying the subject like the inscription below the profile portrait on a coin\\".Hale, 162; Goffen, 278 (quoted) Reception and later composition The painting, which has been described as \\"Titian's sleekest, most polished early work\\",Hale, 162 became famous. Giorgio Vasari thought the head of Christ \\"stupendous and miraculous\\" and that all artists at the time believed it to be Titian's most perfect painting. Carlo Ridolfi's biography relates that when he saw it, an envoy of the Emperor Charles V expressed surprise that any artist could compete with Albrecht D√ºrer so well.Jaff√©, 101, 156; Hale, 162 (quoted) Much later Titian painted a larger composition of the subject (now National Gallery), perhaps to meet a demand for replicas.Penny, 260‚Äì267; Jaff√©, 156 This was perhaps begun around 1543, but not completed until the 1560s; it was sent to Philip II of Spain in 1568.Penny, 264‚Äì265 X-radiographs reveal that the gold coin in it was originally inscribed with \\"Ferrara\\".Penny, 264 Context The figure of the pharisee has been claimed as a self-portrait by Titian, who was in his late twenties at the time. The same claim has been made for several figures painted in narrative scenes by Titian, notably, and perhaps more convincingly, the severed head of John the Baptist in his Salome (Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome and other versions), which is very close in date to this painting, and where the head does not much resemble the one here.Hale, 162, 738, note 7 Both paintings are examples of narrative subjects drawing on Titian's skill as a portraitist,Penny, 201 as well as forming part of a number of paintings using the Giorgionesque type of composition showing two or three tightly-cropped half-length figures with their faces close together, heightening the drama of their interaction. Other examples of this type are Lucretia and her Husband and The Bravo,Jaff√©, 98 both now in Vienna, and The Lovers (Royal Collection).The Lovers, Royal Collection Interlude in Russia The painting is in the collection of Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, Germany. After WWII together with many masterpieces of the gallery it was taken by the Red Army to the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. The painting was badly damaged by water and was painstakingly restored by Russian painter Pavel Korin. Together with many others, in 1955 the painting was returned to Dresden, then in the DDR.  In literature  The painting is referred to in George Eliot, Daniel Deronda (ch 40), when the young and vigorous Deronda meets the ill and prematurely aged Jewish scholar Mordecai: \\"I wish I could perpetuate those two faces\\", Eliot writes, \\"as Titian's 'Tribute Money' has perpetuated two types presenting another sort of contrast.\\" See also *The Tribute Money (Masaccio) ‚Äì showing a different episode.

Born into a naval family, Macnamara served in the East Indies during the last years of the American War of Independence, seeing action with Hughes at the Battle of Cuddalore. He received the acting rank of lieutenant during this time, but reverted to midshipman afterwards. He returned to naval service during the Spanish and Russian armaments, and was serving with Lord Hood aboard on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He saw action in the Mediterranean and was eventually promoted to his own commands. He achieved success as a daring frigate captain, serving with Nelson and making several hard-fought captures. He finished his service in the Mediterranean with action at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, and later served in the West Indies before the Peace of Amiens. Macnamara found himself in trouble with the law after killing a man in a duel, but summoned a bevy of naval officers to testify in his defence, and was acquitted. He commanded a number of ships of the line in the following years, in the Baltic, North Sea and off of the French coast. He was promoted to rear-admiral in 1814, but did not receive a seagoing command. He married in 1818 and died in 1826, having served with prominent naval officers like Hood, Jervis and Nelson in a long and distinguished career.  Family and early life  Depiction of the Battle of Cuddalore, by Auguste Jugelet, 1836. Macnamara was born into a naval family in 1768 in County Clare, son of Michael Macnamara and Bridget Waters, and entered the navy in 1782 aboard the 80-gun . Gibraltar went out that year to the East Indies, flying the broad pennant of Commodore Sir Richard Bickerton. On his arrival he was transferred to the 74-gun , the flagship of the station commander, Sir Edward Hughes. Macnamara saw action at the Battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783 against M. de Suffren, in which battle Superb sustained losses of 12 men killed and 41 wounded. He was then given an acting rank of lieutenant aboard the 68-gun and returned to England with her. He then reverted to the rank of midshipman and served aboard the 50-gun at Jamaica. Europa was at the time the flagship of Admiral Alexander Innes. After some years in this position, he received his lieutenant's commission on 1 December 1788 and went on to serve during the Spanish armament in 1789 and the Russian armament in 1791. He was first aboard the 74-gun under Captain John Gell, later following him to the 100-gun , flying the flag of Admiral Lord Hood.  French Revolutionary Wars  Macnamara continued to serve with Hood aboard Victory after the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France in 1793. He took part in the occupation of Toulon and was promoted by Hood to the rank of master and commander on 22 October 1793, at about the time of the evacuation of the port. He was appointed acting captain of the 74-gun , followed by the 32-gun . Despite these commands an official mistake meant that his commission as post captain was dated 6 October 1795. Southampton was assigned to a squadron commanded by Commodore Horatio Nelson, supporting the Austrian army in Genoa. = Command of Southampton = Macnamara they spent 15 days in September 1795 blockading a French grain convoy in the port of Genoa. The convoy was protected by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally came out on the evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene. Macnamara had another chance to distinguish himself, when on 9 June 1796 a French corvette was sighted entering Hy√®res bay, and Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, summoned Macnamara to his flagship, HMS Victory. He asked Macnamara to bring out the French ship if he could. Recognising the difficulty and risk that would be involved, he did not make it a formal written order, instead instructing Macnamara 'bring out the enemy's ship if you can; I'll give you no written order; but I direct you to take care of the king's ship under your command.' Macnamara promptly took his ship in under the guns of the batteries, and apparently having been mistaken for a French or neutral frigate, closed to within pistol shot of the French ship, and demanded her captain surrender. The captain replied with a broadside, and Macnamara brought Southampton alongside and sent his first lieutenant, Charles Lydiard, over in command of the boarders. After subduing fierce resistance Lydiard took possession of the French ship and together he and Macnamara escaped out to sea under heavy fire from the French shore batteries. Macnamara reported his triumph to Jervis The Battle of Cape St Vincent, 14 February 1797 by Robert Cleveley The prize, a 24-gun corvette named , was taken into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Macnamara's later service with Nelson included the capture of Portoferraio, the evacuations of Caprera and Corsica, and expeditions against Piombino and Castiglione. Macnamara had already developed a reputation for intrepidity bordering on recklessness, and he displayed these qualities again in an attack on the 18-gun Spanish brig Corso in a strong gale under enemy shore batteries. The first attempt to capture her failed, with only one man, the coxswain, getting on board. Macnamara tried again, managing to place 30 men aboard the Spanish ship, at which she surrendered. Having done so the weather prevented any further attempt to make contact with the prize. One of Macnamara's last acts in support of the Mediterranean Fleet was to take part in the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, in which Southampton formed part of the centre of the line as a repeating frigate. = Captain of Cerberus = Southampton returned to Britain within a few months of the battle, and Macnamara was appointed to command the 32-gun , initially on the Irish station. During his time there he captured the 10-gun French privateer Echange, and on 20 October 1799 came across a convoy of Spanish merchantmen escorted by five frigates and two brigs. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority Macnamara attacked and captured one of the frigates, but was forced to abandon his prize after the other Spanish frigates came to her defence. He also captured a merchant ship, and having taken her men off, burnt her. Cerberus sustained minor damage during the engagement, and had only four men wounded. The Admiralty showed their approval of Macnamara's actions by promoting his first lieutenant. Macnamara was then sent out to the West Indies, where he cruised off Jamaica and San Domingo until the Peace of Amiens. Cerberus was then paid off in February 1803, and Macnamara went ashore.  Duel  While ashore during the peace Macnamara contrived to become embroiled in a duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested on a charge of manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.  Napoleonic Wars  Macnamara returned to service with the resumption of the wars with France and took command of the 64-gun in June 1805 for service in the North Sea. He commanded her for two years on this station before taking command of the 74-gun . Macnamara served with the Baltic Fleet under Sir Richard Goodwin Keats in the Great Belt in 1808. During this service he took command of a squadron of gunboats and attacked a Danish brig and cutter off Nyborg. In a fierce attack, in which seven Danes were killed and thirteen wounded to one British officer killed and two seamen wounded; both Danish ships were captured. They were found to be the 18-gun Fama and the 12-gun Salorman. Macnamara was then appointed to the 74-gun in 1809. This service took him back to the North Sea and then the coast of France. While commanding a small squadron blockading Cherbourg on 24 March 1811, he chased the French frigate Amazone off Barfleur, attacking the French ship and forcing her crew to abandon and burn her.  Flag rank and later life  Macnamara was promoted to rear-admiral on 4 June 1814, but never had an active command. He married Henrietta, the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. George Carleton, on 26 January 1818. Rear-Admiral James Macnamara died at Clifton, Bristol, on 15 January 1826 at the age of 57.  Notes  a. Lydiard went on to achieve considerable success in his own right, until his death in the wreck of in 1807. b. George Carleton was the son of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. George had been killed at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in 1814.

Early life Gale was, according to the register of his burial, born about 1797. He was originally an actor in small parts in London minor theatres. He became a great favourite of Andrew Ducrow. In 1831 he went to America, and was claimed to have played Mazeppa for two hundred nights at the Bowery Theatre in New York City (he did play at least about 45 consecutive performances). He afterwards traveled in the west and joined a tribe of native Americans. He brought six of them, with their chief, \\"Ma Caust\\", to London, and was scarcely distinguishable from his companions. They were exhibited at the Victoria Theatre till their popularity declined. Sir Augustus Frederick D'Este had become interested in them, and procured Gale an appointment as coast blockade inspector in the north of Ireland. On the strength of this appointment, which he held for seven years, he afterwards assumed the title of lieutenant. Ballooning Tiring of this he made an unsuccessful attempt to return to the London stage, and then took to ballooning. He had a balloon manufactured at the old Montpelier Gardens in Walworth, and made his first ascent successfully from the Rosemary Branch tavern at Peckham in 1848. He made many ascents, the 114th of which was from the hippodrome of Vincennes at Bordeaux, with the Royal Cremorne balloon, on 8 September 1850. He was seated on the back of a pony suspended from the car. Gale descended at Auguilles. When the pony had been released from its slings, the peasants holding the balloon ropes, not understanding his directions, relaxed their hold, and Gale was carried up by the only partially exhausted machine. The car overturned, but he clung to the tackling for a time, and was borne out of sight. Next morning his body was found in a wood several miles away. He was buried at the Protestant cemetery at Bordeaux on 11 September. Gale was a man of much courage and very sanguine. For some time after his death his widow, who had frequently made ascents in his company, continued to gain a livelihood by ballooning.

John Jones, the managing director of First National, assigned his publicity director, Ken G. Hall with the task of shooting additional scenes. At this stage of Hall's career, his only experience in handling film came with re-editing movies to meet the requirements of Australian censorship. Additional Scenes Hall wrote and shot a number of new sequences, including one where an Australian soldier on the Emden collects his debts before the battle begins. The movie was made with the co-operation of the Royal Australian Navy, who allowed Hall to shoot footage on the real HMAS Sydney while it was training off Jervis Bay. Technical advice was provided by a signaller from the battle.Ken G. Hall, Directed by Ken G. Hall, Lansdowne Press 1977 p 44 Hall later said in a 1972 interview that the more research he did into the battle, the less impressed he was with how Sydneys captain, John Glossop had acted: > Only when I came to make the picture did I realise that she should have > bloody well sunk the Emden and she should have sunk her without one single > Sydney man being injured. She had no right to bombard a wreck up on a reef, > with no chance of retaliation just because the surviving Germans had not > lowered their flag, so they poured another five salvoes in and killed 50 > men... Captain Glossop, R.N.,Biography of Captain Glossop at Australian War > Memorial let it be noted, should never have brought the Sydney within range > because she out-gunned, out-ranged and out-sped the Emden. She had only to > stay away and blow the German ship out of the water, that's all. But he got > 11 killed through making this mistake, so they sent him back to England > after his 'great' victory.Philip Taylor, 'Ken G. Hall', Cinema Papers > January 1974 p 77 Reception The film enjoyed good reviews and was a popular success at the box office, launching Hall's directorial career.

It spans the Beke valley, west of the town of Altenbeken, in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The viaduct is Europe's longest limestone bridge, and its construction was one of the earliest significant events in the history of rail transport in Germany. As part of the Hamm‚ÄìWarburg railway between Paderborn and Altenbeken, it is still in use today. It is also the emblem of Altenbeken, and is depicted, in stylized form, on the coat of arms of the municipality. History thumb Since July 2009, the Altenbeken Viaduct's keystones have been integrated into a new viewing platform below it. The viaduct spans the Beke valley. The viaduct was built by the Royal Westphalian Railway Company, and was inaugurated on 21 July 1853 by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. He was the one who coined the phrase \\"I had thought I would find a golden bridge, because so many terrible dollars have been spent\\". The construction and opening of the viaduct and nearby station, rail yard and tunnel under the Rehberg caused the village of Altenbeken to develop into a railway town, which owes its present size almost exclusively to the railway. During World War II, the viaduct was a prime target of Allied bomb attacks, in which several columns were destroyed. According to the Americans, the Altenbeken Viaduct, together with the Schildesche Viaduct at Bielefeld, was one of the two most important German railway bridges. The Western Allies were hoping that their destruction would have a decisive effect on the war; they wanted to stop the vital coal supply lines and break the backbone of the German war economy. The stakes were correspondingly high: even the first Allied bombing raid of 26 November 1944 resulted in the greatest air battle of World War II. As early as September 1943, the second battery of Flakabteilung 943 zur Reichsverteidigung was posted at the viaduct until January 1944. The first air attack on 26 November 1944 by US bombers cut the important railway link. From then onwards, passengers had to climb about down ladders and then climb up the other side to continue in another train. Goods traffic was diverted to the Detmold-Herford-Bielefeld/Ost route. Following temporary repairs, the viaduct was again destroyed in February 1945. By May 1946, the viaduct could once again be traversed, over makeshift trackwork, at . Only on 2 October 1950 ‚Äì almost six years after the first destructive attack ‚Äì could the viaduct be put back into operation in its old form. The reconstruction of the viaduct took into account the historical shape of the bridge, such that since 1950 it has resembled its old form once again. However, the keystones of the viaduct could not be reinstated. In July 2009, after being displayed for many years as a monument in Adenauerstra√üe, Altenbeken, they were integrated into the viaduct's newly constructed viewing platform. Viaduktfest thumb Between 11 and 21 July 2003, under the name \\"Vivat Viaduct\\", Altenbeken celebrated the 150th anniversary of the viaduct. About 40,000 visitors came to Altenbeken. As the festival was so successful, it was decided to organise it again every two years as a \\"town and station festival\\". Thus, in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, many people came to the event. The Viaduktfest also includes a viaduct walk through the town and a plastic duck race on the Beke river. Celebrities such as Urban Priol, Hennes Bender, G√∂tz Alsmann, Ingo Oschmann or Guildo Horn have complemented the Viaduktfeste with cultural events. The festival always takes place in early July of odd numbered years.

The house was home to the Morris family from around 1660 until the early 1800s, and was bought in 1895 by the Daly family, descendants of whom now run it as a guest house. History According to Charles Smith,Charles Smith (1715‚Äì1762) Natural and Civil Histories of the County of Cork (1750) who terms it \\"a strong romantic building\\", Benduff Castle was built by the O'Donovans. However, it was almost certainly built around 1470 by Catherine Fitzgerald,Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society - 1919 daughter of Thomas, 7th Earl of Desmond, who married Finghin MacCarthy Reagh. The Annals of the Four Masters says that she died in 1506.Journal of the Cork Historical & Archaeological Society. Volume X. (1904) This Earl, one of the most powerful men in Ireland, was Viceroy of Ireland under Edward IV, and was executed at Drogheda in 1466, having fallen a victim, it is said, to the malice of Edward's Queen, Elizabeth Grey, in consequence of his having made a disrespectful speech in reference to her to that King. Earl Thomas's daughter is probably the person who has come down to us as \\"The Black Lady,\\"An Officer of the Long Parliament, Richard Baxter Townsend & Dorothea Baker Townshend, Publisher: Frowde (1892) of whom various legends were told in connection with Benduff. The ancient Castle of Benduff (, \\"The Black Peak\\"), now called Castle Salem (sometimes referred to as Castlesalem,John Rutty's \\"History of the Rise and Progress of the People called Quakers in Ireland from the Year 1653 to 1700\\" (1751) Castle SallyTaylor and Skinner's \\"Maps of the Roads of Ireland\\" (1776) and Mount SalemWilliam Penn (1669‚Äì1670): \\"My Irish Journal\\", edited by Isabel Grubb, Longmans, 1952), is situated about a mile to the north-west of Rosscarbery, in the bosom of a secluded valley shut in by hills and at one time by a dense plantation of trees. It thus differed from the generality of the feudal strongholds of old which were either perched on a rocky eminence or surmounted the summit of some rising ground. But the sheltered and isolated position of this castle probably protected it from external danger. Originally a strong structure, Benduff Castle was built in the usual style of the Norman fortresses which studded Ireland during the Middle Ages, distinguished for their square central keep or tower, with thick massive walls and loop holes for the use of arms as well as the admission of light, to which were generally attached side buildings furnished with bastions, and strong outer walls enclosing the entire foundation ‚Äî these latter being sometimes provided with covered ways. Benduff Castle has three internal arches; its walls were 11 feet thick, with passages and recesses, and the usual stone stairway. It was originally about 70 feet high till William Morris took the top off, and put on it a slated roof. Civil War period The lands of Knocknamadogue with the Castle of Benduff had been the property of Florence McCarthy, a Roman Catholic rebel whose estates were forfeited by Oliver Cromwell. Ballihagornagh (Barley Hill) had belonged to John Marrigoe, who had a similar history, and most of the rest of the lands had been in the possession of the O'Donovans. Captain William Morris (abt. 1620‚Äì1680) was given over 1500 acres of land, including the castle, and he changed the name to Castlesalem. This was in around 1660.The Journal of the Friends' Historical Society, 1913 The land was formally granted in a grant under the act of settlement in 1678:A copy of the document is in the National Archives in Dublin. William Morris and the Quakers William Morris despite having been a Cromwellian soldier became a Quaker in 1656 and was an active member of the emerging Friends community in Ireland. John Rutty gives an interesting account from the Journal of William Edmondson who describes Captain Morris as a man of talents and influence: During 1656 William formed a Quaker meeting in Belturbet, County Cavan, with William Parker and his wife and Robert Wardell and his father. Sometime later in 1656 he was discharged from his post and returned to Cork. Like many educated men of his time with financial means he used his influence as a vehicle for change. William had published in 1659 a short treatise entitled Tythes no gospel ordinance. He attempts to prove by reference to Scripture that \\"Tythes are unjust to rich and poor alike\\" and like many Friends this was to get him into trouble with the establishment. William also wrote a treatise to the English Parliament in 1659, \\"To the Supream Authoritie (under God) of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the Commons in Parliament Assembled. The true and faithfull Testimony of William Morris, a late Member of the Army in Ireland\\" (London, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth, near Aldersgate. 4to. 1659). The work seeks to challenge Parliament about the persecution of Quakers in Ireland by Henry Cromwell, Oliver‚Äôs fourth son. Henry's principal objective in Ireland was to secure the authority of the Protectorate and to crush all disloyalty. He opposed the Baptists among the soldiers and civilian administrators because of their close association with republicans. By late 1656, Henry had succeeded in forcing leading Baptist officers to resign their commissions or to leave Ireland. He discouraged the spread of Quakerism into Ireland by arresting Quaker missionaries and dismissing army officers who appeared susceptible to their message. On the other hand, he encouraged moderate Presbyterian and Independent clergymen to come over to Ireland. Having suppressed the radicals, Henry worked to reconcile the main Protestant groupings, to gain the support of the gentry and to stabilise the administration. The policy of land seizure and transplanting the native Irish was largely carried out before his appointment as Lord-Deputy, so although he remained suspicious and watchful, Henry's treatment of the Irish Catholics tended to be moderate. Henry supported the succession of his brother Richard to the office of Lord Protector in 1658, but was powerless to prevent the collapse of the Protectorate the following year. He resigned as Lord-Deputy in June 1659 and the Restoration of Charles II just one year away in May 1670. The work that could have cemented William as a major Quaker theologian and author, written with George Fox and John Perrot, was entitled \\" Warnings to the Baptised People\\", published in 1659. Like many of the early Friends William was to suffer for his beliefs and was imprisoned on a number of occasions. Joseph BesseJoseph Besse (1753): \\"Collection of the sufferings of the people called Quakers\\" (Volume 2) Chapter 16, Ireland, p. 461 writing in 1753 told how in 1660: Following his treatise against the payment of tithes in 1663/4 Paul and William Morris were sued for tithes by the Archdeacon of Ross but the Archdeacon died suddenly under circumstances which so affected his brother clergy that for some years the Morrises were not again sued for tithes: \\"A Testimony against John Reeve & Lodowick Muggleton, by the Quakers of Cork\\", signed by Wm. Morris, Wm. Edmondson, Robert Sandham and 23 others with Muggleton's Sentence of damnation upon them. And the names of many other Friends & things concerning Friends are scattered throughout the vol.\\"Joseph Besse (1753): \\"Collection of the sufferings of the people called Quakers\\", pp. 379-401 George Fox (1624‚Äì1691), the founder of the Quaker faith, despite being unwelcome visited Ireland in 1669. He first visited Bandon then went on to Cork. The mayor was not keen to welcome Fox to Cork. Paul Morris was a brother of William Morris and acted as the guide to George Fox when he rode through the streets of Cork unharmed though there were warrants out against him and even the Mayor recognised him. The Morrises were clearly people of influence. Fox describes how: William Penn Apart from George Fox the other most widely known Quaker is William Penn (1644‚Äì1718). As a close friend William Penn was often at Castlesalem, particularly in the early months of 1670. Writing in his \\"Irish Journal\\" Penn frequently talks of his time with William Morris. At this time Morris was one of the most prominent Friends in the South of Ireland and clearly respected and admired by William Penn who had him act as his agent in Cork collecting rents etc.\\"The Papers of William Penn: 1644-1679\\". By William Penn, Mary Maples Dunn, Richard S. Dunn, Edwin B. Bronner, Published by University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981 Penn stayed or visited Castle Salem on February 21, 1670, February 23, 1670, February 24, 1670, February 25, 1670, March 26, 1670, March 29, 1670 ‚Äì April 3, 1670, April 6, 1670, April 16, 1670. There may have been other times but these are not recorded. Penn wrote some of his Great Case of Liberty of Conscience Once More Briefly Debated and Defended at Castle Salem, as he refers to it a number of times in his diary. The New House (1682) Rutty describes the death of William in 1680: \\"This year died William Morris of Castle Salem in the Co of Cork, who though a man of great parts and wisdom, was convinced of Truth by a weak instrument\\". Following the death of his father in 1680, Fortunatus Morris built a new house on to the fortress at Benduff. It is 'L' shaped, the tower being at the angle of the 'L'. It is built of small pieces of bad stone, with a high outside chimney and two gables. Fortunatus‚Äô house was built at its rear against the old building, and from the first landing of its stairs one could step into the Castle by the ancient doorway which was placed about 12 feet from the ground. Later a Georgian hall door was added. The gardens were very extensive and laid out in old Dutch style with ponds, little islands and clipped yew trees. 19th century The Morris family still lived in the castle at the beginning of the 19th century. It was described in 1815 in Townsend's SurveyTownsend's Survey of Cork in 1815 as the seat of William Morris. There was an \\"old house joined to a castle of still greater antiquity, standing on a rock rising in the centre of a small romantic vale surrounded by steep and lofty hills. Of the trees that were formerly very abundant many still remain, amongst which are a yew and some beech of great size. A very singular circumstance occurs here of a rookery in a grove of laurels\\". The castle was offered for sale at the encumbered estates court on 3 June 1853 and was bought by a Dr. Fitzgibbon for ¬£1,350.Freemans Journal 4 June 1853 In 1870 it was in the hands of Mrs Eliza Fitzgibbon. Patrick Daly bought the castle in 1895 from the Fitzgibbons and three generations of the family have now farmed the land. Under the stewardship of Michael and Margaret Daly and their family the Castle tower has been partially restored. It is still a working farm and offers bed and breakfast as well as tours.

It depicts the saint at the moment of his martyrdom, being burnt alive on a gridiron. According to Bernini's biographer, Filippo Baldinucci, the sculpture was completed when Bernini was 15 years old, implying it was finished in the year 1614. Other historians have dated the sculpture between 1615 and 1618. A date of 1617 seems most likely. It is less than life-size in dimensions, measuring 108 by 66 cm. The sculpture is now held in the Uffizi in Florence as part of the Contini Bonacossi Collection. Commission There is some confusion over the patronage of the sculpture. Filippo Baldinucci simply wrote it was done for Leone Strozzi, a Florentine nobleman living in Rome. Bernini‚Äôs son, Domenico Bernini, who wrote a biography of his father, paints a more complex picture, suggesting that Bernini executed the sculpture out of his devotion for the saint rather than for a specific commission. Michela Uliva suggests this may be true, with Bernini's supporter Cardinal Maffeo Barberni enthusing the artist with the burgeoning post-Tridentine interest in early Christian martyrs. Recent historians tend to agree with Domenico Bernini's statement that Leone Strozzi was impressed by the sculpture and acquired it for his Villa del Viminale. Irving Lavin suggests that Strozzi may have become familiar with the work as he was commissioning a chapel in the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at the same time as Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, particularly as the Strozzi Chapel included a tomb dedicated to Cardinal Lorenzo Strozzi (who died in Avignon in 1571) and bore the same name as the saint. In any case, the statue is included in Strozzi inventory in 1632, described as a \\"San Lorenzo above a modern gridiron\\". Creation The sculpture was created from a single block of Carrara marble. Restoration in 1997 revealed that Bernini used different tools to create different surface textures on various parts of the sculpture. The reverse side of the gridiron has not been polished and finished in the same way as the front, implying that the artwork was clearly meant to be seen from the front only. A highly sculpted pedestal, made of wood and gilded with golden paint, was designed as a platform for the sculpture. There is a possibility this was also executed by Bernini, although its design suggests that while it was a Strozzi family commission, it was done at a later date. Description and interpretation =Subject= The subject of the artwork is Lawrence of Rome, who was condemned to death by the Roman Emperor Valerian in the year 258 C.E. for defending the Christian faith. According to tradition, Lawrence was burnt to death by being placed on a gridiron. In depicting a highly naturalistic St Lawrence, tortured and yet undergoing some kind of spiritual epiphany, the sculpture presents a taste of many of the themes that Bernini would adopt during the course of his artistic oeuvre, and that would come to represent many of the most pertinent features of the artistic traditions in Italian Baroque art‚Äîthat of solitary figures undergoing intense emotional states, whilst being depicted with illusionistic verisimilitude. Unlike earlier depictions of Lawrence, there are no other figures‚Äîno sign of his judge, torturers or spectators witnessing in depth. Rather the focus is solely on the martyr and his emotional state. =Saint Lawrence's emotional state= Commentators have subtly varied in describing and interpreting the face of Lawrence. Domenico Bernini contextualised the creation with the anecdote that Bernini placed his actual hand in a flame and fashioned Lawrence‚Äôs expression from his own facial reaction seen in a mirror; thus implying that the focus of the portrait of Lawrence would be the physical pain. Yet later commentators have described Lawrence's face not as one of pain, but of being \\"tired\\" or more commonly of being spiritual rapt. To Howard Hibbard, the sculpture makes a clear religious statement of spiritual salvation‚Äîinner strength overcomes external bodily pain. Certainly, observation of the sculpture seems to bear this out. The martyr almost turns away from the pain, his upper body and head reaching upwards towards the skies, with his clear, almost peaceful eyes, focussed in the direction of God. Others take Bernini's depiction of Lawrence even further: describing the martyr as being \\"reclined on his left elbow languidly as any Roman banqueter\\", and thwarting his torturers with \\"a carved attitude of rapture\\". Another art historian, Avigdor Poseq, interprets the expression a little differently: ‚Äúthe calm face was apparently meant to convey the intensive of the martyr‚Äôs fear of God.‚Äù He continues by suggesting that Bernini presented Lawrence with an outstretched to hand to indicate the martyr‚Äôs desire to be turned over by his torturers, thus exposing even more of his flesh to the flames below. =Technical excellence= Twentieth-century commentators have largely agreed on the technical excellence of the sculpture. Rudolf Wittkower speaks of the ‚Äúhigh degree of technical perfection [and] the anatomical precision and an infallible sense for the organic coherence and structure of the human body.‚Äù Irving Lavin sees, in the flesh-like quality achieved with the marble, a criticism of Michelangelo, who mastered design and anatomy but not the appearance of flesh. The flames also receive attention. During the baroque period, the ability to represent to recreate nature, as in flames, water, flesh, in illusionistic marble would be a frequent challenge. Bernini's \\"attempt to represent leaping flames in sculpture is a tour de force\\" \\"depicting convincingly something as evanescent as flames, or as dependent on colour as glowing coals.\\" Daniele Pinton talks of the \\"skilful rendition of the flames under the gridiron, where the portrayal of an immaterial element such as fire is magnificently rendered in stone.\\" Charles Avery goes as far to see the technical innovation of the work as its raison-d‚Äô√™tre. He cites the piece‚Äôs naturalism, its emotional intensity, his use of subject never previously depicted as a full three-dimensional sculpture and concludes that ‚Äúthe work is a manifesto of his ability on the threshold of his adult career, much like the ‚Äòmaster piece‚Äô with which a craftsman matriculates into his guild.‚Äù Recent history At the start of the 1800s, the sculpture was moved to another Strozzi-owned palace in Rome, and then around 1830 it was moved to the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence.

Course  The Kr√§henbach rises some 200 m east of the clay pit in the Haldenwald forest in the municipality of Tuningen, next to a forest road at about . From there it flows northeast through the Haldenwald forest past a Celtic square earthwork, underneath the Bundesstra√üe B 523 and then across the fen into the municipality of Talheim. Here is reaches its northernmost point, a sharp turn to the southeast. Next to the K5919, it leaves its narrow valley and takes up the Zimmerth√§lebach from the right, and, less than 200m further, the Kr√§henbach the Greutgraben form the left. It then flows past two small lakes, the second of which is used as a swimming pool. If then takes up the Lachengraben from the right and flows through the village of Talheim. It then takes up the R√∂hrenbrunnenbach from the right, then turns to the east. At the Upper Mill outside the village of Weichbild, the direction changes back to southeast. Here, the stream is accompanied by the K5944 and the B 523 on the right bank. It flows through a valley with wooded slopes, past the G√∂tzenloch court on the left and the Lower Mill on the right, below the ruins of Klingenberg Castle. Past mount Reisenberg, the B 523 changes to the left bank. The Kr√§henbach then flows past mount Sommerbergs and takes up some minor tributaries on both sides, before flowing into the village E√ülingen in the municipality of Tuttlingen, which is the seat of the eponymous Landkreis. Some of the water is diverted into a several kilometers long mill stream, which rejoins the Kr√§henbach before E√ülingen Mill, right below a pass across which the B 523 continues into the adjacent Elta valley. At this point, the distance between the Kr√§henbach and the Elta is slightly more than 600 meters. The Tiefentalbach flows down from mount M√∂hringer Berg through a wooded valley and joins the Kr√§henbach from the right, opposite E√ülingen Mill, which is situated below the ruins of Konzenberg Castle. Further downstream, a reservoir fills almost the entire width of the valley. The Kr√§henbach flows to the right of this reservoir and on through the B√§chetal valley. After a recent nature restoration project, the Kr√§henbach is once again able to meander through this valley. It then reaches the northern edge of the village of M√∂hringen an der Donau. This village is now part of Tuttlingen and lies in the floodplain on the left side of the Danube. Inside M√∂hringen, the Kr√§henbach takes up a stream coming down from the K√ºhltal valley on the right. In summer, when all of the water of the upper Danube disappears into the Danube Sinkhole, the Kr√§henbach is the first river to provide water to the dry Danube bed.

Specifically, in the context of an Islamic worldview, thawab refers to spiritual merit or reward that accrues from the performance of good deeds and piety.  Pronunciation  The word thawab is used throughout the Islamic world, so the spelling and pronunciation is slightly different from one region to another. In Kazakh society, for instance, it may be pronounced as \\"sauap\\", in Iran as \\"savab\\", in Arab areas as \\"thawab\\" and in India and Pakistan as \\"savab\\" or \\"sawab\\". In Bosnian and Turkish the word becomes sevap. The word becomes suab in Bengali.  Activities for earning thawab  Usually any and all good acts are considered to contribute towards earning sawab, but for a Muslim there are certain acts that are more rewarding than others. The primary contributing factor on the extent of the reward is based on one's intention in one's heart - the silent, unspoken one that God is aware of and not the expressed, articulated one. These may be one and the same, but the articulation is not required prior to performing the deed. The meritorious acts in Islam can be divided into categories - the spiritual good and the moral good. There cannot be moral good without the spiritual good. Or at least the moral good will not have a high bearing if not accompanied by the spiritual good. Spiritual good includes the acts of worship including Prayer (obligatory and supererogatory), remembrance of God in the aftermath of the prayer or at any other time, acts of prescribed charity (zakat), reading of the Quran, among others. The moral good comes from treating parents with love and affection, and not with disdain; visiting sick people, keeping ties of kinship, spending money wisely in charitable causes, giving family their due rights, etc. The relative merits of each act lies with God alone, and is dependent on such factors as the extent of the level of sacrifice, the difficulty endured (or that one would endure from doing the good), intention for benefits in the hereafter, etc. See also * Islamic views on piety *Punya - Hindu view of Sawab/Heavenly merit. *Heavenly Merit - Christian view of sawab.

A leader in the New Ink Painting Movement, Chou was at the forefront of reinventing traditional ink paintings into a contemporary art form. Her contribution to ink paintings has made an impact both regionally and internationally, making way for modern ink paintings in the global art scene.  Life and work  Irene Chou was born in Shanghai, where she studied economics at St. John‚Äôs University. Upon graduating in 1945, Chou worked as a journalist for Peace Daily Shanghai. Thereafter she left for Taipei in Taiwan and in 1949 for Hong Kong. Her mother, a professional calligrapher gave her the first leson.The Universe is My Mind - Irene Chou (ÂÆáÂÆô‰æøÊòØÂêæÂøÉ - Âë®Á∂†Èõ≤), Hong Kong (È¶ôÊ∏Ø): Hanart TZ Gallery (Êº¢ÈõÖËªí), 2000. She began to learn painting formally in 1954 when she became a student of Zhao Shao‚Äôang, a master of the traditional Lingnan school of painting. In her traditional landscape and bird-and-flower paintings Chou demonstrated a solid grounding in traditional Chinese painting methods such as qiyun (spirit-resonance) and moqi (ink-play). She said to have found inspiration in the study of qi-gong. Paintings by Irene Chou (Âë®Á∂†Èõ≤Áï´Â±ï), Catalogue, Hanart 2 Gallery, Hong Kong (È¶ôÊ∏Ø): Hanart 2 Gallery (Êº¢ÈõÖËªí), 1989. Initially Chou drew influences from bright Chinese opera folk paintings and Great Seal Style calligraphy. The use of calligraphic lines in her work was informed by years of studying calligraphy and traditional Chinese ink painting techniques, especially the 'Storm Drum' script, which was first used to inscribe stones during the Qin dynasty (221-206BCE). Although Chou started her career working with more traditional Chinese painting methods and styles through landscape and bird-and-flower paintings, she later experimented with various techniques and paints as she moved away from more conventional ink paintings and the popular Lingnan style. In the late 1960s Chou get touched with abstract expressionism. The progressive theories on art and ink painting of her colleague Lui Shou-Kwan of the Lingnan School inspired her to experiment with different techniques and various types of paint, including oil, acrylic and watercolor. Kathy Zhang mentioned that artists working in this vein followed Lui‚Äôs precepts and combined Western and Chinese art. Chou explored the ‚Äúsplash ink‚Äù technique, the layered ‚Äúpiled ink‚Äù technique, and pointillism in her works in the 1970s. However, her signature mark became the ‚Äúone-stroke‚Äù technique she applied to her abstract paintings, which was reminiscent of the New Ink style that was becoming popular in Hong Kong in the 1980s. Through her work, she attempted to combine Western and Chinese art while simultaneously paying homage to Chinese traditional art. Irene Chou was the Hong Kong representative for the United Nation's Women's Liberation.The Universe is My Heart, My Heart is the Universe. Catalogue, Hong Kong Art Center, February 2003. . After the death of her mentor Lui Shou-Kwan in 1975 and her husband in 1978, the style of Chou‚Äôs work changed fundamentally. But this depression gave her enormous energy and so her style became bolder and more spontaneous. Her works from this period were informed by her exposure to abstract expressionism, Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism. Her works of the 1980s were representative of the New Ink style emerging in Hong Kong. Her works in the 1980s demonstrate her mastery of a range of techniques associated with both the ‚Äòimpact structural strokes‚Äô ‚Äì the artist‚Äôs distinctive violent and short brushstrokes associated with her Impact series style and the dense ink associated with her ‚ÄòDark Painting‚Äô style developed in the late 1970s. The artist carefully applied multiple layers of ink wash to both sides of the thin xuan paper (rice paper), systematically creating a sense of structure and depth, while forming a dark, thick and concentrated ink layer with a luminous surface and soft tones. In the 1980s she won several awards and became a key figure in the contemporary Hong Kong art scene. At age 67, Chou experienced a life-threatening stroke, and after intensive physiotherapy, she moved to Brisbane, Australia, from Hong Kong to be closer to her son. This experience led her to have a more melancholy approach to her art in this decade as Chou depicted images of rebirth on blackened backgrounds. In the following years she studied Buddhism and got interested in Aboriginal painting. The paintings were dark \\" I am not afraid of using black as some people are. ...In fact black is part of me the person\\". In the early 21st century her work became lighter and clearer with contrasting colors. She died in Brisbane, aged 87.

Biography Archibald Galloway was born in Perth, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of James Galloway of that city and region. He obtained a cadetship in 1799, and on 29 October 1800 was appointed ensign in the 14th Bengal native infantry. He afterwards served in the 29th, 10th, and 2nd Bengal native infantry regiments, and was gazetted colonel of the 58th Bengal native infantry on 22 September 1836. Galloway took part in the defence of Delhi, and distinguished himself greatly by his gallantry at the siege of Bhurtpore. He was appointed by Lord William Bentinck a member of the military board, and was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 20 July 1838 in Queen Victoria's Coronation Honours.(London Gazette, 1838, ii. 1661). On 24 Sept. 1840 he was elected a director of the East India Company, and on 23 Nov. 1841 received the rank of major-general. He was created a K.C.B. when knighted by Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace on 25 August 1848,(ib. 1848, iii. 3157) and in the following year became Chairman of the Honourable East India Company. He died at his home in 18 Upper Harley Street, London, on 6 April 1850, aged 71. He left three sons and six daughters. An engraved portrait of Sir Archibald Galloway was published by Dickinson of New Bond Street in August 1850. He Honors and Credits Galloway was thanked for his many and varied services to the Indian government by \\"commanders-in-chief in India on nine different occasions, and by the supreme government of India, or the court of directors, and superior authorities in England on upwards of thirty occasions\\".Gent. Mag. new ser. xxxiii. 660 He married Adelaide Campbell in Calcutta India on 28 November 1815.(IOR Ref: N/1/9 f.271). He was by then a Captain in the H.C.S. and 36 years of age. Prior to this marriage, he had fathered two sons by an unknown partner/wife, named James and George.(IOR Ref: N/1/10 f.85) There was a recorded Baptism for James age 10 years and George age 9 years dated 14 Jan 1816, about six weeks after his marriage to Adelaide Campbell. James was born about 1806 and died 17 March 1841 aged 32 in Bengal India. Younger brother George was born about 1807. George married Rebecca Baldwin on 17 December 1833 in the Calcutta Cathedral (India Office Records Reference: N/1/36 f.104) George Galloway was the great grandfather of Mary Blanche Gertrude Galloway who married Vernon Hope French in Rangoon on 16 September 1906.

Notes on the Siege of Delhi in 1804, with Observations on the position of the Indian Government under the Marquess of Wellesley, 8vo. 3. On Sieges of India. This work is said to have been reprinted, on the recommendation of General Mudge, by the court of directors, and used at their military college, and to have been distributed to the army for general instruction by the orders of the Marquis of Hastings (ib. p. 661). 4.

Kisters Collection at Kreuzlingen. It is signed \\"TICI/ANVS F.\\" and depicts Laura Dianti, lover and later wife of Alfonso I d'Este. Titian painted several portraits of Dianti, perhaps including the Woman with a Mirror, now at the Louvre. In this one, she wears a sumptuous blue dress, jewellery and a diadem. Her right arm runs down the side of her body while her left hand rests on the shoulder of an African page boy. History Vasari mentions a portrait of Dianti, which was engraved by E. Sadler. Ridolfi, in 1648, described the work based on the engraving. There are several copies and versions of the painting, one of which (generally thought to be the autograph version) was sent in 1599 from Cesare d'Este to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. In 1649, it was in the collection of Christina of Sweden, who brought it to Rome in 1654. It then passed into the collections of Decio Azzolino, then (in 1686) of prince Odescalchi, then (in 1721) Philip of Orleans. In 1800, it was in an English collection and in 1876, it was in the Cook collection before arriving in the Kisters collection in Kreuzlingen. Modern criticism previously held the work to be an autograph copy of a lost original, like the versions at the Galleria Estense in Modena, the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the Galleria Borghese in Rome and several private collections. After a restoration in America, which revealed the signature on the sleeve, it is again thought to be the original work. The work was paired with a portrait of Alfonso I d'Este, which is now lost but of which several copies survive, the best perhaps being that at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.
