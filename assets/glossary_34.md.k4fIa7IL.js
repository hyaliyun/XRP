Its theme is the loss of privacy in the Internet age.  Synopsis  The film details the experiences of \\"the greatest Internet pioneer you've never heard of,\\" Josh Harris. The dot-com millionaire founded Pseudo.com, the first Internet television network during the infamous tech boom of the late '90s. After achieving prominence amongst the Silicon Alley set, Harris became interested in controversial human experiments which tested the effects of media and technology on the development of personal identity. Ondi Timoner documented the major business-related moments of Harris' life for more than a decade, setting the tone for her documentary of the virtual world and its supposed control of human lives. Among Harris' experiments touched on in the film is the art project \\"Quiet: We Live in Public,\\" an Orwellian, Big Brother concept developed in the late '90s which placed more than 100 artists in a human terrarium under New York City, with myriad webcams following and capturing every move the artists made. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was a Japanese- style capsule hotel outfitted with cameras in every pod, and screens that allowed each occupant to monitor the other pods installed in the basement by artist Jeff Gompertz, co-founder of the media art group Fakeshop.Fakeshop presented both site-specific and online work in the Whitney Biennial 2000. The film's website describes how, \\"With Quiet, Harris proved how, in the not-so- distant future of life online, we will willingly trade our privacy for the connection and recognition we all deeply desire. Through his experiments, including another six-month stint living under 24-hour live surveillance online which led him to mental collapse, he demonstrated the price we will all pay for living in public.\\" \\"He climbs into the TV set and he becomes the rat in his own experiment at this point, and the results don't turn out very well for him,\\". says Timoner of the six-month period Harris broadcast live, online his life in his NYC loft. \\"He really takes the only relationship that he's ever had that was close and intimate and beaches it on 30 motion-controlled surveillance cameras and 66 invasive microphones. I mean his girlfriend who signed on to it thinking it would be fun and cool, and that they were living a fast and crazy Internet life, she ended up leaving him. She just couldn't be intimate in public. And I think that's an important lesson; the Internet, as wonderful as it is, is not an intimate medium. It's just not. If you want to keep something intimate and if you want to keep something sacred, you probably shouldn't post it.\\" The film includes commentary from Internet personalities Chris DeWolfe, Jason Calacanis, Douglas Rushkoff, and venture capitalist Fred Wilson, as well as artists and producers involved in the \\"Quiet: We Live in Public\\" event V. Owen Bush, Jeff Gompertz, Leo Fernekes, Feedbuck, Leo Koenig, Gabriella Latessa, Alex Arcadia, Zeroboy, Alfredo Martinez, and others.  Awards  We Live in Public was screened six times at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival before being awarded the Grand Jury Prize award in the U.S. documentary category. Timoner is the first director in the Sundance Film Festival's history to win the Grand Jury Prize award twice. Her first win was for the widely acclaimed documentary, DIG! (2004). We Live In Public was also the runner-up for Best Documentary at the 2009 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.  Critical response  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 81% approval rating, based on 48 reviews. The critics consensus says, \\"This documentary about Josh Harris' surveillance-as-art project exposes the problems of privacy in the internet age and asks provocative questions about the power of ego in a place where everything is on display.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, his highest rating, and wrote, \\"This is a remarkable film about a strange and prophetic man.\\"review by Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times, October 14, 2009  References  External links   * 2009 films 2009 documentary films English-language films American documentary films American films Sundance Film Festival award winners Documentary films about computer and internet entrepreneurs Films directed by Ondi Timoner Documentary films about the Internet ","title":"We Live in Public"},{"id":"21254185","title":"134th meridian east"},{"id":"21254203","text":":For the African species called ocellated gecko, see Pachydactylus geitje The ocellated gecko, ocellated sphaero, or stippled sphaero, (Sphaerodactylus argus) is a species of gecko found in the Caribbean.

Ellis was born on 20 August 1860 in Pitsmoor, Sheffield, Yorkshire. He was the son of John Devonshire Ellis (1824‚Äì1906) and, his wife, Elizabeth Bourne. In 1889 Ellis married Lucy Rimington, the daughter of Francis William Tetley who was a director of Joshua Tetley & Son, the brewery in Leeds. Together they had two sons and two daughters. Ellis was a steel maker and in 1914 was elected Master Cutler, the head of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire and ambassador of industry for Sheffield. His tenure as Master Cutler, a position which usually changes each year, lasted until 1918 due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1918 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering by the University of Sheffield. Ellis was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the November 1925 to November 1926 session.. On 28 June 1926 he was appointed by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford, to sit on a commission which had been established to enquire into the conditions of mining and drainage in the county borough Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The commission was a tribunal of inquiry as established by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921 and was to establish what effect mining had had on drainage in the area, what the current efficiency of land drainage systems was and how best to manage the issue in the future.

Plot  Tessibel Skinner is a young woman in a squatter village on the coast, where she lives with her father, a local fisherman. Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves‚Äô men is shot and killed. Tess‚Äô father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias‚Äô son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick‚Äôs sister, Teola. Soon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan. Her decision is made for her soon enough, as she receives a letter informing her that Dan has died heroically in a fire at the fraternity. Unable to confide in her very stern father, Teola is distraught and turns to Tess for support. Once the baby is born, Tess agrees to take the child and bear the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock. Upon his return, Frederick is forced to shun Tess for her sin despite his remaining love for her. Soon, however, Teola‚Äôs baby falls ill and Tess decides to take him up to Elias‚Äô church to be baptized. Disgusted by Tess and the child, Elias refuses, shaming them publicly. Teola, having witnessed her father‚Äôs anger, decides to step forward and admit the truth about her child. Tess is forgiven and it is decided that Teola will die with her son. Meanwhile, the true murderer is found, allowing Tess‚Äô father to be released from prison. Production The film was produced in 1914 by Adolf Zukor's Famous Players Film Company with a budget of $10,000. One of the first feature films to come out of early Hollywood, shooting was spread between the California cities of Del Mar and Santa Monica. When Zukor gave Mary Pickford the script to Tess of the Storm Country, she had to be persuaded to take the lead role. The script was based on a successful novel of the same name by Grace Miller White, but it eliminated much of the book's moral pieties, complexity, and regional dialect. What was left‚Äîand what gave Pickford pause‚Äîwas melodramatic, clich√©d, and direct. Pickford eventually accepted the role due to the popularity of White's novel, but she chaffed under Edwin S. Porter's direction. She later told a film historian that Porter \\"knew nothing about directing. Nothing.\\" The aging Porter was still employing an outdated approach to film-making that worked so successfully him in films like The Great Train Robbery (1903). For example, he resisted using camera movement to his advantage, decorated his sets with painted backdrops, refused to take advantage of film's illusion of depth, and relied heavily on intertitles to deliver narrative. Pickford, one of the most influential pioneers in film-making and acting, was used to working collaboratively with directors and cinematographers to get the best shot. She was also adept at modulating for the camera, commanding attention within a frame, and enchanting audiences. While Porter refused to consider Pickford's suggestions, she delivered a stunning performance and helped turn the film into a resounding success. She later pointed to the film as \\"the beginning of my career.\\"  Distribution  The film first released in US theaters on March 30, 1914 and was rapidly successful, particularly in propelling the fame of its star, Mary Pickford, to new heights. Distribution was handled by producer Daniel Frohman, one of the original founders of the Famous Players Film Company. The film survives today due to the preservation efforts of the Mary Pickford Foundation and the film archives of UCLA.

In 2005 they won the contract to supply the Canadian Forces Land Command with the C14 Timberwolf MRSWS for $4.5 million.Canadian Forces Award Canadian Sniper Rifle Contract Canadian Forces News release NR‚Äì05.040 - May 26, 2005 (Accessed Feb. 5, 2009) The military version of the rifle, which is being used to replace the C3A1 sniper rifle, started as a civilian precision sport rifle. The military rifle, however, has several modifications to make it better suited for military use, and many accessories are available. The official military designation for the rifle is C14 Timberwolf Medium Range Sniper Weapon System (MRSWS).  History  The Timberwolf rifle was originally developed as a civilian long range hunting and sport shooting rifle for super magnum cartridges by the Canadian company Prairie Gun Works, now PGW Defence Technologies Inc. The civilian Timberwolf rifle is offered in several chamberings, up to the .408 Cheyenne Tactical cartridge and the .416 PGW cartridge, a wildcat cartridge based on the .408 Cheyenne Tactical. These rifle cartridges are dimensionally larger and are more powerful when compared to the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge used in the C14 Timberwolf used by the Canadian military. During the 1990s the Canadian Armed Forces formulated a requirement for a sniper rifle that could fulfill an anti-personnel role up to 1,200 m (1,312 yd). This long-range anti-personnel rifle would replace the aging C3A1 bolt-action rifle which fired the smaller 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge which had been in service since the 1950s. In 2001 during trials for new sniper rifles at CFB Gagetown, the C14 Timberwolf MRSWS was picked to become the new designated anti-personnel sniper rifle for the Canadian Forces. The C14 Timberwolf MRSWS went into production for the Canadian Forces Land Command in 2005. Since the introduction of the C14 Timberwolf MRSWS, the C3A1 rifle has been slowly removed from active service. The C14 Timberwolf MRSWS is now the main sniper rifle in the Canadian Armed Forces arsenal. It is highly rated by snipers, who like the rifle itself as well as the additional effective range and penetration the .338 Lapua Magnum offers over the C3A1's 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge. The C14 Timberwolf's accuracy potential is stated by its manufacturer as sub 0.75 MOA with proper ammunition. The Canadian Forces accuracy standard was evaluated by hit probability with a requirement of hitting a chest sized target at 1,200 m (1,312 yd) 90% of the time. PGW Defence Technologies Inc. averaged over 95% on this standard and every weapon delivered under the Canadian Armed Forces contract was evaluated for accuracy and witnessed by DND officials.  Design details  The C14 Timberwolf MRSWS rifle is chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum rifle cartridge. The rifle achieves a maximum muzzle velocity of 838 m/s (2750 ft/s) with 19.44 g (300 gr) Sierra Matchking very-low-drag bullet loads. Such loads are much more powerful compared to the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge used in the C3A1 rifle which typically fires 11.3 g (175 gr) bullets at 790 m/s (2580 ft/s). = Operating mechanism = PGWDTI Timberwolf bolt-action The Timberwolf action is a manually operated stainless steel bolt action with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and stops bolt debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when chambering another round. Though not used by the Canadian military, the manufacturer offers a titanium receiver as an alternative for the stainless steel used in the C14 receiver. The use of titanium reduces the weight of the Timberwolf bolt-action. The single stage trigger is adjustable for weight, creep, and over-travel. = Barrel = The barrel for the MRSWS is a modified, heavy free floating Krieger made barrel. It comes in 660 mm (26 in) standard but a 737 mm (29 in) custom barrel is fitted to the civilian precision hunting rifle variant, however this can be used on the military version as well. The 338 Lapua Magnum barrels are supplied with a 254 mm (1 in 10 inch) twist rate optimized to stabilize long, heavy very-low-drag bullets like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing and Lapua Scenar .338-calibre 19.44 gram (300 grain) bullets. The barrels are cryogenic stress relieved and partly helically fluted which reduces weight whilst maintaining most of the structural strength and contains a detachable proprietary stainless steel muzzle brake that reduces the recoil. = Safety = The safety is a three-position type safety featuring a middle \\"field strip\\" position. = Feeding = It has a five-round detachable box magazine which is positioned just ahead of the trigger guard. = Sights = The rifle has no default iron sights but it is instead fitted with a length of integral picatinny rail with a 25 MOA forward slope on which an optical sight can be mounted. It also contains two small lengths of MIL-STD-1913 or Picatinny rail at the forefront of the stock. The Canadian Forces use a Leupold Mark 4 16x40mm LR/T M1 Riflescope as standard, but other day telescopic sights and night sights can be fitted. Simrad night sights are mounted by custom scope ring sets and UNS or MUNS night sights are mounted via a PGWDTI proprietary mount. Tactical lights and lasers can be fitted to the two front lengths of MIL-STD-1913 rail. = Stock = The stock is a McMillan A5 polymer stock which has an adjustable saddle cheekpiece and spacer plates to regulate the length of pull to tailor the stock for the individual shooter. It is an upgraded version from the M40A3 McMillan A3 type stock.

He emigrated to Boston, MA, in the USA in 1881. By 1898, working in Hopedale, Massachusetts for George Draper and Sons he had filed several hundred patents some of which were used in the Northrop Loom. He retired at 42. He died in Santa Ana, California on 12 December 1940, at 84. Working life A Draper loom showing a Northrop filling-changing battery (the cylinder of pirns) in Bamberg, South Carolina He started his working life in England, where he was a mechanic and factory foreman before emigrating to Massachusetts in 1881. He moved to Hopedale, Massachusetts to work for George Draper and Sons. Here he invented the Northrop spooler guide. He unsuccessfully tried to be a chicken farmer. And it was there he worked on his shuttle-charger for Mr Otis Draper, who saw a model of the device on March 5, 1889. Draper was also developing the Rhoades shuttle-charger. Northrop was given a loom to test his idea. By May 20 he had concluded that his first idea was not practical, and had thought of another idea, On July 5, the completed loom was running, and as it seemed to have more advantages than the Rhoades loom. The Northrop device was given a mill trial in October 1889 at the Seaconnett Mills in Fall River. More looms were constructed. Meanwhile he invented a self-threading shuttle and shuttle spring jaws to hold a bobbin by means of rings on the butt. This paved the way to his filling-changing battery of 1891, the basic feature of the Northrop Loom. The development of a workable warp stop motion by other members of the Draper organization and marketing of the first Northrop looms in 1894 the textile industry achieved new levels of production. By 1900, Draper had sold over 60,000 Northrop looms, They were shipping 1500 a month, were employing 2500 men and enlarging their works to increase that output. Personal life He married to Emily Driver of Keighley, Yorkshire and had 5 daughters. The Northrop loom sold well, so he was able to retire at the age of 42. He bought a fruit farm in Santa Ana, California where he grew dates and spent his time fishing.

Background In this book, Rossi criticizes the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argues that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our \\"collective memory\\"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city.

In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 21 April 2010, the company was awarded two Queen's Awards for Enterprise ‚Äì in the Innovation and International Trade categories. Brompton has now produced well over 100,000 bicycles and in 2008 achieved 25,000 units for export to markets such as the Netherlands, America, Germany, Japan and Scandinavia. A Cambridge engineering graduate, Ritchie was working as a landscape gardener in London when, in 1976, he conceived the idea for a folding bike, which he subsequently named after the Brompton Oratory.Laurance, Ben (7 August 2005) \\"The bicycle that turned into folding money\\".

Sunday TimesBrompton Official site ‚Äî People Early career After graduating in Engineering from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1968,Brompton official site, History Ritchie worked as a computer programmer for Elliott Automation which subsequently became part of Marconi. He then spent 5 years as a self-employed landscape gardener. In the mid-1970s his father, a stockbroker, introduced him to Bill Ingram and the Bickerton bike, which in turn triggered his own ideas for a folding bicycle. Ritchie persuaded 10 friends to invest ¬£100 each so that he could build a prototype which was completed one year later. Two more prototypes were built in the bedroom of his flat overlooking Brompton Oratory in South Kensington, London ‚Äì hence the bike's name. After failing to license the design to Raleigh Bicycle Company he managed to sell 30 bicycles to order for ¬£250 each in advance. Convinced that there had to be at least another 20 people willing to buy one, he produced 50 rather than just the 30. After 18 months, the bikes were delivered ‚Äì and all 50 were sold. In the early 1980s, Ritchie raised ¬£8,000 from shareholders, and made 500 bikes over 2 years. Bicycle manufacturer Ritchie received private funding of ¬£40,000 from Julian Vereker, founder of Naim Audio and a yacht manufacturer, who had originally bought two Bromptons after a chance discussion about 'folding bicycles' whilst on one of his yachts in Cherbourg in 1982. An additional ¬£10,000 equity raised from friends, relatives and Brompton owners launched the company properly in 1986, and he eventually secured ¬£100,000 to set up a better-equipped factory under a Brentford railway arch in 1987. It had taken five years to secure the capital. Volume production was difficult and demand outstripped the factory's capacity, so it expanded into a second railway arch in 1994 and again in 1998 into the Chiswick Park premises it occupied until moving to Greenford in 2016. Later life Ritchie has recruited new management since the early 2000s, including Will Butler-Adams who became managing director and, with new investors, purchased half of Ritchie's 50% shareholding. Ritchie acknowledges that Brompton has been his life.

It entailed the weakening the Turkish Cypriots in the government of Cyprus and then uniting (enosis) Cyprus with Greece. According to Turkish Cypriots, the plan was a \\"blueprint to genocide\\", but Greek Cypriots claimed that it was a defensive plan. Background Cyprus, an island lying in the eastern Mediterranean sea was ruled by several conquerors during its history. In the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire handed Cyprus to the British Empire. Greek and Turkish nationalism among the two major communities of the island (four-fifths of the population being Greek, one-fifth Turkish) were growing, seeking opposite goals. Greeks were demanding enosis (Cyprus to be united with Greece) while Turks were aiming for taksim (partition). In 1955, EOKA, a paramilitary guerilla group, declared its struggle against the British. In 1960, the British gave in and turned power over to the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. A powersharing constitution was created for the new Republic of Cyprus and included both Turkish and Greek Cypriots holding power. Three treaties were written up to guarantee the integrity and security of the new republic: the Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Guarantee and the Treaty of Alliance. According to the constitution, Cyprus was to become an independent republic with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president, with full powersharing between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Akritas organisation and plan  Akritas organisation (or EOK) was a secret group led by prominent members of the Greek Cypriot community, some of them being cabinet ministers. It was formed in 1961 or 1962, in the eve of the creation of Cyprus Republic, and aimed to achieve enosis. It was formed on the command of President Archbishop Makarios, with Glafkos Klerides, Tassos Papadopoulos and Polycarpos Georgadjis having key roles. Guerillas were recruited by former members of EOKA. Apart from communists, who were excluded as in the EOKA's struggle, the organisation had hostile feelings for Greek Cypriots who failed to accept Makarios as their leader leader, which included ultranationalists who rejected the London-Z√ºrich Agreements. EOK had striking similarities with EOKA, from the structure and the division to tomeis, and its name was also coined to resemble that of EOKA. A joint military exercise was performed in presidential resident in Troodos mountain, along with Greek ELDYK in 1962, other military exercises of smaller-scale also took place in 1962 and 1963. The plan was an inner document that was publicly revealed in 1966 by pro-Grivas Greek Cypriot newspaper Patris as a response to criticism by pro-Makarios media. It provided a pathway on how to change the constitution of the Cyprus Republic unilaterally, without Turkish Cypriot concent, and to declare enosis with Greece. Because it was expected that Turkish Cypriot would object and revolt, a paramilitary group of several thousand men was formed and began its training. According to the copy of the plan, it consisted of two main sections, one delineating external tactics and the other delineating internal tactics. The external tactics pointed to the Treaty of Guarantee as the first objective of an attack, with the statement that it was no longer recognised by Greek Cypriots. If the Treaty of Guarantee was abolished, there would be no legal roadblocks to enosis, which would happen through a plebiscite. It is unknown who authored the plan or to what extent Makarios was committed to it. Frank Hoffmeister cited the historian Tzermias to support the notion that Makarios had nothing to do with the plan, but Hoffmeister mentioned John Reddaway and Etrekun, claiming that Makarios had approved the plan. The plan is signed by \\"Chief Akritas\\" (ŒëœÅœáŒ∑Œ≥œåœÇ ŒëŒ∫œÅŒØœÑŒ±œÇ). According to Hoffmeister, the plan was drawn by the minister of the interior, Polycarpos Georgadjis. Angelos Chrysostomou, in his PhD thesis, wrote that Glafkos Klerides and Christodoulos Christodoulou, a top member of Akritas organisation, pointed to Tassos Papadopoulos as the author of the document. There is also controversy about when the document was formulated, but the most probable was late 1963.  1963 events in Cyprus  In November 1963, Greek Cypriot leader Makarios proposed thirteen amendments to change the constitution. The proposals resemble the first part of the Akritas plan. Bloody Christmas violence led to the deaths of 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots. Akritas organization's forces took part in the fighting. About a quarter of the Turkish Cypriots, some 25,000 or so, fled their homes and lands and moved into enclaves.  Controversy and opinions  Greek Cypriot sources have accepted the authenticity of the Akritas plan, but controversy regarding its significance and implications persists. It is a subject of debate whether the plan was actually implemented by Makarios. Frank Hoffmeister wrote that the similarity of the military and political actions foreseen in the plan and undertaken in reality was \\"striking\\". According to Paul Sant-Cassia, the plan \\"purported to project a plan at ethnic cleansing\\", in parallel to the Turkish Cypriot perception that the events of 1963-1964 were part of a policy of extermination. Turkish Cypriot nationalist narratives have presented the plan as a \\"blueprint for genocide\\", and it is widely perceived as a plan for extermination among Turkish Cypriots. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls the plan a \\"conspiracy to dissolve the Republic of Cyprus, in pre- determined stages and methods, and to bring about the union of Cyprus with Greece\\". According to the scholar Niyazi Kƒ±zƒ±ly√ºrek, however, the meaning later given to the plan was disproportionate, and the plan was a \\"stupid\\" and impractical plan that got more attention than it deserved because of propaganda. He claimed that in accordance to the plan, ELDYK troops should have taken action, which was not the case and led to Georgadjis shouting \\"traitors!\\" in front of their camp. Calling the plan \\"infamous\\", the scholar Evanthis Hatzivassiliou wrote that the aim of quick victory indicated the \\"confusion and wishful thinking of the Greek Cypriot side at that crucial moment\\".

In many these spin states vary between high-spin and low-spin configurations. These configurations can be understood through the two major models used to describe coordination complexes; crystal field theory and ligand field theory, which is a more advanced version based on molecular orbital theory.  High-spin vs. low-spin = Octahedral complexes = Low-spin [Fe(NO2)6]3‚àí crystal field diagram The Œî splitting of the d orbitals plays an important role in the electron spin state of a coordination complex. There are three factors that affect the Œî: the period (row in periodic table) of the metal ion, the charge of the metal ion, and the field strength of the complex's ligands as described by the spectrochemical series. In order for low spin splitting to occur, the energy cost of placing an electron into an already singly occupied orbital must be less than the cost of placing the additional electron into an eg orbital at an energy cost of Œî. If the energy required to pair two electrons is greater than the energy cost of placing an electron in an eg, Œî, high spin splitting occurs. If the separation between the orbitals is large, then the lower energy orbitals are completely filled before population of the higher orbitals according to the Aufbau principle. Complexes such as this are called \\"low-spin\\" since filling an orbital matches electrons and reduces the total electron spin. If the separation between the orbitals is small enough then it is easier to put electrons into the higher energy orbitals than it is to put two into the same low-energy orbital, because of the repulsion resulting from matching two electrons in the same orbital. So, one electron is put into each of the five d orbitals before any pairing occurs in accord with Hund's rule resulting in what is known as a \\"high-spin\\" complex. Complexes such as this are called \\"high-spin\\" since populating the upper orbital avoids matches between electrons with opposite spin. High-spin [FeBr6]3‚àí crystal field diagram Within a transition metal group moving down the series corresponds with an increase in Œî. The observed result is larger Œî splitting for complexes in octahedral geometries based around transition metal centers of the second or third row, periods 5 and 6 respectively. This Œî splitting is generally large enough that these complexes do not exist as high-spin state. This is true even when the metal center is coordinated to weak field ligands. It is only octahedral coordination complexes which are centered on first row transition metals that fluctuate between high and low-spin states. The charge of the metal center plays a role in the ligand field and the Œî splitting. The higher the oxidation state of the metal, the stronger the ligand field that is created. In the event that there are two metals with the same d electron configuration, the one with the higher oxidation state is more likely to be low spin than the one with the lower oxidation state. For example, Fe2+ and Co3+ are both d6; however, the higher charge of Co3+ creates a stronger ligand field than Fe2+. All other things being equal, Fe2+ is more likely to be high spin than Co3+. Ligands also affect the magnitude of Œî splitting of the d orbitals according to their field strength as described by the spectrochemical series. Strong-field ligands, such as CN‚àí and CO, increase the Œî splitting and are more likely to be low-spin. Weak-field ligands, such as I‚àí and Br‚àí cause a smaller Œî splitting and are more likely to be high-spin. = Tetrahedral complexes = The Œî splitting energy for tetrahedral metal complexes (four ligands), Œîtet is smaller than that for an octahedral complex. It is unknown to have a Œîtet sufficient to overcome the spin pairing energy. Tetrahedral complexes are always high spin. There are no known ligands powerful enough to produce the strong-field case in a tetrahedral complex. = Square planar complexes = Most spin-state transitions are between the same geometry, namely octahedral. However, in the case of d8 complexes is a shift in geometry between spin states. There is no possible difference between the high and low- spin states in the d8 octahedral complexes. However, d8 complexes are able to shift from paramagnetic tetrahedral geometry to a diamagnetic low-spin square planar geometry. Ligand field theory vs Crystal field theory The rationale for why the spin states exist according to ligand field theory is essentially the same as the crystal field theory explanation. However the explanation of why the orbitals split is different accordingly with each model and requires translation.  High-spin and low-spin systems  The first d electron count (special version of electron configuration) with the possibility of holding a high spin or low spin state is octahedral d4 since it has more than the 3 electrons to fill the non-bonding d orbitals according to ligand field theory or the stabilized d orbitals according to crystal field splitting. ;d4: :Octahedral high-spin: 4 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile.

He was the founder of JupiterResearch and Pseudo.com, a live audio and video webcasting website founded in 1993, which filed for bankruptcy following the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000. He \\"may have been the first internet millionaire in New York,\\" where \\"he rode the web 1.0 dotcom boom to a fortune of $85 million,\\" and then lost all his money. Early life Josh Harris was born circa 1960. He grew up in Ventura, California. His father worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) while his mother was a social worker. He has three brothers and three sisters. Harris majored in communications at UC San Diego and later was a graduate student at the University of Southern California's (USC) Annenberg School for Communication.Charles Platt (writer): Steaming Video Wired 8.11, November 2000 Career Harris founded the technology market research consulting firm Jupiter Communications, now known as JupiterResearch, in 1986.

Funded by Intel, the Tribune Company, Prospect Street Ventures, and Prodigy, under Harris' leadership as Chairman Pseudo \\"burned through $32 million in two years,\\" more than \\"$2 million in cash a month,\\" and was seen as emblematic of the dot-com excesses as it \\"fabulously flamed out.\\" CEO Larry Lux left in 1999 after disagreements with Harris. Lux raised $20 million during a nine month tenure where he introduced more mainstream content. Former CNNfn executive, David Bohrman, was brought in as CEO in 2000 to ready the company for an initial public offering. Bohrman raised $14 million in funding led by LVMH Moet-Hennessey Louis Vuitton's media group, Desfosses International, but \\"was unable to secure a $40 million round of investments that would have kept Pseudo afloat.\\" In September 2001 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early 2001 it was bought in bankruptcy court by INTV for $2 million. Harris owned and operated Livingston Orchards, LLC, a commercial apple farm in Columbia County, New York from 2001‚Äì2006.

After a few months Corrin left Harris and the project citing mental and emotional stress. Harris continued \\"living in public\\" for a few more weeks, finally ending the site due to the mental, personal, and financial losses the project caused him. On the Swedish TV show Kobra, Harris stated that he had been widely influenced by the 1998 film The Truman Show. He strongly believes that the technological singularity will be reached and the human being will cease to be an individual, while the machine becomes the new king of the jungle. In 2001, an episode of director Errol Morris' First Person television series centered on Harris and the weliveinpublic.com project. Harris was the focus of director Ondi Timoner's documentary film, We Live in Public, an entry at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival that was awarded the Grand Jury Prize award in the US documentary category. Harris was the CEO of The Wired City, an internet television network which would allow viewers to interact with each other, based in New York City. In 2011, he ran a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to resurrect The Wired City. In 2011, he made a pitch to run the MIT Media Lab promoting technological singularity.

Activists called on participants to wear black and stay home on the day of the strike. Bloggers and citizen journalists used Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, blogs and other new media tools to report on the strike, alert their networks about police activity, organize legal protection and draw attention to their efforts. The New York Times has identified the movement as the political Facebook group in Egypt with the most dynamic debates. , it had 70,000 predominantly young and educated members, most of whom had not been politically active before; their core concerns include free speech, nepotism in government and the country's stagnant economy. Their discussion forum on Facebook features intense and heated discussions, and is constantly updated with new postings. The April 6 movement is using the same raised fist symbol as the Otpor! movement from Serbia, that helped bring down the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and whose nonviolent tactics were later used in Ukraine and Georgia. Mohammed Adel, a leader in the April 6 movement, studied at the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, an organization founded by former Otpor! members. The movement was banned by an Egyptian court on 28 April 2014. The Constitution Party condemned the verdict, arguing that the charges against the movement were \\"false\\" and that the court ruling was an example of state institutions undermining and destroying the rule of law. Hamdeen Sabahi's presidential campaign warned of the \\"return to a state of suppression and banning.\\" Abdul Ghaffar Shukr, vice president of the National Council for Human Rights, has stated that the council is prepared to stand in solidarity with the April 6 Youth Movement, and will aid the movement if it requests assistance.

Public activism and arrests Aside from online discussions of national issues, members of the group have organized public rallies to free imprisoned journalists and engaged in protests concerning the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. In its official pronouncements, the group stresses that it is not a political party. Ahmed Maher, one of the founders of the group, was arrested by the Egyptian authorities in May 2008 in an attempt to shut it down. In July 2008, Maher was again arrested, along with 14 other members of the group, and charged with \\"incitement against the regime\\". He also claimed that Egyptian state security officers threatened to rape him in custody. On 6 April 2009, the group was subjected to attacks, suspected to have been orchestrated by the Egyptian government. Several websites supporting the group were hacked simultaneously, and protests in Cairo were confronted by plain clothed Egyptian policemen and numerous arrests.Egyptian Chronicles.

In October 2011, the group launched a \\"black circle, white circle\\" political awareness campaign. Aiming to prevent former members of Mubarak's regime from winning seats in the post-revolution parliament, the group compiled a list of candidates with ties to the dissolved National Democratic Party or with histories of corruption, which comprised the \\"black circle.\\" Meanwhile, in the \\"white circle,\\" the group listed a set of qualifications and characteristics they hope to see in elected officials. On 29 March 2013, the Movement organized an extraordinary demonstration in front of the house of the Egyptian Minister of Interior: General Mohamed Ibrahim. The activists carried women's lingerie and a banner describing the Ministry of Interior as the \\"prostitute of the regime\\". Three of the movement activists were arrested: Abdel Azim Fahmy (Known by Zizo), Mohamed Mustapha and Mamdouh Hassan ( Known by Abou Adam). Later on a fourth activist was arrested and detained, Sayed Mounir. April 6 Movement called for a \\"Rage Day\\" against President Mohamed Mursi on the fifth anniversary of its establishment 6 April 2013. On 10 May 2013, Ahmed Maher was arrested at Cairo Airport upon his return to Egypt from a conference in the United States with charges of inciting for protests. Maher was released the day after, but the incident was a turning point. On 12 May, the 6 April Youth Movement decided to join the recently launched petitions collection campaign, Tamarod, calling for a vote of no-confidence in the administration of President Mohamed Morsi. In July 2013, following the military coup against President Morsi, members of 6 April participated in The Third Square, a movement created by liberal, leftist and moderate Islamist activists who reject both Muslim Brotherhood and military rule. Many April 6 members also played founding roles in the Road of the Revolution Front, an organization dedicated to achieving the revolutionary goals of bread, freedom, and social justice. In 2013, the 6 April movement held internal elections to determine who would succeed Ahmed Maher as the organization's coordinator. The vote resulted in Amr Ali, an accountant from Menufiya who has been involved in managing the group's community and public works, becoming the movement's new coordinator. Anti-Protest law campaign & arrest of movement founders The Egyptian interim president Adly Mansour, and regardless of the widespread critics, approved a new law restricting protests on 24 November 2013. The law was nationally and internationally heavily criticized with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urging the Egyptian government to amend it or repeal it. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon added his voice to those criticizing the law for leaving the door open to a very restrictive and repressive interpretation and urged the Egyptian authorities to consider amendments to the law \\"to make sure that any laws passed are in full conformity with international human rights standards\\". Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE), the third largest group in the European Parliament, criticized the new law > This anti-protest law is against everything the revolution was about. The > Egyptian government should withdraw it. On 26 November, the No Military Trials for Civilians campaign organised a protest at the Shura Council in defiance of the protest law. The protest was violently dispersed by the police, and dozens of well-known activists were arrested. The female activists were beaten and released on a desert road in the middle of the night, while the 24 male detainees remained in custody; most of whom were released on bail a week later. An arrest warrant was issued against Ahmed Maher on the following day, accusing him of inciting protests. Maher turned himself in and was detained on 30 November 2013. On 22 December 2013 an Egyptian court sentenced Ahmed Maher, Mohammed Adel, together with another prominent Egyptian activist, Ahmed Douma, to three years in jail and EGP50,000 fine each. Members of the April 6 movement and activists from other organizations have planned to initiate an open-ended sit-in with the intention of remaining in place until the protest law is repealed and the verdict sentencing Ahmed Maher, Mohamed Adel, and Ahmed Douma to three years in jail and the paymenent of a fine of LE50,000 have been overturned. Due to fears of a crackdown, the sit-in's timing and logistics have been rescheduled. =Reactions to the verdict= The verdicts were widely criticized nationally and internationally: The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human Rights condemned the sentence saying it contradicts the spirit of the 25 January revolution. The Constitution Party has expressed solidarity with the detainees and their families and requested that the interim President Adly Mansour issue a pardon to Ahmed Maher, Mohammed Adel, and Ahmed Douma, as well as to Loay Abdel Rahman, Omar Hussein, Islam Ahmed, and Nasser Ibrahim. The Egyptian Social Democratic Party, the Popular Current, the Bread and Freedom Party, and the Freedom for the Brave campaign have also lent their support to the cause of freedom for the imprisoned activists. Hamdeen Sabahi has censured the court conviction sentencing Ahmed Maher, Mohamed Adel and Ahmed Douma to three years in prison and a fine of LE50,000 and maintains that Interim President Adly Mansour should issue these and other detained individuals a pardon. The European Union: \\"The High Representative is concerned about the guilty verdict, the prison sentences and the financial penalty handed down by a court in Egypt against political activists Ahmed Maher, a founder of the April 6 Movement, Ahmed Douma and Mohammed Adel. These sentences appear to be based on the recently enacted protest law which is widely seen as limiting excessively freedom of expression and assembly. The High Representative expresses the hope that these sentences could be reviewed in an appeals process.\\" France: \\"France takes note of the harsh prison sentences handed down in the court of first instance to three human rights activists: Ahmed Maher, Ahmed Douma and Mohamed Adel. The handing down of these sentences follows the arrests carried out by the police ‚Äì including on the premises of a human rights association ‚Äìon the basis of the new law on demonstrations adopted on November 24.France shares the concerns expressed by the UN secretary-general and the UN high commissioner for human rights about this law. The sentences handed down yesterday confirm these concerns. France calls for compliance with the commitments undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the context of the road map and at the international level with respect to public freedoms, notably the freedom of expression and opinion and the freedom to demonstrate peacefully while respecting public security requirements.\\" Italy: \\"The Ministry for Foreign Affairs noted the Egyptian courts' conviction of three members of the opposition ‚Äî Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6th movement, and Ahmed Douma and Mohamed Adel ‚Äî on charges associated with the protests. In reference to the Egyptian transition, Italy fully shares the stances taken by the United Nations and the European Union on the importance of respect for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful demonstration. Italy reconfirms its support for an inclusive and sustainable transition in Egypt aimed at the creation of a democratic society based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and its willingness to engage in dialogue and cooperation to that end.\\" Norway: \\"\\"I am concerned about the yesterday's judgment against three Egyptian human rights activists. It is crucial that the Egyptian authorities respect democractic principles in this critical period prior to the elections and referendum on the constitution,\\" said Minister of Foreign Affairs B√∏rge Brende. The Egyptian authorities have taken action against democracy and human rights activists on several occasions recently. Yesterday, three prominent activists ‚Äì Ahmed Maher, Ahmed Douma and Mohammed Adel ‚Äì were sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and last week, employees and volunteers at the Centre for Economic and Social Rights were arrested in connection with a raid.\\" United Kingdom: \\"Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds expresses concern on the sentencing of three human rights activists in Egypt. Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds said: I was deeply concerned to hear about the sentencing to three years in prison of the democracy and human rights activists Ahmed Maher, Ahmed Douma and Mohammed Adel. This represents a serious setback to attempts to return Egypt to the democratic path and undermines the values expressed by Egyptians during the Revolution of January 2011. The UK believes the freedom to protest peacefully is vital in any democracy and calls on Egypt's interim leaders to ensure that they uphold all Egypt's international human rights obligations.\\" United States: \\"The United States is deeply concerned about the worsening climate for freedom of assembly and peaceful expression in Egypt. The implementation of Egypt's restrictive demonstrations law has led to an increase in arrests, detentions, and charges against opposition figures, human rights activists and peaceful demonstrators, and sends a chilling message to civil society at large. In particular, we believe that the verdicts issued December 22 do not contribute to an open electoral environment or a transition process that protects the universal rights of all Egyptian citizens, and therefore should be reviewed. We continue to urge the government to fulfill its commitment to implement an inclusive democratic transition, including by permitting an open environment in which Egyptians are free to campaign and vote in favor or against the draft constitution on January 14‚Äì15, or abstain from the process entirely.\\" =Petition to repeal the protest law= The April 6 movement has launched a campaign to annul the Egyptian protest law by a circulating a petition which citizens may sign to indicate approval for law's abolition or redrafting. Leading functionaries from various political factions who have signed the petition include the president of the Constitution Party, Hala Shukrallah, and Mohamed Ghonim, a key member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party. =The split= The April 6 Youth Movement Democratic Front () is an Egyptian activist group established in spring 2011 after the differences in the April 6 Youth Movement, led by Ahmed Maher. Differences in the Movement started to appear in April when leaders of the movement announced they would transform it into a NGO or foundation on its anniversary. TV host and founder, Abd Alrahman Ezz, of 6 April \\"Democratic Front\\", told Ahram Online that the decision was taken without consultation. \\"It was taken with no respect for democracy, for the majority,\\" Ezz says. The lack of internal democracy is the main reason why some left the mainstream movement, led by Ahmed Maher, forming the Democratic Front, Ezz says most of the old members joined the Democratic Front. On 5 August, a group of 6 April Youth Movement members in Alexandria announced that they had joined the Democratic Front, leaving the Ahmed Maher front due to what they considered discrimination in decision making processes. The split is not limited to Cairo and Alexandria but also seems to have been reproduced itself across the country. On 6 August, a group of April 6 Movement members in Kafr El-Sheikh governor announced that they joined the Democratic Front, leaving the Ahmed Maher Front.

Using capital Pi notation a product-form solution has algebraic form :text{P}(x_1,x_2,x_3,ldots,x_n) = B prod_{i=1}^n text{P}(x_i) where B is some constant. Solutions of this form are of interest as they are computationally inexpensive to evaluate for large values of n. Such solutions in queueing networks are important for finding performance metrics in models of multiprogrammed and time-shared computer systems. Equilibrium distributions The first product-form solutions were found for equilibrium distributions of Markov chains. Trivially, models composed of two or more independent sub-components exhibit a product-form solution by the definition of independence. Initially the term was used in queueing networks where the sub-components would be individual queues. For example, Jackson's theorem gives the joint equilibrium distribution of an open queueing network as the product of the equilibrium distributions of the individual queues. After numerous extensions, chiefly the BCMP network it was thought local balance was a requirement for a product-form solution. Gelenbe's G-network model was the first to show that this is not the case. Motivated by the need to model biological neurons which have a point-process like spiking behaviour, he introduced the precursor of G-Networks, calling it the random neural network. By introducing \\"negative customers\\" which can destroy or eliminate other customers, he generalised the family of product form networks. Then this was further extended in several steps, first by Gelenbe's \\"triggers\\" which are customers which have the power of moving other customers from some queue to another. Another new form of customer that also led to product form was Gelenbe's \\"batch removal\\". This was further extended by Erol Gelenbe and Jean- Michel Fourneau with customer types called \\"resets\\" which can model the repair of failures: when a queue hits the empty state, representing (for instance) a failure, the queue length can jump back or be \\"reset\\" to its steady-state distribution by an arriving reset customer, representing a repair. All these previous types of customers in G-Networks can exist in the same network, including with multiple classes, and they all together still result in the product form solution, taking us far beyond the reversible networks that had been considered before. Product-form solutions are sometimes described as \\"stations are independent in equilibrium\\". Product form solutions also exist in networks of bulk queues. J.M. Harrison and R.J. Williams note that \\"virtually all of the models that have been successfully analyzed in classical queueing network theory are models having a so-called product-form stationary distribution\\" More recently, product-form solutions have been published for Markov process algebras (e.g. RCAT in PEPA) and stochastic petri nets. Martin Feinberg's deficiency zero theorem gives a sufficient condition for chemical reaction networks to exhibit a product-form stationary distribution. The work by Gelenbe also shows that product form G-Networks can be used to model spiking random neural networks, and furthermore that such networks can be used to approximate bounded and continuous real-valued functions. Sojourn time distributions The term product form has also been used to refer to the sojourn time distribution in a cyclic queueing system, where the time spent by jobs at M nodes is given as the product of time spent at each node. In 1957 Reich showed the result for two M/M/1 queues in tandem, later extending this to n M/M/1 queues in tandem and it has been shown to apply to overtake‚Äìfree paths in Jackson networks. Walrand and Varaiya suggest that non-overtaking (where customers cannot overtake other customers by taking a different route through the network) may be a necessary condition for the result to hold. Mitrani offers exact solutions to some simple networks with overtaking, showing that none of these exhibit product-form sojourn time distributions. For closed networks, Chow showed a result to hold for two service nodes, which was later generalised to a cycle of queues and to overtake‚Äìfree paths in Gordon‚ÄìNewell networks. Extensions * Approximate product-form solutions are computed assuming independent marginal distributions, which can give a good approximation to the stationary distribution under some conditions. * Semi-product-form solutions are solutions where a distribution can be written as a product where terms have a limited functional dependency on the global state space, which can be approximated. * Quasi-product-form solutions are either solutions which are not the product of marginal densities, but the marginal densities describe the distribution in a product-type manner or  approximate form for transient probability distributions which allows transient moments to be approximated.

They consist of both North and South Korean expatriates. South Koreans=Population and business activities= In 1994, there were estimated to be around 100 South Korean expatriates in Mongolia. Official statistics from South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade showed 270 of their nationals in Mongolia in 1997, and about eight times as many by 2013. Some unofficial estimates suggest that their population might be as large as 3,500 individuals. Aside from residents, the number of South Korean tourists has also shown an upward trend, reaching 40,000 individuals in 2007. Many South Korean expatriates operate small businesses; the number of businesses in Mongolia funded by South Korean capital was estimated at 1,500 . The various types of businesses include restaurants serving Korean cuisine, karaoke bars, and even eyeglass shops. A weekend language and culture school for Korean children was set up in 1998 by a local Korean church. Under a bilateral agreement, both South Koreans working in Mongolia as well as Mongolians working in South Korea are exempted from otherwise-mandatory contributions to the national pension plans of the country they reside in. =Ethnic tensions = The growth of the South Korean presence has caused some tensions with their Mongolian hosts. In 2005, Korean-owned businesses in Ulaanbaatar which displayed hangul signs were ordered to switch them to English or Mongolian only, a situation which South Korean news agency YTN attributed to growing Mongolian nationalism. Among the numerous South Korean owned businesses are a number of karaoke bars operating as fronts for prostitution, which are frequented by clients of South Korean-run businesses in Mongolia (growing from just one in 2002 to an estimated fifty as of 2005). North Koreans=Migrant workers= Number of North Korean migrant workers in Asia As of May 2008, roughly 200 North Korean citizens worked in Mongolia. In February 2008, Ulaanbaatar and Pyongyang reached an agreement which would allow as many as 5,300 North Korean workers to come to Mongolia over the following five years. The relevant agreement came before the State Great Hural for approval in May that year. An open letter from American NGO Human Rights Watch in August called on Mongolian Minister of Social Welfare and Labor Damdiny Demberel to ensure that the workers' freedom of expression, movement, and association would be respected; North Korean workers in similar positions in Europe were often denied such rights by their North Korean government minders. The South Korean ambassador described Mongolia's decision to import North Korean workers as \\"problematic\\". =Defectors= North Korean defectors often pass through Mongolia on their way to South Korea. , it was estimated that 500 North Korean defectors entered Mongolia each month, largely by way of neighbouring China. As early as 2004, some South Korean citizens' groups had begun laying plans to construct camps in Mongolia to house North Korean refugees; however, they were denied permission by the Mongolian government. In September 2005, South Korean NGO Rainbow Foundation stated that they had been granted 1.3 square kilometres of land near Ulaanbaatar, and would soon begin construction on a centre which could house as many as 200 North Korean refugees However, during his November 2006 trip to Beijing, Mongolian prime minister Miyeegombyn Enkhbold denied reports that his country was planning to set up any refugee camps for North Koreans, though he reaffirmed that they would be treated in a humanitarian manner. In October 2008, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak was reported to have ordered his officials to look further into the possibility of setting up a camp for them in Mongolia. The Mongolian government does have facilities to provide shelter for North Korean refugees on their territory; in December 2007, Vitit Muntarbhorn, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in North Korea, praised Mongolia's treatment of North Korean refugees in an official report, noting that they had made commendable progress in improving such facilities since his previous visit. Both the Mongolian and South Korean governments' policies towards refugees have shifted several times. In June 2007, Mongolia began to turn North Korean refugees away from their borders, reportedly with the aim of improving their diplomatic relations with North Korea. Similarly, in October 2007, the South Korean side was reported to be \\"closing the door\\" to North Korean refugees in Mongolia and Southeast Asia; North Korea watcher Andrei Lankov, a professor at Seoul's Kookmin University, attributed this to a deliberate policy by the South Korean government to minimise the number of new refugees.

His b√™te noire was Joseph Beuys, who was not an artist in his opinion, but a demagogue and seducer whom he eventually compared with Hitler.Eickhoff, p 212. As a critic Thwaites was a moralist. In 1961 he wrote in the German paper Deutsche Zeitung (Stuttgart/K√∂ln): ::A critic must be capable of rubbishing his personal friends and praise artists he personally dislikes. He should, if need be, harm himself. He must never write for personal advantage. Power and position are corrupting even as money.

Chroniosuchians are often thought to be reptiliomorphs, but some recent phylogenetic analyses suggest instead that they are stem-tetrapods. They were all rather short limbed with a strong tail and elongated snout, somewhat resembling modern crocodiles. The group is traditionally considered to be a suborder or order of labyrinthodonts. Chroniosuchians likely had ecological niches as riverside predators, and may have been outcompeted by semiaquatic true reptiles such as phytosaurs in the late Triassic. Most forms bore a heavy armour of scutes along the back, possibly for protection against land born predators like therapsids, or to strengthen the axial skeleton for terrestrial locomotion. Indeed, femoral microanatomy of Chroniosaurus suggests that it was amphibious to terrestrial. Description The most distinguishing features of chroniosuchians are the rows of interlocking bony plates called osteoderms that run along their backs from head to tail. They are the most commonly found remains of chroniosuchians. Each osteoderm is paired with a single vertebra. The osteoderms are flat plates connected to the neural arches of vertebra by an extension of bone on their undersurfaces. The front margin of each osteoderm has a pair of \\"anterior wings\\" that slip into a notch in the posterior margin of the osteoderm in front of it. Diagram showing different types of tetrapod vertebrae, including the vertebra of the chroniosuchian Bystrowiella schumanni. Chroniosuchians are distinguished from other early reptiliomorphs by the lack of intertemporal bones in the skull, as well as the presence of holes in front of the eye sockets called antorbital fenestrae. Like many early tetrapods, chroniosuchians have vertebrae that are divided into three parts: a pleurocentrum and an intercentrum on the bottom, and a neural arch on top. Chroniosuchians have shizomerous vertebrae, meaning that the pleurocentrum makes up most of the body of the vertebra while the intercentrum is small and wedge-like.

The film was directed, produced, and written by Tyler Perry, who also makes an appearance in the film as his signature character Madea. Although the film and play share the same title, the film is not an adaptation of Perry's play of the same name; the two works have different storylines. Plot The film opens with April (Taraji P. Henson), a self-centered, alcoholic singer, performing at a nightclub where she works. On the other side of town, Madea (Tyler Perry) and Joe Simmons (Perry) catch Jennifer (Hope Olaid√® Wilson), Manny (Kwesi Boakye), and Byron (Freddy Siglar) breaking into their house. After hearing the children‚Äôs troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Manny tells Madea that they‚Äôre living with their grandmother Rose, whom they haven't seen in four days and their mother is deceased. They tell her that their only other relative is their Aunt April. April shares her home with her shady abusive boyfriend, Randy (Brian White), who‚Äôs married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn‚Äôt want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian (Marvin Winans) sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino (Adam Rodr√≠guez) to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making subtle advances at Jennifer. Shortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma (Gladys Knight), a church member, come to inform April that her mother Rose died from a fatal brain aneurysm while riding on a city bus. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy; however, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her. Shortly afterwards Jennifer, Manny, and Byron return to April's after searching for their grandmother and April dejectedly tells them the news. Depressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. However, Madea, inexperienced with prayer, attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically. The same night, Tanya (Mary J. Blige), the nightclub bartender, sings \\"I Can Do Bad\\". Before singing the song, Tanya strongly confronts April about her attitude. She says that April must change her selfish ways and think about the safety of Byron, Manny and Jennifer. Tanya declares she loves April but says she can‚Äôt help her unless she helps herself. Over time, Sandino and April become good friends, and Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to kill Sandino if he continues to spend time with April. Late the next night, Manny needs his insulin shot, and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to rape her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April pretends to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to electrocute him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was sexually abused by her step-father, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her. After twice asking \\"Do you want me to put it down?!\\", she drops the plugged-in radio into the water, giving Randy a severe electric shock. Randy barely jumps out just in time and Sandino orders him to leave. April goes to the bar for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs, just like her mother didn't see the signs with her. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester, because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them.

Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the movie an \\"A‚Äì\\" grade, saying \\"After a summer of phony, pasty rom-coms, do this: See a movie where old-fashioned notions of love, faith, strength, and the possibility of redemption are taken seriously.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film \\"overlong but well-shaped and involving\\", praising Perry for finding a balanced mix of \\"earnest soap opera moralism with [his] comic instincts\\", calling it his \\"most confident and competent mixture of uplifting black middle-class melodrama and low-down comedy.\\" Cliff Doerksen of the Chicago Reader said about the film, \\"Contrived, sentimental, tonally bipolar, and as predictable as clockwork, this latest from chitlin' circuit impresario Tyler Perry is just a fat slab of ecstatic entertainment.\\" Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine felt the film was a great gateway for people not familiar with the \\"scabrous antics and homegrown moralizing\\" delivered by the Madea character, saying that Perry lends his creation a more \\"greater level[s] of tonal consistency\\" than his previously contradictory Madea Goes to Jail, writing that \\"I Can Do Bad acknowledges Madea's flaws with loving scrutiny, and doesn't require approval of her more selfish attributes.\\" Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic was critical of Perry's filmmaking for delivering lengthy musical numbers and overlooked story elements but gave praise to the performances of Henson and Wilson for showcasing his ability to \\"create meaty roles for women.\\" The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave the film a \\"B‚Äì\\" grade, praising Henson's performance and the \\"riveting musical numbers\\" by Knight and Blige for emitting more \\"feverish emotions\\" to the film than Perry's \\"characteristically ham-fisted screenplay\\", concluding that \\"His oeuvre has always been shameless and over the top, but Bad might just be the first of Perry‚Äôs films to border on operatic.\\" Kimberley Jones of The Austin Chronicle criticized Perry for prolonging the film's conclusion but gave him credit for bringing \\"increasingly mature moviemaking\\" to his production, highlighting the Madea scenes as being \\"pretty damn funny\\" and the performances of Wilson and Henson for being \\"nuanced and quite moving\\" and having a \\"likable screen presence\\" respectively.

It serves all or part of the communities of Copake, Hillsdale, Philmont, Ancram, Austerlitz, Claverack, Gallatin, Ghent, Livingston, Northeast and Taghkanic in the southeastern part of Columbia County, New York, United States. The district covers nearly 250 square miles District history The original formal public schools of Columbia County were one room school houses. Many of them were established under the 1812 Common School Act. However, in the 1920s politicians identifying with the Progressive Movement began scrutinizing the one-room school house educational system. These politicians advocated a change to larger, more centralized schools, which they felt would provide more equal educational opportunities for all. When in 1931 the Roeliff Jansen Central School District formed it was made up of twenty-nine smaller districts. It became the largest school district up to that time. In 1946, the Ockawamick Central School District was created from fifteen of these small, rural school districts. Taconic Hills Central School District was formed in 1969 after the unification of the Roeliff Jansen and Ockawamick School Districts, two smaller districts. The School was located in Hillsdale. In 1988 The Taconic Hills Football team won the New York State Class C Championship with a record of 11-0. In 1999, faculty, administrators and students moved into a new state of the art, centralized K-12 school building in Craryville. Campus building and facilities The Taconic Hills Central School opened in fall 1999 after years of debate about the district's facilities plan and a fast-track design and construction process that took just a year and a half. The $50 million school encompasses 350,000 square feet, making it one of the largest schools in the state of New York. The design, created by Rhinebeck Architecture & Planning in Rhinebeck, N.Y., is designed for a capacity of 2,000 students in K-12. The design groups the K-grade 2 and grades 3-6 units on one side and the grades 7-8 and grades 9-12 units on the other. The entry to each side features a two-story atrium, which helps orient students to their location in their wing. A community center is situated between the two school wings. The facility includes a 1,000-seat performing arts center that opens to an outdoor amphitheater (the two share a common stage), two media centers, an aquatic/fitness center, and three subdividable gymnasiums with stadium-style seating. The original quote of 759 interior and exterior doors included 276 interior and exterior hollow-metal doors. In mid-project, the school district received a donation that allowed for the addition of the aquatic/fitness center. Taconic Hills Central School has won several national, regional and state awards, including the prestigious Learning by Design 2001 Citation Award from the National School Boards Association. The Taconic Hills district also hosts many visitors from other districts who come to study the facility and borrow ideas for their own schools.

It was written as a comprehensive history of Jews in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and modern Russia between the years 1795 and 1995, especially with regard to government attitudes toward Jews. Solzhenitsyn published this two-volume work on the history of Russian‚ÄìJewish relations in 2001 and 2002. The book stirred controversy, and many historians criticized it as unreliable in factual data and antisemitic.Dimensional Spaces in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Two Hundred Years Together. By Zinaida Gimpelevich (\\"[200] has evoked strong reactions from many scholars, who doubt in particular his factual data and ideological approach to the history of Russian Jews and their history in the Russian and Soviet Empires.\\") The book was published in French and German in 2002‚Äì2003. A partial English translation is found in \\"The Solzhenitsyn Reader\\".  Summary  In the first volume, Solzhenitsyn discusses the history of Russians and the 100,000 Jews that came under Russian control between 1772 (when the First Partition of Poland happened) and the Russian Revolution in 1917. He asserts that the anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire were not government-sponsored but spontaneous acts of violence, except for some government culpability in the Pale of Settlement. Solzhenitsyn says that life for Russian Jews was hard but no harder than life for Russian peasants. The second volume covers the post-revolution era up to 1970 when many Jews left Russia for Israel and other western countries. Solzhenitsyn says that the Jews who participated in Russian revolutions were effectively apostates splitting from the spirit of tradition. Solzhenitsyn emphatically denies that Jews were responsible for the revolutions of 1905 and 1917. At the end of chapter nine, Solzhenitsyn denounces \\"the superstitious faith in the historical potency of conspiracies\\" that leads some to blame the Russian revolutions on the Jews and to ignore the \\"Russian failings that determined our sad historical decline.\\"The Solzhenitsyn Reader, p. 496 Solzhenitsyn criticizes the \\"scandalous\\" weakness and \\"unpardonable inaction\\" that prevented the Russian Tsarist state from adequately protecting the lives and property of its Jewish subjects. But he claims that the pogroms were in almost every case organized from \\"below\\" and not by the Russian state authorities. He criticizes the \\"vexing,\\" \\"scandalous\\", and \\"distressing\\" restrictions on the civil liberties of Jewish subjects during the final decades of the Russian Empire. On that score, in chapter ten of the work he expresses his admiration for the efforts of Pyotr Stolypin (Prime Minister of Russia from 1906 until 1911) to eliminate all legal disabilities against Jews in Russia. In the spirit of his 1974 essay \\"Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations\\",The Solzhenitsyn Reader, pp. 527‚Äì555 Solzhenitsyn calls for the Russians and Russian Jews alike to take responsibility for the \\"renegades\\" in both communities who supported a totalitarian and terrorist regime after 1917. At the end of chapter 15, he writes that Jews must answer for the \\"revolutionary cutthroats\\" in their ranks just as Russians must repent \\"for the pogroms, for...merciless arsonist peasants, for...crazed revolutionary soldiers.\\" It is not, he adds, a matter of answering \\"before other peoples, but to oneself, to one's conscience, and before God.\\"The Solzhenitsyn Reader, p. 505 Solzhenitsyn also takes the anti-Communist White Movement to task for condoning violence against Jews and thus undermining \\"what would have been the chief benefit of a White victory\\" in the Russian Civil War: \\"a reasonable evolution of the Russian state.\\"  Reception  According to Zinaida Gimpelevich, the reception of Two Hundred Years Together has been –æverwhelmingly negative. Historian Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern of Northwestern University published a refutation of Solzhenitsyn's claims and has accused him of outright antisemitism.http://ldn-knigi.lib.ru/JUDAICA/Stern200.htm On the other hand, historians such as Geoffrey Hosking and Robert Service have defended Solzhenitsyn against his opponents. Service has argued that Solzhenitsyn is very far from the antisemitism of the extreme Russian Right and addresses this issue in a moderate and responsible manner. Critics focus on Solzhenitsyn's insistence that Jews were as much perpetrators as victims in the Communist repression, and that both Russians and Jews need to acknowledge their share of sin.Cathy Young: Traditional Prejudices. The anti-Semitism of Alexander Solzhenitsyn Reason Magazine May, 2004. Questions related to Jewish participation in the three Revolutions have been controversial. Vassili Berezhkov, a retired KGB colonel and historian of the secret services and the NKVD (the precursor of the KGB), said that: \\"The question of ethnicity did not have any importance either in the revolution or the story of the NKVD. This was a social revolution and those who served in the NKVD and Cheka were serving ideas of social change. If Solzhenitsyn writes that there were many Jews in the NKVD, it will increase the passions of anti-semitism, which has deep roots in Russian history. I think it is better not to discuss such a question now.\\" Others feel that Jews were not implicated enough to warrant a reference to Russian antisemitism, or that any notion of the collective responsibility should be avoided. Solzhenitsyn asserted that Jews were overrepresented in the early Bolshevik leadership and the security apparatus, without citing his sources. He wrote that \\"from 22 ministers in the first Soviet government three were Russian, one Georgian, one Armenian and 17 Jews\\". This assertion has been discredited, as the number of Commissars in the first Soviet government on 7 November 1917 was 16, not 22, of whom 10 were ethnic Russians (Milyutin, Yelizarov, Skvortsov-Stepanov, Lomov, Rykov, Lenin, Shlyapnikov, Nogin, Krylenko and Avilov), three Ukrainians (Lunacharsky, Antonov-Ovseyesnko and Dybenko), one Pole (Teodorovich), and only one Jew (Trotsky).https://www.rulit.me/books/evrei-v-kgb-read-199849-1.html Solzhenitsyn stated: \\"I had to bury many comrades at the front, but not once did I have to bury a Jew\\". He also stated that according to his personal experience, Jews had a much easier life in the GULAG camps that he was interned in.\\"200 years together\\":\\"... –≤ –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä—å –ø—Ä–∏—Å—ã–ª–∞–µ—à—å—Å—è –∏ —É–∑–Ω–∞—ë—à—å: –µ—Å–ª–∏ —É —Ç–µ–±—è —É–¥–∞—á–Ω–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è ‚Äì —Ç—ã —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤—á–∏–∫, —Ç—ã –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω, —Ç—ã –≤—ã–∂–∏–ª... –í –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä—è—Ö, –≥–¥–µ —è —Å–∏–¥–µ–ª... –µ–≤—Ä–µ—è–º, –Ω–∞—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –æ–±–æ–±—â–∞—Ç—å –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ, –∂–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –ª–µ–≥—á–µ, —á–µ–º –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º.\\"\\"If I would care to generalise, and to say that the life of the Jews in the camps was especially hard, I could, and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 2003 Solzhenitsyn breaks last taboo of the revolution by Nick Paton Walsh, The Guardian, January 25, 2003 =Richard Pipes review= The book has been described by historian Richard Pipes of Harvard University as \\"a conscious effort to show empathy for both sides\\", and exonerating Jews for responsibility for the revolution: \\"No, in no way can it be said that Jews 'made' the revolution of 1905 or 1917 as it was not made by another nation taken as a whole.\\" At the same time Pipes writes that Solzhenitsyn is \\"too eager to exonerate czarist Russia of mistreating its Jewish subjects, and as a consequence is insensitive to the Jews' predicament\\".Richard Pipes: \\"Solzhenitsyn and the Jews, revisited: Alone Together\\" The New Republic November 25, 2002 In Richard Pipes' opinion, the book absolves Solzhenitsyn from the taint of antisemitism, although he thinks the author's nationalism prevents him from being fully impartial, and that Solzhenitsyn is using outdated and inadequate sources. Pipes asserts that Solzhenitsyn failed to consider the \\"poisonous atmosphere in which Jews lived for generations in the Russian empire (an atmosphere originating in Russian Orthodox and nationalist circles)\\".Richard Pipes: Solzhenitsyn's Troubled Prophetic Mission The Moscow Times August 7, 2008. Also in The St. Petersburg Times August 8, 2008. =Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern critique= Solzhenitsyn was accused by the Northwestern University historian Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern of using unreliable and manipulated figures, while ignoring evidence unfavorable to his own point of view and, in particular, ignoring numerous publications of reputable authors in Jewish history. Petrovsky-Shtern says that Solzhenitsyn claims that Jews promoted alcoholism among the peasantry, flooded the retail trade with contraband, and \\"strangled\\" the Russian merchant class in Moscow.pp. 39‚Äì41, 47 He says that according to Solzhenitsyn, Jews are non-producing people (\\"–Ω–µ–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥\\")pp. 52, 59 and refuse to engage in factory labor.—Å. 244‚Äì245 They are averse to agriculture and unwilling to till the land either in Russia, in Argentina, or in Palestine,pp. 73, 76, 157, 256, 258, 267‚Äì268 and the author blames the Jews' own behavior for pogroms.pp. 210, 483, 120 He says that Solzhenitsyn also claims that Jews used Kabbalah to tempt Russians into heresy,p. 20 seduced Russians with rationalism and fashion,p. 21 provoked sectarianism and weakened the financial system,p. 70 committed murders on the orders of qahal authorities,p. 87 and exerted undue influence on the prerevolutionary government.p. 57 Petrovsky-Shtern summarizes his critique by stating that \\"200 Years Together is destined to take a place of honor in the canon of russophone antisemitica.\\" =Semyon Reznik review= A critical analysis was published by the Russian-American historian Semyon Reznik. According to Reznik, Solzhenitsyn is careful in his vocabulary, generous in compliments toward Jews and maintains a neutral tone throughout, but at the same time he not only condones repressive measures against Jews, but justifies them as intended for protection of the rights of Russians as the titular nation that supposedly \\"greatly suffered from Jewish exploitation, alcohol mongering, usury and corruption of the traditional way of life\\". =Other critiques= Historian and demographer Sergey Maksudov referred to THYT as \\"a piece of pseudoscientific essayism\\", which promulgates numerous antisemitic stereotypes of Jews as professional parasites, infiltrators into the Russian culture, and portrays repressive policies toward Jews as being \\"in Jews' own interests\\". Maksudov also claims that Solzhenitsyn was insensitive toward Jewish sufferings during pogroms in general, and the Kishinev pogrom in particular, and also accuses Solzhenitsyn of denying many well documented atrocities. John Klier, a historian at University College London, describes the charges of antisemitism as \\"misguided\\", but at the same time writes that in his account of the pogroms of the early 20th century, Solzhenitsyn is far more concerned with exonerating the good name of the Russian people than he is with the suffering of the Jews, and he accepts the Tsarist government's canards blaming the pogroms on provocations by the Jews themselves.\\"History Today\\", November 2002 A detailed analysis of THYT and an overview of critical opinion thereon was published by the University of Waterloo professor Zinaida Gimpelevich. According to Gimpelevich, the critical opinion worldwide overwhelmingly tilts against Solzhenitsyn. Grigory Baklanov, a Russian novelist, in his critical study described Two Hundred Years as \\"worthless as historical scholarship\\". Baklanov, himself a World War II veteran, focuses on Solzhenitsyn's insistence on Jews' supposed wartime cowardice and unwillingness to face the enemy, which he says is contradicted both by the statistics of Jewish frontline casualties and by the high number of Jews decorated for bravery in battle. Literary historian Leonid Katsis accuses Solzhenitsyn of numerous manipulated and selective quotations in the first volume of the book, detrimental to its trustworthiness. Cultural historian and comparatist Elisa Kriza discusses THYT in an article about antisemitism in Solzhenitsyn's works and explains how Solzhenitsyn's accusations towards Jewish people as a group and his treatment of Russian Jews as \\"foreign\\", despite being in Russia for two hundred years, are evidence of antisemitic rhetoric in the book. Historians Leybelman, Levinskaya, and Abramov claim that Solzhenitsyn uncritically used writings of antisemitic pseudo-historian Andrey Dikiy for his inflated statistical data of Jewish participation in the early Soviet government and its security apparatus. Mark Deutch, in a two-part review titled \\"A Shameless Classic\\" (\\"–ë–µ—Å—Å—Ç—ã–∂–∏–π –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫\\"),(http://www.mk.ru/editions/daily/article/2003/09/26/126543-besstyizhiy- klassik.html)http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=1000535 lists numerous drawbacks, stemming, in his opinion, from biased exposition, ignoring well-known sources, self-contradictions, and factual errors.

Background Heeney was born at 101 Lower Mecklenburgh Street (now Railway Street) in Dublin.http://www.dublincity.ie/Press/PressReleases/pressreleasenovember2010/Pages/Heeney%E2%80%99sNameLivesOnWithHisMusic.aspx He was the son of a local grocer and attended St. Patrick‚Äôs National School at 13 Mecklenburgh Street. He was a member of the Col. John O‚ÄôMahoney Hurling Club.http://www.nli.ie/pdfs/mss%20lists/074_deBurca.pdf A 1975 memoir of Peadar Kearney states Heeney initially worked for the postal service before taking employment as a bagman at Hickey's Drapers in North Earl Street. One individual of the correct age named \\"Patrick Heaney\\" is listed living in Dublin in the 1901 census as one of four unmarried siblings at 242 Township Cottages (now Gulistan Cottages), Rathmines.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai003708559/ This seems very likely to be the composer since this man's job is listed as a \\"town postman\\". Heaney is listed at the 31 Gulistan Cottages in the 1911 census (conducted in April, two months before the composer's death) along with a wife, Catherine, and a nine-month-old son, William.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000138782/ The Soldier's Song Heeney was unable to write music, but had a knowledge of tonic solfa and usually composed by trying out melodies on his melodeon. \\"The Soldier's Song\\" is generally believed to have been composed in 1907, though, in later years, the lyricist Peadar Kearney put the date at 1909 or 1910. The English lyrics were the work of Kearney who was a prominent member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and had been Heeney's musical collaborator since 1903. The unusual metre of Kearney's lyrics to \\"The Soldier's Song\\" initially gave Heeney considerable trouble in his attempt to fit music to them. Other collaborations between Heeney and Kearney include \\"Michael Dwyer\\". Death and commemoration The plaque in Drumcondra Cemetery commemorating Heeney Heeney died in poverty aged 29 in Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Drumcondra Cemetery, where a plaque on the wall now commemorates him. Peadar Kearney was in London with the Abbey Company at the time of Heeney's death. He took up a collection for his deceased friend‚Äôs mother. Among the contributors were Michael Collins and Sam Maguire. Peadar Kearney dedicated his song Sl√°n Libh to Paddy Heeney. In 2010, Dublin City Council named Patrick Heeney House and Crescent, a new 63 housing unit development in Summerhill, in the composer's honour.

The caste is concentrated in five districts of Western Maharashtra and a district in the Vidarbha region.They traditionally made their living by cultivating fruit, flowers and vegetables. There are many different sub-castes depending on what the sub- group cultivated, for example, the Phul Mali were florists, the Jire Mali grew jire or cumin, and halde Mali cultivated Halad(turmeric) etc. In the 20th century, the Mali have been the pioneers in using irrigation to grow cash crops such as sugar cane and in establishing farmer owned sugar mills. This led later in the century of wide spread cultivation of sugarcane in Western Maharashtra by other communities as well as the establishment hundreds of sugar mills in Maharashtra and other regions of India.Attwood, D.W., 2010.

Biography  John Ernst was the eldest son of Frederick, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1640‚Äì1675) and Christiane Elisabeth of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1646‚Äì1678). After the death of his parents, his regents were John, Count of Nassau-Idstein and after his death, John Louis, Count of Nassau-Ottweiler. In Juli 1679 John Ernst started his studies at the University of T√ºbingen. Between 1681 and 1682 he stayed at the court of King Louis XIV of France in the Palace of Versailles. John Ernst became the only ruler of Nassau-Weilburg when his brother Frederick William Louis was killed in 1684 during the siege of Buda. His territories on the left bank of the Rhine were occupied by France and only returned after the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697. John Ernst had an important military career. In 1684 he commanded a Dragoon regiment in the service of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. In 1688, at the start of the Nine Years' War, he defended Koblenz. Later he participated in the Siege of Mainz (1689), the Battle of Fleurus (1690) and the Battle of Landen (1693). In September 1696 John Ernst entered as general in the service of the Electoral Palatinate as General, which enraged his former employer Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel. After the Peace of Ryswick, John Ernst became governor of the Palatinate city of D√ºsseldorf. In 1701, at the outbreak of the War of Spanish Succession, John Ernst raised an army, participated in the successful Siege of Landau in 1702 and the consequent chasing of an army under Marshal of France Tallard from the Hunsr√ºck. For this achievement, he was made an Imperial Generalfeldmarschall. When Prince Eugene of Savoy marched in 1703 to Bavaria against the French Marshal Villars, John Ernst stayed on the Rhine to defend Landau against Tallard. This led on November 15, 1703 to the Battle of Speyerbach. It was a terrible defeat. 8000 men were lost and John Ernst's eldest son, Colonel Frederick Ludwig of Nassau-Weilburg was killed. Hereafter, John Ernst never fought a major engagement again and withdrew from active service all together in 1706. He was Gro√ühofmeister of the Elector Palatinate until 1716 and returned to Weilburg, where he died in 1719.  Building  In the 1700s, John Ernst initiated the expansion of his residence, Schloss Weilburg, from a Renaissance Palace to a Baroque complex, adding orangeries, stables, a church and terrace gardens.  Marriage and issue  John Ernst married on April 3, 1683 Maria Polyxena of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hartenburg (February 7, 1662 ‚Äì April 22, 1725).

The major ports controlled by the NPA include: the Lagos Port Complex and Tin Can Island Port in Lagos; Calabar Port, Delta Port, Rivers Port at Port Harcourt, and Onne Port. Operations of the NPA are carried out in affiliation with the Ministry of Transportation (Nigeria) and the Nigerian Shippers' Council.Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa, Nigeria The Head office of the Nigerian Ports Authority is located in Marina, Lagos.Nigerian Ports Authority, Contact us However, with the concessioning programme of the federal government, which is aimed at promoting efficiency through, public and private partnership, the Nigerian Ports, has since 2005, being concessioned. This landlord arrangement as they call it, has fostered better relationship and high turn-out of goods and services in and around the Nigerian Port system either in the Eastern or the ever-busy Western zone. History Flag of the Nigerian Ports Authority (1955‚Äì1960) The Nigerian Ports Authority started operating in April 1955 following the implementation of the Ports Act of 1954. In the beginning, the public corporation managed only the Lagos and Port Harcourt ports while some private companies mangaged the remaining Nigerian ports. In addition to managing cargo handling, quay and berthing facilities at the Lagos and Port Harcourt ports, the initial law also gave it the responsibility of managing harbours and approaches to all ports in the country. By 1963 the firm had grown successfully, it was operating a cargo ship from Lagos to Port Harcourt and also began dredging the Bonny terminal for oil operations.The Nigerian Ports Authority. The Financial Times (London, England),Thursday, October 01, 1964; pg. 13; Edition 23,430 In the same year, the firm issued a ¬£4.3 million loan stock in London. From 1962 - 1968, under the Nigerian Development plan, the length of the quays was expanded and additional warehouses and cargo handling equipment were added. During the Nigerian Civil War that lasted from 1967-1969, only the Lagos Port was functioning and some parts of the port in Port Harcourt was damaged. In 1969, a new decree added Burutu, Calabar and Warri ports to its jurisdiction. The firm took control of the Warri port from John Holt and Burutu from UAC. However, by the early 1970s, the Lagos port was battling congestion. In 1973, the corporation entered into an agreement with the World Bank to finance expansion of facilities within the ports. =Cement armada= In 1974, the Nigerian Ministry of Defense began a program of building various barracks to house almost all of its soldiers. Towards the end of the year, the Ministry began a process of issuing offers to various companies for cement delivery. Though less than 3 million tonnes of cement was needed yearly, the ministry ended up offering letters of delivery for 16 million tonnes to be delivered within a year. Other government agencies such as the Federal Housing Authority and the Nigerian National Supply Company also ordered about 4 million tonnes of cement to be delivered within a year. By the end of November 1974 to late 1975, about 400 cement ships berthed at the Lagos port leading to unprecedented congestion and increasing the turn around time of hundreds of ships to 180 days. =Expansion= NPA accelerated the expansion of port facilities after the end of the cement armada. The government spent over 190 million naira to complete the Tin Can Island port with two roll on roll off facilities. It built a third wharf in Apapa and expanded facilities at the Warri and Calabar ports. It also constructed three lighter terminals in Kiri Kiri, Onne and Ikorodu.H., M. \\"N1bn Dock Expansion Outlay Keeps Pace with Demand.\\" Financial Times [London, England] 30 Sept. 1980: XXXVII.

The result was the concessioning of about 24 terminals to private operators for a certain period of time.

The private operators will be involved in loading and offloading of cargoes.Emeka Okwuosa. (2006). \\"Nigeria Ports Concessioning Policy And Legal Implications.\\" Tuesday, 7 Mar. 2006.

Old Silberling coaches were modernised and a more frequent fixed-interval service (Taktfahrplan) introduced. As its use spread the DB changed the way it was written to CityBahn. The City-Bahn was replaced by the Stadt-Express.  Routes  One of the services was the Cologne‚ÄìOverath‚ÄìGummersbach line, which was opened in 1984 as the Aggertaler on the Agger Valley Railway (Aggertalbahn, KBS 459). For experimental services on the closure-threatened line, Silberling coaches were converted to the then modern interiors of the VT 628.2 and, like the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, painted in orange and light grey livery. A caf√© was also part of the redesign. The trains were hauled by similarly painted locomotives of Class 218. The modernised rolling stock and the fixed hourly services led to a considerable increase in passengers. From 1985 the new City-Bahn rakes ran from Cologne to Gummersbach, and sometimes onwards via Marienheide to Meinerzhagen; however this only lasted until May 1986, then they only went as far as Marienheide, and from May 1987 only to Gummersbach again. The second City-Bahn route was the Lower Elbe Railway (Niederelbebahn), where trains ran between Hamburg and Stade. Because the line is electrified, Class 141 locomotives were employed. In the same year City- Bahn trains were also deployed to the area of Hanover and from 1989 in the Saarland. However the specially converted Silberling coaches did not appear here until 1990. In 1995 the City-Bahn services were renamed Stadt-Express, later Regionalbahn and RegionalExpress trains superseded the City-Bahn as a train type. In Hanover the Hanover S-Bahn had the honour of running City-Bahn services. Models The German model train company M√§rklin has made a model of the \\"City-Bahn\\" line for a limited series in 2009. The road number for the engine is BR 218 143-6, and is item number 39182. Additional Silberling passenger cars are also made under item numbers 43808 (3 car set), and 43818 (add on car for 43808 and 39182).

He was drafted by the Lions in the first round of the 2006 CFL Draft. He is a three-time Grey Cup champion, having won in his rookie year in 2006 and also winning in 2012 and 2013. Foley won the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award in 2009 and also the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian award in 2012. He played CIS football at York University. Foley has also been a member of the Baltimore Ravens, the Seattle Seahawks and the New York Jets in the NFL, and a member of the Toronto Argonauts and the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the CFL. Early life Foley was born in Courtice, Ontario Canada and was raised on a 200-acre farm near Toronto..His father was a farmer and growing up his family didn't have a lot of money.. Foley and his family would have to fix things up a lot for a lot of his youth.. After Foley's brother left when he was 14, he was expected to take over farm duties for the family but started to play football, at Paul Dwyer secondary in Oshawa. College career Foley played in college for York University. In his senior year, Foley was a Second team CIS All Canadian and during his college career with the Lions, he was twice named to ALL OUA honours. Professional career=BC Lions= Since joining the BC Lions in 2006, Foley had served as a situational pass rusher but with the departure of Cam Wake following the 2008 BC Lions season, Foley earned the starting defensive end position. In 2009, Foley had his first career start at defensive end and subsequently started all 18 games that season, registering 51 defensive tackles, 12 quarterback sacks, and four tackles for a loss. He also had a total of two sacks in the Lions' two playoff games.

His signing came amidst some controversy as the B.C. Lions had announced earlier in the day that they had agreed to terms with Foley. Foley was also interviewed that same morning by Vancouver radio station the Team 1040 where he discussed his return to the Lions. \\"When I chose B.C., it was like that's the team that I've won a Cup with, winning Canadian Player of the Year, leading the league in sacks, with my boys out there and the staff. It's where I know I've had success, and I love the city out there. They support the Lions so much out there.\\" Lions head coach and general manager Wally Buono later confirmed that Foley had changed his mind and signed with the Argonauts instead of the Lions. \\"He's done an about face.

It was the original southern terminus of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier which ran to a station and pier at Avonmouth. The station opened in 1865, originally named Clifton station, and was situated in the Avon Gorge almost underneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge, near the Clifton Rocks Railway, the Hotwells terminus of Bristol Tramways, the Rownham ferry and landing stages used by passenger steamers. In 1871 the railway company was acquired by the Great Western Railway who created a tunnel under Clifton Down and linked the Port and Pier line to Bristol Temple Meads railway station. This left the Hotwells branch as a stub. The station remained open, renamed as Hotwells until 1921 when it and the track to Sneyd Park were removed to enable the building of the Portway road. The only trace remaining today is a short tunnel under Bridge Valley Road which was used during the Second World War as an air raid shelter. Overcrowding became such a problem that Bristol City Council had to institute a permit system. In later years, until 1996 part of the tunnel was used by a local gun club as a short range.

He subsequently served as MP for the prestigious county seat of Cornwall in 1601 and 1621 and was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1607. He was elected MP for St Mawes in 1624 and for Tregony in 1628, and sat until 1629 when King Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640 he was re-elected as MP for Tregony in the Short Parliament. He was not elected to the Long Parliament, unlike his two sons, Richard Arundell, elected for Lostwithiel and John Arundell for Bodmin. Following the outbreak of the Civil War he was a Royalist, remaining loyal to the King, and was present in 1643 at the Royalist victory at the Battle of Braddock Down in Cornwall. In about 1643 he was appointed governor of the royal Pendennis Castle in Cornwall, built by King Henry VIII to guard the entry to Falmouth Harbour. After the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the Parliamentary army swept through the West Country, and Arundell defiantly refused the demand of General Fairfax to submit, and replied to him: :\\"I wonder you demand the castle without authority from His Majesty, which if I should render, I brand myself and my posterity with the indelible character of treason. And having taken less than two minutes resolution, I resolve that I will here bury myself before I deliver up this castle to such as fight against His Majesty, and that nothing you can threaten is formidable to me in respect of the loss of loyalty and conscience\\". He maintained a five month long siege in heroic circumstances, during which his garrison was reduced by hunger to eating their horses. Finally he surrendered in August 1646, making Pendennis Castle the last but one to have held out for the King. In 1651, following the establishment of the Commonwealth, he was fined ¬£10,000 by the new government, a large sum later reduced to ¬£2,000, and although his estates were sequestered and let, he was able to retrieve them on payment of a further sum.

In his short time at Trinity, he contributed to the growth of the congregation and enlarged of the church building. This was achieved by increasing the monthly subscription for congregation members from 12¬Ω cents to $12.50 on 3 July 1819. The following day he travelled to most of the congregation members' homes and collected $2000 in pledges.

In the years leading up to the 1838 Georgetown slave sale, McElroy was, as Clerk of Georgetown College, responsible for issuing runaway slave advertisements and return rewards.

John Dubois, the pastor in Frederick, to support St. John the Evangelist Church. In 1822, Dubois' successor Fr. Maleve fell ill. McElroy travelled to Frederick to minister to him in illness and was with him when he died on 3 October. A letter was sent by a number of prominent gentlemen from Frederick to the superior of the Jesuits at Whitemarsh, Maryland, requesting the services of Fr. McElroy in Frederick. and in 1822 he was appointed pastor there. McElroy set to work immediately to expand the congregation. In 1823 he began negotiations with the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg, Maryland, for the establishment of a school for girls in Frederick. In 1824, the St. John's Benevolent Female Free School was founded by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph at 200 East Second Street in Frederick. In 1825, McElroy set to work replacing the structure that housed the school, a pre-American Revolution log cabin, with a modern building large enough to also house an orphanage. The money raised for construction was primarily accomplished due to support of the orphanage. McElroy's next task was to found an educational institution for boys. On 7 August 1828, the construction of St John's Literary Institute began. The following year the construction was completed and the school was opened,Shea, John Gilmary.

Mexican War Shortly after the Mexican-American War began in 1846, many Irish Catholic immigrants joined the U.S. forces in Mexico.O'Conner, Thomas H. \\"Breaking the religious barrier\\", The Boston Globe, Boston, 10 May 2004. The religious needs of these soldiers were not being met. In a discussion between the President of the United States of America, James K. Polk, and Archbishop John Hughes of New York, it was decided that for the first time, Roman Catholic priests would join US Army forces as chaplains. Father McElroy and Father Anthony Rey were selected by the Archbishop and were sent to Mexico; they joined General Zachary Taylor's army in Matamoros on 5 July 1846. McElroy, then 64, stayed at the base camp in Matamoros, tending to the casualties, saying Mass, and hearing confessions. In May 1847, McElroy was withdrawn from Mexico due to continuous illnesses.O'Connor, Thomas.McElroy in Mexico, Boston College Magazine. Father Rey died for his efforts at the hand of guerrillas. Boston In October 1847 Fr. McElroy was welcomed in Boston, Massachusetts, by the Bishop of Boston, John Bernard Fitzpatrick, to serve as pastor of St. Mary's parish in the North End. Bishop Fitzpatrick set McElroy to work on bringing a college to Boston.\\"Jesuit History at BC\\", Boston College Retrieved 23 May 2012. Boston's South End In 1853 McElroy found a property in the South End where the city jail once stood. After two years of negotiations the project fell through due to zoning issues. A new site was identified and city officials endorsed the sale. Two important gifts were received, a bequest of $3000 from Joseph Coolidge Shaw, and $5000 plus all construction expenses from Catholic philanthropist Andrew Carney. In 1858, Bishop Fitzpatrick and Father McElroy broke ground for Boston College, and for the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Classes began in the fall of 1864, and would continue at this location until 1913 when the college moved to its current location at Chestnut Hill. Initially Boston College offered a seven- year program including both high school and college. This joint program continued until 1927 when the high school was separately incorporated.

The oldest surviving English embroideries include items from the early 10th century preserved in Durham Cathedral and the 11th century Bayeux Tapestry, if it was worked in England. The professional workshops of Medieval England created rich embroidery in metal thread and silk for ecclesiastical and secular uses. This style was called Opus Anglicanum or \\"English work\\", and was famous throughout Europe.Levey and King 1993, p. 12 With the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the focus of English embroidery increasingly turned to clothing and household furnishings, leading to another great flowering of English domestic embroidery in the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. The end of this period saw the rise of the formal sampler as a record of the amateur stitcher's skills. Curious fashions of the mid-17th century were raised work or stumpwork, a pictorial style featuring detached and padded elements,Embroiderers' Guild 1984, p. 81 and crewel work, featuring exotic leaf motifs worked in wool yarn.Fitwzwilliam and Hand 1912, \\"Introduction\\" Canvaswork, in which thread is stitched through a foundation fabric, and surface embroidery, in which the majority of the thread sits on top of the fabric, exist side-by-side in the English tradition, coming in and out of fashion over the years. In the 19th century, the craze for Berlin wool work, a canvaswork style using brightly coloured wool, contrasts with art needlework, associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, which attempted to resurrect the artistic and expressive styles of medieval surface embroidery under the influence of the Gothic Revival and the Pre-Raphaelites.Embroiderers' Guild 1984, p. 54 Although continental fashions in needlework were adopted in England, a number of popular styles were purely English in origin, including the embroidered linen jackets of the turn of the 17th century, stumpwork, and art needlework. Medieval period=Anglo-Saxon= Detail of stitching on the Bayeux Tapestry. Little physical evidence survives to reconstruct the early development of English embroidery before the Norman Conquest of 1066. Stitches reinforcing the seams of a garment in the Sutton Hoo ship burial may have been intended as decoration, and so be classed as embroidery, and fragments of a scrolling border worked in stem stitch were recovered from a grave in Kempston, Bedfordshire.Coatsworth, Elizabeth: \\"Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery\\", in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, pp. 6‚Äì7 Some embroidered pieces of about 850 preserved in Maaseik, Belgium, are generally assumed to be Anglo-Saxon work based on their similarity to contemporary manuscript illustrations and sculptures of animals and interlace.Levey and King 1993, p. 11The Maaseik Embroideries, details and photos from Historical needlework resources. The documentary evidence is rather richer than the physical remains. Part of the reason for both these facts is the taste among the late Anglo-Saxon elite for embroidering using lavish amounts of precious metal thread, especially gold, which both gave items a magnificence and expense worth recording, and meant that they were well worth burning to recover the bullion. Three old vestments, almost certainly Anglo-Saxon, recycled in this way at Canterbury Cathedral in the 1370s, produced over ¬£250 of gold ‚Äì a huge amount.Dodwell, p. 181 Richly embroidered hangings were used in both churches and the houses of the rich, but vestments were the most richly embellished of all, of a \\"particularly English\\" richness.Dodwell, p. 182 Most of these were sent back to Normandy or burnt for their metal after the Norman conquest. An image of part of a huge gold acanthus flower on the back of a gold-bordered chasuble, almost certainly depicting a specific real vestment, can be seen in the Benedictional of St. √Üthelwold (fol. 118v).Dodwell, pp. 129‚Äì145, 174‚Äì187, and Plate D. Scholars agree that three embroidered items from the coffin of St Cuthbert in Durham are Anglo-Saxon work, based on an inscription describing their commission by Queen √Ülffl√¶d between 909 and 916.Maniple and Stole of St Cuthbert details and photos from Historical needlework resources. These include a stole and maniple ornamented with figures of prophets outlined in stem stitch and filled with split stitch, with halos in gold thread worked with underside couching.Coatsworth 2005, p. 16 The quality of this silk embroidery on a gold background is \\"unparalleled in Europe at this time.\\" Scholarly consensus favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux Tapestry. This famous narrative of the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.Coatsworth 2005, pp. 22‚Äì23Wilson 1985, pp.201‚Äì227 =Opus Anglicanum= The Butler-Bowden Cope, 1330‚Äì1350, V&A; Museum no. T.36-1955. The Anglo-Saxon embroidery style combining split stitch and couching with silk and goldwork in gold or silver-gilt thread of the Durham examples flowered from the 12th to the 14th centuries into a style known to contemporaries as Opus Anglicanum or \\"English work\\". Opus Anglicanum was made for both ecclesiastical and secular use on clothing, hangings, and other textiles. It was usually worked on linen or dark silks, or later, worked as individual motifs on linen and applied to velvet.Jourdain 1912, pp. 6‚Äì8 Throughout this period, the designs of embroidery paralleled fashions in manuscript illumination and architecture. Work of this period often featured continuous light scrolls and spirals with or without foliations, in addition to figures of kings and saints in geometrical frames or Gothic arches. Opus Anglicanum was famous throughout Europe. A \\"Gregory of London\\" was working in Rome as a gold-embroiderer to Pope Alexander IV in 1263, and the Vatican inventory in Rome of 1295 records well over 100 pieces of English work. Notable surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum include Syon Cope and the Butler-Bowden Cope of 1330‚Äì50 in the Victoria and Albert Museum, embroidered with silver and silver-gilt thread and coloured silks on silk velvet, which was disassembled and later reassembled into a cope in the 19th century. =Professional embroiderers= By the 13th century, most English goldwork was made in London workshops, which produced ecclesiastical work, clothing and furnishings for royalty and the nobility, heraldic banners and horse- trappings, and the ceremonial regalia for the great Livery Companies of the City of London and for the court.Lemon, 2004Jourdain 1912, pp. 13‚Äì15Levey and King 1993, p. 17 The founding of the embroiderer's guild in London is attributed to the 14th century or earlier, but its early documents were lost in the Great Fire of London in the 17th century. An indenture of 23 March 1515 records the establishment of Broderers' Hall in Cutter Lane in that year,Norris p. 225 and the guild was officially incorporated (or reincorporated) by Royal Charter under Elizabeth I in 1561 as the Worshipful Company of Broderers.Jourdain 1912, p. 56 Professional embroiderers were also attached to the great households of England, but it is unlikely that those working far from London were members of the Company. From the middle of the 14th century, money that had previously been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions. Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. The work produced by the London workshops was simplified to meet the demands of this deteriorating market. The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. Surface couching replaced underside couching, and allover embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns, \\"thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest.\\"Jourdain 1912, p. 15 Renaissance to Restoration Elizabeth I wears a blackwork chemise and partlet and a gown embroidered with gold thread and studded with pearls. The Phoenix Portrait by Nicholas Hilliard, c. 1575‚Äì76 The second great flowering of English embroidery, after Opus Anglicanum, took place in the reign of Elizabeth I.Digby 1964, p. 21 Although the majority of surviving English embroidery from the medieval period was intended for church use, this demand decreased radically with the Protestant Reformation. In contrast, the bulk of the surviving embroidery of the Tudor, Elizabethan, and Jacobean eras is for domestic use, whether for clothing or household decoration. The stable society that existed between the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 and the English Civil War encouraged the building and furnishing of new houses, in which rich textiles played a part. Some embroidery was imported in this period, including the canvas work bed valances once thought to be English but now attributed to France, but the majority of work was made in England‚Äîand increasingly, by skilled amateurs, mostly women, working domestically, to designs by professional men and women, and later to published pattern books.Levey and King 1993, pp. 13 and 15 =Tudor and Jacobean styles= A general taste for abundant surface ornamentation is reflected in both household furnishings and in fashionable court clothing from the mid-16th century through the reign of James I. A 1547 account of the wardrobe of Henry VIII shows that just over half of the 224 items were ornamented with embroidery of some kind,Hayward 2007, p. 360‚Äì361 and embroidered shirts and accessories were popular New Year's gift to the Tudor monarchs.Arnold 2008, p. 9 Fine linen shirts, chemises, ruffs, collars, coifs and caps were embroidered in monochrome silks and edged in lace. The monochrome works are classified as blackwork embroidery even when worked in other colours; red, crimson, blue, green, and pink were also popular.Levey 1993, pp. 16‚Äì17 Outer clothing and furnishings of woven silk brocades and velvets were ornamented with gold and silver embroidery in linear or scrolling patterns, applied bobbin lace and passementerie, and small jewels.Arnold 1985, pp. PAGES Margaret Laton's embroidered jacket is typical of the early 17th century style. This jacket has survived and is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Appliqu√© work was popular in the Tudor era, especially for large-scale works such as wall hangings. In Medieval England, rich clothing had been bequeathed to the church to be remade into vestments; following the dissolution of the monasteries at the Reformation, the rich silks and velvets of the great monastic houses were cut up and repurposed to make hangings and cushions for private homes. Shapes cut from opulent fabrics and small motifs or slips worked on fine linen canvas were applied a background fabric of figured silk, velvet, or plain wool and embellished with embroidery, in a style deriving from the later, simpler forms of Medieval work. Canvaswork in which the linen ground was covered entirely by tent, gobelin, or cross stitches in wool or silk thread was often used for cushion covers and small bags. Notable examples like the Bradford carpet, a pictorial table cover, were likely the work of professionals in the Broderers' Company. Polychrome (multicoloured) silk embroidery became fashionable in the reign of Elizabeth, and from c. 1590 to 1620 a uniquely English fashion arose for embroidered linen jackets worn informally or as part of masquing costume. These jackets usually featured scrolling floral patterns worked in a multiplicity of stitches. Similar patterns worked in 2-ply worsted wool called crewel on heavy linen for furnishings are characteristic of Jacobean embroidery. =Pattern sources= Blackwork embroidery of the 1530s (left) and 1590s (right). Pattern books for geometric embroidery and needlelace were published in Germany as early as the 1520s. These featured the stepped, angular patterns characteristic of early blackwork, ultimately deriving from medieval Islamic Egypt. These patterns, seen in the portraits of Hans Holbein the Younger, were worked over counted threads in a double running stitch (later called Holbein stitch by English embroiderers).Arnold 2008, p. 6 The first pattern book for embroidery published in England was Moryssche & Damaschin renewed & encreased very popular for Goldsmiths & Embroiderers by Thomas Geminus (1545). Moryssche or Moresque refers to Moorish or arabesque designs of spirals, scrolls, and zigzags,North, Susan. \\"'An Instrument of profit, pleasure, and of ornament': Embroidered Tudor and Jacobean Dress Accessories.\\" In Morrall and Watt 2008, p. 43‚Äì47 an important part of the repertoire of Renaissance ornament in many media. Scrolling patterns of flowers and leaves filled with geometric filling stitches are characteristic of blackwork from the 1540s through 1590s, and similar patterns worked in coloured silks appear from the 1560s, outlined in backstitch and filled with detached buttonhole stitch. Additional pattern books for embroiderers appeared late in the century, followed by Richard Shorleyker's A Schole-house for the Needle published in London in 1624. Other sources for embroidery designs were the popular herbals and emblem books. Both domestic and professional embroiderers probably relied on skilled draughtsmen or pattern-drawers to interpret these design sources and draw them out on linen ready to be stitched.Digby 1984, pp. 51‚Äì52 =Early samplers= Detail of a band sampler on buff linen, c. 1660. Printed pattern books were not easily obtainable, and a sampler or embroidered record of stitches and patterns was the most common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament. The earliest dated surviving sampler, housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, was made by Jane Bostocke who included her name and the date 1598 in the inscription, but the earliest documentary reference to sampler making goes back another hundred years, to the 1502 household expense accounts of Elizabeth of York, which record the purchase of an ell of linen to make a sampler for the queen.Fawdry and Brown, p. 16 From the early 17th century, samplers became a more formal and stylized part of a girl's education, even as the motifs and patterns on the samplers faded from fashion. =Pictorial embroidery and stumpwork= Cabinet with personifications of the five senses, raised work, third quarter 17th century Following the death of James I and the accession of Charles I, elaborately embroidered clothing faded from popularity under the dual influences of rising Puritanism and the new court's taste for French fashion with its lighter silks in solid colours accessorised with masses of linen and lace.Gueter, Ruth. \\"Embroidered Biblical Narratives and Their Social Context.\\" In Morrall and Watt 2008, p. 43‚Äì47 In this new climate, needlework was praised by moralists as an appropriate occupation for girls and women in the home, and domestic embroidery for household use flourished. Embroidered pictures, mirror frames, workboxes, and other domestic objects of this era often depicted Biblical stories featuring characters dressed in the fashion of Charles and his queen Henrietta Maria, or after the Restoration, Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. These stories were executed in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work, usually known by its modern name stumpwork.Hughes, p.22 Raised work arose from the detached buttonhole stitch fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery. Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds in a variety of stitches and prominent features were padded with horsehair or lambswool, or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames. Ribbons, spangles, beads, small pieces of lace, canvaswork slips, and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work. =Crewel= V&A; T.166-1961. Sets of bed hangings embroidered in crewel wools were another characteristic product of the Stuart era. These were worked on a new fabric, a natural twill weave from Bruges with a linen warp and cotton weft. Crewel wools of the 17th century were firmly twisted unlike the soft wools sold under that name today, and were dyed in deep rich shades of green, blue, red, yellow, and brown. Motifs of flowers and trees, with birds, insects, and animals, were worked at large scale in a variety of stitches. The origins of this work are in the polychrome embroidery on scrolling stems of the Elizabethan era, later blended with the Tree of Life and other motifs of Indian palampores, introduced by the trade of the East India Company.Beck 1995, pp. 54‚Äì58 After the Restoration, the patterns became ever more fanciful and exuberant. \\"It is an almost impossible task to describe the large leaves, since they bear no resemblance to anything natural, they are, however, rarely angular in outline, rejoicing rather in sweeping curves, and drooping points, curled over to display the under side of the leaf, a device that gave opening for much ingenuity in the arrangement of the stitches.\\" Although usually called \\"Jacobean embroidery\\" by modern stitchers, crewel has its origins in the reign of James I but remained popular through the reign of Queen Anne and into the early 18th century, when a return to the simpler forms of the earliest work became fashionable. Glorious Revolution to the Great War=Later Stuart= The accession of William III and Mary II following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 triggered another change in needlework fashions. Associations of stumpwork with the reign of the deposed Stuarts combined with Mary's Dutch taste ushered in new styles influenced by Indian chintzes. From the 1690s, household furnishings such as chair covers and firescreens were the focus of embroidery in the home.Geuter, p. 73 =Georgian= Stoke Edith Wall Hanging, linen canvas embroidered with silk and wool, with some details in appliqu√©, 1710‚Äì1720 V&A; Museum no. T.568‚Äì1996. In the Georgian era, canvaswork was popular for chair coverings, footstools, screens and card tables. Embroidered pictures and upholstery both reflected the popular pastoral theme of men and women in the sheep-cropped English countryside. Other recurring themes include exotic Tree of Life patterns influenced by earlier crewelwork and chinoiserie with its fanciful imagery of an imaginary China, asymmetry in format and whimsical contrasts of scale. In contrast, needlepainting in silks and wools produced naturalistic portraits and domestic scenes.Beck 1995, pp. 63‚Äì83Hughes, p. 37 Embroidery was once again an important element of fashion in the early 18th century. Aprons, stomachers, hanging pockets, shoes, gowns, and men's coats and waistcoats were all decorated with embroidery. =Later samplers= Cross- stitch alphabet sampler worked by Elizabeth Laidman, 1760. By the 18th century, sampler making had become an important part of girls' education in boarding and institutional schools. A commonplace component was now an alphabet with numerals, possibly accompanied by various crowns and coronets, all used in marking household linens. Traditional embroidered motifs were now rearranged into decorative borders framing lengthy inscriptions or verses of an \\"improving\\" nature and small pictorial scenes. These new samplers were more useful as a record of accomplishment to be hung on the wall than as a practical stitch guide.Beck 1995, p. 70 =Tambourwork= Tambourwork was a new chainstitch embroidery fad of the 1780s influenced by Indian embroidered muslins. Stitched originally with a needle and later with a small hook, tambour takes its name from the round embroidery frame in which it was worked. Tambour was suited to the light, flowing ornament appropriate to the new muslin dresses of this period, and patterns were readily available in periodicals like the Lady's Magazine which debuted in 1770.Beck 1995, pp. 86‚Äì87Hughes, pp. 41, 80 Tambourwork was copied by machine early in the Industrial Revolution. As early as 1810, a \\"worked muslin cap ... done in tambour stitch by a steam-engine\\" was on the market, and machine-made netting was in general use as a background by the 1820s.Hughes, p.80 =Smocking= The linen smock-frocks worn by rural workers, especially shepherds and waggoners, in parts of England and Wales from the early eighteenth century featured fullness across the back, breast, and sleeves folded into \\"tubes\\" (narrow unpressed pleats) held in place and decorated by smocking, a type of surface embroidery in a honeycomb pattern across the pleats that controls the fullness while allowing a degree of stretch. Embroidery styles for smock- frocks varied by region, and a number of motifs became traditional for various occupations: wheel-shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on. Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread, often in the same color as the smock. By the mid-nineteenth century, wearing of traditional smock-frocks by country laborers was dying out, and a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past led to a fashion for women's and children's clothing loosely styled after smock-frocks. These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate smocking embroidery done in cotton floss in contrasting colors; smocked garments with pastel-colored embroidery remain popular for babies.Marshall 1980, pp. 17‚Äì19 =Berlin work= Berlin wool work purse, c. 1840, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, M.2007.211.280. In the early 19th century, canvaswork in tent or petit point stitch again became popular. The new fashion, using printed patterns and coloured tapestry wools imported from Berlin, was called Berlin wool work. Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831.Berman 2000 Berlin work was stitched to hand-coloured or charted patterns, leaving little room for individual expression, and was so popular that \\"Berlin work\\" became synonymous with \\"canvaswork\\". Its chief characteristic was intricate three- dimensional looks created by careful shading. By mid-century, Berlin work was executed in bright colours made possible by the new synthetic dyes. Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers, cushions, bags, and slippers as well as for embroidered \\"copies\\" of popular paintings. The craze for Berlin work peaked around 1850 and died out in the 1870s, under the influence of a competing aesthetic that would become known as art needlework. =Art needlework= Artichoke art needlework panel, wool on linen, Morris & Co.. In 1848, the influential Gothic Revival architect G. E. Street co-wrote a book called Ecclesiastical Embroidery. He was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish Berlin work in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum.Parry 1983, pp. 10‚Äì11. Street's one-time apprentice, the Pre-Raphaelite poet, artist, and textile designer William Morris, embraced this aesthetic, resurrecting the techniques of freehand surface embroidery which had been popular from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. The new style, called art needlework, emphasized flat patterns with delicate shading in satin stitch accompanied by a number of novelty stitches. It was worked in silk or wool thread dyed with natural dyes on wool, silk, or linen grounds. By the 1870s, Morris's decorative arts firm Morris & Co. was offering both designs for embroideries and finished works in the art needlework style. Morris became active in the growing movement to return originality and mastery of technique to embroidery. Morris and his daughter May were early supporters of the Royal School of Art Needlework, founded in 1872, whose aim was to \\"restore Ornamental Needlework for secular purposes to the high place it once held among decorative arts.\\"Quoted in Parry 1983, pp. 18‚Äì19. Textiles worked in art needlework styles were featured at the various Arts and Crafts exhibitions from the 1890s to the Great War.Parry, Linda. \\"Textiles\\". In Lochnan, Schoenherr, and Silver 1996, p. 156 Modern period Organizations whose origins date back as far as the Middle Ages remain active in supporting embroidery in Britain today. The Worshipful Company of Broderers is now a charitable organization supporting excellence in embroidery. The Royal School of Needlework is based at Hampton Court Palace and is engaged in textile restoration and conservation, as well as training professional embroiderers through a new 2-year Foundation Degree programme (in conjunction with the University for the Creative Arts) with a top-up to full BA(Hons) being available for the first time in the 2011/12 academic year. Previously, apprentices were trained by an intensive 3-year in-house programme. It is a registered charity and receives commissions from public bodies and individuals, including the Hastings Embroidery of 1965 commemorating the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings the following year, and the Overlord Embroidery of 1968‚Äì74 commemorating the D-Day invasion of France during World War II, now in The D-Day Story in Southsea, Portsmouth. The Embroiderers' Guild, also based at Hampton Court, was founded in 1906 by sixteen former students of the Royal School of Art Needlework to represent the interests of embroidery. It is active in education and exhibition. NotesReferences       ","title":"English embroidery"},{"id":"21255428","text":"Fontainebleau is a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris.

Its first- generation tram network first operated as a horse tram system, and was eventually converted to electric trams in the early twentieth century. The original tram network finally closed in 1966. Trams returned in 1990, and a second generation of modern tram service began service in 1992. In this modern era, Istanbul is served by three separate tramway systems. The Asian side has a heritage tramline, whereas the European side has both a heritage tramline and a modern tram system. History Trams on the new Galata Bridge (c.1912). Istanbul inaugurated horse trams in 1872 and these served the people of Istanbul until 1912. Following this date, electric trams were put in place and they were the main means for urban public transport until 1966. Many additional tramlines were added over time, and the system reached its greatest extent in 1956 with 108 million passengers carried by 270 tram-cars on 56 tram lines. But starting from the mid-1950s, automobile traffic congestion in Istanbul increased rapidly. Bus and taxi services grew rapidly over the same period of time. The number of private cars also increased greatly, and many narrow streets, which were ideal for trams, now started filling up with motor vehicles. Tramcars were not modernized for many decades, and some of the 1911 electric cars were still running in the 1960s. At that time, modern buses provided faster and smoother journeys, whereas the trams were slower, narrow single-coach cars and had many outdated features like bow collectors. Poor maintenance of tracks caused derailments and bumpy rides. Due to the city's rapid growth, reconstruction of Istanbul's infrastructure became urgent, and many streets were widened. The transport authority thought that slow tram transport sharing road space with fast bus transport would cause many problems in trying to guarantee smoother city transportation. In sum, the tramway had little comfort and was slow because it was caught in the traffic jam caused by the cars, and the tracks were also outdated, noisy and in the middle of the street. Cars had to pass the tramway on the right, causing danger for the pedestrians boarding and alighting the tramway. Comparatively, electric trolleybuses had proved to be a good alternative to trams in many countries. Due to all of these factors, the transport department decide to replace trams with trolleybuses in Istanbul. Trolleybuses service started well, but due to their needed continuous high investment and maintenance, they were not affordable to transport authority either, and trolleybus service survived only 23 years. After closing the tram network in mid-1960s, it was believed that by removing the old-fashioned obstacle to smooth city traveling, the city would be able to move faster than before, but this belief was proven to be false in the following years. The uncontrolled increase in petrol-based vehicles like buses, taxis, and private cars began to choke the streets of Istanbul. For being situated mostly in Asia, Turkey suffered by many problems common to developing countries, including pollution, traffic jams, illegal migration, low literacy and increasing population, etc. Increasing population led to the increasing urbanization of Istanbul, which spawned increasing motor vehicles, increasing air and noise pollution, and increasing traffic jams and smog. The city eventually became slower than pre-tram closure era. From 1970 onwards, all this problems grew rapidly, and by the mid-1980s Istanbulians realized that the failure to control motor vehicles, and the closure of tram network, was a great mistake. Many cities around the world like Tunis, Buenos Aires, etc., also realized this error and, like them, Istanbul also planned for the return of the tram. As an experiment, Istanbul first opened a heritage tramline at European side in 1990. Due to its increasing popularity, a modern tramline was opened in 1992, also at European side. Another heritage tramline opened in 2003, but this time on the Asian side, and another modern tramline opened in 2007. =Timeline= Heritage tram in Asian side Modern tram in Istanbul *1860 ‚Äì The operation a (horse) tram system proposed in Istanbul. *1863 ‚Äì The first bid came for running tram through Istanbul's main arteries in the suburbs, came from a person named Huchiadson. *1864 ‚Äì The second proposal in 1864 in Istanbul and the Galata Be≈üikta≈ü' privilege to operate a tram. Three routes were planned- 1) Emin√∂n√º ‚Äì Divanyolu ‚Äì Beyazƒ±t ‚Äì Aksaray ‚Äì Yedikule or Topkapƒ±, 2) Emin√∂n√º ‚Äì Ayvansaray ‚Äì Ey√ºp 3) Galata ‚Äì Karak√∂y ‚Äì Tophane ‚Äì Be≈üikta≈ü ‚Äì Ortak√∂y ‚Äì Arnavutk√∂y *1871 ‚Äì The operation of the first horse driven tramcar has started in 4 lines. *1872 ‚Äì Increased passenger demand because of the early 1890s the first route with the \\"imperial\\" has been started, called the use of two-story tram. *1912 ‚Äì Horse tram operation stopped. *1914 ‚Äì Electric tram started running from 25 January at European side. The route was from Karak√∂y to reach Emin√∂n√º. It was also the first tramcar to pass over Galata Bridge, as the passing of horse-driven trams was not permitted from that bridge. *1923 ‚Äì Tram service expanded in 12 routes. *1928 ‚Äì Electric tram started running from 8 June at Asian side. *1939 ‚Äì The tramcar, T√ºnel, bus and electricity systems, which were being operated by various foreign companies, were nationalized, and a new company called the 'ƒ∞stanbul Elektrik, Tramway ve T√ºnel ƒ∞≈ületmeleri (IETT)' took over both European and Asian networks. *1950 ‚Äì Tram service expanded in 37 routes. All the lines were crossing the Golden Horn on the famous Galata Bridge, which was acting as the central connection point. This was the peak year of Istanbul tram. *1956 ‚Äì The T√ºnel-Ma√ßka line (route 14) in the European part and from Topkapƒ±-√áapa line in the in-town walls region, routes were closed. Topkapƒ± ‚Äì √áapa ‚Äì Aksaray route was also closed for redevelopment of Aksaray Square. * 1961 ‚Äì The last tram ran on the European side of Istanbul on 12 January 1961. The Topkapƒ±-Emin√∂n√º line was replaced by trolleybuses on 27 May 1961. Six trams were transferred to the tram network on the Asian side. * 1966 ‚Äì The last tram ran on the Asian side of Istanbul on 3 October 1966, between Kadƒ±k√∂y and Kƒ±zƒ±ltoprak. The remaining trams were transferred to the transport museum. * 1984 ‚Äì Trolleybus service stopped on 16 July 1984. At this time, all electricity-driven city transport in Istanbul completely ended. * 1990 ‚Äì ƒ∞stiklal Caddesi (Independence Avenue) was closed to traffic. Trams returned to the European side of Istanbul as a heritage tram line, the Taksim-T√ºnel Nostalgia Tramway, operating on ƒ∞stiklal Caddesi between Taksim and T√ºnel. Rolling stocks were same as the pre-1966 trams. * 1992 ‚Äì Opening of a completely separate and tramline: trams returned to the European side of Istanbul as modern system, built by Yapƒ± Merkezi. The line, now called the T1 line, operates on the same alignment where trams last ran in 1956. * 2003 ‚Äì Trams returned to the Asian side of Istanbul as heritage tramway, operating a circular tramway on the old closed Route 20 tramway. The rolling stock was imported from Gotha, Thuringia, Germany. This line is now known as the T3 tramline (or the Kadƒ±k√∂y-Moda Nostalgia Tramway). * 2007 ‚Äì A second modern tramline, called T4, opened on the European side on 12 September 2007. Tramlines=Historic tram routes= There were many tram routes; the European side had more routes than the Asian side. The main routes were as follows: * 1 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì Kƒ±sƒ±klƒ± * 4 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì Bostancƒ± * 6 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì Fenerbah√ße * 8 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì Hasanpa≈üa * 10 ‚Äì ≈ûi≈üli ‚Äì T√ºnel * 11 ‚Äì ≈ûi≈üli ‚Äì Beyazƒ±t * 11 ‚Äì √úsk√ºdar ‚Äì Kƒ±sƒ±klƒ± * 12 ‚Äì Harbiye ‚Äì Fatih * 12 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì √úsk√ºdar * 14 ‚Äì Ma√ßka ‚Äì T√ºnel * 15 ‚Äì Ma√ßka ‚Äì Sirkeci * 16 ‚Äì Ma√ßka ‚Äì Beyazƒ±t * 17 ‚Äì Mecidiyek√∂y ‚Äì ≈ûi≈üli ‚Äì Sirkeci * 19 ‚Äì Kurtulu≈ü- Aksaray * 20 ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y ‚Äì Moda (This route has been partly replicated by the Asian side heritage tram from 2003) * 22 ‚Äì Bebek ‚Äì Emin√∂n√º * 23 ‚Äì Ortak√∂y ‚Äì Aksaray * 32 ‚Äì Topkapƒ± ‚Äì Bah√ßekapƒ± * 33 ‚Äì Yedikule ‚Äì Bah√ßekapƒ± * 34 ‚Äì Be≈üikta≈ü ‚Äì Fatih * 37 ‚Äì Edirnekapƒ± ‚Äì Bah√ßekapƒ± Beside these, there were some short routes, which were truncated versions of full routes. Route numbers were also displayed by color combinations, mainly for the illiterate. The colors reflected the termini as follows: * Red : Aksaray, Mecidiyek√∂y, ≈ûi≈üli, Topkapƒ±, T√ºnel * Blue : Beyazƒ±t, Ma√ßka * Green : Edirnekapƒ±, Fatih, Harbiye * Yellow : Arnavutk√∂y, Bebek, Be≈üikta≈ü, Kurtulu≈ü, Ortak√∂y * White : Bah√ßekapƒ±, Emin√∂n√º, Sirkeci, Taksim, Yedikule The colors of both termini were used in left and right of destination board. (Note: service 22 had all-yellow as color despite serving Emin√∂n√º) On the Asian side, services had solid colors: * Red : 4, 11 * Blue : 1 * Green : 6 * Yellow : 20 * White : 12 * Brown : 8 =Alignments= All tram routes were on unreserved tracks and middle of the roads. Some routes were on narrow streets, some were on broad avenues. Tramcars were caught in the traffic jam caused by the cars. The tracks were also outdated, noisy and in the middle of the street. Cars had to pass the tramway on the right, causing danger for the pedestrians boarding and alighting the tramway. Those were one of the strong reasons of closure of the system. There are some common alignments with past & present tramway system: * The heritage tram of European side from Taksim to T√ºnel has laid following the previous systems ‚Äì route 10, 11, 15, 17, but now as a single track with crossing. * The heritage tram of Asian side from Kadƒ±k√∂y to Moda has laid following the previous systems route 20, but as a circular tramway. * The modern tram from Kabata≈ü to Zeytinburnu has laid following the previous systems alignment, as Kabata≈ü ‚Äì Karak√∂y ‚Äì Sirkeci ‚Äì Beyazƒ±t ‚Äì Aksaray ‚Äì Topkapƒ± route, with crossing on Galata Bridge. Rolling Stock The rolling stock was identical with Istanbul's current European-side heritage tramway. However, the tram was infrequently upgraded, and the 1911 electric cars were still running in the 1960s. These vehicles looked outdated compared to the new cars and buses that were now on the streets, contributing to the tramway's closure. Rolling stocks were different between the European and Asian sides, but after the European network closed, its trams were transferred to the Asian side, where they served along with former trams until the final closure in 1966. Depots & termini The following termini were ‚Äì Kadƒ±k√∂y, Kƒ±sƒ±klƒ±, Bostancƒ±, Fenerbah√ße, T√ºnel, Beyazƒ±t, Harbiye, Fatih, Ma√ßka, Sirkeci, Kurtulu≈ü, Moda, Bebek, Emin√∂n√º, Ortak√∂y, Topkapƒ±, Bah√ßekapƒ±, Yedikule, Edirnekapƒ±, Kabata≈ü. The following depots were ‚Äì Baƒülarba≈üƒ±, Hasanpa≈üa, Aksaray, Be≈üikta≈ü, ≈ûi≈üli T√ºnel, Moda & Kadƒ±k√∂y are the three places where both past system's & today's nostalgic system's termini are present.

In 1956, Kovach and Rabovsky were among the passengers rescued from Italian ocean liner SS Andrea Doria after its 1956 collision with the MS Stockholm off of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The two appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show multiple times after their rescue. Shortly after their defection, the two were joined by their one time costume designer from the Budapest Opera House Magda Rosenberg n√©e Markowicz. They started their own troupe in the early 1960s called Bihari. Kovach opened a ballet school in Plainview, New York in 1969. Kovach divorced Rabovsky, and married Tibor Szegezdy, who died in 1985, and was survived by her third husband, Steve Farago. She was also survived by a brother and two stepchildren.

The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. History The chancellor Regimbald (a survivor from Edward‚Äôs reign into William‚Äôs) rebuilt his Minster at Milborne Port in ‚Äúa sumptuous hybrid style.‚Äù It would seem logical to assign the now-demolished nave to this period, since the surviving south doorway of the nave was incorporated into the 1860s rebuild and is of Saxo-Norman design. The church was part of the original endowment of Cirencester Abbey by Henry I, and held by them until the dissolution of the monasteries. An attempt was made around 1199 to make the church a prebend in Wells Cathedral however this was unsuccessful. In 1543 Winchester College acquired control and held it until 1824 when it passed to the Marquess of Anglesey and he sold his estate to Sir William Coles Medlycott in 1835. The Medlycott family memorials survive in the north transept. From 1789 until 1825 the vicar was George Huntingford, the warden of Winchester College and bishop successively of Gloucester and Hereford, although the parish was looked after by the curate during that time. Architecture The chapel roof has been dated at 1641. In 1712 a west gallery was built for the singers and there was also an east gallery by 1747. The west gallery was enlarged in 1812-14 and in 1826 a two-bay north aisle with a gallery was added to the nave. In 1841 the east gallery over the rood screen was taken down. Despite the Victorian nave (almost totally rebuilt 1867‚Äì69 to the designs of Henry Hall) and accompanying north aisle, there remains the pre-conquest central tower and chancel. The south transept was heavily restored and the north chapel wall rebuilt in 1843. The north transept was rebuilt along with the nave, so compared to pre-1867 half of the Anglo- Saxon church has now gone. The new nave is longer than the original it replaced. The old west front exhibited vestiges of triangular-headed arcading on either side of the inserted Perpendicular west window, and the lower part of the front was divided into compartments, by broad pilasters of plain square section. This was recorded by photography and the photo was published in 1893 by A. Reynolds. The crossing (tower) is wider in plan than the nave, and markedly wider than the transepts or chancel. This is a distinctive Saxon trait, which may also be observed at nearby Sherborne Abbey (where traces of the Saxon rubble west wall may be seen). Inside, the four crossing arches with their jambs survive, although the east and west arches have been rebuilt in pointed 14th-century form; the south and north arches have been slightly deformed to elliptical shape due to the pressure of the masonry, perhaps by the addition of the top stage of the tower at some later date. There are eight bells in the tower, three of 1736 by Thomas Bilbie, two by A. and C. Mears of 1846, and the rest recast in the 20th century. Further restoration of the Chancel took place in 1908 when Sir Walter Tapper included plaster medallions high on the sanctuary walls. The glass in the east window is by Bainbridge Reynolds. The chancel exhibits pilaster strip work, much disturbed and cut by Early English period windows, and has a close parallel at Bradford-on-Avon. The wall thickness of the chancel is 2 ft 8in, which is a typical Anglo-Saxon dimension. The church, with its Anglo-Saxon features, is of major importance to our understanding of the larger minsters in pre-conquest England.

However, it is often falsely named as Tibetan Great Compassion Mantra (ËóèÂÇ≥Â§ßÊÇ≤Âíí) or The Great Compassion Mantra in Sanskrit (Ê¢µÈü≥Â§ßÊÇ≤Âíí) in Chinese-speaking regions. Some people believe that this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ is told by the Eleven-Faced Avalokitesvara, an esoteric bodhisattva in Tibetan Buddhism, and that it is the equivalent Tibetan version of The Great Compassion Mantra in Mahayana Buddhism. This is why it is often being referred to as Tibetan Great Compassion Mantra. However, this opinion is not accepted by most Mahayana Buddhists.  In Buddhist music  The chanting of this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ is one of the most popular and famous pieces of Buddhist music in Chinese- speaking countries.

The name came from the fact that Confederate forces used the site for batteries of artillery.http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/books/booklets/battery_park_hotel/default_battery_park.htm , Retrieved on 2009/01/25. History The original Battery Park Hotel was built in 1886 by Colonel Frank Coxe. It was designed by Philadelphia architect Edward Hazlehurst (1853-1915) in \\"spectacular\\" Queen Anne style. (includes historic postcard photo) It was the first hotel in the South with an electric elevator, and one of the first with electric lighting. Once the railroad reached Asheville in 1880, the mountain town attracted 20 passenger trains a day from the nation's largest cities, and people found out what a wonderful place the community was to visit. One reason for visiting Asheville was the clean mountain air, which helped problems such as tuberculosis. Fine hotels were built, and Coxe's Battery Park Hotel was the best of these. For one thing, its location on Asheville's tallest hill provided magnificent views. The Rockefeller and Lorillard families were among those who stayed in the Battery Park. Another notable guest was George Vanderbilt, who from his window could see the land that would one day become Biltmore Estate. By 1920, the Asheville Citizen reported the Battery Park had changed management three times. Edwin Wiley Grove bought the Battery Park in 1921. In 1922 he announced that it would remain a resort hotel for winter and summer, while he would add a second year-round hotel nearby. Plans changed later, however. People hated to see the old Battery Park Hotel torn down, but Grove, known also for the Grove Park Inn, built a fine hotel in the same location. Despite its architectural value, which Grove acknowledged, the old building was \\"rapidly outgrowing its period of usefulness\\". Some sources say it was damaged by a fire before being torn down, but newspapers do not appear to support this. The new hotel would be first-class, for industry, and not a resort. Architect William Lee Stoddart of New York City designed the 220-room Battery Park Hotel that stands today. The modern building was built of reinforced concrete with brick, limestone, and terra cotta, with a Mission Revival roof that offered a dining area. The architectural style was a mix of Neoclassical and \\"Spanish romanticism\\". Helen Clevenger, a 19 year-old college student, was found dead in Room 224 on July 17, 1936, having died the night before. She had been shot in the chest, and slashed in the face with a sharp instrument. A hall boy at the hotel, 22 year-old Martin Moore, confessed to the murder, and was executed on December 11 of the same year. On September 4, 1943 a U.S. Government Official, Clifton Alheit, jumped to his death off the roof of the Battery Park Hotel in an apparent suicide. The hotel closed October 30, 1972 and Billy Shadrick of Housing Projects, Inc. took it over in 1979, keeping the historic exterior with the help of preservation tax credits, and converting the building into apartments for senior citizens. Today it is owned by National Church Residences,http://www.nationalchurchresidences.org/communities/nc/asheville/battery- park-senior-apartments and businesses operate on the first floor.

It was part of a trend of extremely low-cost aircraft as manufacturers attempted to survive the Great Depression. Rearwin Junior 4000 (OK-WAO) and Walter Polaris II Development The Aeronca C-2 had successfully debuted in 1930 as a low-cost two-seat ultra- light sportplane, setting a trend for aircraft manufacturers trying to survive the Great Depression.

Douglas Webber eventually left American Eagle and started advertising a complete design of another similar aircraft and his services as an engineer--Rearwin bought the design, hired Webber and Hockaday, and completed the prototype in 6 months. The first flight was in April 1931. The Junior was tested with an experimental engine by Guy Poyer (a business acquaintance of the company's main investor) built in the Rearwin factory, but that project failed. An alternative engine was also certified.

The wings were of wooden construction while the fuselage and empennage were built from welded steel tube, with the whole aircraft skinned in fabric. While the Junior resembled Webber and Hockaday's preceding Eaglet, it was longer, wider, and had wider landing gear. It was heavier than the Eaglet but also more capable. Operational history Although the Rearwin Junior was designed to meet the lowest possible sale price, the onset of the Great Depression severely limited the size of the market for sport aircraft, and only a small number were built.

Early life Lightburn was born in Pennsylvania, the oldest of 5 children. His family moved to Lewis County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and worked on his family's farm, where he spent the rest of his childhood.General Joseph A. J. Lightburn, \\"Fighting Parson\\" He became friends with Thomas J. Jackson (later known as General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson), whose home was only a few miles away. The Lightburn family freely lent young Jackson books from their large library and took him to church. The two were lifelong friends. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in the Mexican War; serving until 1851 when he was discharged as Sergeant. In 1859 he became a licensed minister in the Baptist church. Civil War When the Civil War began Lightburn was appointed colonel of the 4th (West) Virginia Infantry Regiment on August 14, 1861.Eicher, p. 348. Two of his brothers, Martin Van Buren Lightburn and Calvin Luther Lightburn, also joined this regiment and served with their older brother throughout the war. Another brother, John Fell Lightburn, joined the Confederate Army instead. Joseph Lightburn's regiment served under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan during the West Virginia Campaign early in the war. For much of 1862 he commanded the 4th Brigade in the District of Kanawha. He was forced to evacuate the Kanawha Valley in the face of Confederate General William W. Loring, but helped drive these same Confederates out of the valley during Jacob D. Cox's operations in West Virginia. On March 14, 1863, Lightburn was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and ordered to report to the Army of the Tennessee. He arrived in January 1863 but shortly after went on a leave of absence and returned to his home in West Virginia. During this time Confederate generals William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones and John D. Imboden conducted a raid through the area and Lightburn was enlisted to raise troops to fend off the raid. Returning to the Army of the Tennessee he assumed command of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, XV Corps on May 23 just after the siege of Vicksburg had begun and led the brigade throughout the rest of the siege and following expedition against Jackson, Mississippi. Afterward he was temporarily in command of the 2nd Division of the XV Corps. In November 1863 the XV Corps was transferred from Vicksburg to Chattanooga. Returning to command of his brigade, Lightburn fought under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the battle of Missionary Ridge. When Sherman's attacks against Tunnel Hill failed, he sent in 200 men commanded by Lightburn to attack the position.Korn, p. 141. This attack fared no better than Sherman's earlier attacks. Lightburn led his brigade during the Atlanta Campaign, seeing action at the battles of Resaca, Dallas and Kennesaw Mountain. During the Battle of Atlanta Lightburn rose to command the 2nd Division after the death of army commander James B. McPherson and all of Lightburn's superior officers rose in command also. When Oliver O. Howard was chosen as permanent commander of the Army of the Tennessee, Lightburn returned to command of the 2nd Brigade and fought at the battle of Ezra Church. During the following siege of Atlanta, he was engaged in light skirmishing and was shot in the head. The bullet merely grazed his skull but knocked him from his horse falling into the arms of his brother, Calvin Luther. The wound ended his career with the Army of the Tennessee and he was sent home to recover. Upon recovery he first commanded a brigade then the 2nd Division in the Department of West Virginia until he resigned from the army on June 22, 1865. Postbellum life Joseph Lightburn is buried at Broad Run Baptist Church Cemetery near Lightburn, West Virginia.General Lightburn spent the rest of his life serving as a minister, most significantly at the Broad Run Baptist Church. He was also active in the Masonic fraternity and served as the first master of Jackson Lodge 35 in Jane Lew for five years, ending in 1872. He died in Broad Run, West Virginia, and is buried there in the churchyard. He is the namesake of Lightburn, West Virginia.

The celebrated traveller came from a family from Herat.

The dam and associated infrastructure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Hiwassee Dam is named after the Hiwassee River. The river's name is derived from the Cherokee word for savanna, or large meadow, and had been applied to two of the tribe's villages along the river in the 18th century.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville, Tenn.: C and R Elder, 1972), p. 512. Location The Hiwassee River flows northwestward from its source in Towns County, Georgia through Western North Carolina, where it proceeds to slice a scenic valley through the southern Appalachian Mountains en route to its mouth along Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee. Hiwassee Dam is located nearly above the river's mouth, at the downstream end of a large bend in the river known as Fowler Bend. The dam is upstream from Apalachia Dam (which is near the Tennessee-North Carolina state line) and downstream from Chatuge Dam. Hiwassee Dam and its reservoir are surrounded by the Nantahala National Forest. Hiwassee Village, a small community that developed alongside the dam and reservoir, is located immediately south of Hiwassee Dam. North Carolina State Highway 1314 (Hiwassee Dam Access Road) crosses the top of the dam. Capacity Hiwassee Dam is a concrete gravity overflow dam high and long, and has a generating capacity of 185,000 kilowatts.Tennessee Valley Authority, Hiwassee Reservoir. Retrieved: 25 January 2009. The dam's spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of . Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has of shoreline, a storage capacity of and of flood storage. The reservoir's operating level varies by roughly in a typical year. Pumped storage In the 1950s, TVA began experiments with pumped storage at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The \\"pump-turbine\\" at Hiwassee is designated a \\"National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark\\" by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).Hiwassee Dam Unit 2 Reversible Pump-Turbine (1956) , National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark report, 14 July 1981. Retrieved: 2 October 2013.The Mountaintop Marvel, TVA.gov. Retrieved: 2 October 2013. Background and construction TVA's design plan for Hiwassee Dam, circa 1936 The hydroelectric potential of the Hiwassee River has been recognized since the early 1900s. The cities of Andrews and Murphy had already established minor dams with generating capacities along the river when major power companies began planning large-scale hydro projects in the valley in the 1920s. The Carolina-Tennessee Power Company (later reorganized as the Southern States Power Company) purchased of land and flowage rights along the river in 1924 in hopes of building a large dam just above the present dam site, but the project never materialized. The Tennessee Valley Authority, created as a New Deal measure in 1933, was given oversight of flood control operations in the Tennessee River watershed, which included the Hiwassee. One of TVA's first initiatives was to control flooding on the Hiwassee River, the waters of which were a major contributor to flooding in Chattanooga. Congress authorized the construction of Hiwassee Dam in 1935, and work began the following year. Southern States Power agreed to sell its Hiwassee tract to TVA, although the two entities bickered over the land's value in federal court until 1944, when TVA agreed to a final price of $250,000. The construction of Hiwassee Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of (including the purchased from Southern States Power), of which had to be cleared. 261 families, 462 graves, and of roads had to be relocated. Eight new bridges were constructed, and a Southern Railway trestle required modification. Several changes were necessary to protect the city of Murphy's riverfront, mainly at its main bridge and filtering plant. Construction of Hiwassee Dam's powerhouse and switchyard Hiwassee Dam's height required a large mass of concrete which engineers feared would trap heat during its setting, making the dam more vulnerable to cracks. To help heat escape, the dam's concrete sections were divided into blocks no more than in length. The blocks' joints were formed with shear keys, and pipes were installed to allow future grouting should it become necessary. Several practices were employed to avoid trapping heat in the setting of the concrete, including the use of low-heat cement. Hiwassee Dam's gates were closed on February 8, 1940, although minor construction work continued until later that same year. The first generator went online May 21, 1940. The dam's final price tag was just over $24 million. Shortly after the project's completion, TVA transferred of its Hiwassee reservation to the U.S. Forest Service for inclusion in the Nantahala National Forest. In 1952 unit 2 was added, an integration of pump and turbine built by Allis-Chalmers Company. After the electrical system for the pump failed in 2011, it remained offline until being repaired in 2016.https://www.tva.gov/Newsroom/Hiwassee- Dam%E2%80%99s-Unit-2-Pumps-It-Up ReferencesExternal links *Hiwassee Reservoir -- official TVA site *Scrapbooks of Edgar F.

John Michell and Bob Rickard in their book Unexplained Phenomena said of the International Fortean Organization \\"INFO was founded in 1965 as the natural successor to the original Fortean Society.\\" Colin Wilson said he wished to assure The American Spectator that Charles Fort is far from forgotten and credited the publishing efforts of the International Fortean Organization's INFO Journal.

Martin Gardner, in a chapter devoted to Fort, which according to the Sceptic Report neither scorns or damns, in Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, notes that Fort doubted everything, even his own speculations. Gardner makes the point that Forteanism serves to remind science that no theory is above doubt, and that knowledge is provisional, it serves a 'sound and healthy' purpose. History The organization was formed in the early 1960s by brothers, the writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the original Fortean Society which had begun in 1932 in the spirit of Charles Fort but which had grown silent by 1959 with the death of its founder Tiffany Thayer. The Fortean Society was formed by a friend of Charles Fort, Theodore Dreiser, who had threatened his publisher that he would leave if The Book of the Damned was not put into print. The original society included many of New York's literati including Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Clarence Darrow, Alexander Woollcott and Dorothy Parker. Oliver Wendall Holmes and H.L. Mencken were also early members along with a number of fledgling science-fiction writers such as Eric Frank Russell, Edmond Hamilton and Damon Knight. Dan Oldenburg in the Washington Post said of the all-volunteer staffed International Fortean Organization, \\"Its membership ranges from hard-core skeptics to top scholars to true believers -- but its cornerstone is open-mindedness.\\" The Willis brothers owned a bookstore in the States (Arlington, Virginia) and were also publishers of SF fanzines and magazines of speculative fiction and non- fiction, notably \\"Anubis\\". They enjoyed a long-time correspondence and relationship with many Fort-inspired science fiction writers such as Fritz Leiber, Philip K. Dick, Robert Anton Wilson and, especially Robert A. Heinlein, who remained a loyal member and friend to INFO until his death. Paul was an exceptionally avid letter and article writer and had long-running data exchanges with an international group of nascent forteans including Bob Rickard who went on to found \\"The News\\" in 1967, later the \\"Fortean Times\\", which was encouraged to expand with the help of corporate sponsorship. Rickard, and others, urged Paul Willis to publish. INFO was incorporated as a non-profit in 1965. The \\"INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown\\" was born shortly thereafter in the Spring of 1967. Membership was set at $12US and Heinlein would dutifully send in a check which was promptly framed and put on the wall. Heinlein would then send in a letter complaining that his check had not been cashed, along with suggestions for articles and improvements and, that too, would be framed and put on the wall. This incident is mentioned more than a few times in the \\"INFO Journal\\". Ron Willis, with help from his brother Paul, and in collaboration with Jacques Bergier, in 1974 brought out the book, Extraterrestrial Intervention, the Evidence, published by Henry Regnary Company in the US and as in France as Le Livre de l'inexplicable by Editions Alvin Michel. The authorship (or editorship) is credited to \\"Jacques Bergier and the Editors of INFO\\" and contains many articles reprinted from the \\"INFO Journal\\". The Willis', under the banner of the International Fortean Organization, had also started a conference called FortFest with speeches given by and largely attended by those working in the field of anomalous phenomena. Early INFO conferences included INFO members David Drake, also a long-time member of the INFO Board of Directors, who went on to have over one hundred science-fiction novels published and the legendary fortean John Keel who frequently presented at FortFest, as often as his intermittent health permitted. Keel was, and still is, an advisor and friend to INFO and would give FortFest a generous plug during his stint as a contributing editor at Fate Magazine and be available for midnight wit and wisdom consultations. Keel also gave INFO collections of his early magazine publishing efforts which inspired many articles in the INFO Journal and which INFO lent to Board member Mark Chorvinsky who was eager to start his own magazine, Strange. Keel started his own short-lived, prestigious, New York Fortean Society and named Phyllis Benjamin as a Founding Member and awarded her his often called \\"coveted\\" Falling Frog Award for contributions to continuing the work of Charles Fort in 1988. Other recipients of the Falling Frog Award included notable fortean writers/researchers Doug Skinner and Antonio Huneeus. The Willis' and an ex- pat American living in Canada who called himself Mr. X (after one of Charles Fort's unpublished novels) were concerned that Fort's works, in the public domain, would be lost to posterity and engaged in a letter campaign and, eventually, went to New York City to Dover Publications, Inc. to urge them to publish the works. Dover complied and the following is from \\"The Complete Works of Charles Fort\\", 1974 edition with an introduction by Damon Knight \\"Founder and President of Science Fiction Writers of America, author \\"Charles Fort, Prophet of the Unexplained\\":..This Dover edition;...a replication of the omnibus volume originally published for the Fortean Society by Henry Holt and Company, New York in 1941. The four books by Fort are unabridged and unaltered, but the 1941 Introduction by Tiffany Thayer has been omitted...The present edition has had the encouragement and cooperation of the International Fortean Organization (Info), P.O. Box 367, Arlington, Virginia 22210.\\" The Arlington post office box was moved to P.O. Box N, College Park, MD 20740 to reflect the location of the INFO offices and the INFO Library in College Park. Paul Willis relocated to College Park following the 1975 death from a brain tumor of Ron Willis. An office was found for INFO's 10,000+ books and large collection of clippings, files, and magazines such as the complete issues of \\"Doubt\\" dating back to the original Fortean Society along with letters from Theodore Dreiser, Tiffany Thayer and Ben Hecht. The original notes of Charles Fort had been donated to the New York Public Library where they remain today. INFO rented space in the Washington, D.C. suburbs. Paul Willis named the building NO! in protest of a new-age bookstore called YES! who had rejected an INFO-visiting Bob Rickard who had petitioned YES! to carry the works of Charles Fort, The Fortean Times and the INFO Journal. INFO remained based in College Park for over twenty years until a fire necessitated a move in 2003. The International Fortean Organization (INFO) holds a solid niche in the annals of forteana.

It struck a group of 17 hikers at a height of near the site of a small ski resort. The snow mass dragged the hikers about into a valley. Ten people were killed, one person was rescued with injuries and another one died in hospital while five others survived without injuries. Teams from civilian defense and other public administrations rushed to the scene for the rescue of the victims from a sports club in Trabzon after local gendarmerie was notified of the incident. Also a team of AKUT, a voluntary disaster search and rescue organization, travelled from Trabzon to the location, to assess the situation and to offer any help and assistance necessary.

Their first full-length album Say Something, was released in 2007 by Sidecho Records, to positive reviews from prominent independent music publications such as Pitchfork Media, Alternative Press, Spin Magazine, & Tiny Mix Tapes. The band met while attending college at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, later moving to Brooklyn, New York. They released their second full-length album titled Animalore on Undertow Music on March 9, 2010; it was produced by Spoon's Jim Eno. Their third full-length album titled \\"Natural Language\\" was self-released on March 25, 2014. It was produced and recorded by Dan Molad (of Lucius) in Brooklyn, NY.  Biography  Via Audio met and formed in 2003 while attending Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and released a self-titled EP on Connecticut-based record label Kill Normal Records the following year. The lineup at that time consisted of Jessica Martins (Vocals, Keys, Guitar), Dan Molad (Vocals, Guitar, Drums), David Lizmi (Bass), and Tom Deis (Vocals, Guitar). The band toured regionally through the Northeastern United States and gained a strong following in their then hometown of Boston. In 2007, the band signed to California-based label Sidecho Records, and began to garner lots of attention from various music blogs, zines, and critics after Death Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla called them his \\"new favorite band\\"SXSW.com in his column in Under the Radar Magazine, an Independent Music publication. Sidecho released the band's debut full-length album, Say Something, recorded earlier that year in Austin, Texas with Spoon drummer and producer Jim Eno, on September 25, 2007 in the United States. Additionally, Kurofone Records released the album in Japan. The album was met with praise from prominent Independent Music publications such as Pitchfork Media, who rated the album a 7.7/10 and called the album.Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Via Audio: Say Something > \\"a catchy pop record that's serious: not gloomy, not mournful, and not > pretentious. It's serious and earnest, it's occasionally sad, but there is > such a beautiful gloss over everything that it sticks, hurts, and feels > delicious.\\" The band has toured extensively in the past two years, including tours through North America with acts such as White Rabbits, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, and Jukebox The Ghost, as well as a brief tour of Japan supporting Spoon. The band has also played at numerous festivals including the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas, the Monolith Festival in Denver, Colorado, and the CMJ Music Showcase in New York City, where Spin.com named them \\"one of the nine hottest bands playing CMJ\\". In 2007 Drummer, Guitarist, and co-vocalist Dan Molad left the group to pursue other projects. Molad was replaced as the band's live drummer by Adam Sturtevant, with Deis (Guitar) and Martins (Guitar, Keys) remaining on lead vocals, and Lizmi remaining on Bass.

A player's stolen base percentage (a.k.a. SB%) measures his rate of success in stealing bases. Because stolen bases tend to help a team less than times caught stealing hurt, a player needs to have a high stolen base percentage in order to contribute much value to his team. A commonly used figure is that a player needs to succeed about 2/3 of the time to break even. With 300 minimum career attempts, Carlos Beltr√°n currently holds the record for highest Stolen base percentage in the Major Leagues, with .881, with Tim Raines in second, with .847. Total Baseball developed a statistic related to stolen base percentage called \\"Stolen Base Runs\\" or SBR. (.3 x Stolen Bases) - (.6 x Caught Stealing) This Total Baseball statistic is aimed at quantifying base-stealing. Numerous statistical studies done by Total Baseball have shown that the break even success rate for steals (the rate at which an attempt to steal is neither helping nor hurting the team in terms of total runs scored) is about 67%. Each successful steal adds approximately .3 runs to a team's total runs scored which is much less than often believed. Therefore, the statistic is meant to estimate the impact of base-stealers, which, other than the elite base- stealers, rarely amounts to more than a few runs per year for each team.

He is primarily interested in the relationship between government, citizens and professionals in the public sector. Since 1994 Van der Lans has pled, together with Paul Kuypers in their Modern Paternalisme (Modern Paternalisme), against the culture of non- interference in social work.Naar een modern paternalisme on josvdlans.nl Social workers should intervene actively in the life of their clients without becoming moralist (as in the 1950s) or overly persistent (as in the 1970s).Bemoeien werkt on josvdlans.nl According to Van der Lans this culture of non-intervention is a result of the larger scale of social work and the increased respect for privacy of citizens. Professionals such as teachers, policemen and social workers, should according to Van der Lans be freed from the increased bureaucracy in the public sector. In the eyes of Van der Lans, the increased bureaucracy is a result of the larger demand of the transparency in the civil service from the politics.Hilhorst, Pieter \\"Verlamde professionals\\" in De Volkskrant 8-3-2008. Reproduced josvdlans.nl When professionals free themselves from bureaucracy they can orient themselves to their work on the \\"front lines of society\\". They should interfere in the life of their clients with a \\"right at it\\"-mentality. Van der Lans is very critical of the role of citizens in the public sector. In his eyes citizens act as \\"kings\\": they expect government to solve their problems immediately.KONING BURGER on josvdlans.nl The government reacts as servant: politicians claim to want to listen to citizens. According to Van der Lans these relations have changed radically: before the politicians were the \\"kings\\" and the citizens servants.Koper, A., \\"Leve de overheid, weg met de burger\\" in De Volkskrant 11-11-2005. Reproduced at josvdlans.nl Van der Lans denies that there is a problem of representation in politics: never has politics tried to respond so strongly to the demands of citizens. This has shown the weakness of government however, which cannot deal with all the demands of all the citizens in the short term.  Private life  Van der Lans co-habits. He has four children, two of which are foster children.

The concept is named after Kunihiko Kodaira. These are never algebraic, though they have non-constant meromorphic functions. They are usually divided into two subtypes: primary Kodaira surfaces with trivial canonical bundle, and secondary Kodaira surfaces which are quotients of these by finite groups of orders 2, 3, 4, or 6, and which have non-trivial canonical bundles. The secondary Kodaira surfaces have the same relation to primary ones that Enriques surfaces have to K3 surfaces, or bielliptic surfaces have to abelian surfaces. Invariants: If the surface is the quotient of a primary Kodaira surface by a group of order k = 1,2,3,4,6, then the plurigenera Pn are 1 if n is divisible by k and 0 otherwise. Hodge diamond: Examples: Take a non-trivial line bundle over an elliptic curve, remove the zero section, then quotient out the fibers by Z acting as multiplication by powers of some complex number z.

The Kannada-language version, whose central theme has a strong Jain bent, contains 60 fables, 13 of which are original stories. All the stories have morality as their theme and carry a summary section (Katha Shloka). The Kannada version is the earliest Indian vernacular version, and the author, being a minister, not surprisingly, chose to write a book on political science (Rajniti).Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1253Shastri (1955), p. 357 The scholar R. Narasimhachar fixed the date of this work as c. 1025, but the modern Kannada poet and scholar Govinda Pai dated the work to 8 March 1031, based on information in the concluding stanza of the manuscript. About the author Durgasimha was a Brahmin by birth and is known to have belonged to the Smartha Bhagavata sub-sect of Hinduism, a community which gives equal importance to the Hindu gods Shiva and Vishnu.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 19 He was a native of Kisukadu Nadu, another name for ancient Karnataka, and was a resident of the Sayyadi Brahmin school of higher learning (agrahara). History of Panchatantra literature Although the original text of the Panchatantra is lost, it was evidently an independent work written in Sanskrit around 300 CE (give or take a century or two).Olivelle 1997, p xii-xiii. Within the text its putative author is often given as Vishnu Sharma, but there is no evidence indicating this to be a real person, as opposed to a fictional story-telling figure.Olivelle 1997, p xii.

Durgasimha's version states that Pushpadatta, a chief attendant of the Hindu god Shiva overheard Shiva telling his consort Parvati a great story. This story was later reproduced as Brihatkatha in Paishachi by Gunadhya, a reincarnation of Pushpadatta, and a court poet of king Shalivahana. He further states that the Sanskrit version by Vasubhaga Datta (who replaces Vishnu Sharma as the putative author in several of the \\"Southern\\" versions) was a selection of \\"five stories\\" from the Paishachi original, and hence the name Panchatantra (\\"The five stratagems\\").

Biography=Before the 1918 Revolution= L√°szl√≥ Rudas was born in S√°rv√°r in to a Protestant family, Hungary on 21 February 1885. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (SDP) in 1903 as a university student and identified with the revolutionary socialist left wing of the party. From 1905 he was on the staff of N√©pszava (People's Voice), the official organ of the Hungarian SDP. Following the October 1918 Hungarian Revolution, Rudas consistently stood on the left wing of the Hungarian SDP, voting with a minority of the Central Committee to condemn the Hungarian majority socialists for participation in the independent Hungarian government of Mih√°ly K√°rolyi.Rudolf L. T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967; p. 89 Whereas the majority socialists sought an independent Hungary within the framework of a monarchy, the left wing sought insurrection leading to establishment of a workers' republic of the Bolshevik type, as was currently being established in Soviet Russia.T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 89. On November 17, 1918, Rudas and his co-thinker, J√°nos Hirrosik, called a secret meeting of 50 left wing members of the SDP. Rudas denounced the compromises made by the leadership of his party and called for the immediate formation of a new radical political organization, an idea which was not immediately supported by a majority of the session's participants.Bennett Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1979; p. 26. However, a week later, on November 24, members of the SDP met in a private apartment in Buda and acceded to B√©la Kun's demand for the establishment of the Communist Party of Hungary.Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r, p. 26. Rudas was a member from the Party's inception and was one of 18 original members on its first Central Committee. members.T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 95. He also served as editor- in-chief of the party's official newspaper, V√∂r√∂s Ujs√°g (\\"Red Gazette\\").Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; p. 406. Rudas was the first translator of V.I. Lenin's State and Revolution into Hungarian and also produced a number of other translations of Russian pamphlet literature.T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 140. Rudas was designated as the delegate of the Hungarian party to the founding congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in March 1919, but was unable to reach Moscow until a month after the gathering had concluded. Rudas stayed in Moscow for several months, attending meetings of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). He then left for Germany and Austria, where he took part in the highly factionalized politics of the exiled Hungarian Communist Party (CP).Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 406. During the Hungarian Revolution, Rudas stood with the far left of the revolutionary government, urging \\"strong and merciless\\" application of the proletarian dictatorship \\"until the world revolution spreads elsewhere in Europe.\\"T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 180. He was regarded by revolutionary leader B√©la Kun as an advisor on ideological matters, along with Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs.T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 205. =After the fall of the Hungarian Revolution= After the fall of the Hungarian revolutionary government, Rudas was among the 100,000 people who emigrated from the country, avoiding the fate of many ‚Äî some 5,000 executions were conducted and 75,000 imprisonments made of revolutionary participants by the right wing regime of Mikl√≥s Horthy.T√∂k√©s, B√©la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, p. 214. Rudas, ever the leftist, drew a radical conclusion from the fall of the Kun regime, declaring in 1920 that \\"the mistake lay not in unification [of various strata of the country behind the revolutionary government]. The mistake was in the communists' abandonment of the struggle to captivate the masses.\\"Cited in Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r, p. 66. In the extreme factional politics following the fall of the revolution, the hardline Rudas was an opponent of J√≥zsef Pog√°ny (John Pepper), regarded by the left wing as an opportunist; the moderate wing of the Communist Party regarded Rudas and his associates as dangerous revolutionary adventurers.Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r, p. 87. In March 1922 Rudas returned to Moscow to attend meetings of ECCI and its Presidium. He was co-opted into the Comintern apparatus, remaining to teach in Moscow at the Institute of Red Professors, later at the Comintern's Lenin School.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 406. During the 1930s, Rudas worked at the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow and contributed frequently to the theoretical journal Pod znamenem marksizma (\\"Under the Banner of Marxism\\").Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 406. He was arrested in 1938, during the last days of the Great Terror, but was subsequently released. He was arrested again in 1941 during the first panicky days of the German invasion but was released again, along with Luk√°cs, who had also been taken in the roundup.Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r, pp. 132-133. After the conclusion of the Second World War, Rudas returned to Hungary, where he became director of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of Hungary as well as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 407 He also served as a member of parliament from 1945 to 1950.

Family and Provenance Roger de Lacy was also known as Roger FitzJohn (son of John, constable of Chester)Some references show Roger de Lacy as Roger FitzEustace but this is not correct as he was not the son of Eustace, his father was, and FitzEustace did not become a surname. and during the time that he was hoping to inherit his grandmother's de Lisours lands as Roger de Lisours.Certainly Lisors near Lyons-la-For√™t, Normandy He was the son of John fitz Richard (son of Richard), Baron of Halton, Lord of Bowland, Lord of Flamborough and Constable of Chester. Roger became Baron of Pontefract on the death of his paternal grandmother Albreda de Lisours (-aft.1194) who had inherited the Barony in her own right as 1st-cousin and heir to Robert de Lacy (‚àí1193), Baron of Pontefract. In agreements with his grandmother Roger adopted the name of de Lacy, received the right to inherit the Barony of Pontefract and its lands, and the lands of Bowland, and Blackburnshire. He gave up all claims to his grandmother's de Lisours lands. He also gave his younger brother Robert le Constable the Flamborough lands that he had inherited from his father. He married Maud (or Matilda) de Clere (not of the de Clare family). Service to Kings Richard and John Roger's great-grandfather, Robert de Lacy, had failed to support King Henry I during his power struggle with his brother and the King had confiscated Pontefract Castle from the family earlier in the 12th century; Roger paid King Richard I 3,000 marks for the Honour of Pontefract, though the King retained possession of the castle itself. Roger accompanied his father and King Richard for the Third Crusade, succeeding to the title when his father died at the siege of Tyre. =Accession of King John= At the accession of King John of England, Roger was a person of great eminence, for we find him shortly after the coronation of that prince, deputed with the Sheriff of Northumberland, and other great men, to conduct William, King of Scotland, to Lincoln, where the English king had fixed to give him an interview. King John gave de Lacy Pontefract Castle in 1199, the year he ascended the throne. Military service=Siege of Acre= Roger was the Constable of Chester, and joined Richard the Lionheart for the Third Crusade. Roger assisted at the Siege of Acre, in 1192 and clearly earned the favour and the trust of King Richard as a soldier and loyal subject as judged by his subsequent service. =Ch√¢teau Gaillard= King Richard reconquered some castles along his Norman border from Philip II of France in 1196 and de Lacy was likely in his retinue. In 1203, de Lacy was the commander of the Ch√¢teau Gaillard in Normandy, when it was besieged and finally taken by Philip, marking the loss of mainland Normandy by the Plantagen√™ts. Under de Lacy's command the defence of the castle was lengthy, and it fell only after an eight-month siege on 8 March 1204. After the siege, de Lacy returned to England to begin work reinforcing Pontefract Castle. =Siege of Rothelan= In the time of this Roger, Ranulph, Earl of Chester, having entered Wales at the head of some forces, was compelled, by superior numbers, to shut himself up in the castle of Rothelan (Rhuddlan Castle), where, being closely besieged by the Welsh, he sent for aid to the Constable of Chester. Hugh Lupus, the 1st Earl of Chester, in his charter of foundation of the Abbey of St. Werberg, at Chester, had given a privilege to the frequenters of Chester fair, \\"That they should not be apprehended for theft, or any other offense during the time of the fair, unless the crime was committed therein.\\" This privilege made the fair, of course, the resort of thieves and vagabonds from all parts of the kingdom. Accordingly, the Constable, Roger de Lacy, forthwith marched to his relief, at the head of a concourse of people, then collected at the fair of Chester, consisting of minstrels, and loose characters of all description, forming altogether so numerous a body, that the besiegers, at their approach, mistaking them for soldiers, immediately raised the siege. For this timely service, the Earl of Chester conferred upon De Lacy and his heirs, the patronage of all the minstrels in those parts, which patronage the Constable transferred to his steward; and was enjoyed for many years afterwards.Burke, John, A general and heraldic dictionary of the peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland (1831) Pg 301 High Sheriff He was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for the years 1204 to 1209.

Brooks was also the author of several books, both fiction and non-fiction, the best known of which was an examination of the financial shenanigans of the 1960s Wall Street bull market. Early life John Nixon Brooks was born on December 5, 1920, in New York City, but grew up in Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Kent School in Kent, Connecticut in 1938 and Princeton University in 1942. After graduation Brooks joined the United States Army Air Forces, in which he served as a communications and radar officer from 1942 until 1945. He was aboard the First United States Army headquarters ship on D-Day during the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. After leaving the military, Brooks went to work for Time magazine, where he became a contributing editor. He worked at Time for only two years, pining for a chance to write at more length and in a looser style than that dictated by the newsweekly format. In 1949, Brooks got his break. That year he joined The New Yorker as a staff writer - a development he later called the lucky break that made his career. While working at The New Yorker, Brooks also began contributing book reviews to Harper's Magazine and The New York Times Book Review.Mitgang, Herbert. \\"John Brooks, Writer, Dies at 72; Specialized in Stories of Business\\", The New York Times, July 28, 1993. Accessed January 26, 2009. Brooks was the author of three novels, one - The Big Wheel, published in 1949 - describing a newsmagazine much like Time.Brooks based some of the fictional characters in his The Big Wheel on people he had known at the newsweekly. One character, he later told Times Henry A. Grunwald was based on him. He also published ten non-fiction books on business and finance, the subject in which he specialized for The New Yorker. Brooks's best-known books were Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street, 1920-1938, about the scandal surrounding Wall Street banker Richard Whitney; The Go-Go Years, on the speculative bubble of Wall Street in the 1960s; The Takeover Game about the merger mania of the 1980s.; and of special note, Business Adventures, which has been cited as Bill Gates' favorite business book.https://online.wsj.com/articles/bill-gatess-favorite-business- book-1405088228 The Go-Go Years earned Brooks the 1974 Gerald Loeb Award for Books. Career at The New Yorker Brooks also wrote scores of articles and profiles for The New Yorker, many profiling well-known business figures, and written in an informal and erudite style that turned the accounts of bankers and traders into the stuff of drama. Brooks's best-known New Yorker two-part Annals of Business article was about Henry Ford II and the ill-fated introduction of the most famous failed automotive gambit in history, the Edsel. Brooks also wrote widely on other subjects as well, including the government-guaranteed loans to Chrysler Corporation, the public television show Wall Street Week and its creator Louis Rukeyser, an examination of supply-side economics, the banking behemoth Citibank, economist Arthur Laffer and his Laffer curve, the development of New Jersey's Meadowlands, New York City urban planner Robert Moses, and even the Southern grocery store chain Piggly Wiggly.John Brooks, The New Yorker Brooks's writing on finance won him three Gerald Loeb Awards, and moved Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith to call Brooks's book The Go-Go Years \\"a small classic in the history of financial insanity\\".Staff. \\"The Best in Boardroom Intelligence\\", Directorship, September 1, 2008. Accessed January 26, 2009.John Brooks, Newsbios, The Business News Luminaries \\"He was not a breaker of big stories, or a shaper of important journalistic institutions\\", wrote journalist Joseph Nocera, now of The New York Times. \\"He was a wonderful writer, He was that rarest of birds, a gifted storyteller, with an enviable talent for summing up a character with a single, pithy anecdote or sentence.\\" Ford Motor Company's Edsel, subject of author John Brooks's best-known New Yorker profile Part of Brooks's appeal as a financial journalist was that he wrote for a general-interest publication, The New Yorker. Unlike journalists for more narrowly focused business publications, Brooks realized early on that it was storytelling - and not financial jargon - that would propel readers through his pieces.In spite of writing for a general-interest publication, Brooks did note some trends that would have longstanding consequences. On the newly introduced practice of copying by Xerox, for instance, John Brooks raised the issue of copyright questions in a 1967 profile of the copier maker. In his book Once in Golconda, Brooks devoted much of the book to fleshing out the character and peccadilloes of its protagonist, financier Richard Whitney, the aristocratic Morgan broker who headed the New York Stock Exchange, but ended up in Sing Sing Prison for his misdeeds.Once in Golconda fared poorly at bookstores when first released, which some attributed to the arcane title, which author Brooks is said to have insisted upon. Golconda was a city in India which, legend had it, enriched those who journeyed there. But the book ultimately did sell well in both hardcover and paperback, and remained in print for many years. \\"Mr. Brooks has convinced me, absolutely, that Richard Whitney ranks in the highest pantheon of American symbols - like Lincoln and Bryan and Melville and Hemingway and Yellow Kid Weil, Buffalo Bill, Horatio Alger, and even Babe Ruth,\\" wrote TK in Harper's magazine, \\"In him, the upper-class con crested - and America's last chance to do it right the first time ended.\\"Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street 1920-1938, John Brooks, Reissued by John Wiley and Sons, 1999 Brooks's tale of easy credit, inflated egos, financial greed and the end of an era - symbolized by broker Whitney - came to be seen as one of the best accounts of the conditions which led to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. \\"As Mr. Brooks tells this tale of dishonor, desperation, and the fall of the mighty, it takes on overtones of Greek tragedy, a king brought down by pride. Whitney's sordid history has been told before\\", said The Wall Street Journal in its review. \\"But in Mr. Brooks's hands, the drama becomes freshly shocking.\\" Brooks's account of the bull market of the 1960s in The Go-Go Years similarly delineated the personalities at the center of the action, like high- flying portfolio manager Gerald Tsai. In Brooks's retelling of the decade's events, Tsai and others correctly intuited that the ways of the Street were changing, and adjusted their trading strategies accordingly. Speculation was on the rise, Brooks noted, made easier by the new casino mentality. Writer Michael Lewis noted that Brooks's outrage at the new speculative excesses of the 1960s marked the end of an era. \\"The reader Brooks imagines himself to be speaking to is the same shockable character who has vanished from the financial world over the past thirty years\\", writes Lewis in his preface to a later edition of The Go-Go Years. \\"Who on Wall Street these days thinks twice about speculation? Who disapproves of such large corporate takeovers? No such person exists, or if he does he's living on some island so remote that no word of the market will ever reach him.\\"The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street's Bullish 60s, John Brooks, Reissued by John Wiley and Sons, 1999 As with previous market booms and busts, much of the new sober hindsight emerged from the rubble of the previous boom. Written during the recession of 1973, Time magazine's review has an eerily familiar ring. \\"But now that mutual funds are hemorrhaging cash and conglomerate has become a dirty word\\", opined Time reviewer George Church on October 29, 1973, \\"the story of the 1960s on Wall Street has the faraway quality of tales from 1929. As New Yorker writer John Brooks points out, the speculative excesses of the decade bore a haunting resemblance to those of the '20s, and they, too, led to a resounding market crash (in 1970) that wiped out fortunes and nearly destroyed Wall Street itself by threatening to bankrupt its biggest brokerage houses.\\"Hubris in the Street, George Church, TIME magazine, October 29, 1973 Brooks's subsequent work, The Takeover Game, limned the precincts of the greenmailers and junk bond pioneers of the 1980s. The book, noted Business Week's editor-in-chief Stephen B. Shepard in his New York Times review, managed \\"to be both scholarly and provocative.\\" With his facile explanations of complex financial terms and invigorating portraits of market speculators, The Takeover Game \\"argues that the investment banks, motivated by huge fees, are the driving force behind the current merger mania - usually to the detriment of the commonweal. It is little more than a speculative frenzy reminiscent of the 1920s, Mr. Brooks believes, built on high-risk debt euphemistically called leverage.\\" \\"Come the next recession,\\" Business Week editor Shepard wrote prophetically, \\"the debtors will default, throwing both the stock market and the economy into a tailspin.\\"Books and Business: Board- Room Buccaneers, Stephen B. Shepard, The New York Times, October 25, 1987 In a field known for bone-dry adjectives, writer Brooks lent his business writing a new panache. In describing Ford's Edsel, for instance, Brooks wrote in his best-known New Yorker essay that the newly engineered vehicle was \\"clumsy, powerful, dowdy, gauche, well-meaning - a deKooning woman.\\"\\"The Edsel Was An Important Debacle,\\" George Will, Jewish World Review In a field starved for vigorous writing, colorful characters and invigorating plot lines, Brooks's prose was seen by contemporary critics as a long-overdue tonic. But seen from today's vantage, many of Brooks's assumptions seem almost quaint, writes The New Yorker's current financial writer James Surowiecki. On reading Brooks's The Seven Fat Years several decades later, Brooks's account of the managing of General Motors's first-ever secondary offering in 1955, \\"the business world Brooks describes seems so oddly innocent, so unvoracious that he could just as well be talking about children playing Monopoly.\\"A Wee Bit Wistful About Wall Street, James Surowiecki, Slate, July 14, 1998 In his New Yorker portrait of public television's groundbreaking business host Louis Rukeyser, Brooks paid tribute to another gimlet-eyed observer of Wall Street's follies. \\"His airy and adroit handling of his big-shot guests is a pleasure to watch\\", wrote Brooks in his revealing portrait of Rukeyser, who had a \\"knack for providing entertainment unrivaled by any other television commentator on economic matters, past or present.\\"About Louis Rukeyser, rukeyser.com Ironically, some of Brooks's most telling observations were about his own employer: The New Yorker, a magazine which guarded its privacy so zealously that it did not publish its telephone number. Such quaint business practices were bound to endear it to writer Brooks, who called The New Yorker's business model \\"so bad it's good.\\"Newhouse: All the Glitter, Power & Glory of America's Richest Media Empire & the Secretive Man Behind it, Thomas Maier, Reprinted by Big Earth Publishing, 1997 When it came to the Ford Motor Company's hapless Edsel, Brooks revealed in his two-part series in The New Yorker that the Dearborn- based eponymous auto company had introduced the new model without much research.Ford Motor seemed to wing it in its introduction of the Edsel, Brooks implied in his profile. \\"Cars are the means to a sort of dream fulfillment,\\" Ford marketing research director David Wallace told The New Yorker journalist. \\"There's some irrational factor in people that makes them want one kind of car rather than another - something that has nothing to do with the mechanism at all but with the car's personality, as the customer imagines it. What we wanted to do, naturally, was give the E-Car the personality that would make the greatest number of people want it.\\" The only research done on the brand before its splashy introduction, Brooks noted, was simply on its name‚Äîwhich the Ford Executive Committee then proceeded to ignore.Hearing the Voice of the Market: Competitive Advantage Through Creative Use of Market Information, Vincent P. Barabba, Gerald Zaltman, Harvard Business Press, 1990 The naming of the brand, in Brooks's trademark trenchant style, carried echoes of the patent medicine salesmen of the nineteenth century. \\"Science was curtly discarded at the last minute and the Edsel was named for the father of the Company's president, like a nineteenth-century brand of cough drops or saddle soap. As for the design, it was arrived at without even a pretense of consulting the polls, and by the method that has been standard for years in the designing of automobiles - that of simply pooling the hunches of sundry company committees.\\" \\"Instead of spending millions on listening and learning about the market,\\" Brooks wrote of Ford's executives, \\"it spent millions on a campaign to launch the product it had developed in isolation. In this sense, the Edsel story is a classic of what so often goes wrong in a silo-based enterprise: Organization and ego got in the way of sound decision making.\\"What Sticks: Why Most Advertising Fails and how to Guarantee Yours Succeeds, By Rex Briggs, Greg Stuart, Kaplan Publishing, 2006 Sing Sing Prison old cell block housed Richard Whitney, former President of New York Stock Exchange, profiled in author John Brooks's Once in Golconda Such words today seem commonplace, but when Brooks was writing it was commonplace for financial writers to simply pull corporate press releases off the wires and massage them gently into 'journalism.' Among the first of a new breed of financial journalist, unafraid to lift the manhole covers to peer underneath, Brooks's copy was, at the time, revolutionary. In his portrait of portfolio manager Gerry Tsai, for instance, Brooks described the go-go operator as \\"so swift and nimble in getting into and out of specific stocks that his relations with them, far from resembling a marriage or even a companionate marriage, were often more like that of a roue with a chorus line.\\" Brooks did not limit his writing to business topics. In a 1983 book review in The New York Times, Brooks wrote that author David Burnham, in his The Rise of the Computer State, noted that the \\"apocalyptic vision\\" painted by writer Burnham was nearly at hand. The rise of the state's technological prowess was such, wrote Brooks, that \\"it is because one feels powerless against the advance of the national electronic eye and ear.\\"Books of the Times, The New York Times, June 6, 1983 In his interviews of his subjects, and in his writing, Brooks sometimes dropped in passages from Virginia Woolf, or alluded to paintings by Marcel Duchamp or theater reviews by English critic Kenneth Tynan. In 1950, the former newsweekly writer and aspiring novelist Brooks reviewed Jack Kerouac's The Town and the City in The New York Times.Kerouac: The Definitive Biography, By Paul Maher, David Amram, Published by Rowman & Littlefield, 2004 Brooks subsequently reviewed The Deer Park, the new novel by writer Norman Mailer that was rejected for publication by Mailer's original publisher for obscenity.Mailer: A Biography, Hilary Mills, Published by Empire Books, 1982 Thanks to his wide-ranging style and eclectic mind, Brooks emerged as \\"the only writer of business books and articles with a large and assured readership of nonprofessionals.\\"Inside Wall Street, Robert Sobel, Published by Beard Books, 2000, Part of Brooks's appeal to the readers of The New Yorker, accustomed to prose by the likes of John Updike, may have been his singular voice and contrarian nature. Writing about the paucity of women on Wall Street, for instance, Brooks noted the dining policies of the Street's stuffier precincts barred women from dining there, and \\"even more astonishing... was the fact that many of the public restaurants in the area did not take advantage of the situation by encouraging women, but rather fell in line with the clubs by banning them.... Without a reservation or a long wait, a woman could scarcely get a decent lunch anywhere in the area at any price.\\"Bull!: A History of the Boom and Bust, 1982-2004, By Maggie Mahar, HarperCollins, 2004 Professional organizations and later years Brooks also used his knowledge of business and finance to help other authors. He served as president of the Authors Guild for four years, from 1975 until 1979, and along with fellow New Yorker writer John Hersey was instrumental in creating a recommended book contract for authors. Brooks also served as vice president of PEN for four years, a vice president of the Society of American Historians and a trustee of the New York Public Library from 1978 until 1993. Brooks was married for the last 10 years of his life to the former Barbara Mahoney. He was previously married to the former Rae Everitt, with whom he had two children. He died in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, on July 27, 1993, of complications from a stroke.

It came into effect on October 6, 1980, replacing it constitution enacted in 1966 upon its independence from the United Kingdom. The current Constitution of Guyana contains 12 chapters that are further divided into 232 articles.http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Guyana/guyana96.html It also contains a preamble and an oath. Since its 1980 enactment, it has gone through multiple amendments. Pre-independence constitutions Guyana's complex constitutional history provides a useful means of understanding the conflict between local interests and those of Britain, the long-time colonial power. The colony's first governing document, the Concept Plan of Redress, was promulgated under Dutch rule in 1792 and remained in effect with modifications under British administration until 1928. Although revised considerably over the years, the Concept Plan of Redress provided for a governor appointed by the colonial power and for a Court of Policy that evolved into the colony's legislature. Reforms throughout the 19th century gradually broadened the electoral franchise and lessened the power of the planters in the colonial government. As a result of financial difficulties in the 1920s, as well as conflict between the established sugar planters and new rice and bauxite producers, the British government promulgated a new constitution making British Guiana a crown colony. The Court of Policy was replaced by a Legislative Council with thirty members (sixteen appointed and fourteen elected), and executive power was placed in the hands of a governor appointed by officials in London. Modifications throughout the 1930s and 1940s made the majority of members of the Legislative Council subject to popular election and further broadened the franchise. The formation of British Guiana's first major political party in 1950 and growing pressure for independence again forced the British to overhaul the political framework. A royal commission proposed a new constitution that would provide for a bicameral legislature consisting of a lower House of Assembly and an upper State Council, a governor appointed by the British, and seven ministers appointed by the House of Assembly. This constitution was put into effect in early 1953. The success of self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist Cheddi Jagan and his leftist People's Progressive Party (PPP) in the April 1953 elections frightened the colonial authorities. After the new legislature passed a controversial labor bill and pressed for independence, the British suspended the constitution in October 1953 and put in place an interim government whose members were chosen entirely by British authorities. New elections were held in 1957 to choose a majority of members in the new Legislative Council; the rest of the members were chosen by the governor. During its four-year tenure, this government set up a committee to make recommendations on yet another constitution. The committee proposed that a new government be formed with full internal autonomy. Only defense and external affairs would be managed by the British. In 1961 the new constitution went into effect. A bicameral Legislature was established with a thirty-five-member Legislative Assembly, consisted entirely of elected officials; and the upper house, the thirteen-member Senate, consisted entirely of appointees. The prime minister, who was chosen by the party with a majority of votes in the Legislative Assembly, held the most powerful executive post. Assisting the prime minister were various other ministers. The governor remained the titular head of state. The PPP won the elections of August 1961, and Jagan was named prime minister. Labor strife and civil disturbances were widespread in 1962 and 1963. In an effort to quell the unrest, the British colonial secretary declared a state of emergency and proposed modifying the constitution to provide for a unicameral fifty-three-member House of Assembly and proportional representation. The proposal was adopted, and elections were set for 1964. The elections brought to power a new coalition government headed by the PNC. However, the PPP administration refused to step down. Not until a constitutional amendment was enacted empowering the governor to dismiss the House of Assembly was the old government removed from power. Independence constitution Independent Guyana's first constitution, a modified version of the 1961 constitution, took effect on the first day of independence, May 26, 1966. It reaffirmed the principle that Guyana was a democratic state founded on the rule of law. The titular head of the country was the British monarch, represented in Guyana by the governor general, who served in a largely ceremonial capacity. Real executive power rested in the prime minister, appointed by the majority party in the renamed National Assembly, and his ministers. The first post-independence elections in 1968 confirmed the dominant role of the PNC and its leader, Forbes Burnham. On February 23, 1970, the Burnham government proclaimed the Cooperative Republic of Guyana. This move had both economic and political ramifications. The government argued that the country's many resources had been controlled by foreign capitalists and that organizing the population into cooperatives would provide the best path to development. The 1970 proclamation severed Guyana's last significant constitutional tie to Britain. The governor general, heretofore the ceremonial head of state, was replaced by a president, also a ceremonial figure. Arthur Chung, a Chinese-Guyanese, was the country's first president. Although its ties to the British monarch were broken, Guyana remained within the Commonwealth of Nations. Membership in the Commonwealth allowed Guyana to reap the benefits of access to markets in Britain and to retain some of the defense arrangements that Britain offered its former colonies. In particular, the British defense umbrella was seen as a deterrent to Venezuelan claims on Guyanese territory. In 1978 a constitutional referendum was held. The proposed change to Article 73 of the constitution would abolish the need for referendums to change the entrenched provisions of the constitution (including presidential powers, the dissolution of Parliament and the electoral system) and instead allow them to be changed by a two-thirds majority in parliament (which the PNC had at the time).Rigged referendum Guyana Journal, April 2006 It would also result in the postponement of the elections scheduled for later in the year, and instead the parliament elected in 1973 would be declared a Constituent Assembly.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p356 The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 10 April, with the referendum held three months later. The changes were reportedly approved by 97% of voters with a turnout of 70%,Guyana, 10 July 1978: Constitutional amendments of the Parliament Direct Democracy although the figures were subject to fraud by the government.Nohlen, p365 The opposition claimed that turnout was only between 10% and 14%. Constitution of 1980 As Burnham consolidated his control over Guyanese politics throughout the 1970s, he began to push for changes in the constitution that would muffle opposition. He and his colleagues argued that the changes were necessary to govern in the best interest of the people, free of opposition interference. By the late 1970s, the government and the legislature were PNC- dominated, and the party had declared its hegemony over the civil service, the military, the judiciary, the economic sector, and all other segments of Guyanese society. Burnham called the 1966 constitution inadequate and the product of British conservatism. Nationalization of private enterprise was to be the first step in revamping a system that Burnham felt had been designed to protect private property at the expense of the masses. Two of the principal architects of the new constitution were the minister of justice and attorney general, Mohammed Shahabbuddeen, and Hugh Desmond Hoyte, the minister of economic planning. Attorney General Shahabbuddeen was given the task of selling the new constitution to the National Assembly and the people. He decried the 1966 constitution as a capitalist document that supported a national economy based on exports and the laws of supply and demand. He argued that the constitution safeguarded the acquisitions of the rich and privileged and did not significantly advance the role of the people in the political process. The constitution of 1980, promulgated in October of that year, reaffirmed Guyana's status as a cooperative republic within the Commonwealth. It defines a cooperative republic as having the following attributes: political and economic independence, state ownership of the means of production, a citizenry organized into groups such as cooperatives and trade unions, and an economy run on the basis of national economic planning. The constitution states that the country is a democratic and secular state in transition from capitalism to socialism and that the constitution is the highest law in the country, with precedence over all other laws. The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, speech, association, and movement, and prohibits discrimination. It also grants every Guyanese citizen the right to work, to obtain a free education and free medical care, and to own personal property; it also guarantees equal pay for women. However, freedom of expression and other political rights are limited by national interests and the state's duty to ensure fairness in the dissemination of information to the public. Power is distributed among five \\"Supreme Organs of Democratic Power\\": the executive president, the cabinet, the National Assembly, the National Congress of Local Democratic Organs, and the Supreme Congress of the People, a special deliberative body consisting of the National Assembly in joint session with the National Congress of Local Democratic Organs. Of these five divisions of government, the executive president in practice has almost unlimited powers. The important constitutional changes brought about by the 1980 document were mostly political: the concentration of power in the position of executive president and the creation of local party organizations to ensure Burnham's control over the PNC and, in turn, the party's control over the people. The constitution's economic goals were more posture than substance. The call for nationalization of major industries with just compensation was a moot point, given that 80 percent of the economy was already in the government's hands by 1976. The remaining 20 percent was owned by Guyanese entrepreneurs.

Breese's cousin Osmond Williams was also Liberal MP for Merioneth from 1900‚Äì1910. Breese served in the Volunteers and during the First World War, he fought in the European theatre, reaching the rank of Major. Like his father, he was deeply interested in antiquarianism, archaeology and heraldry. He was chairman of the executive committee of the Cambrian Archaeological Association and was one of its vice-presidents in 1930.National Library of Wales: Welsh Biography Online Politics=Liberal politics= Breese was drawn into Liberal politics through his strong family association with Liberalism in North Wales. In addition to the Williams connection, there was Breese's father's involvement in Merioneth and South Caernarvonshire.Emyr Price, David Lloyd George; University of Wales Press, 2006 pp6-7 Breese served on the Caernarvonshire County Council and was made an Alderman of the county.

Caernarvonshire was a new constituency being made up from the merger between two pre-war seats Arfon and Eifion. The former MP for Eifion, Ellis William Davies was a supporter of H H Asquith and strongly opposed to Lloyd George. He tried to manoeuvre his succession to the new Caernarvonshire seat by quickly setting up a combined Arfon and Eifion Liberal Association and packing it with his own supporters to secure the nomination. Many of the local Liberal Clubs refused to acknowledge Ellis' nomination by this route however and chose their own delegates who convened a new adoption process. The three candidates for the nomination were Breese, Ellis Davies and R. T. Jones, the general secretary of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union who was actually the Labour candidate. Breese won the contest and went on to face both men in the general election itself, Jones standing as an Independent Labour candidate and Ellis Davies as a Liberal but in support of the Asquithian party.Kinnear, The Fall of Lloyd George pp193-194 Breese no doubt received the Coalition Coupon as he stood as a Coalition Liberal and he faced no Conservative Party opposition.

Development Design of the Speedster started in 1933 as sales of the Rearwin Ken-Royce and Junior began to flag in response to the Great Depression. While the previous aircraft had been built by \\"Rearwin Airplanes,\\" a joint venture between Rae Rearwin and an investor, the Speedster was built by Rearwin's newly-formed company \\"Rearwin Aircraft.\\" Rearwin had negotiated the use of Rearwin Airplane's equipment and property from his investor since it was being underutilized during the Great Depression. The initial design work proceeded smoothly, with first flight of the prototype occurring on July 11,1934. However, efforts to certify the design were unsuccessful as it could not meet the Civil Aeronautics Authority's spin recovery rules (later relaxed). Multiple engineers were hired and passed through Rearwin as the company attempted to improve the aircraft's spin recovery. Work was suspended between 1934 and 1937. By the time it was resumed in 1938, the ACE Cirrus engine that had powered the two prototypes was out of production, and Speedsters produced in series had Menasco C-4 engines. Rearwin had developed and begun selling the Rearwin Sportster and would also develop and sell the Rearwin Cloudster once the Speedster finally entered production. Design The Speedster was intended as a good-performing, two-seat, high-wing monoplane with an enclosed cabin. As such, it was designed around the ACE Cirrus, an inverted, 4-cylinder inline engine that was tightly faired into the body of the airplane. To maintain a small frontal area, the cabin accommodations were cramped. Passenger and pilot were seated in tandem. After the Cirrus engine went out of production, the Menasco C-4 was substituted. To address the issues with spin recovery, the flight controls were given improved bearings and rudder- centering springs. The tail surface was enlarged and redesigned, becoming a distinctive feature of the model. The gaps between the ailerons and the wings were also redesigned to better maintain airflow.

Kennedy International Airport, over Carmel, New York, United States. TWA Flight 42 made an emergency landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport, while Eastern Air Lines Flight 853 was forced to make a crash landing on Hunt Mountain in North Salem, New York. Three passengers died, plus the Constellation's pilot, Captain Charles J. White, who had returned to the aircraft's cabin to help the last passenger. Accident The TWA Boeing 707 and the Eastern Air Lines Constellation approached the Carmel VORTAC at the same time. As the Constellation emerged from a cloud puff, First Officer Roger I. Holt Jr. saw the Boeing in his right side window at the 2 o'clock position. The aircraft appeared to be converging rapidly at the same altitude. Holt shouted, \\"Look out,\\" placed his hands on the control wheel, and made a rapid application of up elevator simultaneously with Captain White, causing crew members and passengers to be forced down into their seats. =TWA Flight 42= Aboard the Boeing, the crew was preparing for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude- hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on what appeared to be a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.C. S. Murphy, R. T. Murphy, G. J. Minetti, W. Gillilland, and J. G. Adams for the Civil Aeronautics Board. ' (1966) The Boeing crew recovered from the dive, declared an emergency with New York Center, and received the first of many vectors to JFK International. They performed a damage assessment and asked that crash and fire equipment stand by. The Boeing was vectored south of JFK International where it made a wide 360 degree turn to check that the landing gear was fully down and to determine how the airplane would fly at approach speeds, and made a safe landing on Runway 31L at 1640. =Eastern Air Lines Flight 853= Following the collision, the Eastern Air Lines Constellation continued to climb. The crew felt the aircraft shudder and begin a left-turning dive back into the clouds. There was no response from the controls or trim tabs, but the crew discovered that a degree of control was available by adjusting the throttles. The aircraft descended through solid clouds and a recovery was made below the clouds using throttles only. Several zooms were then made back into the clouds as the pilots attempted to gain control of their aircraft. The pilots discovered a throttle setting that would maintain a descent in level attitude, with airspeed maintained between 125 and 140 knots; the nose rose when power was increased and fell when power was decreased. Their rate of descent could be maintained at approximately 500 feet per minute. It was obvious to the pilots that the Constellation was badly damaged and that they needed to make an emergency landing. However, they were over mainly wooded terrain on the Connecticut-New York border, and the few fields were surrounded by stone walls, sited on sloping terrain, and not large enough. Captain White advised the passengers that there had been a collision, that the aircraft was out of control, and that a crash landing would be made. The aircraft descended on a southwest heading over Danbury Municipal Airport, Connecticut at an altitude of 2,000 feet. Around two miles ahead, White spotted a pasture halfway up Hunt Mountain, a 900 ft ridge running perpendicular to the Constellation's flightpath. He aligned the aircraft using asymmetric thrust, told passengers to brace themselves, and descended into the upward-sloping hillside with wheels and flaps retracted. At the last moment he jammed the throttles forward to pitch up the aircraft's nose, letting the Constellation pancake into the 15-percent slope. The crash-landing site was 4.2 miles north of an area where numerous parts from both aircraft were later found by investigators. The first impact was on a tree that was found broken 46 feet above the ground. 250 feet farther on, the left wing contacted another tree, and was separated from the aircraft. The fuselage contacted the ground at the same point, and the aircraft came to rest on the slope. The fuselage had been broken into three pieces, and all the engines had been separated from their nacelles. The cockpit and cabin crews survived the crash landing and worked both inside and outside the broken fuselage parts to evacuate the survivors from the wreckage, which was on fire. Volunteer firemen from North Salem, Ridgefield, Connecticut, and nearby communities extinguished the fire and transported the survivors to hospitals at Danbury, Connecticut; Mount Kisco, New York; and Carmel, New York, where two passengers later died of their injuries. Firefighters later discovered two bodies in the fuselage - that of a passenger in the forward section, and that of Captain White, who had returned to the cabin to help the passenger. Both had died from smoke inhalation. = Notable passengers = * Warren P. Mason and his second wife were aboard the Constellation when it crashed.

Investigation=Conclusions= Misjudgment of altitude separation by the crew of EA 853 because of an optical illusion created by the up-slope effect of cloud tops resulted in an evasive maneuver and a reactive evasive maneuver by the TWA 42 crew.

Jackson's theorem cannot be applied to closed networks because the queue length at a node in the closed network is limited by the population of the network. The Gordon-Newell theorem calculates the open network solution and then eliminates the infeasible states by renormalizing the probabilities. Calculation of the normalizing constant makes the treatment more awkward as the whole state space must be enumerated. Buzen's algorithm or mean value analysis can be used to calculate the normalizing constant more efficiently. Definition of a Gordon‚ÄìNewell network A network of m interconnected queues is known as a Gordon‚ÄìNewell network or closed Jackson network if it meets the following conditions: # the network is closed (no customers can enter or leave the network), # all service times are exponentially distributed and the service discipline at all queues is FCFS, # a customer completing service at queue i will move to queue j with probability P_{ij}, with the P_{ij} such that sum_{j =1}^m P_{ij} = 1, # the utilization of all of the queues is less than one. Theorem In a closed Gordon-Newell network of m queues, with a total population of K individuals, write scriptstyle{(k_1,k_2,ldots,k_m)} (where ki is the length of queue i) for the state of the network and S(K, m) for the state space :S(K,m) = left{ mathbf{k} in mathbb{N}^m text{ such that } sum_{i=1}^m k_i = K right}.

A chartered school bus transporting 52 passengers on an elevated offramp left the roadway, landing on its roof. Of the 52 passengers (not including the driver), 28 students and an adult adviser were killed in the crash. As of 2019, the incident remains the second-worst bus disaster in U.S. history and the deadliest to involve a school bus (in any usage). It also remains the deadliest highway disaster ever investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) since its creation. Incident On May 21, 1976, Yuba City High School chartered a school bus from Student Transportation Lines, Inc. to transport its a cappella choir from Yuba City to Miramonte High School in Orinda for a friendship day involving the choirs of the two schools. The company supplied a Crown bus, dating from 1950. The accident occurred at 10:55 a.m., as the driver took the Marina Vista (exit 56) off-ramp from I-680 southbound from the Benicia‚ÄìMartinez Bridge. The driver was unfamiliar with this bus, and mistook the low air pressure warning (for the air brakes) was a warning of low engine oil pressure. Intending to stop for oil, the driver left the freeway at the aforementioned off ramp; the air brake system failed due to lack of air pressure. With no braking capability, the bus struck the mounted bridge rail and left the elevated roadway. After falling 21.6 feet, the bus landed on its roof, crushing it to the base of the window line. Out of 52 passengers on board, twenty-eight students and an adult adviser were killed. All of the surviving passengers were injured, most critically. The driver survived the crash but was seriously hurt. Investigation The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, which it attributed to the unfamiliarity and inexperience with the driver with the design of the 26 year-old bus and his confusion of oil pressure and air pressure warnings. Other cited factors included proper maintenance and inspection of the compressor drive belt (supplying air to the brakes). Several aspects of the road design were cited as contributing factors to the accident, including the (sharply-angled) curvature of the offramp itself, the signage of the offramp (to alert drivers of the curve), curb and railing systems (to properly contain and redirect vehicles). Memorials The Yuba City bus disaster was the second-worst bus disaster in U.S. history, exceeded only by the 1963 train-bus collision in Chualar, California which claimed the lives of 32 Mexican farmworkers. In May 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of the accident, a memorial built near the water at the Martinez Marina was dedicated to the victims. Bearing the names of those who died, it was constructed by firefighters who had responded to the accident and their friends and largely funded by them and donations they obtained. On the 35th anniversary of the accident in May 2011, Contra Costa County firefighters dedicated a monument in Yuba City. In 2015, the I-680 freeway off-ramp was replaced with one having a longer and flatter approach.

He graduated from Lynn Classical High School in 1974 and from Berklee College of Music in 1979. Brian can be seen performing at the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem Massachusetts on Thursday nights. Biography=Early days= Maes' music studies began at the age of eight when he began trumpet lessons with Louis Pascucci which lasted until the age of fourteen when he switched to playing baritone horn at the request of Lynn Public schools senior band director, Fancis Pagnotta. By the age of sixteen, Maes had decided to focus primarily on singing and playing the keyboard. Private instruction from North Shore organist, Marie Fairfield as well as piano studies from jazz pianist, Joe Carlton prepared Maes for his audition and acceptance to Berklee in 1975. While at Berklee, Maes studied classical piano under Emanuel Zambelli and scored an A- on his senior recital, performing an hour of memorized classical pieces and an hour of memorized original material. =Career= After graduation from Berklee, Maes began touring with Boston- based pop rock group American Teen as keyboardist and vocalist. In 1982 Maes auditioned with RCA recording artist, Robert Ellis Orrall, and was hired to tour in support of the release of the \\"Special Pain\\" album on RCA Records. In 1983 Maes travelled to Wales to play keyboards and sing backing vocals on the follow-up album, \\"Contain Yourself.\\" Maes was commissioned to return to the United Kingdom to work on other recording projects, acting as arranger, performer and conductor with Orrall bandmates, Charles (Kook) Lawry, David Stefanelli and Don Walden. In 1984, Maes began his long-standing relationship with Barry Goudreau when he successfully auditioned for the keyboardist/backing vocalist chair with Orion the Hunter. The band toured as the opening act for Aerosmith on the \\"Back in the Saddle\\" tour during the summer of 1984. After their first tour, Orion the Hunter disbanded. Maes and Goudreau made the decision to stay together and work on new material. In 1985, while still writing and recording with Barry Goudreau, Maes began collaborating with Peter Wolf, The J. Geils Band frontman, doing pre- production and arranging work in the recording studio for Wolf's solo record \\"Come As You Are\\". Maes, Lawry, Stefanelli and Waldon all worked together in the studio recording the songs that would later be on this record and all received credit on the label. This collaboration between Wolf and Maes began a long-standing personal and professional relationship that would bring them together on numerable musical endeavors. It was during this time that Maes presented Wolf with the song \\"Until Your Love Comes Back Around\\" for consideration but Wolf passed on the song. Brian and Peter would come together again in 1993 to tour the United States and Japan in support of Peter's Long Line album.

The hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission and provides behavioral health care treatment. This includes psychiatric and addiction services. From 2010-2018, Silver Hill Hospital hosted the annual Giving Hope Gala, a fundraiser to benefit the Patient Financial Aid Fund, which assists patients lacking funds to cover the costs for the hospital's long-term residential treatment programs. The gala was founded by Michael Cominotto and husband Dennis Basso. History Silver Hill Hospital was founded by John Millet in 1931 as Silver Hill Inn as a setting to help patients described as \\"nervous, depressed, anxious, or malingering.\\" It was located in the Silvermine River Valley of Fairfield County, straddling the borders of Wilton and New Canaan, Connecticut. Starting in 1971, focus was placed on building the hospital's substance abuse program. By 1984, that program included a psychiatrist, an associate psychiatrist, a psychologist, substance abuse counselors, nursing staff, and a recreational and occupational therapist. The inpatient acute care unit was built in 1985 to provide treatment to patients whose mental illness call for constant supervision. In 2012, The Chronic Pain and Recovery Center program launched. In 2015, both an eating disorder program for adults and an outpatient opioid addiction program launched. Facilities The hospital's 42-acre campus includes former family homes acquired by the hospital's board over time, allowing for longer term treatment and transitional living programs on the campus. The restoration of these homes generated several awards from a local historical preservation society. These include: * Scavetta House, which serves as a men's residential facility. * River House, a 1913 English Tudor style home that has served as a patient residence since the 1980s and now houses the Dialectical Behavior Therapy residential program, which helps patients diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder regulate feelings by charting emotions. * Klingenstein House, a 1920s guesthouse that now houses the Adolescent Transitional Living Program.

Origin  Milhais was a farmer, born on July 9, 1895, in the small village of Valongo de Milhais, a parish of Mur√ßa, in north of Portugal.  In the war  Badge, collar and star of the order On July 30, 1915, he was drafted into the Infantry of Bragan√ßa. In 1917, he was mobilized to join the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. He arrived in France in the same year, as a member of the Tr√°s os Montes brigade from the 2nd Infantry Division of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. The 2nd Infantry Division was deployed to the front line. The participation of Portugal in World War I took place mostly in Flanders, Belgium. Portuguese soldiers volunteered to infiltrate enemy lines and raid trenches, even though the casualties on both sides for raids were extremely high. Three German divisions had been rotated in the sector facing the 2nd Division in the last nine months before April 1918. The division saw no major battles, but suffered many casualties and extreme fatigue among the front-line soldiers from consecutive night raids. With unfortunate bad timing for the Portuguese, they were to have been rotated out of the line on the same morning that the Germans attacked. On April 9, 1918,‚ÄúThe Soldado Million ‚Äì A Hero For Torre and Sword‚Äù Milhais took part in the battle known in Portugal as \\"The Battle of La Lys\\" ‚Äì the first day of Ludendorff's Lys Offensive, otherwise known as \\"Operation Georgette\\", and as the \\"Battle of Estaires\\" in official British history.Rodrigues, Hugo ‚ÄúFrance at War ‚Äì Portugal in the Great War‚Äù He found himself in the midst of the battle, in the field of Isberg, covering the withdrawal of Portuguese and Scots soldiers. Within a few hours, 1,938 men had been killed, 5,198 wounded and about 7,000 taken prisoner. Milhais was in charge of a Lewis gun on April 9, 1918. During Operation Georgette, when the German Army attacked his division, Milhais laid down intensive fire against assaults by two German regiments, causing many German casualties. He managed to cover the retreat of Portuguese and Scots alike, despite coming under heavy attack himself. He fired in all directions and stayed at his post until he ran out of ammunition. Finally, the Germans decided to go around his position, and Milhais found himself alone in the rear of the enemy lines for three days. On the third day, Milhais, still carrying his Lewis gun, rescued a Scottish major from a swamp, and the two reached Allied lines. Milhais was warmly welcomed, but being a modest man he did not say anything about his experiences. However, the officer he had helped reported his actions to the British headquarters and several other testimonies also made his deeds known. A few months later, Milhais once again held back a German assault single-handed with his Lewis gun, allowing a Belgian unit to retreat safely to a secondary trench without casualties. Both the British observers present in the scene and the Belgian commander included his action in their reports. Milhais was awarded the highest Portuguese distinction - the Order of the Tower and Sword - and the French L√©gion d'Honneur, delivered on the battlefield before 15,000 Allied soldiers. On July 15, 1918, the Order of Service of the Battalion published a commendation, given by Major Ferreira do Amaral, which described his action as having been worth a million men, hence the nickname by which he became known: \\"Soldier Millions\\".‚ÄúMiles, Anibal Augusto‚Äù  After the war  Milhais in his hometown, shortly before his death On February 2, 1919, he returned to his homeland and married Teresa de Jesus and had nine children with her. Unfortunately, after the war ended, the Portuguese economy was near bankruptcy, and Milhais had difficulty providing for his family. The Portuguese government promised to help, but instead of an allowance, named the village where he was born after him. On July 8, 1924, the Parliament renamed the town of Valongo the Valongo de Milhais. The rather shy Milhais lived in the village of Valongo of Milhais, more famous than ever, but as poor as before. He received many decorations and much public praise, but the highly decorated soldier still could not provide for his family. In 1928, he emigrated to Brazil in an attempt to improve his financial standing. The Portuguese community in Brazil received him as a hero. When the Portuguese living there realized that Milhais was in need, the community gathered funds to send him back to Portugal with enough money to provide for his family. The Portuguese public thought it a national indignity and were angry that the military had done little for Milhais. On August 5, 1928, he returned to Portugal and to agriculture. He received a small pension, enough to live on as a national hero. He died on June 3, 1970, in the village named after him.

Concept Living Dead Dolls are ten inches tall, made of plastic, with fabric clothing, and come packed in coffin- shaped boxes with death certificates. Each doll has a different cause of death, which is usually described in doggerel verse on the certificate. While the dolls are occasionally inspired by real people such as Lizzie Borden, they are described explicitly as dolls, not representations of actual dead children, and are aimed at an adult audience aged upwards of 15 years. Origins The first Living Dead Dolls appeared for sale in the USA in 1998. They were originally craft dolls individually customised by either Ed Long or Damien Glonek and described as \\"handmades.\\" These original handmade dolls were sold exclusively through Glonek's mail order company Unearthly Possessions, as well as at horror conventions along the East Coast. At one of these conventions, Mike \\"Mez\\" Markowitz, the founder of Mezco Toyz noticed the dolls, and subsequently contacted Long and Glonek about manufacturing and distributing the dolls commercially. At the time of their introduction in 1998, the Living Dead Dolls tapped into the business trend for \\"witty repackaging of Gothic themes for a teen/twenty-something audience\\" that emerged after the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which had premiered the previous year. One commentator noted in 2006 that the Living Dead Dolls were unusual among Gothic themed products in that they fell outside the theme of clothing and music that typically defined merchandise aimed towards this market. In addition, the dolls were distinct in that they were generally not obviously connected to pre-existing popular culture such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings, although were often sold alongside merchandise for these franchises. Production history The first commercial series of Living Dead Dolls, Series 1, was released early in the United States in 2000, with a production run of 40,000 sets; and a second edition in Japan. Apart from the boy doll, Damien, the dolls were all based on original handmade designs, such as Eggzorcist, a doll wearing a bunny suit that had originally been made for Long's former girlfriend. From 2001, after the dolls went into production, it was possible to request custom handmades directly from the creators. These custom handmades originally cost $666 each, later increased to $800. In 2004, Long & Glonek announced on the Mezco message boards that they would no longer accept commissions or make handmades to order, but would instead occasionally offer handmade dolls on eBay to the highest bidder. Since their commercial launch by Mezco in 2000, variations have been produced such as miniature dolls, ragdolls and baby dolls, large 18-inch tall porcelain dolls and 13-inch tall fashion dolls called 'Fashion Victims.' A separate line called \\"Living Dead Dolls Presents\\" offers dolls based on contemporary and classic movie characters such as Annabelle and the Creature of the Black Lagoon. In addition to dolls, the brand has produced a wide range of spin-off merchandise including stationery sets, pencil sharpeners, and party lights. By 2017, the thirty-fourth series of the dolls had been produced. Since 2001, a wide range of exclusive special edition dolls have been manufactured too. One of the first of these sets was a 2001 bride and groom set called Died and Doom made as a Tower Records exclusive,http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/1911.shtml Accessed 23-2-2010 while others, such as the Blue Eggzorcist (2003), were only available from specific conventions.http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/3423.shtml Accessed 23-2-2010 Some dolls were only released in specific countries such as the 2003 UK exclusive Jack The Ripper, and others, like Abigail Crane & Mr. Graves, were exclusive only to members of Mezco's club.http://www.toymania.com/columns/spotlight/lddgraveabigail.shtml Accessed 23-2-2010 Critical response In 2002, the Greek government banned the dolls, releasing a statement which described them as a \\"serious threat to the smooth formation and development of the child's personality and mental health.\\" Two of the dolls singled out were Inferno, a bat-winged doll with fiery eyes, and Sybil, wearing a collar and chains. In response, the Irish government also looked into banning the dolls, with the Minister of State for Children, Brian Lenihan describing it as a question of \\"public morality.\\" The dolls were also \\"nearly banned\\" in Singapore.

On August 8, 2008, elements from 2nd platoon, Golf Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Marines, and 2nd Platoon, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company, conducted a deliberate clear of the village of Shewan. After approximately eight hours of heavy combat, the coalition marines defeated approximately 250-350 Taliban fighters. Planning The leaders in 2nd platoon and the reconnaissance unit attached to them had been planning the assault on Shewan for several weeks. It was delayed on 6 August, and approved on 7 August. The Marines departed in the early hours of the morning on 8 August in two different sections, the Recon Marines heading down Route 517, and 2nd Platoon around Saffarak Mountain. The battle Golf 2 circled around Saffarak Mountain and set up a blocking position from the North, while Recon traveled up Highway 517 directly into Shewan, and then dismounted and entered the city on foot. Golf 2 took a position to the north of the city with the 81 mm mortar team to provide support for Recon, and served as a quick reaction force (QRF). Golf 2 was receiving reports from the ANP that there was movement to their north, and many policemen began firing nervously into the trees in front of them. 1st Recon began taking heavy small arms and RPG fire on the outskirts of Shewan from fortified trench lines and bunkers around the city. Their vehicles were targeted by a volley of RPGs, and a Humvee was disabled and caught fire. The crew suffered minor shrapnel wounds and the other Marines returned fire and went to assist the injured, removing them from the vehicle. 2nd Platoon got back into their trucks and traveled quickly through the countryside to aid Recon. Taking cover in trenches and in their vehicles, the Recon Marines took heavy machine gun and RPG fire. By this time, hundreds of Taliban soldiers were taking positions in buildings and behind trees. Over a period of five to ten minutes at least 15 RPGs were fired from the treeline as Recon awaited Golf 2's arrival. 2nd Platoon pulled out onto the 517 and headed east at high speed, with smoke from the burning Humvee visible. The coalition convoy pulled off the road on line and sped towards the berm that ran parallel to the city, firing their crew-served weapons at the Taliban positions. At this time, the Taliban soldiers began firing 82mm mortar rounds at the coalition marines as they approached the city. The marines halted behind the berm and dismounted, continuing to return fire into the city. The 2nd Platoon then attacked the Taliban positions and engaged in trench clearing and close combat. Despite the pressure on the Taliban positions, the Taliban RPG and machine gun fire intensified. It was estimated that by the end of the fight, over a hundred RPGs had been fired at the Marines. By this time the attached coalition 81 mm mortar crew began firing volleys into the trenchlines from targets called in by their Forward Observer. The mortars suppressed the Taliban fire until air support came on station. F-18s strafed the Taliban positions with their cannons, and then dropped a series of 2000 lb bombs. Despite numerous airstrikes, the Taliban continued to fight, utilizing their fortified positions to shield them from the airstrikes. They continued to fire mortar and RPG at the marines. Three more airstrikes were dropped into the city, but the Taliban continued to fight. Several hours into the fight, convoys of vehicles carrying an estimated 100 Taliban reinforcements with weapons and supplies arrived in the city. The Marines attacked the vehicles and their occupants, and another volley of mortars and airstrikes were fired. The Taliban were sustaining heavy casualties, and began to retreat into the buildings to hide from the coalition fire. More air attacks were fired on the buildings, though the Taliban fire was beginning to slow down, and the Marines were now only receiving sporadic mortar fire. The coalition spotted a Taliban mortar team operating in the mountains, and an 81 mm mortar strike was called onto their position, killing them. The Marines fell back and set up a perimeter around the buildings, cutting off the Taliban completely, and continued to engage Taliban fighters with their crew served weapons. Another bombing run destroyed the damaged Humvee while Marines prepared to disengage. During the lull in the fighting, the remaining Taliban fighters attempted to retreat into the mountains, but 2nd Platoon killed them before they were able to reach the safety of the rocks. The battle was the longest of 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines deployment, lasting over 16 hours. No Marines were killed, and an estimated 150 Taliban soldiers were killed.

The action formed part of the blockade of the French Biscay ports during the war by the British Royal Navy, a strategy designed to prevent ships from entering or leaving French harbours, thus eliminating foreign trade with France and damaging the French economy as well as cutting France off from her overseas colonies. The French ship in the action, Th√©tis, was destined for the French held West Indian island of Martinique with a cargo of flour and military supplies, including over 100 soldiers to reinforce the island's garrison. Th√©tis had not even cleared the French coast when she was discovered by a patrolling British frigate of the inshore squadron, a unit tasked with watching the entrance to the French Biscay ports, principally Brest, and intercepting any ships seeking to enter or leave the harbours. This frigate, HMS Amethyst chased Th√©tis and brought her to battle, closing with the French ship but preventing the soldiers aboard Th√©tis from boarding the British ship and using their superior numbers to overwhelm her with heavy and accurate gunfire. The battle lasted more than six hours and the French suffered over 130 men killed, including the captain and many of the soldiers aboard, before the crew of Amethyst was able to storm and capture Th√©tis. Within minutes two additional British vessels arrived, attracted by the sound of gunfire, and helped secure the badly damaged Th√©tis for the journey to Britain. The battle was a blow for the French defenders of Martinique, who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages of military and food supplies. Although another supply frigate broke through the blockade and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized over the next two years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Ni√©men, at the Action of 6 April 1809. Background By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars had lasted five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of mainland Europe, they were unable to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast.Gardiner, p. 17 Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron.Gardiner, p. 34 The efficiency of the British blockade was such that communication and reinforcement between France and her colonies was dangerous for the ships involved and so was severely limited. This led to shortages and disaffection among the French colonists, especially in the Caribbean, where they were surrounded by hostile British harbours and constantly raided and blockaded by British ships.Gardiner, p. 75 The island of Martinique was one of the more important French islands in the West Indies, but by late 1808 the island's economy had been crippled by the British blockade, and food stocks, military supplies and morale were all running low. In the summer a French dispatch vessel was intercepted by British warships, warning of the desperate state of the island's defences; similar messages that did reach France safely prompted an urgent response by the French Navy.James, p. 206 The frigate Th√©tis, stationed to the south of Brest at Lorient, was selected to carry supplies to Martinique and given a full complement of 330 men, 40 cannon and a new captain, Jacques Pinsum. Supplies were loaded, including over 1,000 barrels of flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Martinique. Secrecy was tight: to prevent the British discovering Th√©tis' mission, even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate's departure early on 10 November 1808.James, p. 81 The French efforts to hide the frigate's mission and departure were initially successful: the British ships in the area were unaware of Th√©tis's intentions before she sailed. They were however prepared for any French movement and were launching regular patrols, in particular two ships under the command of captains Michael Seymour and Frederick Lewis Maitland, HMS Amethyst and HMS Emerald respectively. Both captains were experienced and veteran officers: Seymour had lost an arm at the Glorious First of June 15 years earlier, and they had agreed to hunt together, communicating regularly and with an understanding that all prize money won would be shared equally across both crews. After several weeks sailing in tandem, the frigates separated in early November.Wareham, p. 184 Battle At 18:42 on 10 November 1808, the garrison of a French defensive gun battery on the island of Groix saw a frigate moving rapidly westwards. As they had not been informed of any French movements at that time, the battery fired two warning shots at the ship to establish her identity. The frigate, Th√©tis, replied with her recognition signal and the firing stopped, but the sound had attracted the attention of HMS Amethyst, then approaching Groix from the west. Within a few minutes, Seymour's lookouts had spotted the French frigate and Amethyst immediately gave chase. Pinsum followed his orders to avoid combat and made all sail south-west, intending to escape into the Atlantic. By 21:00, Amethyst was close enough to fire her bow-chasers, small guns positioned at the front of the ship, at the French frigate and was attacked in turn from the French stern chasers. Certain that his quarry was an enemy, Seymour launched signal rockets in the hope of attracting attention from other ships of the inshore squadron that might intercept the French ship, and he received answering flashes from the north-east as Captain Sir Thomas Hardy joined the chase in HMS Triumph.Clowes, p. 427 By 21:15, Pinsum realised that his heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply in front of the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Th√©tis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course.Woodman, p. 241 Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Th√©tis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another.Clowes, p. 428 Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.James, p. 82 French fire was taking its toll on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethyst's mizzenmast was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Th√©tis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Th√©tis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point- blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Th√©tis, which was set alight in three places due to the proximity of the British muzzle flashes. Aftermath Amethyst continued firing on Th√©tis for the next 80 minutes, almost without reply, until 12:20, when the British were able to board and seize Th√©tis unopposed, the two frigates tangled together by their rigging. Seymour's most immediate problem was to secure his prize. Many of the unwounded prisoners were transferred to Amethyst under guard and at 01:05, the frigates were cut apart by severing the tangled rigging. Ten minutes later, the 74-gun appeared out of the darkness and at 01:30 a second frigate, under Captain Philip Broke, arrived, drawn by the gunfire.James, p. 83. Together, the three British ships removed the prisoners from Th√©tis and effected improvised repairs: Th√©tis had lost her remaining masts shortly after she had been boarded and Amethysts were in immediate danger of collapse. British casualties in the engagement were severe, with 19 killed and 51 wounded, but French losses were several times larger, with 135 dead, including Pinsum, and 102 wounded. In Britain, Seymour's victory was rewarded: Seymour himself was presented with a commemorative medal, ¬£100 (with ¬£625 to share among the wounded) and the freedoms of Cork and Limerick, although there were suggestions that he should receive a knighthood.Wareham, p. 186 In addition, first lieutenant Goddard Blennerhasset was promoted to commander, the junior officers were advanced and Th√©tis was purchased by the Royal Navy as HMS Brune, the crews of Emerald and Amethyst profiting from the prize money. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Amethyst had been severely damaged in the engagement and repairs took 71 days to complete at Plymouth. Five months later, Seymour and Maitland were specially selected to hunt the Ni√©men, en route to √éle de France, in the Bay of Biscay. Again, Emerald was absent when the frigate was brought to action and again Seymour was able to capture his opponent after a fierce encounter in the Action of 6 April 1809.James, p. 88 Although Seymour praised the bravery of Th√©tis' surviving French officer, Lieutenant Joseph Ded√©, Ded√© later swore in court that Th√©tis had not surrendered until after Triumph and Shannon arrived, a statement that contradicts not only British testimony, but also Ded√©'s own insistence on the night of the battle that he had not seen any other ships during the action.James, p. 85 Historian William James suggests that this was a deliberate attempt to appeal to the French naval authorities to avoid responsibility for the defeat.James, p. 84 The failure of the supplies and reinforcements carried on Th√©tis to reach the Caribbean may have had an effect on the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign.Woodman, p. 242 The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both √éle de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.Gardiner, p. 80  Notes  References   * Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Conflicts in 1808 Naval battles involving France Naval battles involving the United Kingdom Military history of the Bay of Biscay November 1808 events ","title":"Action of 10 November 1808"},{"id":"21257111","text":"Drosera humilis is a perennial tuberous species in the genus Drosera that is endemic to Western Australia.

However, there is something mysterious about Liz, the house, and the dragons. As for what it is, David can't figure out. Meanwhile, David is trying to help Lucy find a missing squirrel named Conker. Conker, unlike the other squirrels, does not leave after the tree he lived in was cut down, his eye is badly injured and the doctors try to rescue him, but unfortunately he dies. While he tries to unravel the dragon mysteries and save the squirrel, David writes a story for Lucy about Snigger (another squirrel), Conker and Lucy's other squirrel friends. However, the story begins to mirror real life. Whatever is going on, it has something to do with his special writing dragon Gadzooks, whom Liz made as a housewarming gift. But when Conker's life is threatened and Gadzooks appears to be in trouble, David is forced to believe the impossible if he is going to save them. Meanwhile, he finds himself drawn to an attractive wildlife rescuer. In Icefire, Lucy creates a new dragon named G'reth. He is a wishing dragon that can grant wishes that would benefit dragon kind. David becomes the owner of this dragon because he was the one who named him (with Gadzook's help). But fate seems to be dictating an unusual course for David when his college tutor, Dr. Bergstrom, sets him an essay on the existence ‚Äì or not ‚Äì of dragons. The tantalising prize is a fully funded research trip to the Arctic, which seems just within his grasp. David starts to research the subject and soon discovers a connection between dragons and the Arctic. Then, evidence begins to mount that somewhere in the neighbourhood is a polar bear. Beginning to wonder whether it is only a coincidence or could deeper forces be at work, David begins to uncover more about the dragons. He finds himself drawn to a time when dragons really did exist, and their secrets were guarded by the polar bears of the Arctic. David must open his mind to the legend of dragons if he is going to have any chance of winning the research trip. Meanwhile, the evil sibyl, Gwilanna, appears with an evil plot, and the secret of the dragons is revealed. If she is to be defeated, David must discover the link between an ancient legend about the fire tear of the last dragon, Gawain, and the frozen north. The keys to solving the puzzle are his new girlfriend, Zanna, and Dr. Bergstrom, who proves to have more mysteries than meets the eye. In Fire Star, Gwilanna, the evil sibyl that first starred in Icefire, returns. She plans to reincarnate the last dragon, Gawain, and use him to open a portal to the dragon dimension Ki:mera. If she succeeds, the concentrated fire of all those dragons will be released onto an unstable Arctic, already threatened by global warming and in no need of any more heat to push it over the brink. The wishing dragon G'reth is whisked to another dimension by mysterious forces and brought back with an entity that calls itself the Fain. Meanwhile, David and Zanna are on the trip they won to the Arctic, and David is writing another book, an epic book about dragons, polar bears, and a mysterious fire star. But when the book, like the one he wrote before, starts to mirror real life, and when Zanna is kidnapped and presumably killed by polar bears, the expedition is cut short. Back at home, he arrives to find Lucy has been kidnapped by Gwilanna for a ritual to raise the last dragon Gawain. Zanna is proved to be alive and learning the ways of the Inuit in a small village. Then, Gwillana's plans are revealed by a twist of fate that reunites Liz with her former husband Arthur, who is using a powerful relic of Gawain to affect the flow of time. In the dramatic climax, David, Zanna, Arthur, the Pennykettles and the clay dragons have to side with a polar bear army to stop Gwilanna, as well as a darker evil from the past of Ki:mera and Earth. There is however, a final twist, David is stabbed by one of the Ix controlled humans on the expedition with a shard of ice and supposedly 'dies.' In The Fire Eternal it has been five years since David, now a cult author, mysteriously disappeared in the Arctic. Life in Wayward Crescent has settled to relative normality. But as the weather grows wild and the ice caps melt, all eyes turn north, where bears and the souls of the Inuit dead are combining to produce a spectacular solution...a solution with its focus on David and Zanna's child, Alexa. By this time, Lucy has grown to about the age of 16, and meets a reporter named Tam Farrell who is doing an article on the author David who supposedly went missing in the arctic. At the end, David reveals that he, in fact, was not dead, but combined with the dragon, Gawain, and his fire tear. In Dark Fire David is ordered by the elder dragons of Ki:mera to seek out and destroy a spark of dark fire, even though doing so will mean sacrificing the beloved housework dragon, Gwillan. Also, David's first girlfriend, Sophie, died in Africa while David was there trying to stop a mutation called a darkling from destroying the entire facility. He uses Gwillan's and Grace's fire tears to attempt to revive the fallen clay dragons back to their original selves. As David struggles to reach a compromise, dragons all over the world begin to wake, and the Earth enters a new Dragon Age. But just as this is to happen, the dangerous Ix:cluster reverse the Fire Eternal during an epic battle between the dragon queen and our heroes, and the villainous Ix:cluster, and in a single moment, Gadzooks ends with writing the word 'sometimes' in dragontongue, the language of the dragons. In Fire World, a 12-year-old boy named David lives in Co:pern:ica. He and his friend Rosanna spend their days in the librarium, a museum for books, with the curator, Mr. Henry, and the mysterious firebirds that roam the upper levels. When the two friends accidentally injure one of the firebirds, they find themselves on a remarkable and dangerous adventure. The evil Ix have found a way into Co:pern:ica from their home planet and have taken over a firebird, turning it to the side of darkness. The firebirds have a secret, though: they know about dragons. With the help of David and Rosanna, the firebirds must reach across the universe to call on the dragons for protection. But will the dragons arrive before the Ix destroy everything? WARNING: Alternate timelines may occur. Read at your own risk. The entire series is resolved with a seventh novel named The Fire Ascending. The novel reveals that the entire universe is made up of the word and symbol Oomara, meaning sometimes. This last book shows Alexa's part in the series. It also shows how Alexa came to be.

A college student who lives with the Pennykettles. He is an author whose stories magically manage to come true and he gets his inspiration from his writing dragon, Gadzooks (see: Pennykettle dragons). In Fire Star, he made Gollygosh, a natural healing dragon. Another one of his dragons is G'reth, a wishing dragon made by Lucy Pennykettle. David turns out to be a \\"Fain\\", although at the start, he doesn't know that himself. He has the ability to transform into a polar bear, and has \\"illuminated\\" with the adolescent dragon, Grockle, Liz's completely-dragon child, whom his girlfriend Zanna quickened earlier on in the series. He has a daughter by Zanna named Alexa. In addition, David becomes a dragon when he extends his Fain into Grockle. Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Pennykettle ‚Äì A woman probably in her thirties who makes dragons out of clay and sells them at pottery fairs. She made all of the Pennykettle dragons except Golly and G'reth. According to Gwilanna, she happens to have more auma than most other daughters of Guinevere, which is actually because she has icefire. She is the mother of Lucy Pennykettle, wife of the blinded ex-monk Arthur, and landlady of David Rain. According to David, the Fain (the alien species) meant for Liz and Arthur to be his biological parents, but when Gwilanna interrupted this plan, David materialised at age 20 at the \\"necessary\\" time. Liz is pregnant with a boy at the end of \\"Dark Fire\\" by her husband, Arthur. Gwilanna originally says that the child will not have \\"dragon\\" in him, but after the boy manages to refrain from being affected by the dark fire Liz absorbed, her interest regarding the boy piques. Lucy Pennykettle ‚Äì Liz's eleven-year-old daughter. She is the youngest of Guinevere's (see: other characters) known line and the next \\"dragon princess\\". At the beginning of Icefire, she made an extremely effective wishing dragon called G'reth, which is surprising for a girl of her age, as proper wishing dragons are extremely hard to make. When David returns, she is sixteen. In \\"The Fire Eternal\\" she communicates several times with a journalist by the name of Tam, who she admits to being in love with in her journal in \\"Dark Fire.\\" She is the one to awaken the Dragon Queen Gawaine, the mother of Gawain. She likes Tam and her idol is David because he wrote Snigger and the Nutbeast for her twelfth birthday. Gwilanna/Aunty Gwyneth ‚Äì Lucy's \\"aunt\\". She is a very powerful sibyl who was once served by Gretel, the potions dragon. She kidnaps Lucy to help her raise Gawain, the dragon, from his state of paralysis so that she could be \\"illuminated\\" with it (become one with it) like she believed her mother, one of the pre:men, should have been able to do before the Fain executed her. She is frozen in a block of ice in the shape of a crow with her powers are stripped from her, though they are restored later on. She has been the midwife of all of Guinevere's line, as only a sibyl can do so. Liz Pennykettle has a great amount of respect for her, despite the fact that on numerous occasions the \\"aunt\\" has almost killed her, kidnapped her daughter, trapped her tenant under some floorboards, as well as a myriad of other feats of similar creed. This may be because Gwilanna birthed her daughter, and has also saved Liz's life on numerous accounts. Sophie Prentice' ‚Äì David's first girlfriend who dies in Dark Fire. Also tried to help them when Conker, one of Lucy's squirrels, was injured. Suzanna \\"Zanna\\" Martindale ‚Äì A character that first appears in Icefire and becomes David's girlfriend. She is a college student like David, as well as, in the beginning, a Goth. When Gretel stops serving Gwilanna, she becomes Zanna's dragon. Zanna is a sibyl like Gwilanna but she is not as powerful. She is at times very zany and amusing. She is also the mother of David's child, Alexa. She bears the mark of Oomara on her forearm, which grants her many abilities, one of which being the ability to transform into a raven. She lived with the Pennykettles for five years, but then was given a house by the deceased Henry Bacon (who conveniently resided next door), and both she and her daughter relocated there. Alexa Martindale ‚Äì David and Zanna's daughter. It is later revealed that she is to become an \\"angel\\". She can also draw the future. Because her father is a Fain and her mother a sibyl, she has quite a lot of power and is extremely intelligent. It is of Arthur's belief that before her birth into the human world, she acted as a muse to describe to Arthur who she wanted her father to be. When Arthur wrote about the man who was originally destined to be his son, the past \\"changed,\\" creating David so that Alexa could be born. Dr. Bergstrom ‚Äì A geography teacher at Scrubbley College. He is Scandinavian, can turn into a polar bear, and has a dragon called Groyne who can become invisible and shape-shift. He started out as a polar research scientist and met the spirit of Thoran, the first polar bear ever. People believed he was killed, but he actually became a mixture of man and polar bear. Henry Bacon ‚Äì The Pennykettles' neighbour that dies in Dark Fire from a stroke. In Icefire, he shows David the picture of his grandfather on an expedition to the Arctic. It shows his grandfather with several other people, one of whom David identifies as Dr. Bergstrom. Before his death, he often helped the Pennykettles and David. His sister is a sibyl. Tam Farrell ‚Äì A journalist who has the spirits of two bears, Avrel and Kailar, in his hands. He first appears in The Fire Eternal when he tries to get information about David. He later becomes a friend and rescues Lucy from the Ix. ReferencesExternal links *Official website.

By the spring of 1911, some prominent Mongolian nobles including Prince T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence from the Manchu-led Qing China. On November 30, 1911 the Mongols established the Temporary Government of Khalkha. On December 29, 1911 the Mongols declared their independence from the collapsing Qing Empire following the Xinhai Revolution. They installed as theocratic sovereign the 8th Bogd Gegeen, highest authority of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, who took the title Bogd Khaan or \\"Holy Ruler\\".Thomas E.

The first was the efforts of the Mongolians to form an independent, theocratic state that embraced Inner Mongolia, Barga (also known as Hulunbuir), Upper Mongolia, Western Mongolia and Tannu Uriankhai (\\"pan- Mongolia\\"). The second was the Russian Empire's determination to achieve the twin goals of establishing its own preeminence in the country but at the same time ensuring Mongolia's autonomy within the newly independent Chinese state.

Ulaanbaatar: Admon The official Chinese name was \\"Â§ßËíôÂè§Âúã\\" (D√† Mƒõngg«î Gu√≥, \\"Great Mongol State\\"). Mongolian Revolution of 1911 On February 2, 1913 the Bogd Khanate sent Mongolian cavalry forces to \\"liberate\\" Inner Mongolia from China. The Russian Empire refused to sell weapons to the Bogd Khanate, and Russian Tsar Nicholas II spoke of \\"Mongolian imperialism\\". The only country to recognize Mongolia as a legitimate state was Tibet, which also declared independence from Qing China. Tibet and Mongolia would sign a friendship treaty and grant mutual recognition. Government and society The Bogd Khaan At the time, the government was still composed of a feudal Khanate, which held its system in place largely with the power of agriculture, as most traditional pastoral societies of East Asia had been. The new Mongolian state was a fusion of very different elements: Western political institutions, Mongolian theocracy, and Qing imperial administrative and political traditions. December 29 was declared to be independence day and a national holiday. Urga (modern Ulan Bator), until then known to the Mongolians as the \\"Great Monastery\\" (Ikh kh√ºree), was renamed \\"Capital Monastery\\" (Niislel kh√ºree) to reflect its new role as the seat of government. A state name, \\"Great Mongolian State\\" (Ikh Mongol uls), and a state flag were adopted. A parliament (ulsyn khural) was created, comprising upper and lower houses. A new Mongolian government was formed with five ministries: internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, justice, and the army. Consequently, a national army was created. The new state also reflected old ways; the Bogd Khaan adopted a reign title, \\"Elevated by the Many\\" (Olnoo √∂rgogds√∂n), a style name used (it was believed) by the ancient kings of Tibet. He promoted the ruling princes and lamas by one grade, an act traditionally performed by newly installed Chinese emperors. Lay and religious princes were instructed to render their annual tribute, the \\"nine whites\\". By tradition the \\"nine whites\\" were eight white horses and one white camel. On this occasion, the \\"nine whites\\" consisted of 3,500 horses and 200 camelsTs.

Chinese and Russian Policies in Outer Mongolia, 1911‚Äì1921 Bloomington, IN, 1980. p. 36. The Bogd Khaan himself was the inevitable choice as leader of the state in view of his stature as the revered symbol of Buddhism in Mongolia. He was famed throughout the country for his special oracular and supernatural powers and as the Great Khan of Mongols. He established contacts with foreign powers, tried to assist development of economy (mainly agriculture and military issues), but his main goal was development of Buddhism in Mongolia. Ladies at court Bogd Khanate. The new state was theocratic, and its system suited Mongols, but it was not economically efficient as the leaders were inexperienced in such matters. The Qing dynasty had been careful to check the encroachment of religion into the secular arena; that restraint was now gone. State policy was directed by religious leaders, with relatively little participation by lay nobles. The parliament had only consultative powers; in any event, it did not meet until 1914. The Office of Religion and State, an extra-governmental body headed by a lama, played a role in directing political matters.Sh.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs was vigilant in ensuring that senior ecclesiastics were treated with solemn deference by lay persons.A contemporary, \\"Old Jambal,\\" in the Soviet time has supplied a fascinating description of the sordid affairs of the Bogd Khaan's court and his court. Tsendiin Damdins√ºren, ed., √ñvg√∂n Jambalyn yaria (\\"Tales of Old Jambal\\") Ulan Bator, 1959. The head of the Bogd Khaan's Ecclesiastical Administration (Shav' yamen) endeavoured to transfer as many wealthy herdsmen as he could to the ecclesiastical estate (Ikh shav'), resulting in the population bearing an increasingly heavy tax burden. Ten- thousand Buddha statuettes were purchased in 1912 as propitiatory offerings to restore the Bogd Khaan's eyesight. A cast-iron statue of the Buddha, 84 feet tall, was brought from Dolonnor, and a temple was constructed to house the statue. D. Tsedev, pp. 49‚Äì50. In 1914 the Ecclesiastical Administration ordered the government to defray the costs of a particular religious ceremony in the amount of 778,000 bricks of tea (the currency of the day), a gigantic sum.Tsedev, pp. 40, 46.

The Tsar however, rejected the Mongolian plea for recognition, due to a common Russian Imperial ambition at the time to take over the central Asian states, and Mongolia was planned for further expansion. Throughout the Bogd Khaan era, the positions of the governments of China and Russia were clear and consistent. China was adamant that Mongolia was, and must remain, an integral part of China. The (provisional) constitution of the new Chinese republic contained an uncompromising statement to this effect. A law dealing with the election of the Chinese National Assembly provided for delegates from Outer Mongolia.Jou Kuntien, Bienjiang chengtse (\\"Frontier policy\\"). Taipei, 1962. pp. 42‚Äì43. For their part, the Russian Imperial government accepted the principle that Mongolia must remain formally part of China; however, Russia was equally determined that Mongolia possess autonomous powers so substantial as to make it quasi-independent, so they recognised the autonomy of the region. Russian Empire could not act on the ambition due to internal struggles, which allowed Russia to claim that Mongolia was under her protection. Thus, in 1912 Russia concluded a secret convention with the Empire of Japan delineating their respective spheres of influence: South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia fell to the Japanese, North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to the Russians. Bogd Khaan said to Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China \\"I established our own state before you, Mongols and Chinese have different origins, our languages and scripts are different. You're not the Manchu's descendants, so how can you think China is the Manchu's successor?\\".History of Mongolia, Volume 5. Mongolian Institute of History, 2003. In spite of Chinese and Russian opposition, the Mongols were tireless in their efforts to attract international recognition of their independence. Diplomatic notes were sent to foreign consulates in Hailar; none responded. A delegation went to Saint Petersburg the purpose of which, among other things, was to contact European ambassadors expressing the desire for diplomatic relations. The Russians did not permit these contacts. A later delegation to Saint Petersburg sent notes to Western ambassadors announcing Mongolia's independence and formation of a pan-Mongolian state; again none responded. The Mongols attempted to send a delegation to Japan but the Japanese consul at Harbin prevented it from proceeding further.Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, pp. 49‚Äì50. Tibet‚ÄìMongolian Friendship Treaty While these efforts at obtaining international recognition continued, the Mongols and Russians were negotiating. At the end of 1912, Russia and the Mongols signed a treaty by which Russia acknowledged Mongol autonomy within the Republic of China; it also provided for Russian assistance in the training of a new Mongolian army and for Russian commercial privileges in Mongolia. Nevertheless, in the equivalent Mongolian version of the treaty, the terms designated independence were used. Both versions have the same value; so it was formally recognition of Mongolia as an independent state and its name Great Mongolian State.Kuzmin S.L.

In 1913, Mongolia and Tibet signed a bilateral treaty, recognizing each other as independent states. Two Cossacks in gymnastyorka uniform, in Kh√ºree ca. 1913. In November 1913, there was a Sino-Russian Declaration which recognised Mongolia as part of China but with internal autonomy; further, China agreed not to send troops or officials to Mongolia, or to permit colonization of the country; it was also to accept the \\"good offices\\" of Russia in Chinese-Mongolian affairs. There was to be a tripartite conference, in which Russia, China, and the \\"authorities\\" of Mongolia would participate.John V.A. MacMurray, comp., Treaties and Agreements with and concerning China, 1894‚Äì1919 (New York, 1921), v. 2, no. 1913/11, pp. 1066‚Äì67. This declaration was not considered by Mongolia to be legitimate as the Mongolian government had not participated in the decision. To reduce tensions, the Russians agreed to provide Mongolia with more weapons and a second loan, this time three million rubles. There were other agreements between Russia and Mongolia in these early years concerning weapons, military instructors, telegraph, and railroad that were either concluded or nearly so by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. In April 1914, the northern region of Tannu Uriankhai was formally accepted as a Russian protectorate.Istoriya Tuvy [History of Tuva], v. 1, pp. 354‚Äì55. = Kyakhta Agreement of 1915 = Namnans√ºren in delegation to St. Petersburg Mongolia in 1915 A tripartite conference between the Russian Empire, Republic of China and the Bogd Khaan's government convened at Kyakhta in the autumn of 1914. The Mongolian representative, Prime Minister T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren, were determined to stretch autonomy into de facto independence, and to deny the Chinese anything more than vague, ineffectual suzerain powers. The Chinese sought to minimize, if not to end, Mongolian autonomy. The Russian position was somewhere in between.Chen Lu, the Chinese representative, has provided a detailed chronicle of discussions in Jishi biji [Reminiscences], (Shanghai, 1919), pp. 16‚Äì41. The result was the Kyakhta Treaty of June 1915, which recognised Mongolia's autonomy within the Chinese state. Nevertheless, Outer Mongolia remained effectively outside Chinese controlBatsaikhan, O. The Last King of Mongolia, Bogdo Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Ulaanbaatar: Admon, 2008, p.290-293 ‚Äì and retained main features of the state according to international law of that time.Kuzmin, S.L. –°entenary of the Kyakhta Agreement of 1915 between Russia, Mongolia and China. ‚Äì Asia and Africa Today (Moscow), 2015, no 4, p. 60-63 The Mongolians viewed the treaty as a disaster because it denied the recognition of a truly independent, all-Mongolian state. China regarded the treaty in a similar fashion, consenting only because it was preoccupied with other international problems, especially Japan. The treaty did contain one significant feature which the Chinese were later to turn to their advantage; the right to appoint a high commissioner to Urga and deputy high commissioners to Uliastai, Khovd, and Kyakhta. This provided a senior political presence in Mongolia, which had been lacking. Decline of Russian influence In 1913, the Russian consulate in Urga began publishing a journal titled Shine tol' (the New Mirror), the purpose of which was to project a positive image of Russia. Its editor, a Buryat-born scholar and statesman Ts. Zhamtsarano, turned it into a platform for advocating political and social change. Lamas were incensed over the first issue, which denied that the world was flat; another issue severely criticized the Mongolian nobility for its exploitation of ordinary people.Korostovetz, p. 251. Medical and veterinary services, part of Russian-sponsored reforms, met resistance from the lamas as this had been their prerogative. Mongols regarded as annoying the efforts of the Russians to oversee use of the second loan (the Russians believed the first had been profligately spent) and to reform the state budgetary system.Korostovetz, p. 286. The Russian diplomat Alexander Miller, appointed in 1913, proved to be a poor choice as he had little respect for most Mongolian officials, whom he regarded as incompetent in the extreme.Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, p. 81. The chief Russian military instructor successfully organized a Mongolian military brigade. Soldiers from this brigade manifested themselves later on in combat against Chinese troops. The outbreak of the World War I in 1914 required Russia to redirect its energies to Europe. By the middle of 1915, the Russian military position had deteriorated so badly that the Russian government had no choice but to neglect its Asian interests. China soon took advantage of the Russian distractions which increased dramatically following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.  Chinese attempts to \\"reintegrate\\" Mongolia  Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China In December 1915, Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China, sent gifts to the Bogd Khaan and his wife. In return, the Bogd Khaan dispatched a delegation of 30 persons to Beijing with gifts for Yuan: four white horses and two camels (his wife Ekh Dagina sent four black horses and two camels). The delegation was received by Yuan Shikai himself, now proclaimed ruler of a restored Empire of China.B√ºgd nairamdakh Mongol ard ulsyn t√º√ºkh [History of the Monglian People's Republic], (Ulan Bator, 1966‚Äì69), v. 2, pp. 536‚Äì37. The delegation met Yuan Shikai on February 10, 1916.Badarchi, O.S. and Dugarsuren, Sh.N. Bogd khaany amdrallyn on daraalyn tovchoon. Ulaanbaatar: Khadyn san, 2000, p. 125. In China this was interpreted in the context of the traditional tributary system, when all missions with gifts to Chinese rulers were considered as signs of submission. In this regard, Chinese sources stated that a year later, the Bogd Khaan agreed to participate in an investiture ceremony ‚Äì a formal Qing ritual by which frontier nobles received the patent and seal of imperial appointment to office; Yuan awarded him China's highest decoration of merit; lesser but significant decorations were awarded to other senior Mongolian princes.Chen Chungzu, Wai mengu jinshi shi [The modern history of Outer Mongolia], (Shanghai, 1926; repr. Taipei, 1965), bien 2, p. 69. Actually, after the conclusion of the Kyakhta agreement in 1914, Yuan Shikai sent a telegram to the Bogd Khaan informing him that he was bestowed a title of \\"Bogd Jevzundamba Khutuktu Khaan of Outer Mongolia\\" and would be provided with a golden seal and a golden diploma. The Bogd Khaan responded: \\"Since the title of Bogd Jevzundamba Khutuktu Khaan of Outer Mongolia was already bestowed by the Ikh Juntan, there was no need to bestow it again and that since there was no provision on the golden seal and golden diploma in the tripartite agreement, his government was not in a position to receive them\\".Batsaikhan, O. The Last King of Mongolia, Bogdo Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Ulaanbaatar: Admon, 2008, p.293 ‚Äì The Bogd Khaan had already been granted said golden seal, title and diploma by the Qing dynasty. Revolution and civil war in Russia The Bolshevik revolution in 1917 and the resultant outbreak of civil war in Russia provided new opportunities for China to move into Mongolia. The Bolsheviks established workers' councils in Siberia, a process essentially completed by the summer of 1918. The presence of the Bolsheviks so close to the Mongolian border unsettled both the Mongolians and the Chinese High Commissioner, Chen Yi. Rumours were rife of Bolshevik troops preparing to invade Mongolia. The Cossack consular guards at Urga, Uliastai, and Khovd, traditionally loyal to the Imperial House of Romanov, had mutinied and left. The Russian communities in Mongolia were themselves becoming fractious, some openly supporting the new Bolshevik regime.Burdukov, pp. 151, 393. The pretext was the penetration of the White Russian troops from Siberia.Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, , p. 128. Chen Yi sent telegrams to Beijing requesting troops and, after several efforts, was able to persuade the Bogd Khaan's government to agree to the introduction of one battalion. By July 1918, the Soviet threat from Siberia had faded and the Mongolian foreign minister told Chen Yi that troops were no longer needed. Nevertheless, the Chinese battalion continued to move and in August arrived to Urga. Grigory Semyonov Anti-Bolshevik forces in Asia were fragmented into a number of regiments. One was led by the Supreme Commander of the Baikal Cossacks, Grigory Semyonov, who had assembled a detachment of Buryats and Inner Mongolian nationalists for the creation of a pan-Mongolian state. Semyonov and his allies made several unsuccessful efforts to encourage the Bogd Khaan's government to join it. The Khalkha people regarded themselves as the natural leaders of all Mongols and feared being submerged into a new political system that likely would be led by Buryats, whom the Khalkhas deeply mistrusted.B. Shirendyb, Mongolia na rubezhe XIX-XX vekov [Mongolia on the eve of the 19th and 20th centuries], (Ulan Bator, 1963), pp. 173‚Äì74. When inducements failed, Semyonov threatened to invade Mongolia to force compliance.Zhung-O guanxi shiliao: Wai menggu [Historical sources on Chinese- Russian relations: Outer Mongolia], (Taipei, 1959),, no. 159, p. 415. The Bogd Khaanate was in a difficult position. On the one hand, it lacked the strength to repel a pan-Mongolist attack; on the other, they were profoundly disquieted by the thought of more Chinese troops in Mongolia. The first detachment of Chinese troops arrived to Urga in July 1919. Prince N.A Kudashev, the old Imperial Russian ambassador to Beijing, indicated a violation of the Kyakhta Agreement by China.Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, , p. 134 This step in conflict with the Kyakhta agreement was considered by the Chinese as the first step toward Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia.Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, p. 118. In any event, the threatened pan-Mongolian invasion never materialized because of dissension between the Buryats and Inner Mongolians, and Semyonov's dream of a pan-Mongolian state died.Ewing, Russia, China, p. 407. Abolition of Mongolian autonomy On August 4, 1919, an assembly of princes took place in Urga to discuss Semyonov's invitation to join the pan- Mongolian movement; this was because Khalkhas were threatened by a pan- Mongolist group of one Mongolian and two Buryat regiments advancing from Dauria. While that military campaign failed, China continued to increase troop numbers in Mongolia. On August 13, 1919 Commissioner Chen Yi received a message from \\"representatives of the four aimags\\", requesting that China come to Mongolia's aid against Semyonov; it also expressed the desire of the Khalkha nobility to restore the previous Qing system. Among other things, they proposed that the five ministries of the Mongolian government be placed under the direct supervision of the Chinese high commission rather than the Bogd Khaan.Zhung-O, no. 253, 461‚Äì61. According to an Associated Press dispatch, some Mongol chieftains signed a petition asking China to retake administration of Mongolia and end Outer Mongolia's autonomy. Pressure from Chen Yi on Mongolian princes followed; representatives of the Bogd Khaan also participated in negotiations. Eventually, the princes agreed on a long list of principles, sixty-four points \\"On respecting of Outer Mongolia by the government of China and improvement of her position in future after self- abolishing of authonomy\\". This document offered the replacement of the Mongolian government with Chinese officials, the introduction of Chinese garrisons and keeping of feudal titles. According to ambassador Kudashev, the majority of princes supported the abolition of autonomy. The Bogd Khaan sent a delegation to the President of China with a letter complaining that the plan to abolish autonomy was a contrivance of the High Commissioner alone and not the wish of the people of Mongolia. On October 28, 1919, the Chinese National Assembly approved the articles. President Xu Shichang sent a conciliatory letter to the Bogd Khaan, pledging respect for Mongolian feelings and reverence for the Jebtsundamba Khututktu and the Buddhist faith.Thomas E. Ewing, Russia, China, and the Origins of the Mongolian People's Republic, 1911‚Äì1921: A Reappraisal, The Slavonic and East European Review (London), v. 58, pp. 407‚Äì08 (1980). General Xu Shuzheng A few months earlier the Chinese government had appointed as new Northwest Frontier Commissioner Xu Shuzheng, an influential warlord and prominent member of the pro-Japanese Anhui clique in the Chinese National Assembly. Xu had a vision for Mongolia very different from that reflected in the Sixty-four points. It presented a vast plan for reconstruction. Arriving with a military escort in Urga on October 29, he informed the Mongolians that the Sixty-four points would need to be renegotiated. He submitted a much tougher set of conditions, the \\"Eight Articles,\\" calling for the express declaration of Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia, an increase in Mongolia's population (presumably through Chinese colonization), and the promotion of commerce, industry, and agriculture.Ts. Puntsagnorov, Mongolyn avtonomit √ºyeiin t√º√ºkh [History of Mongolia in the autonomous period], (Ulan Bator, 1955), p. 205. The Mongols resisted, prompting Xu to threaten to deport the Bogd Khaan to China if he did not immediately agree to the conditions.Zhung-O, no. 420, p. 593. To emphasize the point, Xu placed troops in front of the Bogd Khaan's palace.D. Gongor, Ts. Dolgors√ºren, eds., D. S√ºkhbaataaryn tukhai durdatgaluud [Memories of D. Sukhbaatar], (Ulan Bator, 1965), p. 71. The Japanese were the ones who ordered these pro-Japanese Chinese warlords to occupy Mongolia in order to halt a possibly revolutionary spillover from the Russian revolutionaries into Mongolia and Northern China. After the Chinese completed the occupation, the Japanese then abandoned them and left them on their own. The Eight Articles were placed before the Mongolian Parliament on November 15. The upper house accepted the Articles; the lower house did not, with some members calling for armed resistance, if necessary. The Buddhist monks resisted most of all, but the nobles of the upper house prevailed.L. Bat-Ochir, D. Dashjamts, Damdiny Sukhe-Bator. Biografiya [Biography of Damdin Sukhbaatar], (Moscow, 1971), pp. 31‚Äì32. A petition to end autonomy, signed by the ministers and deputy ministers of the Bogd Khaan's government, was presented to Xu.Chen Chungzu, pien 3, pp. 5‚Äì7. The Bogd Khaan refused to affix his seal until compelled by the fact that new Prime Minister Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj, installed by order of Xu Shuzheng, and conservative forces were accepting the Chinese demands. The office of the high commission was abolished, and Chen Yi was recalled. Xu's success was broadly celebrated in China. January 1 and the following days were declared holidays and all governmental institutions in Beijing and in the provinces were closed. Xu Shuzheng returned to Mongolia in December for the Bogd Khaan's \\"investiture\\", which took place on January 1, 1920. It was an elaborate ceremony: Chinese soldiers lined both sides of the road to the palace; the portrait of the President of China was borne on a palanquin, followed by the national flag of China and a marching band of cymbals and drums. Mongols were obliged to prostrate themselves before these emblems of Chinese sovereignty.Xu Daolin, Xu shuzheng hsien-sheng wenji nienpu hokan [The life of Mr. Xu Shuzheng], (Taipei, 1962), p. 261. That night herdsmen and lamas gathered outside the palace and angrily tore down the flags of the Chinese Republic hanging from the gate.Bat-Ochir, Dashjamts, p. 34. Xu moved immediately to implement the Eight Articles. The doors of the former Mongolian ministries were locked, and Chinese sentries posted in front. A new government of eight departments was formed. The Mongolian army was demobilized, its arsenal seized, and both lay and religious officials banned from using the words \\"Mongolian state\\" (Mongol uls) in their official correspondence.B√ºgd nairamdakh Mongol ard ulsyn t√º√ºkh [History of the Monglian People's Republic], (Ulan Bator, 1966‚Äì69), v. 3, p. 65. The Tusiyetu Khan Aimak's Prince Darchin Ch'in Wang was a supporter of Chinese rule while his younger brother Tsewang was a supporter of Ungern-Sternberg. Conclusion Flag of Mongolia, preserved in the National Museum of Mongolia The late Qing government had embarked on a grand plan, the \\"New Policies\\", aimed at an integration of Mongolia into China and opened Han Chinese colonization and agricultural settlement. Many Mongols considered this act as a violation of the old agreements when they recognized authority of the Manchu dynasty, particularly the preservation of traditional social order on Mongolian lands, and thus began to seek independence. The collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, conducted under the nationalistic catchwords of the Han Chinese, led to the formation of the Republic of China; later the initial concept was called \\"Five Races Under One Union\\".Esherick J.W. 2006. How the Qing became China. ‚Äì –í –∫–Ω.: Empire to Nation. Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World (eds. J.W. Esherick, H. Kayali, E. van Young). Lanham, Maryland, p.240-255 The newly founded Chinese state laid claim to all imperial territory, including Mongolia. Mongolian officials were clear that their subordination was to the Qing monarch and thus owed no allegiance to the new Chinese republic. While some Inner Mongols showed willingness to join the Republic of China, Outer Mongols, together with part of Inner Mongolia, declared independence of China. The Outer Mongols were helped by the White Russian troops of Baron R.F. von Ungern-Sternberg incursions following the Russian Revolution of 1917.See also Thomas E. Ewing, Ch'ing Policies in Outer Mongolia 1900‚Äì1911, Modern Asian Studies, pp. 145‚Äì157 (1980).Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, , pp. 120-199. The abolition of Mongolian autonomy by Xu Shuzheng in 1919 reawakened the mongolian national independence movement. Two small resistance groups formed, later to become the Mongolian People's Party (renamed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party), which sought independence and Soviet cooperation. It was proposed that Zhang Zuolin's domain (the Chinese \\"Three Eastern Provinces\\") take Outer Mongolia under its administration by the Bogda Khan and Bodo in 1922 after pro-Soviet Mongolian Communists seized control of Outer Mongolia.

West Anaheim is where most of the residential development occurred during the 1950s and the 1960s, after Disneyland opened in 1955. History The area went by a number of names such as \\"Lorara\\", \\"Manchester\\", \\"Lincoln Park\\", \\"Magnolia Tree\\" and \\"WestGate\\" as the western gate to Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County boundary is in nearby Buena Park. The former US Route 101 crossed there, was named Manchester Avenue. The area was settled in the 1860s to 1890s by Midwestern and East Coast Americans, although Germans and the Dutch established farms (many were diary operations and horse ranches), groves and orchards with some grape vineyards but oranges fared better. West Anaheim was named in 1877 when the Southern Pacific railroad established a station west of Anaheim because the city refused to pay subsidies.OC Almanac web site A post office was established at West Anaheim from 1900 to 1907 by the name of Loara.1977 H.E. Sally, \\"History of California Post Offices\\" Prior to 1960, newly annexed West Anaheim mostly consisted of orange groves before Disneyland opened in 1955. The Walt Disney theme park became a success and brought a lot of business to Anaheim, and with it, a need for residential development. From 1955 when the theme park opened to 1961, Anaheim's population increased from about 14,000 people to 104,184 people, and a lot of that population growth took place in West Anaheim. Between 1955 and 1970, orange groves were cleared away to make way for new streets and new houses moving westward. The neighborhood went through great deal of suburbanization into one of California's largest cities by population. Urban blight followed in the 1980s and 1990s, and immigrants from Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East settled in large numbers. The area of West Anaheim is now mostly lower-middle class and working class. There are sections and business strips representing Arabs, Koreans, Hispanics/Latinos, African-Americans and white Anglos. One of the blocks is called Little Gaza named for Palestinians residents since the early 2000s. Some of the main thoroughfares in West Anaheim include Brookhurst Street, Magnolia Avenue, Beach Blvd and Knott Avenue (named after Walter Knott), which go north and south. West Anaheim roads which go east and west include Katella Avenue, Cerritos Avenue, Ball Road and Lincoln Avenue. West Anaheim is surrounded by Stanton to the south and Buena Park to the north. The Knott's Berry Farm Resort and E-Zone in Buena Park are not too far north from West Anaheim on Beach Blvd (California Highway 39), and so Beach Blvd. in West Anaheim consists of hotels and motels. Adventure City Amusement Park, which features a lot of hobby stores, is also located on Beach Blvd in West Anaheim. A new West Anaheim police precinct was built in 2005 just a mile north of Adventure City, along with a youth center. Golfer Tiger Woods attended Western High SchoolGoogle Books search which is located in West Anaheim on the corner of Western ave. and Orange Ave. In 2010, unincorporated sections of West Anaheim rejected city annexation into Anaheim. One of them Anaheim Island, California is divided whether or not on accepting annexation and/or forming a new city, as the community wants better public services by Orange County versus not to pay for Anaheim city taxes. Anaheim Island remains a mostly middle-class community, while they never been part of the municipality that surrounded them.  Twila Reid  Twila Reid was the librarian, and highly respected, during the early years in Anaheim's history.

Powell (also known as Woody Powell), born August 15, 1951, is a contemporary American sociologist. Powell is Professor of Education, Sociology, Organizational Behavior, Management Science and Engineering, and Communication at Stanford University and the Stanford Graduate School of Education since 1999 and is known for his contributions to organizational theory, in particular to the new institutionalism and network theory. Since 2000, he has been an external faculty member of the Santa Fe Institute. Powell received his Ph.D. in sociology from the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Professor Powell works in the areas of organization theory and economic sociology. Powell is widely known for his contributions to institutional analysis, beginning with his article with Paul DiMaggio, \\"The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields\\" (1983) and their subsequent edited book, The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis (1991). These works are widely considered seminal to the development of the new institutionalism within organizational theory. Powell is also engaged in research on the origins and development of the commercial field of the life sciences, and the dynamics of collaboration that knit together this field. This line of work continues his interests in networks as a governance mechanism, first developed in his seminal 1990 article, \\"Neither Market Nor Hierarchy: Network Forms of Organization,\\" which won the American Sociological Association's Max Weber Prize. Powell and his collaborators have developed a longitudinal database that tracks the development of the biotechnology industry worldwide from the 1980s to the present. Powell is author and co-author of a number of books: The Culture and Commerce of Publishing (1982), an analysis of the transformation of book publishing from a family-run, craft-based field into a multinational media industry, and author of Getting Into Print (1985), an ethnographic study of decision-making processes in scholarly publishing houses. He has conducted numerous studies of nonprofit organizations, ranging from public television and university presses to art museums and higher education. He edited The Nonprofit Sector (1987, referred to by reviewers as \\"the Bible of scholarship on the nonprofit sector\\"). The second edition of the handbook, co-edited with Richard Steinberg, was published by Yale University Press in 2006. Powell is also co-editor with Elisabeth Clemens of Private Action and the Public Good (1998).

A necessary and sufficient condition for the arrival theorem to be satisfied in product-form networks is given in terms of Palm probabilities in Boucherie & Dijk, 1997. A similar result also holds in some closed networks. Examples of product-form networks where the arrival theorem does not hold include reversible Kingman networks and networks with a delay protocol. Mitrani offers the intuition that \\"The state of node i as seen by an incoming job has a different distribution from the state seen by a random observer. For instance, an incoming job can never see all 'k jobs present at node i, because it itself cannot be among the jobs already present.\\" Theorem for arrivals governed by a Poisson process For Poisson processes the property is often referred to as the PASTA property (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) and states that the probability of the state as seen by an outside random observer is the same as the probability of the state seen by an arriving customer. The property also holds for the case of a doubly stochastic Poisson process where the rate parameter is allowed to vary depending on the state. Theorem for Jackson networks In an open Jackson network with m queues, write mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2, ldots, n_m) for the state of the network. Suppose pi(mathbf{n}) is the equilibrium probability that the network is in state mathbf{n}. Then the probability that the network is in state mathbf{n} immediately before an arrival to any node is also pi(mathbf{n}). Note that this theorem does not follow from Jackson's theorem, where the steady state in continuous time is considered. Here we are concerned with particular points in time, namely arrival times. This theorem first published by Sevcik and Mitrani in 1981. Theorem for Gordon‚ÄìNewell networks In a closed Gordon‚ÄìNewell network with m queues, write {mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2, ldots, n_m)} for the state of the network. For a customer in transit to state i, let {alpha_i(mathbf{n}-mathbf{e}_i)} denote the probability that immediately before arrival the customer 'sees' the state of the system to be :mathbf{n}-mathbf{e}_i = (n_1,n_2,ldots,n_i - 1,ldots,n_m). This probability, {alpha_i(mathbf{n}-mathbf{e}_i)}, is the same as the steady state probability for state {mathbf{n}-mathbf{e}_i} for a network of the same type with one customer less. It was published independently by Sevcik and Mitrani, and Reiser and Lavenberg, where the result was used to develop mean value analysis.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Totality began over the Pacific Ocean and Hawaii moving across Mexico, down through Central America and across South America ending over Brazil. It lasted for 6 minutes and 53.08 seconds at the point of maximum eclipse. There will not be a longer total eclipse until June 13, 2132.

It was released on 2 July 2009 in the UK and was published on May 1, 2010 for the US.http://zookiesnotepad.blogspot.com/2010/04/this-weeks-word-is- conference.html  Plot  Three young adults named Arthur, Lucy and Elizabeth were traveling to meet Rupert Steiner. Gadzooks met them and left them a note. Scuffenbury was written in Dragontounge. This is a name for a barrow which legend has it, contains a dragon. Back in their home town, Wayward Crescent, David asks Zanna, David's girlfriend, for more information about Gwilanna. This is where Gwillanna is threatening to hand over the Dark Fire Tear to IX. She had the choice to sacrifice her husband while being threatened, but Zanna was used for David's place. The summoning of the dragon Ghislaine, Gwilanna summoned a darkling. David and Zanna get home one night and discover their neighbor, Henry Bacon, is in the hospital due to a stroke. Liz and Lucy are at the hospital and David gets a letter. He learns about the Scuffenbury. David goes with Liz to visit Henry in hospital, and Henry dies during their visit. After Henry dies, Gwilanna, attends the funeral and gives a warning to David that she will do anything to get her hands on the obsidian and the Dark Fire. The group meet Henry's sister Agatha, a powerful sibyl. They also discover that Henry has left Liz and Lucy $50,000, and left David his collection of Arctic memorabilia and Zanna his house. The will also says that the Arctic would be left in place. After this, Agatha(a Sybil) teaches Zanna healing magicks and suggests that she make her peace with David. Zanna goes into town with Alexa and Gretel to open her shop, but on the way the group are attacked by the semi-Darkling flock and are rescued by Tam, who destroys them with the spirit Kailar. Zanna was hurt, but uses her new healing knowledge to mend the wound. Tam talks to David about Rupert Steiner, who has come to him with a story about translations of the dragontongue found on the Glacier expedition. Lucy told David that Sophie emailed her, trying to talk to him, and David leaves for Africa. Lucy then receives a phone call from an old friend, Melanie Cartwright, who has seen a video of a Pennykettle dragon moving on TV and is concerned over her own ‚Äúspecial‚Äù dragon, Glade. David gets to Africa and finds Sophie's wildlife sanctuary on fire. Grockle extinguishes the fire. Sophie was killed and Grace is preparing to cry her Fire Tear. The semi-Darkling which began the fire is still alive. He was planning on inverting Grace's tear to create dark fire. Pieter, Sophie's fianc√©, tries to kill it, but it kills him instead. David then distracts the Darkling with the dark fire he already has, captures it and sends it back to the IX with a warning to leave the Pennykettle dragons alone. Mutu, one of Sophie's college roommates, tells David that he saw a woman dancing in the flames. David then leaves Africa, taking with him Grace's stone body. Her Fire Tear was caught by Groyne during the struggle. When he returns home. David informs Zanna that Alexa is a new species. She is an angel, a bridge between dragons and mankind and when the dragons are revealed, people everywhere will want to be like her. He also tells her that the people will travel to Ki:mera. This is the Fain's home world. In the Dragon's Den, David gathers the dragons in an attempt to convert the dark fire and return it to Gwillan. Gollygosh will extract the dark fire from the obsidian, Groyne will mix it with Grace's Fire Tear and some icefire to neutralize it, and G'reth will wish for Gwillan and Grace to be reanimated. However, while David explains what will happen, Gollygosh is momentarily corrupted by the dark fire, and releases it early. The Dark Fire then enters Liz and her baby and she is knocked out. While Zanna tends to her, He then sends Lucy with Tam to Scuffenbury. Not noticing that, in the Dragon's Den, Gwillan is draining Grace's auma into himself. Lucy and Tam travel to Scuffenbury. On the way, Lucy reads the article about the last meeting of dragons. This is how eleven of the last twelve dragons shed half of their fire tears, then went into stasis, while the twelfth, Gawaine, ingested all eleven tears and planned to use them to defeat the Ix. Lucy and Tam arrive at their guesthouse, which is run by Hannah and Clive, and has one other guest, Mrs Gee. They climb Glissington Tor, the dragon's burial site, that evening, and that night Lucy has a nightmare about a cat, which she encountered earlier in the day, bringing her a semi-darkling. In the Crescent, Liz is comatose, but unharmed. When Gwillan suddenly wakes up, Melanie Cartwright comes to visit with her mother, Rachel, and dragon, Glade, who can sense moods. Gretel puts the humans to sleep so they don't get in the way, and Glade goes upstairs to try and check on Liz and the baby. She finds that Liz is all right, but the baby's body is in stasis, and its auma has been transferred to Gwillan. The Cartwrights leave, and David contacts G'Oreal, informing him that Grockle is destroying the semi-Darklings. Early next morning, Tam and Lucy climb Scuffenbury Hill to see the unicorn. While they are there, cairn stones, the remains of a monument on Glissington Tor, begin to rise from the earth and rebuild the cairn, revealing more chalk carvings - a unicorn's horn. Mrs Gee, a sibyl, has rebuilt the cairn to try and wake the unicorn and the dragon, but Hannah, who claims to know all the Tor's secrets, warns her that this legend is false, and waking the dragon requires a red-haired girl, touched by the spirit of a dragon. She also explains that the dragon in stasis is Gawaine, who came to Scuffenbury looking for the unicorn Teramelle's healing to help her give birth, and offers to help Mrs Gee claim the dragon in return for one of its scales. Gwendolen, left in the hotel to watch for the mysterious cat, is shocked to discover that not only is the cat real, it can do magic, and communicate. It tells her it is truly a girl called Bella, who was turned into a cat by Mrs Gee. The TV news is showing pictures of dragons being freed all over the world, and Hannah tells Lucy that she can wake the dragon if she touches it and sings - and that there is a tunnel under the cairn which will let Lucy touch the dragon. At Wayward Crescent, Zanna is puzzled by e-mails Lucy is receiving, which David tells her are from other daughters of Guinevere. He also gives her Tam's article, telling her that Gawaine, the dragon in Scuffenbury and the one chosen to fight the IX, was Gawain's mother, and her plan to destroy the IX was to draw the IX to her, then sacrifice herself in the Fire Eternal, a plan which the new Wearle has adopted. Tam and Lucy travel through the tunnels to wake Gawaine, but as the dragon stirs, Hannah betrays them. Tam is trapped underground, and Lucy captured by Mrs Gee, but Bella helps her escape. In the chaos of the dragon's awakening, Mrs Gee, Hannah and Clive are all killed and the hotel collapses. Meanwhile, Melanie and Rachel Cartwright are attacked by the last surviving semi-Darkling, who injures both of them before taking Glade. Glade sends a distress signal to the Pennykettles, which is intercepted by Gwillan. Lucy calls David for help, and he sends Grockle. With his help, Lucy places some of her tears in Glissington cairn, although Bella tries to stop her. The tears reflect moonlight onto the unicorn's horn, bringing it to life, and it frees Gawaine. However, as Zanna discovers through an email Bella sent Lucy, Gawaine was betrayed and one of her children murdered by a sibyl disguised as a red-haired maiden, and when she sees Lucy, she attacks. Grockle fails to defend Lucy, but, as Lucy is Gawaine's kin, the flames do not harm her, and Gawine is distracted for long enough that David can arrive to help. Meanwhile, the last surviving semi- Darkling ingests Lucy's auma from the tears she left at Glissington Cairn. It uses the power in the tears to renew itself, and call the Ix towards it, and a full Darkling is born, with the ability to self-replicate, which it does until there are four Darklings. Realizing the danger, David gives Lucy the narwhal tusk talisman which he thinks is Groyne so that she can be transported home, not realizing that the tusk is in fact Gwillan, who has taken Groyne's abilities, and Lucy has only been moved across the valley. Gawaine and G'lant - the combined force of David and Grockle - begin to fight the Darklings. One invades Gawaine's mind before she destroys it, but G'lant restores her before permanent injury can occur. One then distracts G'lant while the remaining two attack Gawaine. One destroys her wing and poisons her blood, although it is near-fatally injured in the attempt, and falls to the ground near Lucy, who has been joined by Bella. As it attempts to attack the girls, Tam emerges from the ground and destroys it. Zane contacts Agatha Bacon but instead Gwilanna arrives at Wayward Crescent, and Zanna leaves for Scuffenbury after . She arrives near Gawaine, who is gravely injured, and begins trying to heal her with Teramelle's help. The unicorn warns her to hurry, as Scuffenbury is the site of a portal to the Fire Eternal, and the portal will soon open. Meanwhile, Gwilanna, who wishes to deliver Liz's child. She refuses to listen when Arthur explains that Gwillan now possesses the child's auma. She uses a spell to trap Arthur in an armoir and, with the use of Gawain's iscoscele, draws the dark fire out of Liz. The dark fire turns Gawain's isoscele black, then proceeds to kill Gwilanna before traveling to Scuffenbury. Alexa, who was locked outside by Gwilanna, grows full wings and is then taken by G'Oreal of the New Wearle to Scuffenbury. At Scuffenbury, G'lant continues to fight the two remaining Darklings.

History Prior to joining his latest band Grave Digger in 2007, Herrmann has played with a lot of other different kinds of metal bands. One of the first bigger bands he played with in his career was the heavy metal/hard rock band Faithful Breath (earlier a progressive rock band), which he joined in 1985. That band changed their name to Risk some years after he joined the band. He did not record anything on their first album as Risk, which is called The Daily Horror News. He did come back however in 1989, and during this time in the band he recorded one EP and two albums and then left them again. In 1994 Thilo was recruited as guitarist for the famous German heavy metal band Running Wild, where he played on their album Black Hand Inn, as well as three other albums. He left the band in 2001 about a year after their album Victory was released. Several years later, Grave Digger was planning to add a second guitarist for the first time ever during their existence. A competition was held at the official Grave Digger homepage where the fans could guess who the new second guitarist would be. On October 8, 2007 it was revealed that it was Thilo. He played his first gig with the band on October 31 in Zeche Bochum. Thilo left Grave Digger in February 2009. Apart from those bands, he has also played with Steel Dragon, H√∂llenhunde, Glenmore, and Holy Moses during a period in 1988. He did not record anything with any of these bands, though.

He also held a position as ethnologist at George Washington University from 1917 until 1932.Cooper, John, 1939, p. 281 Michelson studied Indo-European historical linguistics at Harvard University, completing his doctoral degree in 1904, with further study at the Universities of Leipzig and Bonn in 1904-1905, followed by study with Franz Boas.Cooper, John, 1939, p. 281 Soon after joining the Bureau of American Ethnology, Michelson began an extensive program of field research on North American Indian languages. Much of Michelson's research focused on languages of the Algonquian family. Bibliographies of his publications are available in Boas (1938), Cooper (1939), and Pentland and Wolfart (1982).Boas, Franz, 1938, pp. 113-116; Cooper, John, 1939, pp. 282-285; Pentland, David, and H. C. Wolfart, 1982, pp. 165-174 He was the author of an early influential study classifying the Algonquian languages,Michelson, Truman, 1913 although extensive further research has entirely superseded Michelson's pioneering effort.Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 94 Much of his research focused on the Fox people and language, resulting in an extensive list of publications on Fox ethnology and linguistics. Michelson employed native speakers of the language to write Fox stories in the Fox version of the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, resulting in a large collection of unpublished materials. Goddard (1991, 1996) discusses the material in some of these texts.Goddard, Ives, 1991, 1996 A significant text from this corpus, The Owl Sacred Pack, has recently been published.Goddard, Ives, 2007 One of the texts obtained in this manner that Michelson did publish, The autobiography of a Fox Indian woman, is now available in a more complete edition, with a revised transcription of the original text and comprehensive linguistic analysis.Michelson, Truman, 1925; Goddard, Ives, 2006 Michelson also assisted in the posthumous preparation and publication of a number of draft manuscripts left unpublished after the premature death of William Jones. Among these were: (a) a significant two- volume collection of Ojibwe texts with translations that Jones had obtained in northwestern Ontario at Fort William Ojibwa reserve, and near Lake Nipigon, in addition to stories collected in northern Minnesota;Jones, William, 1917, 1919 (b) a volume of Kickapoo texts;Jones, William and Truman Michelson, 1917 and (c) an article on Fox for the first Handbook of American Indian languages.Jones, William, 1911 He also undertook field research on, among others, Arapaho; Shawnee; Peoria; Kickapoo; Munsee and Unami, the two closely related Delaware languages;Goddard, Ives, 1979b, pp. 5, 9 collected notes and texts in the syllabic script from Cree dialects in Qu√©bec and northern Ontario; physical anthropology notes on Blackfoot and Cheyenne; Eskimo texts from Great Whale River, Qu√©bec, and others.Boas, Franz, 1938, p. 116 A comprehensive list of all of Michelson‚Äôs archival materials in the National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian Institution is available online.Smithsonian Institution Archival Listing of Truman Michelson Materials Michelson was involved in a prominent debate with Edward Sapir because of his rejection of Sapir's proposal that the Algonquian languages were related to Wiyot and Yurok, two languages of California, through common membership in the Algic language family.Michelson, Truman, 1914, 1915; Sapir, Edward, 1913, 1915, 1915a Although he strongly criticized Sapir's proposal, the historical links between Algonquian, Yurok, and Wiyot are now accepted as being beyond dispute.Goddard, Ives, 1975 NotesReferences *Boas, Franz. 1938. ‚ÄúTruman Michelson.‚Äù International Journal of American Linguistics 9(2/4): 113‚Äì116. *Cooper, John M. 1939. ‚ÄúTruman Michelson.‚Äù American Anthropologist New Series 41(2): 281‚Äì285. *Goddard, Ives. 1975. ‚ÄúAlgonquian, Wiyot and Yurok: Proving a distant genetic relationship.‚Äù Eds.

They were part of the second wave of punk rock music and toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe, recording several EP's. History The Plague started out in October 1982 as a three-person band. Bob Sablack recruited his cousin John Korosec of his previous band The Defnics on drums and Duke Snyder, the younger brother of his best friend who lived down the street, on bass, with himself on guitar and vocals. Influenced by bands such as Discharge and The Stooges, the three recorded an eight-song demo almost immediately. They played nearly every venue in Cleveland and Kent, and went through several vocalists before recruiting Mike Duncan of Agitated for vocals in 1985. That same year, they attempted to record their masterpiece, but showed up to the studio too drunk to play and did not record anything else for a while. Finally, in 1987, after much insistence from The Pagans' Mike Metoff, the Plague hit the studios, recording \\"Just Say No\\". The record got a glowing three-sentence review in Maximumrocknroll that would send them on their way to a European tour. Swedish record producer Stefan Wicklander heard the single and wanted to sign The Plague. They accepted, and Wicklander produced a split LP called Distortion Head with Swedish band Rosvette (Ass Sweat), a tour promotion single \\"Unresting Place\\" and The Plague's full LP Chain Sawng Massacre. Additionally, the Plague and their fans are often credited with having introduced and popularized the slang term \\"sick,\\" which has recently entered mainstream usage. European tour The band proceeded to tour Europe, where they had the biggest following outside of the Cleveland area. They were the first band from Cleveland's second wave of punk to tour Europe, The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu having toured there a decade early during first wave of punk. The Plague's song \\"Nazi Submarine\\" was always a crowd pleaser. But when the band toured Germany, they decided to drop it from their set list, fearing it might offend audiences. When they got there, however, the crowds screamed for \\"Nazi Submarine\\" everywhere they went. Demise The Plague recorded one final session in 1989 before calling it quits. Nearly thirty years later, all of their vinyl recordings as well as some previously unreleased recordings were released in a two-volume set entitled Thumper, which is also downloadable.

She is perhaps best remembered for her 1893 novel A Sex Revolution. Early years and education Born Adeline Eliza Nichols in upstate New York, she grew up in poverty there and in Ohio. She had little formal education, and worked for some years as a domestic servant. Career Beginning at the age of seventeen, an illegitimate pregnancy, a forced marriage, a quick widowhood and a brief second marriage inspired her devotion to feminist values.Passet, 2006, pp. 230-2. She converted to spiritualism and became a \\"trance speaker\\" at spiritualist gatherings. By 1863 she had adopted the name Lois Waisbrooker, and began a practice of lecturing and journalism that continued through the remainder of her life. \\"She wrote passable poetry, but didactic prose was her forte.\\"Hal D. Sears, The Sex Radicals: Free Love in High Victorian America, Lawrence, KS, Regents Press of Kansas, 1977; p. 232. She helped to organize the Boston Social Freedon Convention in the 1870s, and served as an official of the American Labor Reform League in 1882-83. Waisbrooker founded and edited three periodicals, Our Age, Foundation Principles, and Clothed with the Sun (sometimes even setting the type and operating the printing press). In 1892 she \\"served as acting editor of an anarchist free-thought weekly titled Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\\"Passett, 2006, p. 230. when its former editor Moses Harmon went to prison. Like other radical writers of the period, she was prosecuted under the Comstock Act that prohibited the sending of obscene materials through the U.S. mail. She was involved in public controversy, and was the subject of condemnation and ridicule, throughout her career. In August 1894, the Topeka State Journal ran a story about her under the derisive headline \\"A Queer Old Woman Thinks She Has a Mission to Perform.\\"Passet, 2006, p. 229. Waisbrooker spent a late phase of her career at the experimental community of Home, Washington. She arrived there early in 1901; local residents built her a small house.Charles Pierce LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885-1915, Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1975; p. 192.

Penhallow, were arrested and charged with disseminating obscene material -- the material in question being an article in Clothed with the Sun titled \\"The Awful Fate of Fallen Women.\\" A jury convicted Waisbrooker; a sympathetic judge sentenced her to the minimum penalty, a fine of $100. (Penhallow was acquitted, though the U.S. Post Office subsequently closed the Home post office.)LeWarne, pp. 183-5.

Life Tuttiett was born and brought up in Newport, Isle of Wight, the daughter of the surgeon Frank Bampfylde Tuttiett and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Gleed. Largely self-educated, in early adulthood she visited London, various other parts of England, and Yverdon-les-Bains in Switzerland;Maxwell Gray, Catherine Jane Hamilton, 1894, The Woman at Home, Warwick Magazine Co but for the majority of her working life as a writer suffered constant debilitating illness from asthma and rheumatismThe Oxford Companion to Edwardian Fiction, Sandra Kemp, Charlotte Mitchell, David Trotter, OUP Oxford, 2002‚Äîreports described her as \\"a confirmed invalid\\"‚Äîthat left her unable to leave her bed for more than two to three hours a day. She wrote lying on a sofa.Book News, National Book League, 134, vol 12, October 1893 For much of her life she lived and worked confined to her home in Newport, first at Pyle Street (where works up to The Last Sentence were written) then at Castle Road, only making occasional trips out by carriage or bath-chair. On one such trip she visited the American writer Wolcott Balestier, whose sister married Rudyard Kipling, when he and his family were staying at Blackgang. Her 1893 novel The Last Sentence was dedicated to Balestier after his early death. She was strongly interested in women's rights, being one of a number of writers who petitioned in support of the Women's Suffrage Bill,Advertisement, The Times, 15 June 1910 and such themes appear in a number of her novels.The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction, John Sutherland, Stanford University Press, 1990 After her father's death in 1895, she moved to West Richmond, remaining in London until her death in 1923, aged 76, at Ealing.Obituary, The Times, 22 September 1923 Works Mary Tuttiett began her literary career by contributing essays, poems, articles, and short stories to various periodicalsThe World's Greatest Books, Volume V., Arthur Mee and J.A. Hammerton, Eds., Internet Archive including Atalanta. Her first novel, The Broken Tryst, was published in 1879 to lukewarm reviews, but Tuttiett achieved critical and popular success with the 1886 The Silence of Dean Maitland (\\"a powerful and impressive story, which was appreciated both by critics and by the public\\"). This tells the story of a churchman who gets a young woman pregnant and kills her father in a fight, then allows the wrongful imprisonment of his friend for the manslaughter. On the eve of his accession to bishop, he is forced to face his guilt when that friend returns, released from prison on ticket of leave. The reader for the publisher Kegan Paul, Alfred Chenevix Trench, initially thought The Silence of Dean Maitland \\"a little too unorthodox\\" for his religious clientele, but on the second reading decided it was \\"too good to refuse\\".Mr. A. C. Trench Doyen of London Publishers, Obituary, The Times, 15 March 1938 The release saw a deal of speculation about the authorship, including theories that it has been written by a well-known ecclesiastic or the daughter of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The poet Tennyson praised the book, driving to Newport to meet Miss Tuttiett as her illness prevented her visiting him at his winter home near Freshwater.Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle, 28 July 1888 The Silence of Dean Maitland and a number of Mary Tuttiett's other novels are set in a fictionalised Isle of Wight, in which Newport, Calbourne, Swainstone, Brading and Arreton appear as \\"Oldport\\", \\"Malbourne\\", \\"Swaynestone\\", \\"Barling\\" and \\"Arden\\". She also wrote a number of poetry anthologies. In 1910, Arthur Mee and J.A. Hammerton's The World's Greatest Books said of The Silence of Dean Maitland that it had immediately and permanently established her name in the front rank of living novelists. The obituary in The Times described her works overall as \\"characterised by a delicate grace and charm, and generally suggested a serious purpose, but she can never be said to have equalled her first success\\". The Silence of Dean Maitland became a successful stage play, and was filmed three times: in 1914 by Raymond Longford,IMDb #0004595 in 1915 (under the title Sealed Lips) by John Ince,IMDb #0006014 and in 1934 in Australia by Ken G.

PaineWebber continued to use the Mitchell Hutchins brand until the company's sale to UBS in 2000. In 2001, the Mitchell Hutchins name was discontinued when it was merged as a subsidiary with UBS's Brinson Partners division. =Data Resources Inc.= In 1969 Marron co-founded Data Resources Inc. with Harvard University notable economist Otto Eckstein. DRI became the largest non- governmental source of economic data and, working with Eckstein's theory of core inflation, developed the largest macroecomonic model of its era.

His collection of post-war works spanning both the 20th and 21st centuries is inspired by his personal response to art and his conviction that good contemporary art reflects -- and great art anticipates -- societal trends. Under Marron's five-year term as President of the Museum of Modern Art's Board of Trustees in the late 1980s, the Museum's endowment more than doubled, growing from $26 million in 1985 to $59 million in 1990.Grace Glueck (April 24, 1991), Collector Is in Line To Head Modern The New York Times. As a Trustee, Marron oversaw the first expansion of the Museum Tower in 1984, in which MoMA more than doubled its gallery footprint, increased its curatorial department by 30 percent, and added an auditorium, two restaurants and a bookstore. MoMA's atrium is named the Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron Atrium, for Marron and his wife, in recognition of their contributions to the Museum's significant expansion efforts. While at PaineWebber, Marron personally directed the firm's acquisition of more than 850 post-1945 works by major American and European artists -- including Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Willem de Kooning, and Susan Rothenberg, among many others -- to create the PaineWebber Collection. In 2002, UBS PaineWebber promised MoMA 37 works, including paintings, drawings and sculpture by Andy Warhol (including Cagney, 1962), Roy Lichtenstein, Lucian Freud, and Jasper Johns. The donation was to be made over 15 years and was completed in 2017.Carol Vogel (April 11, 2002), The Modern Gets a Trove From Corporate Collection The New York Times.Roberta Smith (February 4, 2005), Corporate Taste in Art, and the Art of Donation The New York Times. =Non-profit and philanthropic work= In 2013, Marron provided the founding donation to launch the New York University Marron Institute of Urban Management.

It was named after James Henry Northrop who invented the shuttle-charging mechanism. Background James Henry Northrop, (8 May 1856 - 12 December 1940) was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, where he worked in the textile industry. He emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1881. Northrop worked as a mechanic and foreman, for George Draper and Sons. There he invented a spooler guide. He left and tried to be a chicken farmer, but was unsuccessful. It was at that time that he invented a shuttle-charger. Otis Draper saw a model of the device on March 5, 1889. Draper was also developing the Rhoades shuttle-charger. Northrop was given a loom to test his idea. By May 20 he concluded that his first idea was not practical, and thought of another idea, On July 5, the completed loom was running, and as it seemed to have more advantages than the Rhoades loom. The Northrop device was given a mill trial in October 1889 at the Seaconnett Mills in Fall River, Massachusetts. More looms were constructed and tested at Seaconnett later in 1889 and during 1890.Transactions of the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers, Issue 59, 1895 Northrop Battery Meanwhile, Northrop invented a self-threading shuttle and shuttle spring jaws to hold a bobbin by means of rings on the butt. This paved the way to his filling-changing battery of 1891, the basic feature of the Northrop loom. Northrop was responsible for several hundred weaving related patents. Other members of the Draper organization had developed a workable warp stop motion which was also included. The first Northrop looms were marketed in 1894. Northrop retired to California two years later when he was 42. Economics The principal advantage of the Northrop loom was that it was fully automatic; when a warp thread broke, the loom stopped until it was fixed. When the shuttle ran out of thread, Northrop's mechanism ejected the depleted pirn and loaded a new full one without stopping. A loom operative could work 16 or more looms whereas previously they could only operate eight. Thus, the labour cost was halved. Mill owners had to decide whether the labour saving was worth the capital investment in a new loom. By 1900, Draper had sold over 60,000 Northrop looms and were shipping 1,500 a month, were employing 2,500 men and enlarging their Hopedale works to increase that output. In all 700,000 looms were sold. By 1914, Northrop looms made up 40% of American looms. However, in the United Kingdom labour costs were not as significant and Northrop had only 2% of the British market. Northrops were especially suitable for coarse cottons, but it was said not particularly suitable for fines, thus the financial advantage in their introduction into Lancashire was not as great as it had been in the United States. Henry Philip Greg imported some of the first Northrops into Britain in 1902, for his Albert Mill in Reddish, and encouraged his brother Robert Alexander Greg to introduce Northrops into Quarry Bank Mill in 1909. Greg bought 94 looms and output increased from 2.31 lbs/man-hr in 1900, to 2.94 lbs/man-hr in 1914. Labour costs decreased from 0.9d per pound to 0.3d per pound. Draper's strategy was to standardise on a couple of models which they mass-produced. The lighter E-model of 1909 was joined in the 1930 by the heavier X-model. Continuous fibre machines, say for rayon, which was more break-prone, needed a specialist loom. This was provided by the purchase of the Stafford Loom Co. in 1932, and using their patents a third loom the XD, was added to the range. Because of their mass production techniques they were reluctant and slow to retool for new technologies such as shuttleless looms.

The line was approximately long and operated from 1896 through 1898.  Design  A train and station on the Ontario Southern Railway The Ontario Southern had a unique design. It was an early example of a monorail, consisting of a single running rail which was laid on top of a wood beam, with guide rails mounted on each side. The majority of the line was elevated 10 to 30 feet (3 to 9 meters) on wooden posts, giving rise to the nickname \\"the Peg-Leg Railway\\". The line also passed through one small tunnel under a road. The passenger carriages were open-sided and had a total of six benches in a back-to-back configuration. These were powered by batteries for the first two years of the line's operation. In the final year, a trolley wire was installed. Power to charge the batteries, and later to energize the trolley wire, came from a generator connected to a stationary steam engine located at the Crystal Beach end of the line.  Operation  The system nominally operated service at 15-minute intervals; however, its reliability was poor. The posts would sway in the soft ground, especially after heavy rains, and winter frosts shifted the posts, necessitating substantial maintenance each spring. In spite of the maintenance challenges facing the railway, no major accidents are known. The only known fatality was to a cow, struck by the battery case which hung beneath the car. Nevertheless, a lack of passengers made the line uneconomical. It was more a novelty than a viable means of transportation. The primary form of public conveyance to Crystal Beach was via steamship from Buffalo, New York, with the railway providing only a secondary service. Following the 1898 season, the railway was closed and dismantled.

Jake and Leah agree, but Jake changes his mind after seeing that Leah is wearing a necklace with exactly the same hamsa that his brother gave him. Dating from before Benjamin left home for college, the amulet reminds Jake of how much he loved his big brother. He pulls Leah aside and tells her that he doesn't want to deny his brother's existence, which is what he believes the halizah vow requires of him. After deciding that she wants to leave her mother's home, become independent, and start college, Leah agrees to Jake's alternate offer to marry him and move with him to Washington but maintain a platonic relationship. Jake is constantly busy with work at the hospital, his girlfriend Carol has little patience for his new \\"wife\\" and Leah adjusts to finding her way around a new city. But eventually, true love arises, and the two find that the greatest gift Benjamin has left them is each other.

Aarons that outlines a mother's experience in coming to terms with the suicide of her gay son. On January 24, 2009, the TV film Prayers for Bobby, an adaptation of the book starring Sigourney Weaver and Ryan Kelley in the title role as Bobby, was shown on the Lifetime cable network. Book summary This book illustrates the story of Mary Griffith and her ordeal with her gay son, Robert Warren, known as Bobby. Her Christian intolerance and hard-nosed indoctrination leads him to despise who he is and ultimately he dies by suicide in 1983. Mary begins to question her faith because Bobby had killed himself and wonders what will happen to his soul. After some soul-searching of her own, she comes to the harsh realization that nothing was wrong with Bobby in God's eyes. She later becomes an advocate for gay rights in memory of her son. This story contains excerpts of Bobby's diary throughout the book to illustrate his feelings and point of view. Development In 1989, Leroy Aarons read a newspaper story about a young man's suicide. Particularly striking to him was the mother, Mary Griffith, who had tried throughout her son's adolescence to \\"pray away\\" his \\"gay nature\\". At age 20, Bobby Griffith jumped to his death from a freeway bridge in Portland, Oregon. Mary was transformed by her loss and eventually renounced the rigid religious beliefs that had kept her from fully accepting Bobby during his lifetime. The Griffiths' story resonated with Aarons' own transformation as an openly gay journalist and activist. After Bobby's death, his mother became an iconic activist for the national association PFLAG, urging parents to understand and accept their children's homosexuality. \\"This extraordinary conversion touched me as deeply as the tale of Bobby's tragic death,\\" Aarons wrote. \\"What enabled her to transcend her background and perform what could only be described as acts of courage.\\" After leaving daily journalism in 1991, Aarons began to explore the Griffiths' stories in depth. Prayers for Bobby: A Mother's Coming to Terms with the Suicide of Her Gay Son -- Aarons' first book -- was published by HarperCollins in 1995.

According to Shelby, \\"I turned it down because I went to Lee Iacocca, and he told me not to take it because the domestic makers were going to push the Japanese back into the ocean.

They were the first special police units founded in Greece. They were created to lift the burden from other bodies of police and armed forces from involvement in riots, illegal gatherings and demonstrations. The MAT are known as \\"matatzides\\" () or \\"matades\\" (). The idea of creating them belongs to the junta-appointed Prime Minister Spyros Markezinis and the mandate to implement and create the first group was given in 1976 by the then Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis. The force was significantly augmented by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, to eventually three times the original size under the Costas Simitis government. During the 1980s, the MAT lost favor and were temporarily substituted by the \\"Special Mission Units\\" (ŒúŒøŒΩŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ ŒïŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒøŒªœéŒΩ, MEA).Ta Nea, 20/11/1985 Since the early 1990s however, they resumed their role as the primary riot control units of the Police.  History  Men of MAT Men of MAT The suppression of the demonstrations until the dictatorship was done by policemen or gendarmes, only with clubs, with the assistance of special vehicles of the fire brigade, while only in serious cases the army intervened. There was no tear gas (which was then unknown in Greece), in extreme cases, warning shots were fired in the air, and rarely against the crowd. The Athens riots of 1960 led to the first investigations of other means to disrupt a demonstration. Three police officers Ilias Psychogios, Georgios Sambanis, and Theodoros Harlaftis were sent for training to the United States. The first would be responsible for the education of the MAT several years later, while the second would become commander of the body. In his memoirs, Spyros Markezinis, junta-appointed Prime Minister in 1973, argues that if he had time to make the MAT, then the events of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which led to the downfall of the junta would have possibly been avoided. The MAT formed at the behest of Karamanlis shortly after the fall of the dictatorship, by ministerial order. The idea of their name belonged to the later Minister Anastasios Balkos. This unit consisted of 150 men from various subdivisions of Police, to whom later men of Special Forces troops were added. A second unit was created in Thessaloniki, while the Greek Gendarmerie manned a third for a period of time. These units were trained by Ilias Psychogios, according to his textbooks and experience from the training he had received in the US several years earlier. In 1978, after the unsuccessful intervention of the police at the home of anarchist doctor Vassilis Tsironis, which resulted in his death, the Special Mission Units (MEA) were created. After the rise of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement to power in 1981 MEA substituted MAT for some time. The MEA wore a brown-green uniform with turtleneck sweaters, but sometimes they appeared plainclothes. The MEA were abolished by the 1990-1993 New Democracy conservative government, because its officers were mostly PASOK supporters. In the 1990s, the group YMET were created as supportive in squads of MAT as well as the Group of Crime Prevention and Suppression (OPKE), similar to but more heavily equipped riot police and with more specialized training.  Equipment  The MAT have special equipment to suppress demonstrations. The main and most visible feature is the plexiglas shield. Attached by hand using leather belt on the inside of the elbow and grip on the palm. The clubs are rubber and of two types, one short and a longer one, which has internal strings which allow it to stretch when lowered, while to retract when raised in order to cause more pain. Sometimes the baton is used upside down (i.e., holding the rubber part with hold-out), to cause greater injury, which is illegal. The helmet is heavy and has a special visor to protect the neck and face. In the back of the helmet there are stickers stuck with characteristic color and shape (red or yellow triangle, square, etc.) for each squad, in order to easily identify and regroup. The uniform is a military type, usually in khaki/green color, but sometimes also blue. The first years after their creation, the MAT used the simple uniform of the Greek police. The MAT do not bear their identification number, or any other personal identification, and are thus not identifiable. In recent years, the MAT have been equipped with stockings, plastic material and other components that protect the torso of the body (mainly shoulders and arms) from hits. Each man also bears his service weapon, gas masks (in backpack hanging on the shoulder), a sufficient number of tear gas and flash-bangs, handcuffs. Some of the squad members have a fire each. One or two in each squad have a special tear gas spray (known as \\"bellows\\") and do not carry a shield. When the platoon is on hold or perform custodial tasks, riot the MAT wear black berets instead of helmets. The commanding officer of each squad does not bear all of the above equipment (shield, protective body) to be able to move easily and quickly in the field and have full oversight of the development of the company. Instead the officer has a radio and is in constant contact with the headquarters in the Police Department.

Life and career He was born in a peasant family in the village of Sveti Gregor (now in the Municipality of Ribnica in Lower Carniola), in what was then the Austrian Empire. His father died when he was a child. After finishing the state gymnasium in Ljubljana in 1884, he entered the Roman Catholic seminary. He was consecrated priest in 1888, and sent to the theological faculty in Vienna by the bishop Jakob Missia. There, he became acquainted with the new Austrian Christian Social movement of the charismatic politician Karl Lueger. Krek graduated in 1892, and was appointed vicar in the Ljubljana Cathedral. From 1985, he taught philosophy at the Catholic seminary. He soon became involved in politics within the conservative Slovene People's Party. In 1897, he was elected representative to the Austrian Parliament. In 1900, he decided not to run for a second turn. In 1901, he was elected representative in the Provincial Diet of Carniola. Already in his early Viennese years, Krek had published critical articles against liberalism. Influenced by the ultra- conservative thought of the Roman Catholic bishop of Krk Anton Mahniƒç, and by the encyclic Rerum novarum, he attacked the liberal economic system as being anti-social and anti-democratic. Between 1898 and 1907, Krek organized several peasant and worker's co-operatives, and transformed the Slovene People's Party from a conservative clerical party into a mass political movement propagating social emancipation on the basis of Catholic political ideology. As the result such mobilization, the People's Party won by landslide the first elections by general suffrage in Austria in 1907, gaining 20 of the 24 Slovene seats in the Austrian Parliament. Krek was among those elected. In the parliament, Krek proved to be a powerful orator. He proposed several measures for social welfare, but was frequently blocked by the conservative leadership of his own party, led by the powerful Ivan ≈†u≈°ter≈°iƒç. In 1909, Krek founded the Yugoslav Labor Association (Jugoslovanska strokovna zveza), which would become and remain the biggest trade union in the Slovene Lands until its dissolution in 1941. Already in the late 1890s, Krek convinced the Slovene People's Party to seek a close alliance with Ante Starƒçeviƒá's Croatian Party of Rights. Krek's aim was to establish a unified state of South Slavs within Austria-Hungary on the basis of the tradition of Croatian historical rights. Krek was a convinced supporter of the idea of the unity of South Slav peoples, and many later commentators, including the historian Lojze Ude and Communist politician Boris Kidriƒç, reproached him with \\"Slavic romanticism\\" and \\"Yugoslav nationalism\\". In 1917, Krek became the proposer and leader of the so-called May declaration (), which proposed the creation of a state of South Slavs under Habsburg rule. The declaration developed in a mass movement in the Slovene Lands, and Krek traveled extensively to Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to popularize the movement there, too. He died of exhaustion when returning from one of his travels. His ideals were realized only after his death and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, first with the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was buried in the ≈Ωale cemetery in Ljubljana.

It is often topped with dried onions, and occasionally poppy seeds. Onion rolls are popular in the Jewish world.http://www.cobblestonemill.com/CSM_Varieties/Variety.cfm?CategoryID=57&ProductID;=53 Overview Onion rolls are a small roll, originating in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe several hundred years ago. The rolls contain flour, water, eggs, oil, salt, yeast, sugar, dried onions, and often poppy seeds. Today they are most typically used for sandwiches by those in the Jewish community, although they are also used as a dinner roll and can be commonly found at Jewish delis and bakeries across North America and Israel. History=Early history= Onions rolls originated in the Ashkenazi Jewish community of Eastern Europe several hundred years ago, and were likely brought to America by Jewish refugees fleeing Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century (late 1800s). These refugees brought their traditional Jewish foods with them to their new homes in America, especially in New York City, which became a center of Jewish culture and was where the onion roll became most notable. =1908‚Äì2002= Onion rolls could be found at Jewish bakeries, restaurants, delicatessens, and markets around the United States and other places with a significant Jewish population. However most notably, the kosher dairy restaurant Ratner's opened in New York City‚Äôs Lower East Side neighborhood in 1908, and began serving its famous onion rolls soon after. These onion rolls became famous both within the Jewish community and among other New Yorkers as well. The restaurant opened several more locations but eventually, they all closed in 2002. At the restaurant‚Äôs peak up to 3,000 onion rolls were baked and served every day. =2002‚Äìpresent= According to Jewish American cookbook author and baker Stanley Ginsburg, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost impossible to find a decent onion roll.‚Äù, since the closing of Ratner‚Äôs in 2002 which prompted him to help write a cookbook, ‚ÄùInside the Jewish Bakery‚Äù, offering his version of an onion roll, and other classic Jewish breads and other baked goods. Onion rolls have since been featured in other Jewish baking cookbooks as well. The family that formerly owned Ratner's later published a book with a recipe for their original onion rolls after the restaurant's closing. Today onion rolls are most commonly found in supermarkets across the Northeastern United States, as well as the Los Angeles and Miami areas, due to their large Jewish populations. Onion rolls are sold by a variety of brands including Kasanoff‚Äôs, Miami Onion Roll Company, Ratner‚Äôs, Zomick‚Äôs, and others in stores across the country. Onion rolls are also still found in Jewish bakeries and dairy restaurants in the United States, as well as Israel. Usage Onion rolls are often served at kosher dairy restaurants as part of the bread basket that is presented to every table, and are often paired with butter. They are also used to make sandwiches. Along with that, they are an alternative to the plain hamburger bun. Of course, many choose to eat onion rolls plain as well. In popular culture Onions rolls are a popular bread in Jewish culture, particularly the American Jewish culture of New York City, where they are commonly served at Jewish bakeries, delis, kosher markets and restaurants. They have also been featured in popular culture. Onions rolls were the most famous food served at the popular, but now-closed Ratner's restaurant in New York‚Äôs Lower East Side, a kosher restaurant only offering foods made with dairy. Ratner's was an iconic Jewish restaurant in the city for many decades, and it‚Äôs onion rolls were very popular among its clientele, some of whom still remember them and attempt to recreate them to this day. According to the restaurant's cookbook, the winner and undisputed champion at Ratner's was its famous onion rolls which were featured on every table with every meal served at the restaurant. More than 1500 onion rolls were baked daily, 3000 on Sundays. Onion rolls were featured in the 2000 movie, \\"Boiler Room\\" where the main character Seth, (Giovanni Ribisi) has a meal with his family. An exterior shot shows the front of the restaurant.

Geography Mana Pass is located within the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, 24 km north of the town of Mana, India and 52 km north of the Hindu pilgrimage town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand. It is the source of the Saraswati River, the longest stem of one of the longest Ganges tributaries, the Alaknanda River. That river trickles through several scenic small ponds between the pass and Lake Deo Tal three km southwest of the pass. Mana pass is also the key col for climbing Chaukhamba peak. Mana as a name derives from \\"Manibhadra Ashram\\", the ancient name of the town of Mana. History Mana Pass was an ancient trade route between Uttarakhand and Tibet. Mana Pass led from Badrinath to the kingdom, now province, of Guge in Tibet. The Portuguese Jesuits Ant√≥nio de Andrade and Manuel Marques became the first known Europeans to enter Tibet across Mana Pass in 1624. The pass continued as a minor trade route until its closure in 1951 by the Chinese. On April 29, 1954, China and India signed an agreement granting pilgrims and indigenous travelers the right to travel between the two countries through Mana Pass. Access The pass is reached from the south by an extension of India National Highway 7 (NH-7, old number NH-58) that connects Fazilka with Badrinath, though beyond Badrinath the graded road is subject to landslides.

Sometimes briye (chicken or beef stock) is used in the preparation. Origins Kasha varnishkes are part of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. Jews from Eastern Europe brought the food to America and it is widely popular in the American Jewish community. The name and the dish varnishkes as a whole seems to be a Yiddish adaptation of the Ukrainian vareniki (varenyky, stuffed dumplings). Buckwheat came to Ukraine and became one of the most common fillings of Ukrainian dumplings. This dish was enhanced by emigrating Jews in the Ashkenazic manner. A recipe from 1925 shows kashe-filled dumplings, rather than the simpler kashe with farfalle. This 1925 recipe is indicative of the dish‚Äôs origins.

The company started in the early 1970s with audio products, then expanded to personal computers and other electronics. Although it was the largest company of its kind in the region, it became defunct in the mid-1980s. Schaak Electronics was originally an audio-related products company headed by Richard L. (Dick) Schaak which expanded to personal computers (Digital Den) and other consumer electronics from the early 1970s to about 1986, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Schaak Electronics had its origins in a small radio and television repair shop in South Minneapolis, begun in 1957 by Leander Schaak. In 1960, his son Richard, known as Dick, dropped out of school and began working for his father. Dick soon took over the business when Leander died unexpectedly that October. As Dick Schaak learned the business, he began advertising and focusing on audio equipment. By 1971, he had expanded the business to ten stores, including one in St. Cloud and one in Rochester, in addition to eight in the Twin Cities. Two years later he had stores in Milwaukee and Chicago. The Jaycees named him one of ten outstanding young men in Minnesota in 1972.http://mnjaycees.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/past- recipients-updated-11-10.pdf In 1972, Schaak Electronics, Inc., had its initial public offering of shares; Dick Schaak controlled about 80% of the stock. At that time the company was described as a retail seller of audio equipment for home and office use.https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1972/dig083172.pdf In 1973, Dick Schaak engineered a dramatic change in the company. The Tandy Corporation had been ordered to divest itself of Allied Radio. With the opportunity to buy not only 8 Allied stores in Chicago, but 19 in other locations, he made the acquisition and Schaak Electronics was now double its original size. By December, 1974, Schaak Electronics was advertising on local Twin Cities air waves, broadcasting at least two different radio commercials on KTCR-FM with a character named Uncle Allie talking to his nephew Timmy.http://www.twincitiesradioairchecks.com/ktcrfmairchecks.html These two characters also appeared in a Schaak Electronics - Allied Radio catalog during the mid-1970s. But the expansion proved to be too much, especially in the context of economic recession in the US. Schaak Electronics lost money in 1974, in spite of significant sales increases. The pattern continued in 1975 with even more sales and even more money lost. In spite of efforts to control costs by closing some stores, Schaak Electronics filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the spring of 1975. A two-year battle with creditors ensued, including American National Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. By 1976, issues with the banks were resolved and the company returned to profitability. By 1978, creditors had been repaid and profitability continued to grow. In 1977 they opened their fifteenth location at Burnsville Center in Burnsville, Minnesotahttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/186825056.

The Freeport of Monrovia awarded Operations Contract to APM Terminal to handle port operations, which includes container handling, cargo handling, and marine. As of 2011, a One-Stop Shop has been established at the Port to make it expedite Shipping and Clearing Procedures. Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, and Central Bank have set up sub stations at the Port to expedite the process. Establishment Shipping and clearing procedures at NPA An act of Legislature established the National Port Authority in 1967 (amended in 1970) as a state-owned enterprise to manage, plan and develop all ports in Liberia. The Authority manages four ports, namely, the Freeport of Monrovia, the Port of Buchanan, the Port of Greenville and the Port of Harper. The Freeport of Monrovia is the largest in the Authority's Network. The United States Military built the port during World War II for strategic purposes. It handles most of the country's imported cargoes. Two breakwaters, 2,359m and 2,200m long, protect the harbour, enclosing a basin of 300 hectares of protected water. The general cargo berth, (the main pier), consists of an opened piled, 610m long by 11m wide marginal wharf with a reinforced concrete deck. The main wharf serves 2nd and 3rd generation coastal and mainline vessel. The Port of Buchanan is located 170miles South-east of Monrovia. The Liberia-American Swedish Company (LAMCO), a joint venture company, constructed the port in 1960 for the export of iron ore deposits of the Nimba Range. Two break waters, 1,890m and 590m long to protect the harbour. Inside the basin, a 225m long ore-loading quay is located to the deeper section of the harbour basin with a water depth of 12.95m below chart datum. Adjacent to the loading quay, a waiting berth for ore carrier is available. On the inner side of the secondary breakwater, a commercial quay 334m long is located with an available water depth of 10.15m below chart datum. The access channel to the port provides ship a water depth of 14.95m below chart datum and a channel width between the breakwaters of 210m. The Port of Greenville is also located in the South-eastern region of the country, Sinoe County, about 421 miles from the Freeport of Monrovia. A 400m long breakwater protects the harbour. There are two quays (70m and 180m long respectively) on the inner side of the breakwater for berthing facilities, with an existing water depth of 6m below chart datum. The port was rehabilatated in the early eighties with loan from the German Development Fund. The port functions mainly as an outlet for the timber industry. The Port of Harper is situated in the South-eastern region of Liberia, Maryland County, near the border with the Ivory Coast, about 476 miles from the Freeport of Monrovia. The Port was constructed in 1959, on the rocky Russwurn Island, by connecting the island to the mainland with a causeway and by constructing a 150m long breakwater off the Russwurn Island. A 100m long reinforced concrete pier with an available water depth of 5.50m provides berthing facilities. The port serves the timber industry of the South-eastern hinterland. Port of Monrovia World Food Program employees offload humanitarian aid at the Freeport of Monrovia in 2003. The largest port in the authority's network, Freeport of Monrovia was built by the United States military during World War II for strategic purposes. It handles most of the authority's imported cargo, some of which are transshipped to other Liberian ports and to third countries. The Freeport of Monrovia consists of an artificial harbor formed by two-rock breakwater approximately 2,300 meters out into the open sea, which encompass some 300 hectares of protected water. The coastline between the breakwater is dredged to accommodate oceangoing vessels and ore carriers (up to 100,000 dwt) and a marginal wharf of 610 metres long is capable of berthing 3‚Äì4 ships according to their size. The port is connected with Monrovia by an access road(four lanes approximately 1.5 kilometres long with two connecting bridges over the Mesurraddo River, of which one is out of use. From the seaside, the vessels enter the harbour basin through an entrance channel approximately 2,000 m long and 180 m wide. The central part of the port area is occupied by two iron ore companies (NIOC and Bong Mines) that previously operated their own facilities but have since folded up operations. A crude oil mooring station is located between the iron ore piers. The general cargo wharf located south of this central area, is entirely operated by NPA which provides all onshore services and facilities to the users. The former Liberia Mining Company (LMC) pier which is not operational except for use by local fishing trawlers is situated at the northern end of the General Cargo wharf. There is 500 m long oil jetty for refined products situated alongside the southern breakwater approximately 450 m off the coastline and it is connected to the tank farms by pipelines. The back of the Freeport is occupied by the port warehouses and shed s and also by private bonded warehouses. Port of Buchanan The Port of Buchanan is located some 272 kilometers South-East of Monrovia. It constructed in 1960 by the Liberian-American Swedish Mining Corporation (LAMCO), a joint venture company, to export the iron ore deposits of the Nimba range. The Harbor is protected by two breakwaters, 1890 and 590 long respectively. Inside the basin, a 255 meters long ore loading quay is located adjacent to the deeper section of the harbor basin, providing a water depth of 12.95m below chart datum. Adjacent to the loading quay, a waiting berth for ore carriers is available.

He spent most of the 1952 season in the reserves and was a member of their premiership team but also made five appearances in the seniors. From 1953 he was a regular in the Essendon side, kicking 32 goals in 1954 and playing in the 1957 Grand Final loss to Melbourne. Earlier in 1957, he was involved in some controversy when in a game against that year's premiers he was penalised for kicking the ball out of bounds deliberately, after a tackle from Ron Barassi.

Their second record, It's Great to Be Alive, was released through Side One Dummy Records on February 17, 2009. Their third record Real Ghosts Caught On Tape was released September 21, 2010, also on Sideonedummy. The band broke up in 2014. Biography=History and background= Fake Problems was created by Chris Farren, Derek Perry, Casey Lee, and Sean Stevenson in 2005. Farren was in another band at the time, but he wanted to expand his creativity and write different music. All of the band members grew up in Naples and have known each other since they were about 14 years old.Artist of the Day: Fake Problems  Spin Magazine Online The members have been able to make the band a full-time obligation by allowing for a relentless touring schedule. Stevenson gave up an opportunity to go to Berklee College of Music in Boston for film scoring. Members Lee and Perry also had a side project called Stay & Fight, which has now dissolved. The band released music videos for two songs from It's Great to Be Alive: \\"The Dream Team\\" and \\"Diamond Rings.\\" Diamond Rings was also featured on the third episode of Season 1 of NBC's \\"Trauma.\\" They've also released a video from their latest record, which has been heavily featured on MTV. In 2012, Fake Problems announced that Casey Lee was leaving the band. Lee was temporarily replaced by Brian Blount of Vega Under Fire. =Music style and influences= Fake Problems is heavily influenced by several genres of music, including emo, indie rock, and country music. In various older songs mandolin, violin, lap- steel/slide guitar, and brass horns can be heard along with the guitars and drums. The band claims that they have been influenced by Look Mexico, Cursive, Bright Eyes, Amon D√º√ºl II, and The Good Life. =Tours= To date, they have toured with Against Me!, The Gaslight Anthem, Into It.

They were scheduled to play a show in Sarasota, Florida and had arrived a few hours early. Before their set, they had climbed a strip mall roof. As they were climbing off the roof, police entered the parking lot. The band members were arrested and were held until they received bail at about 2:00 am the following morning. The court ordered them to take anger management classes.

It is a series of parables about one man's attempt to preserve traditional African culture on a terraformed utopia. The prologue and eight chapters of the book were each originally sold as a short story (or novelette or novella, depending on length) but were designed to fit together into a novel that builds to a climax with a coda afterward. The book and its chapters are among the most honored in science fiction history with 67 awards and nominations including two Hugo Awards.Hugo Award for Best Short Story 1989 and Hugo Award for Best Novelette 1991. The Author's Afterword in the novel lists 57 awards and nominations. Each section begins with a parable illustrating the relationship between Ngai, the Kikuyu god, and the creatures of the earth. On occasion, it is the narrator that has failed to properly understand the meaning of the story. Plot summary Prologue: One Perfect Morning, With JackalsIn Kenya, a son argues with his father whether it is possible to adopt European conveniences and customs and still be a true Kikuyu, the dominant native tribe. The father will be the mundumugu (witch doctor) for the new Kikuyu society on a terraformed planetoid named Kirinyaga. On the way to the spaceport, they detour to see a pair of jackals hiding behind a bush in an area that will become a nature preserve. KirinyagaKoriba kills a newborn child because traditional beliefs dictate that it is a demon. He must then convince Maintenance, the people who maintain the environment and regulate the orbit of the planetoid Kirinyaga, not to interfere with their traditions, no matter how much they dislike them. For I Have Touched the SkyA girl finds a falcon with a broken wing and asks the mundumugu to heal it. \\"Once a bird has touched the sky,\\" Koriba explains, \\"he can never be content to spend his days on the ground.\\"Resnick, Mike (1998). Kirinyaga, p.35. Balantine Publishing Group, New York. She persists. In the course of doing chores in exchange for help treating the bird, she discovers Koriba‚Äôs computer and the knowledge it can share. This creates conflict with the role held by women in the traditional Kikuyu society. BwanaKoinnage, the paramount chief, hires a hunter to reduce the hyena population. The hunter‚Äôs idea of utopia differs radically from Koriba‚Äôs. The mundumugu must demonstrate that, although the Kikuyu are a farming society, they are not powerless against predators. The ManamoukiA married couple immigrate to Kirinyaga. Although they try to assimilate, they bring modern ideas that conflict with traditional Kikuyu culture. Can a utopia evolve? Song of a Dry RiverA grandmother refuses to be cared for in the traditional manner and sets up residence near the mundumugu, who lives apart from the village. The mundumugu threatens a drought unless she follows tradition. The Lotus and the SpearThree young men have died in unusual circumstances. The mundumugu must find and overcome the cause. A Little KnowledgeKoriba is training Ndemi as his successor. Eventually he begins to instruct him on the use of the computer. But, as in the Garden of Eden, knowledge is a dangerous thing. When the Old Gods Die\\"It is said that from the moment of birth, even of conception, every living thing has embarked upon an inevitable trajectory that culminates in its death... Yet this knowledge does not lessen the pain of death.\\"Kirinyaga p. 230 For a man intent on maintaining the traditional ways, cultural change may not represent life but the death of the old gods. Epilogue: The Land of NodKoriba returns to Kenya. There, the old ways don‚Äôt mesh well with modern city living. When he visits a cloned elephant that is to be killed in a few days' time, Koriba realizes that they are both anachronisms, and that their fates are intertwined.

Retrieved 31 January 2009. Julio Argentino Roca (1843‚Äì1914) was an army general who served as President of Argentina from 1880 to 1886 and again from 1898 to 1904. While in the army, he applied ruthless measures to subdue or destroy the Indian communities of the Pampas, and it was these successes that led to his first election as president shortly after suppressing an attempted revolution by Carlos Tejedor. =Monument to Juan Manuel de Rosas= Juan Manuel de Rosas The Monument to Juan Manuel de Rosas was inaugurated on November 8, 1999. Is located in Intendente Seeber square, Palermo neighbourhood. The monument was created by Ricardo Dallia Lasta. Has a major monument to Juan Manuel de Rosas, surrounded by a high fence. Juan Manuel de Rosas (1793‚Äì1877), ruled Argentina from 1829 to 1852. Rosas was one of the first famous caudillos in Ibero-America and through his rule united Argentina, provided an efficient government and strengthened the economy. =Monument to General San Martin= General San Martin This monument to General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is in the Plaza San Mart√≠n. It was created by Louis-Joseph Daumas in 1862. San Mart√≠n (1778‚Äì1850), was the prime leader of the southern part of South America's successful struggle for independence from Spain. He is the national hero of Argentina. Official Buildings=Cabildo= Buenos Aires Cabildo. The Cabildo building was used as the government house during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate. The original building was finished in 1610 but was soon found to be too small and had to be expanded. Over the years many changes have been made. In 1940, the architect Mario Buschiazzo reconstructed the colonial features of the Cabildo using various original documents. Currently, the Cabildo hosts the National Museum of the Cabildo and the May Revolution (Museo Nacional del Cabildo y la Revoluci√≥n de Mayo), in which paintings, artifacts, clothes and jewellery of the 18th century are on display. The patio of the Cabildo still has its 1835 ornamental water well. =Casa Rosada= The Casa Rosada from the north The Casa Rosada (\\"Pink House\\") is the official seat of the executive branch of the Argentine government. The Casa Rosada sits at the eastern end of the Plaza de Mayo, a large square which since the 1580 foundation of Buenos Aires has been surrounded by many of the most important political institutions of the city and of Argentina. The site, originally at the waterline of the R√≠o de la Plata, was first occupied by the \\"Fort of Juan Baltazar of Austria,\\" a structure built on the orders of the founder of Buenos Aires, Captain Juan de Garay, in 1594. Its 1713 replacement by a masonry structure (the \\"Castle of San Miguel\\") complete with turrets made the spot the effective nerve center of colonial government. Following independence, President Bernardino Rivadavia had a Neoclassical portico built at the entrance in 1825, and the building remained unchanged until, in 1857, President Justo Jos√© de Urquiza ordered the fort demolished in favor of a new customs building, built under the direction of British Argentine architect Edward Taylor. The Italianate structure was Buenos Aires' largest building from 1859 until the 1890s.\\"Museum of the Casa Rosada: history\\" =Metropolitan Cathedral= Main fa√ßade of the Cathedral. The Metropolitan Cathedral () is the main Catholic church in Buenos Aires. It is located in the city centre, overlooking Plaza de Mayo, on the corner of San Mart√≠n and Rivadavia streets, in the San Nicol√°s neighbourhood. It is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires. The Cathedral of Buenos Aires was rebuilt several times since its humble origins in the 16th century. The present building is a mix of architectural styles, with an 18th-century nave and dome and a severe, 19th century Neoclassical fa√ßade without towers. The interior keeps precious 18th century statues and altarpieces, as well as abundant Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque decoration.Official site of the Archbishop of Buenos Aires =Museo de Arte Hispano Fern√°ndez Blanco= This museum of art is on Suipacha, in the Retiro neighborhood, in a large house built in the 1920s by architect Mart√≠n Noel in a neo-colonial style. The Buenos Aires town council bought the house in 1936, along with the art collection, which became the basis of the \\"Museo de Arte Colonial\\" that opened there a year later. In 1943, Isaac Fern√°ndez Blanco donated his collection to the museum, and in 1947 the museum was given its current name. The legacy of the Fern√°ndez Blanco is considered one of the most important in Spanish American art, including silverware from Peru, and from de R√≠o de la Plata; Peruvian and Cuzco paintings; Jesuit and Quito images, Brazilian furniture and decorative arts.\\"Museo de Arte Hispano Fern√°ndez Blanco\\" =National Congress= National Congress Building The National Congress () building is the seat of the legislative branch of the government of Argentina. It is situated at the end of Avenida de Mayo, at the other end of which is located the Casa Rosada. Designed by the Italian architect Vittorio Meano, the building was under construction between 1898 and 1906 when it was precariously opened, to be later finished by Julio Dormal. As time went by, the building proved too small for its purpose, and in 1974 the construction of the Edificio Anexo, which now holds the deputies' offices, was started. In front of the building lies the Square of Congress () which is popular with tourists, as well as a preferred location for protestors and those who want to voice their opinion about Congress activities. =National Library= The National Library, designed in 1961 by Clorindo Testa, Francisco Bullrich and Alicia Cazzaniga. The National Library () is the largest library in Argentina and one of the most important in the Americas. It is located in the barrio of Recoleta and viewed as an example of brutalist architecture. Originally named the Public Library of Buenos Aires and founded in September 1810 by decree of the first Government Junta of the May Revolution first Government Junta, it later became the country's only national library when it redefined its mission in 1884 and formally changed its name to the National Library of Argentina.

The palace contains many works of art by Argentine and American artists from the 20th century, such as Antonio Berni, Pablo Curatela Manes, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, and Roberto Matta. Other Buildings=Club de Pescadores= Club de Pescadores, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Club de Pescadores (\\"Fisherman's Club\\") is situated on the banks of the R√≠o de la Plata in Costanera Norte Avenue. In 1926 a plan was initiated to construct a pier with a building on it to house the social activities of the club. This received presidential consent in 1928 and construction of the pier was completed in 1930. The building on the pier, still in existence today, was designed by Jos√© N. Quartino and officially opened on 16 January 1937 in the presence the Argentina president General Agust√≠n P. Justo. Declared a national historic monument in 2001, the building has become an icon of the city of Buenos Aires.Official Website of Club de Pescadores =Confiter√≠a El Molino= Old El Molino Coffeehouse. The Confiter√≠a El Molino is an Art Nouveau style coffeehouse located on the corner of Callao Av. and Rivadavia Av., in front of the Argentine National Congress. In 1915 Cayetano Brenna, a famous confectioner, commissioned the Italian architect Francisco Gianotti, to design the building that would house the caf√© on its ground floor. When finished in 1917 the building, which was on the site of an existing caf√©, was one of the highest buildings in the city with a corner turret which was illuminated from the inside with electric light, stained glass windows and windmill sails. El Molino and Galer√≠a G√ºemes were two of Gianotti's greatest works and represent important examples of Art Nouveau style architecture in Buenos Aires. Over the years El Molino became a favourite meeting place for the rich and famous. The caf√© closed on February 23, 1997 and today is only rarely opened to the public for events designed to advertise the urgent need to restore the building before its final disintegration. In 1997 El Molino was declared a National Historic Monument. =Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico= Frescos in the cupola of Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico. The central panel in the image was painted by Antonio Berni. The Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico is a shopping mall located on Florida Street, at the junction with C√≥rdoba Avenue. The Beaux Arts building was designed by the architects Emilio Agrelo and Roland Le Vacher in 1889 to accommodate a shop called the Argentine Bon March√©, modelled on the Le Bon March√© in Paris. In 1945 the building was remodelled by architects Jos√© Aslan and H√©ctor Ezcurra, and the offices were separated from the rest of the building. A large central cupola was constructed and decorated with 12 frescos by artists Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Antonio Berni, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Manuel Colmeiro and Demetrio Urruch√∫a. These frescos, executed in 1946, are some of the most important in Buenos Aires. After having been abandoned for years, the building was renovated by Juan Carlos L√≥pez and Associates and re-opened in 1990 as the shopping arcade Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico. Four more frescos by Romulo Maccio, Josefina Robirosa, Guillermo Roux and Carlos Alonso were added to the cupola. In addition to the shopping arcade the building also contains the Jorge Luis Borges Cultural Centre and the Julio Bocca Dance Studio.Official website of Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico =Kavanagh building= Kavanagh building through San Mart√≠n Square's jacarand√°s The Kavanagh Building () is located at 1065 Florida St. in the barrio of Retiro, overlooking Plaza San Mart√≠n. It was constructed in the 1930s in the Rationalist style, by the architects Gregorio S√°nchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis Mar√≠a de la Torre and was finished in 1936. The building is characterised by the austerity of its lines, the lack of external ornamentation and its large prismatic volumes. It was declared a national historical monument in 1999,'El Kavanagh, entre los protegidos', Clar√≠n, 1999-04-23 and is one of the most impressive architectural masterpieces of Buenos Aires. Standing at a height of 120 m, it still retains its impact against the modern skyline of the city. In 1939 its fa√ßade received an award from the American Institute of Architects.Edificio Kavanagh =Palacio Barolo= Palacio Barolo Palacio Barolo is a 22-story office building located at 1370 Avenida de Mayo. The Italian architect Mario Palanti was commissioned to design the building by the empresario Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who had arrived in Argentina in 1890 and had made a fortune in knitted fabrics. The basic design, in Eclectic style, was conceived simultaneously with one for the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay. The Palacio Barolo was designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's Divine Comedy, motivated by the architect's admiration for Alighieri. When completed in 1923 it was the tallest building, not only in the city, but also in the whole of South America. It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the Kavanagh Building took over this title. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay.Palacio Barolo Website =Teatro Col√≥n= Teatro Col√≥n The Teatro Col√≥n (Columbus Theatre) opened in 1908 and is one of the World's major opera houses. The present theatre, the second with that name, opened in 1908 after twenty years under construction. The auditorium is horseshoe-shaped, has 2,487 seats (slightly more than, say, the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London, England), standing room for 1,000 and a stage which is 20 m wide, 15 m high and 20 m deep.Official site of the Teatro Colon The acoustics are considered one of the best five acoustics in opera in the world.

He was born in southern France in the town of Saint-Affrique, department of Aveyron. The year of his birth is somewhat uncertain, some sources claiming 1811 but his tomb at Prairie du Chien, WI, bearing the date December 17, 1812. In the 1830s, people were settling across the Minnesota River (at the time called Saint Pierre by the French and St. Peter by the British and Americans) from Fort Snelling in the area of Mendota, Minnesota. Mathias Loras, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dubuque, Iowa learned of these settlers and journeyed up the Mississippi River to visit the settlers in the area. He wrote to his sister that \\"the Catholics of St. Peters amounted to one hundred and eighty five.\\" The bishop saw a need to send a missionary to the area the next year. Galtier spoke little English when he arrived in 1840. Galtier eventually learned that a number of settlers, who had left the Red River Colony, had settled on the east bank of the Mississippi River. He decided that the area with the settlers, in what is now downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, was a better location for a church. The location was near a steamboat landing, which had the potential for later development. Two French settlers offered a location for a church, and other settlers provided materials and labor to build a log chapel. Father Galtier wrote, \\"I had previously to this time fixed my residence at Saint Peter's and as the name of Paul is generally connected with that of Peter... I called it Saint Paul.\\" The area had previously been known as Pig's Eye (French: L'≈íil du Cochon), in association with pioneer Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant. The name of \\"Pig's Eye\\" came about by accident when a customer at Parrant's tavern mailed a letter with the return address of \\"Pig's Eye\\". Since everyone in the area knew Parrant, the response to the letter was delivered to Parrant's establishment. The area became known as Saint Paul's Landing, and a few years after a post office was established in 1846, later became Saint Paul. Saint Peter's Church in Mendota Jean Baptiste Faribault gave Galtier a small log house in Mendota. Galtier used one corner of it as a bedroom and used the rest of it as a chapel. In 1842, following the collapse of the house, the settlers at Mendota built a more permanent chapel. The church, now known as Saint Peter's Church, is the oldest Catholic church in Minnesota. Much of the material were donated by Catholic men that Galtier had visited in logging camps on the Chippewa River. Galtier discovered that many of the Indians in the area were good singers, so he taught them to sing several songs that had been translated into the Sioux language. Galtier also conducted missionary trips to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, Hudson, Wisconsin, St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, the new church in St. Paul, and traveled as far south as Lake Pepin. In 1840, Galtier became ill as a result of \\"bilious fever\\" and the hard work necessary to minister in a frontier area. He was treated in the military hospital at Fort Snelling, staying there two months. In May 1844, Bishop Loras transferred him to Keokuk, Iowa, where he remained only for a few months, long enough to build the first Catholic church in that location. Galtier returned to Dubuque and subsequently traveled back to France without his bishop's permission, intending to quit the Dubuque Diocese for good due to his disagreements with Mathias Loras. Following an absence of two years from America, Galtier joined the Diocese of Milwaukee in 1847 and served at St. Gabriel's Parish in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he remained until his death in 1866. The white marble tomb of the priest can be seen in front of St. Gabriel's Church. Cray Plaza in downtown Saint Paul was originally named after him,Galtier Plaza as is the Galtier Society, a faith formation and service organization within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.Galtier Society - About Us ReferencesFurther reading * Luban, Marianne, Lucien Galtier-Pioneer Priest, Second Edition, Pacific Moon Publications, 2011.

During the Battle of Carrhae, Megabocchus is among those who ride with young Crassus on a last desperate cavalry foray. Plutarch says he was about Publius's age, distinguished for his courage and strength. After sustaining heavy casualties, the Romans and their Gallic auxiliaries retreat to a sand dune, where hope is soon lost under the constant barrage of Parthian arrows.

The Center showcases a broad spectrum of performing arts for the benefit of a wide-ranging audience at affordable prices. The Patchogue Theatre as a full-time mixed-use venue, offering a variety of events including live performances, films, educational presentations, commercial productions, community forums, and other appropriate events. History The Patchogue Theatre opened on May 23, 1923, as perhaps the largest and most magnificent theater on Long Island, Ward and Glynne‚Äôs theatre, as it was called then, was described as ‚Äúpalatial‚Äù and ‚Äúmagnificent in its interior decorations and appointments.‚Äù For the first half dozen years, the theatre hosted first-run feature films, Broadway productions, vaudeville and the best in burlesque. In 1929 the Theatre was sold to Prudential Theater Circuit and it remained a movie house for the next forty plus years. In 1958, a fire destroyed the lobby, so a new, much smaller lobby was built and three storefronts were added to the front of the building along Main Street. In 1980, United Artists bought the building, and converted it to a three-theatre ‚ÄúMultiplex‚Äù. This was the beginning of the era that saw single screen theaters give way to more and more screens in one place. The conversion of the Patchogue Theatre into a triplex destroyed much of the interior as plaster columns were smashed, sheetrock and wallpaper were installed over the original walls, and new lower ceilings replaced the magnificent interior. Unfortunately, the theatre went out of business several years later and stood empty, forlorn, derelict and almost forgotten for over a decade. In 1997, the Patchogue Village Board made the decision to purchase the theatre for the Village of Patchogue. Several local businessmen came up with the initial funds to purchase the theatre and the village applied for grants to renovate and restore the building to its former glory. The three empty storefronts were torn down. Where they stood, a brick walkway to the parking lots was built and a new building was constructed that is now a restaurant. The small theater lobby was replaced by a much larger one, featuring a mahogany bar and Art Deco style bathrooms. The old exterior brick was cleaned up and the new buildings had new brick fronts. The theatre interior was restored to its 1923 grandeur in several phases as the theatre was open for business.

The film is the third in the Kickboxer franchise with only Sasha Mitchell and Dennis Chan returning from the previous films. It was also the last film to feature Dennis Chan as Xian Chow and first entry into the series to be released direct-to-video. Plot The movie opens with a distressed woman being chased through a tropical forest by an unknown pursuer. It is soon revealed that the woman is attempting to escape from Frank Lane, an American running an illegal child sex ring operation in Brazil. Upon being recaptured, she is taken back to Lane's home and executed in front of the other slaves, as punishment for her actions. Meanwhile, kickboxing champion David Sloane and his trainer Xian arrive in Rio de Janeiro for a championship bout. Though Xian is mostly interested in training for the upcoming fight, David dismisses the idea in favor of relaxing in the city. While eating lunch, their camera is suddenly stolen by a young thief, and David gives chase. After fending off a pair of drunken assailants, he catches up to the boy who then brandishes a knife, but David easily disarms him and takes back the camera. When the boy, Marcos, follows him back to the restaurant to reclaim the knife, Xian invites both him and his beautiful sister Isabella to join them for lunch, and they eventually become friends. At a charity kickboxing event, David is asked to be the cornerman for another young fighter in an exhibition match against Eric Martine, an Argentine kickboxer managed by Lane, who also happens to be David's opponent for the upcoming championship fight. However, the aggressive Martine brutally beats the young fighter, prompting David to physically intervene on his behalf. As a result, David's bout with Martine is billed as a grudge match. Lane apologizes to David for Martine's actions and invites him to a party he is hosting. David attends the party with Marcos and Isabella as his personal guests. Upon meeting her, Lane becomes infatuated with Isabella. When David parts ways with the children for the night, Lane secretly sends out a group of men to kidnap her. In a panic, Marcos asks for David's help. They file a police report, but with an overwhelming backlog of unsolved cases on their hands, the authorities do not consider their case a priority and advise them to simply forget about Isabella. Undeterred, David and Xian launch their own investigation, which ultimately leads to their arrest. Although Lane bails them out in an attempt to cover his tracks, the two continue their search, only to find that the trail leads right back to him. They confront Lane in his home but are ambushed and taken prisoner. Lane forces David through a series of grueling exercises designed to weaken him before his match with Martine, such as hiking with a backpack full of rocks and water-skiing without skis. He then releases both men back to their hotel, with the condition that if David doesn't show up for the fight, Isabella will disappear forever. With Marcos' help, Xian is able to create and administer a cure for David's fatigue. At the fight, David manages to defeat Martine, and Xian is successful in rescuing Isabella before Lane can flee the arena, leaving Lane bankrupt. Upon being reunited with Marcos, Isabella tells him about the other girls Lane has imprisoned, and David resolves to free them as well. In retaliation, Lane pulls a gun on David, but Marcos suddenly appears and stabs Lane in the stomach with his knife. In the end, the police sergeant decides to cover up Lane's murder, and David arranges for Marcos and Isabella to attend school. Upon realizing that they have missed their flight back home, David, Xian, and the police sergeant decide to go out for drinks together.

His gens name was almost certainly Marcius, and he may have been the son of the Gaius Marcius Censorinus who was monetalis around 88 BC.Claude Eilers, \\"The Date of Augustus' Edict on the Jews (Jos. AJ 16.162‚Äì165) and the Career of C. Marcius Censorinus,\\" Phoenix 58 (2004), p. 92. If so, his father and uncle Lucius were staunch supporters of the popularist faction of Cinna.Michael Lovano, The Age of Cinna (Franz Steiner, 2002), passim, limited preview online. Censorinus is one of the two named friends of Publius Crassus who died with him at the Battle of Carrhae. Plutarch calls him \\"a man of senatorial dignity and a powerful speaker.\\" During the battle, Censorinus is among those who ride with young Crassus on a last desperate cavalry foray; after sustaining heavy casualties, the Romans and their Gallic auxiliaries retreat to a sand dune, where hope is soon lost under the constant barrage of Parthian arrows. Wounded and with his sword-arm incapacitated, Crassus orders his shield-bearer to take his life. Censorinus does likewise, and dies at his side. Their friend Megabocchus and most of the other officers commit suicide.Plutarch, Crassus 25.3, 11‚Äì12. This Censorinus is possibly also the young man who had accompanied Quintus Cicero to Asia, as mentioned in a letter written by Quintus's elder brother Marcus Cicero between 25 October and 10 December, 59 BC.Cicero, Ad Quintum fratrem 1.2.13; Eilers, \\"The Date of Augustus' Edict on the Jews ‚Ä¶ and the Career of C. Marcius Censorinus,\\" p. 92. D.R. Shackleton Bailey notes in his commentary that the person in Cicero's letter could less likely be the Lucius Marcius Censorinus who was consul in 29 BC; he further doubts that all four illustrious young men listed would actually be part of Quintus's entourage. He is named in the company of four other young nobiles who seemed willing to support Quintus if he were to be prosecuted as a result of his governorship. The others are an Antonius who is either the famous Marcus Antonius or one of his two brothers, Gaius or Lucius; Cassius Longinus and his brother Lucius; and Quintus Mucius Scaevola (tribune of the plebs in 54 BC). Other close members of the Censorinus family were supporters of Antonius as triumvir, and one of them, the consul of 39 BC, came into possession of Cicero's house on the Palatine after his death.According to Velleius Paterculus 2.14.3.

His magnum opus, the History of the Conquest of al-Andalus, is one of the earliest Arabic Muslim accounts of the Islamic conquest of Spain. Legend claimed that Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya (\\"son of the Gothic woman\\") was descended from Wittiza, the last king of the united Visigoths in Spain, through a granddaughter, Sara the Goth, who travelled to Damascus and married ‚Äòƒ™sƒÅ ibn MuzƒÅ·∏•im, an Arab client of the 10th Umayyad caliph Hisham. Sara and ‚Äòƒ™sƒÅ then returned to Al-Andalus. Ibn al- Q≈´·π≠iyya was born and raised in Seville. His family was under the patronage of the Qurayshi tribe, and his father was a qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (judge) in Seville and √âcija. The Banu Hajjaj, also of Seville, were close relatives of his family, also claiming descent from Visigothic royalty. Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya's student al-Fara·∏çƒ´ composed a short sketch of his master for his biographical dictionary, preserved in a late medieval manuscript discovered in Tunis in 1887. Al-Fara·∏çƒ´ tells us Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya studied first in Seville,His teachers there were: Mu·∏•ammad ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn al-Qarn, ·∏§asan ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh al-ZabƒÅrƒ´, Sa‚Äòƒ´d ibn JƒÅbr, and  øAlƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ Shƒ´ba. then in C√≥rdoba.His teachers there were: TƒÅhir ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Azƒ´z, Ibn Abƒ´ al-Walƒ´d al-Arj, Mu·∏•ammad ibn  øAbd al-WahƒÅb ibn Mughƒ´th, Mu·∏•ammad ibn  øUmar ibn LubƒÅba, ‚ÄòUmar ibn ·∏§af·π£ ibn Abƒ´ Tamƒ´m, Aslam ibn  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z, A·∏•mad ibn Jild, Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mas≈´r, Mu·∏•ammad ibn  øAbd al- Malik ibn Ayman, ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh ibn Y≈´nis, A·∏•mad ibn Bashƒ´r ibn al-Aghbas, and Qasƒ´m ibn A·π£bagh. Al-Fara·∏çƒ´ cautions that his histories were written from memory, not following the hadƒ´th and the fiqh, and they lacked original sources, literal truth, and verification. Under Sa‚Äòƒ´d ibn QƒÅhir he studied, memorized and transmitted the great work of history known as Al-KƒÅmil (The Complete) by the famous Ba·π£riyyan philologist, al-Mubarrad. He died in old age at C√≥rdoba. Al-Q≈´·π≠iyya's highly anecdotal history is unusual among the Arab chronicles. The influence of his royal ancestry probably lies behind his defense of treaties between the Arab Muslim conquerors and the Gothic aristocracyboth secular and ecclesiastical that preserved them on their estates. Al-Q≈´·π≠iyya contests criticisms by historians such as Rhazes, arguing that these treaties bolstered Islamic hegemony at minimal military cost. He refutes a claim that the Umayyad emirs of C√≥rdoba retained the fifth (quinto or khums, a tax) for the Caliph of Damascus. His history retells the legend of the part played by \\"the sons of Wittiza\\" at the Battle of Guadalete. .

In response, Carlson ‚Äî the runner-up in the Independent-Republican primary ‚Äî announced a write-in candidacy, backed by US Senator Rudy Boschwitz.

The Reserve contains national parks and wildlife preserves, and \\"multiple use\\" zones where limited human settlement and activity are permitted.

El Mirador is located in the remote, dense jungle about 7 km south of the Mexican border. A government press release lists Tikal, El Mirador, Piedras Negras, and Uaxact√∫n as the Maya sites that will anchor tourism development. Tens of other sites are also being excavated in the region. ' is a word for \\"jaguar\\" in many Mayan languages, and ' is Spanish for \\"four\\"; hence the intended meaning, \\"four jaguars.\\" \\"Cuatro Balam\\" also refers to the four main figures of the K'iche' Maya sacred text Popol Vuh, linked to the four cardinal directions. The project was officially presented to the press and the public by Guatemala's president Alvaro Colom on July 16, 2008 preceded by months of speculation and discussion. At the presentation, a video was shown depicting aspirations for the first fifteen years of the project, which include attracting 12 million visitors to the region. At El Mirador specifically, Colom says he hopes to increase the annual number of tourists to 40,000. According to President Colom and Eugenio Gabriel, whom Colom has put in charge of the project, the Reserve will be divided into three zones: an archeological park in the north, a tourism hub in the center, and an agricultural zone in the south, intended to prevent further northward migration by Guatemalan farmers and ranchers. Key features of the plan include a small train that will carry tourists to and from archaeological sites at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour and a new university that will promote the study of the region's biodiversity and genetic material, as well as Maya studies. President Colom did not specify exactly how the project will be financed, but said it will require investment from both the public and private sector. At the announcement of the project, Colom said that some of plan objectives could be achieved within just two years, while others would take up to fifteen to realize. In his announcement of Cuatro Balam, Colom also said that for the project to succeed, the region would have to be protected from invasive farmers and rancher and drug traffickers, who are concentrated in the western part of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. The plan will be a subject of discussion in the ‚Äúmesas multisectoriales‚Äù or multisectoral roundtables, an ongoing series of talks between government officials, NGOs and community groups to discuss economic development and environmental conservation around El Mirador.

History After lifting the 1948 TV allocation \\"freeze\\" with its Sixth Report and Order (1952), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated channels 8, 13, and 43 to Monroe and West Monroe, with channel 13 reserved for non-commercial (educational) broadcasting.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook\\", 1964 edition, Page A-22 The State Department of Education signed KLSE on the air March 9, 1957, from a studio and transmitter facility on Forsythe Avenue. The facility was originally used by KFAZ-TV Channel 43 until KFAZ went dark May 1, 1954.USGS topographic map shows \\"KSLE Tower\\" (misspelling). Topo map date July 1, 1973. It was the fourth television station in the Monroe‚ÄìEl Dorado, Arkansas area, after KFAZ-TV, KNOE-TV, and KRBB-TV (now KTVE), the 24th educational television station in the United States, and the first educational television station in Louisiana, going on-the-air almost one month prior to WYES-TV in New Orleans. KLSE's sign-on predates the debut of Louisiana Public Broadcasting's first station, WLPB-TV in Baton Rouge, by over 18 years. KLSE was to be the first station in an intended statewide educational television network along the lines of Alabama Educational Television, which had been created two years earlier. LSU professor Lucille Woodward had urged Governor Robert Kennon to create the Educational Television Commission a few years earlier. The state's limited budgetLouisiana State Department of Education Report 1962-1963 includes budget. meant the station signed on with a transmitter and antenna providing one tenth the maximum allowed effective radiated power for a station on channel 13. In addition, its tower was only half as tall as that of KNOE. This combination effectively limited KLSE's viewing area to Monroe and West Monroe, with viewing in nearby towns difficult.Station coverage range can be estimated at from this FCC coverage map for a Channel 13 station application in Anchorage, AK. EIRP and tower height are similar. A range of centered on the KLSE transmitter address is approximated by this map view. In addition, the amount of educational television programming available to the state from National Educational Television and other sources in the late 1950s and early 1960s was limited in comparison to the programming available to commercial stations. KLSE could only have been viable as part of a statewide network, but the only educational licenses allocated to Louisiana outside of New Orleans were on UHF frequencies. UHF was not considered viable at the time, since most people could only watch UHF stations with an expensive converter. Even then, the picture was marginal at best. When it became apparent that there wouldn't be enough funding to sign on additional stations, the state shuttered KLSE in 1964. The Ark-La-Miss area would not receive another educational station until LPB went on-the-air in Monroe with KLTM, also operating on channel 13, on September 8, 1976. There is no record of any television station using the former KLSE facilities after its closure.

In situations where a river flow is weaker than the marine processes that build sand dunes, the river may be obstructed from flowing into the sea by the formation of a sand dune; that is, a sandbar. In such cases the river will often form an elongate estuary in the swales of the dune. When river flow increases, or once the estuary has built up a large mass of water, it breaches the sandbar and flows out to the ocean. If this breach occurs at the farthest end of the estuary from the river inflow, then water must flow through the whole length of the estuary in order to reach the sea. Thus the entire estuary is flushed, and there is no deadwater. On the other hand, if the breach occurs near the river inflow, then most of the estuary will not be flushed by the flow of the river into the sea, resulting in a large deadwater.

During Khan Jahan's second viceroyalty, Aurangzeb built a wall around the city in 1682, to protect it from the incursions of the Marathas; and in 1696 he erected a similar fortified wall for Begumpura. The city wall is terraced, and is of solid masonry, but of no great height, being in many parts not more than fourteen feet. The battlements are loop-holed, and the merlins over the gateways and at certain places along the wall, are machicolated; while semi-circular bastions surmounted by towers, occur at each flanking angle, and at regular intervals along the works. The wall is pierced with thirteen gateways, exclusive of a small postern wicket, and its total length is a little over six miles. All gates barring one are associated with Aurangzeb. The four principal entrances face the cardinal points, and consist of the Delhi gate in the north, the Jalna gate in the east, the Paithan gate in the south, and the Mecca gate in the west. Besides these, there are the Jaffar, Khirki, Barapul, Mahmud and Roshan gates; as well as four others, now closed, the Khizri, Khadgar, Mada, and Kumhar. The Barapul had also been walled up for some time. =Bhadkal Gate= Bhadkal Gate is a building in Aurangabad City, India. This gate is the biggest gate of city. It was built by Ahmadnagar's, Murtaza Nizamshah's Vazir Malik Ambar. It was built in memory of victory against Mughal in 1612. It is also known as victory gate. Bhadkal Gate has unique architectural style. It is India's first column structural Building. =Delhi Gate= The largest and the most stately, it was built by Aurangzeb. It is situated to the north of the city facing Delhi. It is similar to Lahore gate of Delhi‚Äôs Lal Quila (Red Fort). =Paithan Gate= The gate is smaller in size and was royal gateway leading to Paithan town. This gate is smaller in size compared to other gates. =Mecca or Makai Gate= This gate leads to Begumpura another walled quarter of the city, and is the only gate that has a canon installed on it. It faces the holy city of Mecca towards the west. =Khas or Jalna Gate= The gate is simple in design but was disintegrating. It has been restored recently. It faces the Jalna city in the east. =Kaala Darwaza= This gate leads to the palace fort of Qila‚Äìe-Ark. The palace had its own fortification walls and had five gates other than the Kaala darwaza all gates are in ruins. =Roshan Gate= This gate is located to the north of Jalna gate or Khas gate. It is bigger in size and stature as compared to Jalna gate. Roshan gate is said to have been named after Aurangezeb‚Äôs sister Roshanara to whom the emperor was much attached and she remained his favorite friend and advisor.

The ministry is located in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. History The modern Liberian state was established by former American slaves and free African-Americans that immigrated to western Africa in the early 1800s as part of the mission of the American Colonization Society.\\"Colonization: Thirty-Sixth Anniversary of the American Colonization Society\\", New York Times, January 19, 1853 Much of the country's foreign policy philosophy is therefore derived from the same principles that guide United States foreign policy. Indeed, the ministry notes on its website that the \\"foundation [of Liberia's foreign policy] is copied after the pattern adopted by the United States of America from where the founding fathers of Liberia had come as ex-slaves and free men of color.\\" Liberia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established as a cabinet-level branch of the government in 1848, soon after the country's declaration of independence in 1847. Originally called the \\"Department of State\\", the ministry assumed its current name in 1972. The first director of the ministry was Hilary Teague, who also drafted the Liberian Declaration of Independence and served in the Liberian Senate. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus meets with Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarters in Monrovia Between 1848 and 1981, every Foreign Minister (formerly \\"Secretary of State\\") came from Montserrado County, Liberia's most populous county. The first individual to fill the post from outside of Montserrado was H. Boimah Fahnbulleh, Jr., who was originally from Grand Cape Mount County. In February 2012, Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan, a member of the Unity Party was appointed as the minister. He was Dean of the Liberian Cabinet under President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. Diplomacy The ministry maintains Liberia's affairs with foreign entities, including bilateral relations with individual nations and its representation in international organizations, including the United Nations, African Union, the World Health Organization, UNESCO and the Economic Community of West African States, among others. It oversees visas, some matters of public affairs and the Gabriel L. Dennis Foreign Service Institute, which helps to train Liberian diplomats. Foreign diplomatic corps vehicles are issued with a unique set of Vehicle registration plates of Liberia.

He was a photographer with The Chicago Tribune, stationed at the Washington, D.C., bureau from 1998 to 2007; during this period he also followed the rise of then-Senator Obama to the presidency. Early life Souza was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts and grew up in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, the son of a nurse and a boat mechanic. He is of Portuguese ancestry; both sets of his grandparents emigrated from the Azores. Souza graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in public communication from Boston University and a master's degree in journalism and mass communication from Kansas State University. Career=Early career= Souza started his career in the 1970s in Kansas at the Chanute Tribune and the Hutchinson News. In the early 1980s, he was a photographer for the Chicago Sun-Times. =With Ronald Reagan= He served as an official White House photographer for President Ronald Reagan from June 1983 until 1989. He was also the official photographer for the funeral services of Ronald Reagan in 2004. At the end of the Reagan administration, Souza continued to be based in Washington, D.C. Between 1998 and 2007, he was a photographer for the Chicago Tribune Washington, D.C., bureau. Souza has also worked as a freelancer for National Geographic and Life magazines. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he was among the first journalists to cover the war in Afghanistan and the fall of Kabul. =With Barack Obama= In 2004, Jeff Zeleny, now a political correspondent for CNN, asked Souza to take photographs for a project documenting Barack Obama's first year as U.S. senator. Souza covered Obama's arrival to the Senate in 2005 and met him for the first time on Obama's first day in the Senate. He documented Obama's time in the Senate, following him in many foreign trips, including those to Kenya, South Africa, and Russia. In the process he not only became close to Senator Obama, he ended up following his rise to the presidency. In July 2008, Souza published a bestseller photo-book The Rise of Barack Obama, featuring photographs between 2005 and 2008. Souza was an assistant professor of photojournalism at Ohio University's School of Visual Communication After the November 2008 election, he was asked to become the official White House photographer for his second time for the new President-elect Obama. On January 14, 2009, the new presidential portrait was released; it is the first time that an official presidential portrait was taken with a digital camera. A week later Souza was present at the inauguration and the following day he was the only photographer present for Obama's second swearing-in on Obama's first workday in the Oval Office. In May 2009, Souza began using Flickr as an official conduit for releasing White House photos. The photos were initially posted with a Creative Commons Attribution license which required that the original photographers be credited. Flickr later created a new license which identified them as \\"United States Government Work\\" which does not carry any copyright restrictions.The photos, at https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/ are (as of January 4, 2009) posted with the following disclaimer, \\"This official White House photograph is being made available only for publication by news organizations and/or for personal use printing by the subject(s) of the photograph. The photograph may not be manipulated in any way and may not be used in commercial or political materials, advertisements, emails, products, promotions that in any way suggests approval or endorsement of the President, the First Family, or the White House.\\" In 2010, National Geographic produced a program about Souza titled The President's Photographer, which featured Souza as the main subject while also covering the previous White House photographers. Souza's photograph taken at 4:06 pm on May 1, 2011, in the Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden, featuring Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and others, quickly became an iconic image. It also became one of the most viewed images on Flickr. Souza's 2009 image of a five- year-old child, Jacob Philadelphia, touching Obama's head has also become iconic. Jacob asked if Obama's hair was similar to his and the image has become symbolic of the African American struggle for civil rights. As the official White House photographer, Souza traveled with the president to document each meeting, trip and encounter for historical record. Along with his staff, Souza produced up to 20,000 pictures a week. In November 2011, Souza was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most-powerful, least-famous people. As well as using very high end cameras for his presidential photography, Souza occasionally took square shots on his iPhone.The Verge: A year at the White House as seen through an iPhone's lens ‚Äì The VergeHow the official White House photographer uses his iPhone ‚Äì Cult of Mac =Post-Obama administration= Interview with Pete Souza about his 2017 book.

In 2017 Souza received a book deal from Little, Brown and Company to publish a book of photos from his tenure as White House photographer titled Obama: An Intimate Portrait: The Historic Presidency in Photographs. Upon Donald Trump's inauguration as president in 2017, Souza began sharing pictures of Obama on his Instagram account, often as critical commentary on the new administration. In April 2017, he had over one million Instagram followers, and reached two million followers in August 2018 as he continued to critique the Trump presidency through contrasting photographs of Obama.instagram.com, nytimes.com In 2018, he announced the release of a new book titled Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents, juxtaposing the Obama and Trump administrations. In late 2019, Pete Souza and his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin. Souza's work in and after the Obama administration is also the subject of the 2020 documentary The Way I See It.

The lender sells the borrower a trivial object to be paid for on the loan due date. The borrower then sells the same object back immediately for cash at the price minus the interest. An example would be a lender selling a pencil for $120 to be paid in a year's time and immediately repurchasing it for $100 in cash. The borrower has effectively borrowed $100 at a 20% interest rate.False Economy: A surprising economic history of the world, Alan Beattie, page 130 Name The term was shared among Latin and Western European languages, from Arabic mokhatara ().

The package was designed to increase the amount of money that banks could lend to businesses and private individuals. This aid comes in two parts: an initial ¬£50 billion being made available to big corporate borrowers, and a second undisclosed amount that forms a form of insurance against banks suffering big losses. Bailout After the October 2008 bailouts of RBS, HBOS and Lloyds TSB together with Lloyds TSB's January 2009 merger with HBOS, the Government was holding a 43% stake in Lloyds Banking Group, but then on 6 March 2009, after it became apparent that the HBOS merger had been bad for Lloyds since HBOS had made losses of ¬£11bn, the Government announced it would increase its stake in Lloyds to 65% (77% if including non- voting preference shares). The investment was maintained at 43% after a rights issue. RBS had received ¬£5bn in preference shares purchased by the Government who also underwrote a ¬£15bn rights issue, which failed to attract investors, leaving the Government with an investment of ¬£20bn for a 58% stake. The Government, on what became Blue Monday Crash, realising that RBS could not afford the 12% coupon payment on the preference shares, RBS having released financial results showing a loss of ¬£28bn, converted those shares to ordinary shares, increasing its stake to 70%. The investment in RBS has increased to ¬£45bn with a 72% stake held by the British Government. Recovery of bailout funds * Lloyds The investment in Lloyds had cost ¬£20.3bn which the British Government began to recover by selling its 43% investment in 2013. Sales continued until the final tranche of 0.5% in May 2017, the Government making a small profit on the sales, realising ¬£21.2bn. * RBS An investment of ¬£45,527m was made across three tranches in December 2008 (¬£14,969m), April 2009 (¬£5,508m) and December 2009 (¬£25,500m) at an average investment per share of 502p and represented an 84.4% stake in the company.https://investors.rbs.com/share-data/equity-ownership-statistics.aspx Since these investments, the bank has paid back the government ¬£305m in underwriting fees, ¬£2,504m to exit the Asset Protection Scheme, ¬£1,280m in Contingent Capital Facility fees as well as retiring the special Dividend Access Share for ¬£1,513m in March 2016.

Several Japanese folklores, essays, and rakugos refer to it. Concerning binb≈çgami's preference of baked miso, in Senba, Osaka, (:ja:ËàπÂ†¥ (Â§ßÈò™Â∏Ç)) the following story is told: > There used to be an event till about 1877 to send binb≈çgami away: At the end > of each month, merchants in Senba made baked and plate-shaped miso, then a > bant≈ç (Áï™È†≠, head clerk), with the plate-shaped miso in his hands, walked > around till the air was filled with its appetizing smell. After a while, he > bent the plate-shaped miso closed. The miso's smell makes binb≈çgamis come > out of the houses they inhabit and traps them in it. The bant≈ç dumps the > miso into a river and washes the smell away before returning. According to > poet Mitsuyuki Nakamura, binb≈çgami has an uchiwa to draw in and enjoy miso's > smell. Description Generally, a binb≈çgami appears as a skinny, dirty old man, who wields both an uchiwa and a kendama in his hands and wears one broken geta on his foot. Toen Sh≈çsetsu (ÂÖéÂúíÂ∞èË™¨), the mystery stories written by Kyokutei Bakin and others includes a story of ky≈´ki (Á™ÆÈ¨º): > In 1821, there was a bushi house with ever-present misery. One day, the man > who served the house went to S≈çka and came across a bonze. The man asked him > where he came from. The bonze replied he came from the man's house. The man > said that he had never seen the bonze before. \\"I'm binb≈çgami,\\" the bonze > answered, \\"and that's why so many people in the house caught an illness. > That house has enough misery, so I shall go to another house. Your master > will have better luck hereafter\\" and the bonze disappeared. Just as the > bonze said, people in the house experienced better luck gradually.[ Being a kami, a binb≈çgami cannot be killed. A story in Niigata Prefecture describes how: > If you light an irori on an ≈çmisoka, irori's heat kicks binb≈çgami out and > invites fukunokami (Á¶è„ÅÆÁ•û, the kami of good luck) who likes the warmth of > irori. There are many other superstitions which connect binb≈çgami with > irori, including that of Tsushima, Ehime Prefecture: If an irori is lit too > repeatedly, binb≈çgami appears. Tankai (Ë≠öÊµ∑), an essay collection by Souan Tsumura, includes a story about a binb≈çgami: > During a nap, a man dreams of a ragged old man entering the room. > Thereafter, everything the man did went wrong. Four years later, in another > dream, the old man appears again. The old man says that he will leave the > house and tells the man how to send a binb≈çgami away: Make some baked rice > and baked miso, and place them on an oshiki (wooden board, with four bent > edges to serve as a tray), and take it through the back door and dump them > into the river. The old man also reveals how to avoid binb≈çgami thereafter: > Not to make any baked miso, which is preferred by binb≈çgami, and to never > eat any raw miso, which makes poverty too severe to light a fire to bake > miso. The man did as he was told, and he never again experienced poverty. It is also said that hospitality of the inhabited people may turn binb≈çgami into fukunokami. Ihara Saikaku's Nippon Eidaigura (Êó•Êú¨Ê∞∏‰ª£Ëîµ) includes the story (Inoru shirushi no kami no oshiki Á•à„ÇãÂç∞„ÅÆÁ•û„ÅÆÊäòÊï∑ lit. oshiki as a praying sign) which tells :About the man who deified a binb≈çgami. At the night of Jinjitsu (January 7 in the former Japanese calendar), a binb≈çgami appeared at the man's bedside and thanked him, \\"I had a prepared dinner on a tray for the first time,\\" and made the man a millionaire in return. And it is also said that a poor hatamoto (middle-class bushi), who thought binb≈çgami had brought him security as well as poverty, put sake and rice out to pray to binb≈çgami for a little bit of luck. And then, he received a little bit of luck. This binb≈çgami is now enshrined beside Kitano Shrine, in Bunky≈ç ward, Tokyo. If you pray at the small shrine to welcome binb≈çgami temporarily, and send him away 21 days later, it is said, you can avoid binb≈çgami thereafter.

Her father Amos Bronson Alcott is \\"Abel Lamb,\\" while his partner and community co-founder Charles Lane is \\"Timon Lion;\\" Abigail May Alcott, Louisa's mother and Bronson's wife, is \\"Sister Hope.\\" Alcott depicts her father as dominated by his more forceful partner, and both men as feckless and impractical dreamers. The men of the community spend their time in pointless debates while Sister Hope works from dawn to dusk to maintain their existence. A crisis arises at harvest time, when the grain crop is threatened by an approaching storm.

TechShop offered safety and basic use training on all of its tools and equipment in addition to advanced and special interest classes and workshops. For most equipment, a safety and use class had to be completed before it could be used. It was affiliated with the maker culture and participated in annual Maker Faire events. On November 15, 2017, with no warning, the company closed all domestic locations and announced it would declare bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code (immediate liquidation). An effort to purchase the company's assets and reopen the workshops fell through, and, the San Francisco location was reopened by a new owner on February 19, 2018. The original TechShop filed for bankruptcy a few days later, on February 26, 2018. History TechShop was founded by Jim Newton and Ridge McGhee. Jim Newton originally wanted to establish a place with tools to work on pet projects. Newton, who had been a science adviser to the TV show MythBusters and a College of San Mateo robotics teacher, was also motivated by his students' frustration with lack of access to equipment. Ridge McGhee, a resident of Atherton, California, was upset by the loss of American manufacturing capability to other countries.

An email from Dan Rasure stated that over $2 million was spent on legal fees fighting TechShop stakeholders. Noisebridge, a nonprofit hackerspace in San Francisco, held a Life After Techshop meetup to welcome former TechShop members. In Chandler, users created their own space, with the help of the city. In response to the closing, a group of makers in the San Francisco Bay Area created a new nonprofit called \\"Maker Nexus.\\" , Maker Nexus operates a facility in Sunnyvale, at and they are open from 10:00 AM until 10:00 PM, Wednesday through Sunday.

Newscaster Larry Blackmar was host, while local disc-jockey Michael Bailey announced. The series was based on an original concept created by Douglas K. Vernon, who at the time was a videotape editor for KGW. Gameplay Three contestants, one usually a returning champion, competed. Each player was spotted 1,000 points at the beginning of the game. =Round 1=Category Board At the beginning of the round, all three players were shown a category board consisting of six categories to be used for the entire game. Each category had three lighted triangles, each representing a different multiple-choice toss-up question to be asked. The players were given ten seconds to study and memorize the category board before it was turned away from view. The players had to keep track of the category names and the number of questions asked in each category in the round by memory. Toss-up Question Round 1 began with a non-category question, a question whose category did not come from the category board. The players could buzz in to answer the question at any time with a maximum of five seconds after the question was asked. If a player buzzed in with a correct answer, 100 points were added to their score and the player earned the right to choose one of the categories from the category board. Category Questions A question from the chosen category, worth 100 points, was then asked to all three players in the same manner. If the first player to buzz in gave an incorrect answer or failed to answer the question within five seconds, 100 points was deducted from their score and the question was repeated for their two opponents. If the second player to buzz in gave an incorrect answer or failed to answer within five seconds, 100 points were deducted from their score, a new non-category toss-up question was asked (this also applied, minus the point deductions, if no contestant buzzed in with an answer). Exhausted Category If at any time a player who answered a question correctly chose a category that had already been \\"exhausted\\" (all three questions from it were already asked), 100 points were deducted from their score and a new non-category toss-up question was asked. The round was played until either all categories were exhausted or until five minutes elapsed (signified by a ringing bell). =Round 2= Round 2 was played like Round 1, with the category board shown once again to the players. However, there were some changes. * Correct answers added 200 points, while incorrect answers deducted 200 points. * 200 points were deducted for choosing an exhausted category. Passing Each player, after giving a correct answer, had the option of choosing a category or passing their turn to one of their opponents, forcing that player to choose a category. However, the players were limited to one pass per game. A good strategy was for a contestant to pass their turn near the end of the round, when there were several exhausted categories. Spotlight Question One pre-designated question in the second round was a somewhat more difficult question that only the player that found it could answer. If a player chose a category and that next question was the Spotlight, they could wager from 100-500 points on it. A correct answer added the wager to their score, while an incorrect answer deducted it. The category and question position of the Spotlight was shown to the home audience during the category board reveal for Round 2. =Winning= The player with the highest score at the end of Round 2 won the game plus a prize, while their opponents received consolation gifts (including gift certificates from local stores/restaurants). All contestants received an On the Spot umbrella made by Shedrain. Flash Round The day's champion played the \\"Flash Round\\" for up to $1,000 cash and one of two prizes (ranging from furniture to trips to a new car, all provided by local stores and dealerships). =Wheels= The champion was shown a special wheel-within-a- wheel setup (similar to the Melody Roulette wheel on Name That Tune). The inner wheel contained two sets of dollar wedges (worth $25, $50, $75, and $100) while the outer wheel contained two wedges each of the names of two grand prizes. The champion spun the wheels to determine the dollar amount of each question and which grand prize they would play for. =Questions= The champion then had 60 seconds to answer 10 questions. The clock started after the first question was completely asked, and each correct answer earned the amount of money the inner wheel landed on. Contestants were not penalized for incorrect answers, which allowed them to give as many answers to each question as possible until the correct answer was given. They may also pass on questions, returning to them if time remains. If all ten questions were answered correctly, the contestant won the grand prize the outer wheel landed on. All money earned was theirs to keep regardless of outcome. Returning champions Champions remained on the show until they were defeated or won five consecutive games, after which they were retired. The maximum possible cash amount that a contestant could win was $5,000. Changes Starting with the 1985-1986 season, the series made a number of changes to the game. =1985= * During the first commercial break in the middle of Round 1, the players were shown the category board for the second time, including the number of questions that were played from each category at that point. * The player who chose the category containing the last question in either round had 100 points added to their score. * The Spotlight Question became home-viewer driven. Viewers sent in their questions, and if the question was used they won an On the Spot t-shirt (later a gift certificate to a local store/restaurant). * All $25 wedges were eliminated from the inner Flash Round wheel. In addition, Blackmar paid out winnings in bills of money (similar to The Joker‚Äôs Wild). =$5K Giveaway (1987-1988)= For the final season, a \\"$5K Giveaway\\" was instituted as the third grand prize in the \\"Flash Round\\". Presented in association with KGW's AM radio sister-station 62 KGW, the \\"$5K Giveaway\\" gave winning contestants a chance to play for $5,000. A small wedge marked \\"62 KGW\\" was added in one of the spaces between the two grand prizes on the outer wheel. If the outer wheel landed on the special wedge and the contestant won the bonus game, they received a $5,000 check in addition to the cash amounts earned for each correct answer. Each time a contestant returned to the bonus game, an additional wedge was added to another space between the two grand prizes on the outer wheel, thus increasing the chances of playing for the $5,000. On the fifth and final trip to the bonus game, the contestant was given another wedge to place in any position on the wheel. On the Spot High School Challenge Beginning in 1985 and played during the school year, a weekly Saturday version used local-area high-school students as contestants, playing for cash and prizes along with scholarship money for their schools. Scott Runkel from South Salem High School was a contestant in 1987 and later recalled (in 2017), \\"It was really, really annoying that you had to remember all the categories and how many questions had been asked in each one.\\" He did not do very well on the show as a result. Set The set was designed and built by All West Display Company of Portland, Oregon. For the 1984-1985 season, the set utilized a gold color scheme. This was changed to a blue color scheme for the rest of the run.

It was bred in the early part of the twentieth century by artificial insemination of local Criollo cows with imported semen from Brown Swiss bulls. It is named for its place of origin, the town of Carora in the Venezuelan state of Lara.  History  Breeding of the Tipo Carora began in the 1930s in the Venezuelan state of Lara, in western central Venezuela. Brown Swiss semen from Europe and North America was used in artificial insemination of cows of the Amarillo de Quebrada Arriba, a local breed of Criollo cattle which was well adapted to the tropical conditions of the area, until about 85% of the genotype of the resulting stock derived from the Brown Swiss. A breeders' association, the , was started in 1979, and in 1982 the breed was officially recognised by the Venezuelan government. During the 1980s there was a sharp fall in breed numbers. In 1992, the breed was denominated a \\"Patrimonio Nacional\\" or national heritage; a programme of genetic improvement was begun, and a herd- book was established. In 2013 the registered population numbered 13 682 cows and 644 bulls.  Characteristics  The Carora has black skin and a white or pale fawn-coloured coat. In approximately 90% of the cattle, the hair of the coat is glossy and short; this is caused by the slick hair gene often found in Criollo cattle. Selection for this characteristic in the Carora is intentional: bulls found ‚Äì through observation of their male progeny ‚Äì not to be homozygous for it are killed. The sleek short coat helps the cattle to stay cool in hot and humid tropical conditions; in their area of origin, monthly average temperatures vary between about and , and humidity may reach 90%.  Use  The Carora was created as a dairy breed capable of producing well in a tropical climate. In 1998, cows were found to give an average of of milk in a lactation of 305 days; milk protein averages about 3.7%. Carora bulls ‚Äì or semen from them ‚Äì are extensively used for cross-breeding, both with Holstein cows to produce dairy animals with good tolerance of heat, and with cows of indicine breeds to produce dual-purpose cattle.

It was formulated in 1928 by Tibor Rad√≥ and has been generalized to more general shapes and higher dimensions by Richard Rado.  Formulation In a letter to Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski, motivated by some results of Giuseppe Vitali, Tibor Rad√≥ observed that for every covering of a unit interval, one can select a subcovering consisting of pairwise disjoint intervals with total length at least 1/2 and that this number cannot be improved. He then asked for an analogous statement in the plane. : If the area of the union of a finite set of squares in the plane with parallel sides is one, what is the guaranteed maximum total area of a pairwise disjoint subset? Rad√≥ proved that this number is at least 1/9 and conjectured that it is at least 1/4 a constant which cannot be further improved. This assertion was proved for the case of equal squares independently by A. Sokolin, R. Rado, and V. A. Zalgaller. However, in 1973, Mikl√≥s Ajtai disproved Rad√≥'s conjecture, by constructing a system of squares of two different sizes for which any subsystem consisting of disjoint squares covers the area at most 1/4 ‚àí 1/1728 of the total area covered by the system.  Upper and lower bounds  Problems analogous to Tibor Rad√≥'s conjecture but involving other shapes were considered by Richard Rado starting in late 1940s. A typical setting is a finite family of convex figures in the Euclidean space Rd that are homothetic to a given X, for example, a square as in the original question, a disk, or a d-dimensional cube. Let : F(X)=inf_{S}sup_{I}frac{I}{S}, where S ranges over finite families just described, and for a given family S, I ranges over all subfamilies that are independent, i.e. consist of disjoint sets, and bars denote the total volume (or area, in the plane case). Although the exact value of F(X) is not known for any two-dimensional convex X, much work was devoted to establishing upper and lower bounds in various classes of shapes. By considering only families consisting of sets that are parallel and congruent to X, one similarly defines f(X), which turned out to be much easier to study. Thus, R. Rado proved that if X is a triangle, f(X) is exactly 1/6 and if X is a centrally symmetric hexagon, f(X) is equal to 1/4. In 2008, Sergey Bereg, Adrian Dumitrescu, and Minghui Jiang established new bounds for various F(X) and f(X) that improve upon earlier results of R. Rado and V. A. Zalgaller. In particular, they proved that : frac{1}{8.4797}leq F(textrm{square})leqfrac{1}{4}-frac{1}{384}, and that f(X)geqfrac{1}{6} for any convex planar X.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Mst√≥w. It lies approximately east of Czƒôstochowa and north of the regional capital Katowice. Mst√≥w lies on the Warta river, in western part of historic province of Lesser Poland. The village has a population of 1,704, and in early days of Polish history, it was the regional center of an opole (the word opole comes from Slavic language, and means basic territorial unit of a tribe). The village has a population of 1,704. Mst√≥w was first mentioned as Mstowo in 1193, when it belonged to the congregation of Canons Regular of the Lateran from Wroc≈Çaw. Sometime in the early 13th century, a large monastery was built here. It burned in a great fire of 1566, then the complex was rebuilt and destroyed several times. More destruction came during World War I, when several German-Russian skirmishes took place here in early stages of the conflict. During those fights, the towers and defensive walls of the ancient church were destroyed, as well as the roof of the nave. The complex was gradually rebuilt in the 1920s and 1930s. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, fields around the monastery were used by Lesser Poland‚Äôs szlachta for its sejmiks. Among notable guests of Mst√≥w, there was Queen Bona Sforza. Mst√≥w, whose name probably comes from an ancient Slavic given name Msta, received its town charter in 1279, from Prince of Krak√≥w Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. Several years before that event, in 1212, a council of Polish bishops took place here, and among its participants was Wincenty Kad≈Çubek. The very fact that a meeting like this was organized in Mst√≥w means that it had already been an important location, and it had the monastery complex ready to host the bishops. In the Middle Ages Mst√≥w was located along a very important merchant route from Krak√≥w to Greater Poland. The town had a toll bridge on the Warta river, and merchants stayed here on the way to their destinations. As a result, a fair was established in Mst√≥w some time in the first half of the 12th century. In the course of time, to guard the route, wooden strongholds were erected along the road. In 1220, the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º, founded a defensive Church here. Mst√≥w emerged as a main urban center of northwestern Lesser Poland, and in the 13th century, the town was destroyed several times by the Mongols (see Mongol invasion of Poland). In 1260, the Mongols burned the monastery; their last raid took place in 1266. After Mst√≥w had received its town charter, a market square was designed, with rectangular streets, whose shape has not been changed. The town had its local government, and despite widespread destruction following the raid of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia (1292), it quickly recovered, with several artisan guilds being active here. In 1327, Mst√≥w was visited by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åokietek, and following this visit, for unknown reasons the post of a local starosta was transferred to the town of Olsztyn, where a castle was built. During the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War, the Mst√≥w monastery was a gathering point for royal troops. In the 15th century, Mst√≥w had 105 houses, and remained an important location, where in 1474 Polish troops gathered under King Kazimierz Jagiello≈Ñczyk, for a Silesian campaign against King of Hungary Matthias Corvinus. Mst√≥w had its coat of arms and a seal, with an inscription SI - Gillum - CIYITTATIS - MSTHUOW (1564). At that time, and until 1795, Mst√≥w belonged to Lel√≥w County of Lesser Poland‚Äôs Krak√≥w Voivodeship. In the 17th century the merchant route lost its importance, which resulted in Mst√≥w's decline to the benefit of nearby Czƒôstochowa. In 1655 (see the Deluge), Swedes captured the town and the monastery, destroying it completely. Mst√≥w lost 50% of inhabitants, and the destruction was so widespread that the town never recovered. In 1697, a Baroque synagogue was built, as the number of Jews grew. Mst√≥w was destroyed in 1709 by Russian troops during the Great Northern War, and in the third partition of Poland, the town was cut in half, along the Warta river. The district on the right bank of the river became part of Prussian New Silesia, and the rest was captured by Austria. The Prussians destroyed the monastery, and furthermore, in 1801 Mst√≥w was burned in a fire. In 1815 the town became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and by the 1850s, one-third of its population was Jewish. Polish residents actively supported the January Uprising, for which Mst√≥w lost its town charter in 1870. After the great fire of 1879, Mst√≥w lost many residents, who moved to the quickly developing industrial center of Czƒôstochowa. In 1933, already in Kielce Voivodeship, it had 284 houses and 2,129 inhabitants. The village suffered further losses in World War II. Its historic buildings were destroyed by the Germans, and its Jewish population was decimated in the Holocaust. In 1970 Mst√≥w had 314 houses and the population of 1,676, most of which were farmers. In 1993 the local council undertook an initiative aimed at recovering the town charter, but it failed.

Liberia, as a nation, had its beginnings in 1821 when groups of free blacks from the United States emigrated from the U.S. and began establishing colonies on the coast under the direction of the American Colonization Society. Between 1821 and 1847, by a combination of purchase and conquest, American Societies developed the colonies under the name \\"Liberia\\", dominating the native inhabitants of the area. In 1847 the colony declared itself an independent nation. Because it was already established as a nation, Liberia avoided becoming a European colony during the great age of European colonies in Africa during the latter half of the 19th century. The United States recognized Liberia as an independent state in 1862 and commissioned its first representative to Liberia in 1863. The representative, Abraham Hanson, was appointed as commissioner/consul general. The status of the commissioner was later upgraded to Minister, and finally to full ambassador in 1949. Relations between the United States and Liberia have been continuous since that time. Eight US ambassadors have died at their post serving in Liberia. The US embassy in Liberia is located in Monrovia. Ambassadors *President Lincoln nominated John J.

His uncles, John Pollok and Arthur Pollok, were co-founders of Pollok, Gilmour and Company. Biography Rankin was born at Mearns, Renfrewshire, Scotland. Having obtained a good general education in Scotland, he joined Pollok, Gilmour and Company in 1815, and in 1818 was transferred to Miramichi, New Brunswick. In 1822 he set up a branch firm, Robert Rankin and Company, in Saint John, New Brunswick. This branch became the most prosperous and successful of the Pollok, Gilmour, and Company enterprises. On 17 March 1829 he married Ann, daughter of John Strang, a prominent Scottish merchant of St. Andrews, New Brunswick. By 1830 Rankin was Saint John's leading shipowner and timber merchant. Rankin had added there to his lumbering concerns the building of ships and the importing of textiles, foodstuffs, and building supplies on a large scale ‚Äì reputedly for more than half of the numerous merchants in the town. In 1838 he returned to Scotland in order to lead the reorganisation of Pollok, Gilmour, and Company, whose founders had fallen out. He renamed it Rankin, Gilmour, and Company, and moved the headquarters to Liverpool. By 1838 his firm operated 130 vessels in the timber trade ‚Äì making it the largest British shipowning firm ‚Äì and employed no fewer than 15,000 men in its sawmills, on its wharves, and in the forests; it owned as well 2,000 horses and oxen for draught purposes. In the early 1830s the firm shipped out annually over 300 cargoes of timber. In order to employ its large fleet fully in the winter months, branch houses were opened in New Orleans, and Mobile, Alabama, where the company entered the rapidly expanding and very profitable cotton trade. Rankin's prestige in Liverpool can be judged by his election in January 1862 as chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, described as ‚Äúthe highest honour Liverpool has to bestow.‚Äù He maintained control of this business empire until his death at the age of 69. In his later years Rankin‚Äôs public benefactions were numerous. He funded mechanics‚Äô institutes, temperance societies, and orphans‚Äô homes, and he contributed several large sums for the laying of the first Transatlantic telegraph cable in the 1850s and 1860s. Early in 1869 his health began to fail. The death of his daughter, drowned in Menai Strait, Wales, in August 1869, was a crushing blow to Rankin, who had already lost four of his seven children through childhood illnesses. In 1865 he had established his son James as a country gentleman, buying for him two large estates in Herefordshire. Rankin died in June 1870 at Bromborough Hall, Cheshire, England. Appraisal According to his biographer David S. MacMillan, Rankin contributed greatly to the amazing growth of the shipbuilding and timber trades in 19th century Canada.biographi.ca: \\"Rankin, Robert\\", by David S.
