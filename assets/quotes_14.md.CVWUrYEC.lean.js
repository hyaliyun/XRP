An SRB may be considered, in the abstract, to be a highly optimized Task Control Block (TCB), one which has few, if any, associated resources other than access to the processor itself. All system resources which are utilized under an SRB must be accessed through the use of \\"branch entries\\", some of which are new entries to traditional system services which were formerly accessed exclusively using SVC instructions (which an SRB may not employ for any purpose other than abnormally terminating itself in which case SVC 13, ABEND, may be used, however the \\"branch entry\\" to ABTERM is really more appropriate). When employed by the Start Input/Output interface, an SRB is always paired with an Input/Output Supervisor Block (IOSB). When otherwise employed, an SRB facilitates inter-address-space communication in general, and inter- application communication in particular. SRBs may also be employed for intra- address-space processes, where the highest possible performance is required, and in this case the necessary resources are first acquired under a TCB (usually the \\"job step\\" TCB), before the SRBs are SCHEDULEd (i.e., are presented to the system dispatcher to compete for processor resources). It is conceivable that an address space may have but one TCB (again, the \\"job step\\" TCB) but tens or hundreds or even thousands of SRBs, with the SRBs performing almost all of the work in the address space, and the TCB merely synchronizing the SRBs and responding to communications from the system operator. For purposes of such synchronization, the TCB will usually issue a WAITR, SVC 1, specifying a list of Event Control Blocks (ECBs; one ECB per SRB, plus one for the system operator), and each SRB will indicate its completion to the TCB by using a \\"branch entry\\" to the POST system service (which is normally SVC 2, but in this special case would be a call to the address contained in CVT0PT01), and specifying the ECB which is associated with its SRB, and possibly a \\"message\\" to the TCB. The \\"message\\", should it be present, is often placed in the lowest 24 bits of the ECB, and which is otherwise unused. The highest eight bits are used by the system. Disk device access and network device access is available to SRBs using the \\"improved control interval processing\\" feature of VSAM and the \\"fast path\\" feature of VTAM, respectively. History With the introduction of MVS/370 and successor systems, a whole new environment was introduced: the Service Request Block (SRB), which generally has a higher priority than any TCB, and, indeed, which itself has two distinct priorities: a Global SRB (priority over all local address space SRBs and TCBs) and a Local SRB (priority over only the local address space TCBs); and MVS's dispatcher must manage all of these with absolute consistency across as many as two processors (MVS/370) and as many as sixteen processors (successor systems). More than sixteen processors are available on some z/System models. z/System support for zIIP has dramatically increased the use of SRBs (over and above their traditional Start Input/Output usage). An SRB is a highly-optimized instance of a Process control block in these MVS/370 and successor systems. A TCB is a general-purpose instance of a Process control block in these OS/360 and successor systems.

Named in recognition of the 48 states of the US to signify the desire to construct a broad national movement, the moderate progressives of the Committee of 48 attempted without success to form such a third party with sympathetic activists from the labor movement in 1920. The group (commonly known as \\"The Forty-Eighters\\") then became one of the key constituents in the Conference for Progressive Political Action in 1922, a movement culminating in the independent candidacy of Robert M. La Follette for President of the United States in 1924. Organizational history=Establishment J.A.H. Hopkins, a former member of the Democratic National Committee and head of the short- lived National Party, was the National Secretary of the Committee of 48. The Committee of 48 traces its roots to January 1919, when a gathering of individuals interested in public affairs gathered in New York City.Platform of the Committee of 48: Unanimously Adopted at the First National Conference, St. Louis, Missouri, Dec. 9-12, 1919: Together with Supporting Argument, Resolutions, and Methods of Political Procedure. New York: The Committee of 48, n.d. [1919]; pg. 14. Those so assembled decided that a formal organization should be sponsored and decided to issue a call for a National Conference. The name \\"Committee of 48\\" was chosen as a reflection of the desire to form a national organization bringing together interested representatives of each of the nation's 48 states. The formal call for a new organization, headlined \\"Revolution or Reconstruction? A Call to Americans,\\" was first published on March 22 in four prominent liberal publications. This appeal was targeted to Americans who sought neither revolution nor a turn to reaction in America and urged the formation of a new political entity that would stand apart both from the proto-communist revolutionary socialist movement and from the increasing conservatism of the two \\"old parties\\" of American politics, the Republicans and Democrats.Allen McCurdy, \\"The Forty-Eighters' Position,\\" The Nation, vol. 111, whole no. 2874 (July 31, 1920), pp. 126-127. Public reaction to this announcement was deemed as favorable by the group's organizers. The first published call to establish the organization read in part: > \\"Despite America's splendid success in a war waged against foreign > autocracy, our country is menaced by the growing power of an autocratic and > reactionary minority at home. We stand in danger of losing many of the > liberties and advances won in the course of our national development.... > > \\"Centralization and autocracy are increasing rapidly in the organization of > governments, in the control of credit, and in the determination of public > opinion. The very classes whose labors in factory and field are the basis of > our economic power, find no effective political medium through which to > express their economic demand... > > \\"It is the purpose of the Committee of Forty-eight to summon from all parts > of the country the leaders of its liberal thought and of its forward-looking > citizens, to meet in conference. We hope that out of this assemblage of the > scattered forces of Americanism will come a flexible statement of principles > and methods that will permit effective cooperation with organized Labor and > Agricultural workers in the tasks of social reconstruction.\\"\\"Revolution or > Reconstruction? A Call to Americans,\\" The New Republic, vol. 18, whole no. > 229 (March 22, 1919), pt. 1, pg. iv. Planning on entering the political fray for the long haul, the Committee of 48 opened a headquarters office at 15 E 40th Street in New York City in June 1919, with J.A.H. Hopkins of Morristown, New Jersey, former chairman of the National Executive Committee of the National Party, in the role of Chairman.\\"Plan a Conference to Form New Party: Committee of Forty-Eight Opens Headquarters for 'Liberal' Political Organization,\\" New York Times, June 25, 1919. A more nebulous \\"General Committee\\" back of the organization included a number of marquee names of the American mainstream liberal movement, including historian and philosopher Will Durant, attorney Dudley Field Malone, pacifist minister John Haynes Holmes, and writer and academic Robert Morss Lovett, among others. To gauge public interest in its efforts, the Committee of 48 circulated some 30,000 copies of a survey to progressives around the nation inquiring as to their views on the need for a new political party and polling them on who should lead such a political ticket.\\"Third Party Forms on Call of 21,000: 'Committee of 48' Reports Result of Its Nationwide Questionnaires,\\" New York Times, June 16, 1920. Some 21,000 surveys were returned to the organization, loudly voicing approval of a new organization to challenge the dominant Republican and Democratic Parties and endorsing the candidacy of Wisconsin Senator La Follette as their preferred nominee for President. On September 22, 1919, the organizing committee pegged St. Louis, Missouri as the location at which the founding conference would be held and slated December 9 to 12 as the dates for the event. Some 300,000 copies of a pamphlet entitled A Call to a National Conference were distributed in preparation for the event. National Conference Over 500 persons attended the organizational conference of the Committee of 48, which was gaveled to order on December 9, 1919. That gathering unanimously adopted a first platform for the organization as well as a set of resolutions on various issues of the day. This platform was envisioned as a working draft, to be discussed by the public in preparation for a formally delegated political convention. The platform approved by the December national conference of the Committee of 48 called for public ownership of transportation, stock yards, grain elevators, public utilities, and \\"the principle natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas, mineral deposits, timber, and water works.Platform of the Committee of 48, pg. 3. The use of tax policy was urged to ensure that idle land was put into productive use. The convention also declared itself for > \\"Equal economic, political, and legal rights for all, irrespective of sex or > color. The immediate and absolute restoration of free speech, free press, > peaceable assembly, and all civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\\" An end to the use of legal injunctions in labor disputes was demanded, and the right of workers to \\"organize and bargain collectively\\" was endorsed. The conference passed resolutions calling for the retention of American railroads under government control for a two-year period, requiring that Congress submit any future declaration of war to a direct vote of the people, urging the Blockade of Soviet Russia be immediately lifted and all American forces withdrawn from that country, and demanding that \\"political prisoners and all imprisoned in violation of their constitutional right of free speech\\" be immediately released.\\"Resolutions Adopted by the Conference,\\" in Platform of the Committee of 48, pg. 12. Additional resolutions were passed urging that universal military training not be implemented and that the American government should \\"make every effort to secure universal disarmament by international agreement. July 1920 Conventions Attorney Dudley Field Malone, spokesman for the pro-unity forces in the Committee of 48 at the July 1920 Convention. A grand unification convention designed to bring together liberal forces around a new third party was opened in Chicago on July 10, 1920. The gathering brought together the Committee of 48 with representatives of the Single Tax movement, with a view to further combining with the convention of the Labor Party of the United States, due to start in the same city two days later.\\"Lay Foundation for New Party: Committee of 48 and the Single Taxers Join in First National Convention,\\" Spokesman-Review [Spokane, WA], July 13, 1920, pg. 8. Also joining the eclectic gathering of 539 accredited delegates were adherents of other political organizations, including the Non-Partisan League, the Northwest Farmers' National Council, the Triple Alliance of the Northwest, the Consumers' League, and other organizations. Lack of harmony was evident from the outset, with incompatible programmatic goals and Presidential desires evident, the Single Taxers insistent upon a Single Tax plank in the new party's platform and threatening to bolt the convention if the favorite of the Committee of 48, \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette of Wisconsin, were to be nominated to head the ticket. Simultaneously, closed door unity negotiations were begun between representatives of the Committee of 48 and the Labor Party with a view to joining the two conventions in a new organization to challenge the so-called \\"old parties\\" of American politics, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\\"Committee of 48 Menaced By Labor: Must Show Compromise Spirit or Laborites Will Go Ahead Alone,\\" New York Times, July 13, 1920, pp. 1, 3. The unification effort was quickly on the rocks, however, as two days of preparatory meetings of conference committees of the two organizations proved unable to agree upon a common program. Bad feelings were in evidence, with at least one member of the Labor Party charging the Committee of 48 with being \\"plutocratic philanthropists trying to use the Labor Party.\\" Moreover, the \\"Forty-Eighters\\" found themselves internally divided between a more conservative bloc based in the East, including top organizational leaders J.A.H. Hopkins, Allen McCurdy, and Amos Pinchot, and a more radical segment of newcomers hailing largely from the Western states, the most prominent spokesman for whom was lawyer Dudley Field Malone. The matter of central difference between the two groups related to the proposed unified organization's position on nationalization of industry, with the Labor Party camp and the Western radical members of the Committee of 48 in favor of the proposition while the Eastern leadership of the \\"Forty-Eighters\\" deeming the matter \\"pre-revolutionary idealism\\" that was far in advance of political realities. Rumors circulated that Western adherents of the Committee of 48 believed their Eastern-based leadership, clearly unhappy with the direction in which the convention was headed, to be stalling unity negotiations in order to bring the unity convention to a stalemate and thereby preserve their organizational independence and personal control. On July 12, the first day of their own scheduled convention, Labor Party activists at the convention therefore issued the Committee of 48 an ultimatum: to either proceed with amalgamation the next day on terms suitable to the Labor Party or else the Labor Party would forward alone, nominating its own candidate for President of the United States and writing its own program in its own name. The Hopkins- McCurdy-Pinchot bloc refused this proposition, and no unification of the two rival organizations was achieved. The Labor Party of the United States went on to nominate Utahn Parley Parker Christensen to head its ticket and conducted its own campaign in the 1920 campaign. The Eastern leaders of the Committee of 48 attempted to put the best face on their inability to construct a unified third party for the November 1920 election, with Allen McCurdy declaring the failure to have been \\"inevitable,\\" while counterintuitively declaring that the inability of the July conventions to unite having revealed \\"more clearly than ever the necessity for a new party.\\" In McCurdy's view, unification had failed owing to the failure of the convention to accept the desires of \\"the responsible leadership of the Committee of 48\\" to establish a \\"great coalition party\\" of \\"believers in American progress,\\" in which organized labor would play only a part. Instead, influenced by the British Labour Party, the adherents of the Labor Party of the United States had opted for a \\"class party devoted to the interests of the workers alone.\\" McCurdy declared: > \\"It is the conviction of the leaders of the Committee of 48 that the rank > and file of the workers of the United States of America do not know what > guild socialism is, do not believe it when they know what it is, and will > not follow a political leadership which has this end in view.\\" The Committee of 48 would continue its efforts to establish a new progressive political party, but on its own terms. Activity in the Conference for Progressive Political Action Over the course of the next two years, members of the Committee of 48 gave support to various insurgent progressive politicians in their campaigns for election. Some of these successful candidacies included the Senatorial campaigns of Non-Partisan League Republican Lynn Frazier in North Dakota and progressive Republican Robert B. Howell in Nebraska, the re-election of La Follette in Wisconsin, and the Gubernatorial campaign of Charles W. Bryan in Nebraska.\\"Committee of 48 Backs Third Party: Executive Chairman Says Plans are Under Way for National Convention,\\" New York Times, November 16, 1922. Executive Chairman J.A.H. Hopkins saw this success of these and other progressive candidacies in the 1922 election to be indicative of a groundswell of support for a new political party to challenge the Republicans and Democrats in an organized manner, announcing to the press that plans were underway for the calling of yet another national convention to launch a new political movement. Dissolution and legacy The failure of the Committee of 48 to establish a viable new progressive capitalist political party owing its own ideological timidity was foreseen even in 1920, when one discouraged Single Tax adherent noted of the failed unity effort of July 1920: > \\"[J.A.H. Hopkins of the Committee of 48] does not seem to see that the > Farmer-Labor Party did not fail, but did just what it went to Chicago to do. > It formed a political party. It matters not whether this party is large or > small. It carried its program through victoriously, and the estimable > bourgeoisie comprising the Committee of 48, for whom these hardened persons > never had anything but the most thinly veiled contempt, melted away when the > burning glass at Carmen's Hall [LP convention site] turned its fierce > intensive rays toward the Hotel Morrison [48ers convention site].... > > \\"Mr. Hopkins still thinks an amalgamation possible on the basis of the > [Committee of 48's] St. Louis platform.

It has a Single Tax plank, or a > plank for the taxation of idle land to force it into use; the Single Tax > Party is in the field with a full Single Tax program.

Formed in 2009, the band's final line-up consisted of vocalist Alex Monty, guitarists Dean Richardson and Tom Green and drummer Tom Hutton. They drew musical influences from a variety of styles, including but not limited to groups such as Devil Sold His Soul, Architects, Underoath, Comeback Kid, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Gallows. The band released their debut album Dead Ends on 21 June 2011 through Mediaskare Records to critical acclaim – it was the first album of the year to receive a KKKKK (5/5) rating by Kerrang! and also gained 8/10 scores from both Metal Hammer and Rocksound magazines. The release saw the band tour extensively with varied number of bands in alternative music like Architects, Biohazard and Attack Attack!. Following the release of their debut album, the band left Mediaskare Records and signed to Transcend Music who released their second and final album Old Lies For Young Lives. In 2014, the band released a three-track EP entitled \\"Strangers\\", which would be their final studio material to be released before their break up. Since their break up in 2014, the former band members have pursued other musical ventures, the most notable being guitarist Dean Richardson joining the band Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes. Former lead vocalist Thomas Debaere has since formed a metalcore band known as \\"Counting Days\\" who released their debut album, Liberated Sounds in 2015. History=Dead Ends (2010–2011) Heights recorded their first studio album at Outhouse Studios in Reading, United Kingdom. It was released on 21 June 2011 to critical acclaim. Kerrang! magazine awarded the album 5/5 and at the time of print was the only album that year to receive full marks. The album also received an 8/10 review from Metal Hammer and RocksoundHeights – Dead Ends, Rocksound Magazine magazines. In support of the album Heights completed a number of tours and festival appearances including their second appearance on the Red Bull Stage at Download Festival 2011. The end of 2011 saw Heights tour alongside Architects, Deaf Havana and Tek One on their most diverse and biggest tour to date. At the end of 2011 Dead Ends was listed in the top 100 albums of the year by Big Cheese magazine, and also noted as Kerrang! editor James McMahon's 10th favourite album of the year. Lineup change and \\"These Streets / Gold Coast\\" (2012) In 2012, Heights continued touring as they supported Biohazard and Attack Attack! on their UK tours. They also announced the end of the Dead Ends era with a special one off show at The Peel in Kingston – the band said this would be the last time fans could hear some songs of the album as they looked towards their next album. In March 2012 the band released two songs for free though their website titled \\"These Streets\\" and \\"Gold Coast\\". Lead track 'These Streets' was premiered exclusively on Daniel P Carter's Radio 1 Rock Show on 13 March and has since received airplay on BBC Radio 1 and XFM. Also in March it was announced that Heights were nominated for 'Best New Band' at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards 2012. After returning from a European tour on 6 May they announced that they had kicked out vocalist Thomas Debaere. The band released no official announcement or explanation for a week and on 10 May announced that bassist Alex Monty would be taking over on vocals and ruining the band alongside a sample titled \\"Heights Is Dead\\". The band announced the position of bass would be left open until the right person was found, and that friends would play live with them until that time. On 4 June the band entered Outhouse Studios in Reading to record their second studio album, with no details on the release announced. During July and August 2012 Heights toured Australia in support of House Vs. Hurricane for the Crooked Teeth tour, they ended the year touring with Architects and While She Sleeps in Europe during October and November. Old Lies for Young Lives (2013–2014) Heights first tour of 2013 was in support of Your Demise in the UK during February 2013. On 11 February 2013, Daniel P Carter premiered their first single \\"Eleven Eyes\\", taken from their second album on the Radio 1 Rock Show. The video was released the following day, featuring Sam Carter as a guest vocalist. Just after the tour, Heights announced that their second album Old Lies For Young Lives was to be released on 29 April 2013, with appearances at Hevy, Summerjam and Slam Dunk festivals scheduled for the summer. Domestically, they scheduled a headlining tour – their first in the UK – covering nine dates from the end of September and into October 2013. Breakup, final release In March 2014, the band announced their break-up, stating that \\"towards the end of last year a couple of us just didn’t feel the same passion that we always relied upon and without that, we all knew it was time. In fact, we’re closer as friends than we’ve ever been, and we plan to spend the last few months and shows enjoying the end to what will forever be something we are all proud of\\". Shortly after the announcement, the band announced a farewell tour across the UK and Europe from September to October 2014, later featuring two other UK bands known as \\"The Catharshits\\" and \\"Echoes\\". The band would also announce a farewell Australian tour spanning the month of September 2014, as well as a South-East Asian tour in the same month. The band would also release a 3 track 7-inch EP entitled \\"Strangers\\" before their last shows. The band's very last show took place in London on October 5, 2014. In 2015, the band uploaded a video to their YouTube channel entitled \\"Cabin Fever\\", documenting their last 25 shows as a band with compiled live footage from the shows.

The wreck lies at around 18 to 20 metres depth off the coast of the small fishing port of La Madrague de Giens on the Giens Peninsula, east of Toulon, on the southern Mediterranean coast of France. Sunk around 75–60 BCE, the vessel has been found to be \\"a large merchantman of considerable tonnage—400 tons deadweight with a displacement of around 550 tons\\", making it one of the largest Roman wrecks excavated, with only the wreck at Albenga, Italy (around 600 tons deadweight) exceeding it at the time of its discovery. The vessel wrecked at Madrague de Giens measured around 40 metres in length; \\"showed a sharp bottom with \\"wine glass\\" section and a prominent keel creating a large leeboard\\"; displayed extended raking of the stem and stern; and had two masts. The hull was characterised by a reverse stempost in the shape of a ram with a big cutwater which \\"must have given... [the] craft high-performance sailing qualities\\". The ship sunk while transporting a large cargo of wine and black glazed pottery from Italy. It is not known why it sank. Archaeological investigation In the summer of 1972 a team of maritime archaeologists of the Archaeological Institute, run jointly in Aix-en-Provence (France) by the University of Provence and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Centre for Scientific Research or CNRS) began what was planned as three years of work on the recently discovered Roman wreck at Madrague de Giens. The archaeological investigations would end up running for 11 seasons, only concluding in 1982, and are notable for first utilising a number of archaeological techniques still used in underwater excavation. Unbeknownst to the team of diver-archaeologists who first began documenting the wreck, the Madrague de Giens vessel would soon be revealed as one of the \\"largest ancient ships whose remains have ever been found under the sea\\". Throughout the excavations the team was led by Andre Tchernia, France's \\"first director of research in underwater archaeology\\" and then assistant director of CNRS, and Patrice Pomey, a maritime archaeologist. The first four years of excavations, undertaken from 1972 to 1975 (with the results published in 1978), focused on the central area of the ship. These excavations established the approximate age of the wreck (around the middle of first century BCE) and determined the cargo the ship was carrying at the time of its sinking. They also helped in determining the origin of the cargo - amphorae from Terracina, Italy and Campanian ceramics and pottery. From 1976 to 1982 excavations focused on the other parts of the wreck not uncovered in previous seasons. The 1976 to 1979 campaigns primarily involved the stern which had been well preserved under 2 to 3 metre deep sediment. Once uncovered, the stern, which is one of the largest and most complete of all Roman wrecks, revealed important information about the construction of the ship. In 1980 focus shifted to the front of the ship. A 4-metre unexcavated area, deemed to be of little interest and not worth the time it would take to excavate, was left between the centre and stern of the wreck as the archaeologists moved to the extreme front of the ship. The stern was abandoned in favour of the bow as what had already been uncovered suggested that parallels might possibly be made between the Madrague de Giens wreck and classical iconography and the archaeologists wished to explore this further. With the bow uncovered it was clear that the shape and proportions of the ship were indeed similar to images created at the time of its wrecking, particularly that of the Ocean God mosaic in the Themetra baths in Tunisia. With the extreme front of the ship recorded, archaeologists moved back towards the centre of the wreck, beginning at the rearmost portion of the 'front' section and working forwards. Throughout the excavations it was discovered that the site may have been heavily impacted by divers who had salvaged from the wreck. After analysis it was concluded that most, if not all, of the salvage operations most likely occurred not long after the ship was wrecked. It appeared that almost half the amphorae had been removed and the site was strewn with rocks (which were most likely used by free divers) from the Giens peninsula. By the end of excavations in 1982 almost all of the wreck had been uncovered, revealing a ship with a concavely profiled bow and a convex stern; a sharp, prominent keel; two masts; and a heavy cargo load, a shape well attested by iconography but not common in the Roman world. Excavation techniques The excavation of the wreck at Madrague de Giens utilised a number of archaeological techniques common in underwater archaeology. Using an air pump objects were carefully extricated and recorded before they were removed. Important artefacts, including each amphora, had a number attached to them. These numbers were designed to be clearly visible throughout excavation and to remain as cataloguing numbers through processing and the eventual storage of the recovered items. Comprehensive stereoscopic photographic recording was undertaken across the site at a number of levels and the hull was carefully examined and partly dismantled to determine how it was built. After excavation concluded in 1982 the wreck at Madrague de Giens was reburied in sand and left on the seabed. Archaeological significance The wreck at Madrague de Giens is significant not only because it is one of the largest Roman vessels ever discovered, or that its excavation was the first “truly scientific underwater excavation carried out in France”, but because it also reveals important information about Roman art. During the excavations Pomey created a detailed, scale plan of the hull which he then compared with a selection of images showing ships from around the same time period as the wreck. He discovered that in several mosaics the proportions and shapes were identical to his own plans, suggesting three things: firstly, that mosaics \\"represent ancient ships with much more realism and accuracy than might be supposed\\"; secondly, that the deteriorated, destroyed or lost parts of the Madrague de Giens wreck (such as the rigging) were likely similar to those displayed in the images; and thirdly, based on the date ranges of the comparable mosaics, \\"that this type of ship was built to a virtually identical pattern for more than three centuries\\". Ship construction The dimensions of Madrague de Giens portray a tall two-masted merchant ship with a displacement of 520 tons implying a total cargo weight of 400 tons, one of the two or three largest ancient ships to be found underwater. It was known as a myriophoroi, capable of carrying 10,000 amphorae. A sharp bottom and prominent keel create a “wine glass” shaped hull with a large leeboard. A strongly curved hull profile and the depth of the keel prevented the ship from drifting, enabling it to sail windward. This hull design is characterized by a reverse stempost with a cutwater, enabling the vessel to compensate for its large, non-specialized, powerful square sails and giving it speed. A schematic of the mortise and tenon technique for shipbuilding that dominated the Mediterranean until the 7th century BC. The vessel contained framing composed of various elements (keel, fore foot, stempost, cutwater, sternpost, inner post, false post), double planking (assembled entirely by mortise-and-tenon joints pegged from the inside) and was covered with a sheet of lead. What is referred to as a large keelson is actually a 7.5m long mast-step timber made of oak which doubles the axial frame. The stringers, nailed onto the frames, reinforced the hull longitudinally. Regularly alternated floor timbers and half frames comprised the framing of the vessel. The wreck indicates the vessel was about 40m long (35.10m remains preserved on the seabed), 9m wide, and 4.5m deep with a length-to-beam coefficient of 4.4(if L=40m, L/W=4.4). This coefficient of elongation-rate of length to width allows the ship to be much faster than those with a lower coefficient. The vessel was built by a method of construction known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame- first construction. The keel, extended by a long fore foot ending with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by mortise (10 to 12 cm deep and 8 cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22 cm long, 8 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick), construction to three strakes. This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, the rest of the framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the upper shell (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6 cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive cutwater, over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame. The deck or ship superstructure has not survived, although a baulk of timber and its supports as found, fitted carefully onto the lowest frames of the hull. This mast-step timber indicates sockets that correspond to a main mast, a foremast, of a bilge pump well, and of various interior architectural characteristics. Kept at a height of 1.10m above the floor of the hold, this well was 1.5m long by 1.25m wide and consisted of four vertical supporting cross-coated plates. Cargo Dressel 1B type amphora Key : 1 : rim - 2 : neck - 3 : handle - 4 : shoulder - 5 : belly or body - 6 : foot The cargo found amongst the wreck site indicates that the wreck at Madrague de Giens belongs to a large Roman merchant vessel. The ship was capable of carrying anywhere between 5800 and 8,000 amphorae, each weighing 50 kilos, a freight of up to 400 tons. Four layers of wine amphorae, stacked in staggered rows, was the typical cargo, but on the final trip, the ship was only holding three layers (6,000-6,500 amphorae) reaching 3m high. Dressel Type 1B, 1.16m [3 ft 10in] high, amphorae with narrow pointed bodies and long cylindrical necks made by the potter Publius Veveius Papus made up the majority of the wine amphorae. Potter’s stamps belonging to Publius Veveius Papus have been found on these amphorae indicating that they were an export from Terracina, a wine-producing area in Southern Italy, where he is known to have had a workshop. Various other types of amphorae were found, which may have been for on board consumption or alternatively may have been additional cargo. The ship of Madrague de Giens was only carrying three layers of amphorae due to the fact that it was also carrying a large load of ceramics, which was placed on top of the amphorae. This extra cargo contained black- glazed ceramics (Campanian) and coarser kitchen wares. The presence of kitchen wares, table wares, and other various objects indicated the cabin area near the stern of the ship.

Her work examined traditional pedagogy and challenged Enlightenment writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. She is often called the German counterpart to Mary Wollstonecraft. There is still little known about Amalia Holst's life. She rose to prominence in the late 1700s through her works as a teacher, although she became more widely recognized in the 1970s after her work was rediscovered and published. Life= Early life  Amalia Holst was born in 1758 in Mecklenburg. She is the daughter of Johanna Maria Magdalena Marchand and Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi and the oldest of six children from her father's second marriage. Her father was a well-known political economist and the Prussian chief inspector of mines. He was also a feminist, who published pieces advocating for improved women's education. When Holst was 10 years old, he was accused of embezzling funds and imprisoned in Küstrin where he died several years later. After her father's death, the family was split up. Their possessions had to be dissolved. Holst's mother went to live with her brother, who was a pastor in Brunswick. Her younger sisters were lodged into a monastery in Potsdam and her brother was admitted into a Danish cadet school. It is unknown what happened to Holst during this time. In large part due to Justi's progressive beliefs, Holst was one of only very few women to receive a college education during this time. She is also said to have received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Kiel.  Marriage and children  Her name appeared again 20 years later in 1791 when at the age of 33, she married Ludolf Holst, a lawyer as well as the director of the Pedagogical Institute in Hamburg-St Georg. They had three children together, one son and two daughters.  Career  That same year she published her first work, Observations on the Errors of our Modern Education by a Practical Teacher (German: Bemerkungen über die Fehler unserer Modernen Erziehung von einer Praktischen Erzieherin) after having supported herself through teaching from a young age. From about 1792–1802, Holst was the headmistress of the preschool that her husband oversaw. During this time, she also opened several small schools in Hamburg, Wittenberg and Boizenburg. These schools were short-lived however, and the reason for their closings is not known. Holst published \\"Letters on Elisa, or Women as they Ought to be\\" (German: “Breife über Elisa, oder das Weib wie es seyn sollte\\"), the second of her three known works, in 1799. It was written in response to the novel, which according to Holst dangerously extolled the marital oppression of the title character. In it she also strongly advocated for marital equality and female autonomy. She argued that women should be defined as human beings first and wives second. This was the beginning of her involvement in a larger debate about feminism occurring during this time. In 1802, Holst published her final work: On the Purpose of Women’s Advanced Intellectual Development (German: Über die Bestimmung des Weibes zur höhern Geistesbildung).  Death and afterward  Holst passed away in Groß-Timkenberg on January 6, 1829. She is memorialized in Judy Chicago's installation art piece The Dinner Party which features a triangular table with 39 place settings, each commemorating important women in history. While she is not given a place setting, her name, along with the names of 998 other feminist icons, is inscribed in gold on the white tile floor below the table. Work= Observations on the Errors of Our Modern Education by a Practical Teacher  Published in 1791, it criticizes widely accepted conservative pedagogical theories, specifically those of Campe and Basedow. Holst analyzes their ideas from the perspective of an educator, and points out the flaws and contradictions within them. She also calls attention to the impractical nature of their ideas.  Letters on Elisa  In 1799 Holst responded to the success of the novel Elisa, which appeared in its fifth edition. She wrote four letters to the title character criticizing the self- sacrificing and submissive role of women. This seems to be her first public push for gender equality. According to Holst, a woman's attachment to her spouse did not detract from her autonomy. However, she also emphasized a woman's responsibility to her domestic duty and referred to her own marriage as \\"a domestic bliss.\\"  On the Purpose of Women’s Advanced Intellectual Development  In this work, Holst makes the case for higher, ungendered education for males and females alike. This notion was very radical: unlike many of the prominent female-education advocates before her such as La Roche, Herder and Goethe, Holst rejected the idea of separate curriculums for each gender, believing that women could and should learn the same things men do. This was not an accepted idea at the time. Her ideas diverged from most her contemporary equal education advocates as well, including the likes of Hippel, Wollstonecraft and Condorcet: while they were in favor of an advanced public coeducation system, Holst insisted on a professional maternal educator who would instruct her children in all academic disciplines from early childhood through adolescence. Only women who were thoroughly educated themselves were fit to educate the next generation, and thus Holst reasoned that every woman was to be educated. She advocated for an in depth knowledge of history, the sciences, philosophy, geography and the arts. Holst stressed that the most important quality of an effective maternal educator was the ability to draw meaningful connections among all disciplines. She also placed an emphasis on individual perfection, urging women to continually engage in intellectual pursuits throughout the course of their lives. She made several demands for female education: * Women were to have complete freedom to study every subject. * They were to be given access to original sources, as opposed to those specifically written for women, which she claimed offered “superficial knowledge” and which “treat [women] like overgrown children.” * Exceptionally intelligent women were to have access to a formal university education. They were also to be free of the pressure to have children. She used the philosophers Kant and Leibniz as examples, noting that both were celibate but their “immortal works, the offspring of their minds, have enriched the world.” Why then, Holst argued, shouldn't the same apply to women? * It was to be accepted that women were capable of achieving in the most advanced fields of thought. Holst asserts “there exists no proof that a woman’s mind cannot comprehend the higher sciences.” References 1758 births 1829 deaths German women academics German feminists Education writers 18th-century German educators 18th-century German writers 18th-century German women writers 19th-century German educators 19th-century German writers 19th-century German women writers 19th-century women educators ","title":"Amalia Holst"},{"id":"36032254","text":"The Battle of Collejares also known as the Battle of los Collejares was a battle of the Spanish Reconquista that took place in 1406 at Collejares nearby the towns of Úbeda and Baeza in Granada, Spain. The battle was fought between the Kingdom of Castile, whose forces were commanded by Henry III of Castile, and the Emirate of Granada, whose troops were commanded by Sultan Muhammad VII.  Battle  The Kingdom of Castile had signed a peace treaty with the Nasrid dynasty who controlled the Emirate of Granada. Power struggles and changes in the court of the Emirate of Granada prompted them to break the cease fire. Muhammad VII, encouraged and aided by the Marinid Dynasty of Morocco, invaded the territory of Murcia. Henry III of Castile, who had completed a series of battles against Portugal, saw his opportunity to counter the Granadan threat after signing a peace treaty with the Portuguese in 1402. One of the more famous Castilian knights that participated in this campaign was Juan de Tovar y Toledo, who was given land and title in part for his actions at Collejares.

Initially, the school offered only its own diploma in Internationale Betriebswirt (International Business Administration). However, unlike the whose name it resembled, the IBS diploma was not recognized by the German state. In 2000, IBS began a partnership with the University of Lincoln whereby the British university would deliver and award a BA in Management and an MBA to IBS students via distance learning. The BA would require only two more years of study following acquisition of the IBS diploma. In their advertising, IBS claimed that students would receive a \\"double degree\\" (from both Lincoln University and IBS) that was \\"nationally and internationally recognized\\". In fact, this was not the case. Neither degree was recognized in Germany. For a foreign university BA to be recognized in Germany at that time, students were required to have attended that university for three full years.Schwertfeger, Bärbel (22 August 2005). \\"Geld zurück wegen arglistiger Täuschung\\". Der Spiegel. Retrieved 18 May 2018 . This led to numerous legal complaints from students. IBS was also the subject of harsh criticism for deceptive practices and the low quality of its teaching in the 2002 book Die Bluff-Gesellschaft by . In early 2005, a student at the Bad Nauheim branch sued IBS for \\"malicious deception\\" concerning the status of the degrees it offered. The judgement of the Frankfurt Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court) awarded the student a full refund of tuition fees, further compensatory damages, and legal costs. By 2005 the partnership with University of Lincoln had ended, and similar partnerships were struck with the University of Surrey to deliver an MBA and the University of Sunderland to deliver a BA in management. By that time IBS was describing itself as an \\"American-style management academy\\" and a \\"private alternative to the university\\". The degrees on offer were no longer described as \\"nationally and internationally recognized\\". A fourth IBS branch was established in Nuremberg in 2006. The other three branches (Lippstadt, Bad Nauheim, and Berlin) ultimately closed. In April 2018, the Director of IBS Nuremberg, Thomas Nau, announced that the school would cease operation in 2021 and would accept no further students after the 2018 summer term. He cited the steady decline in student enrollment as the principal reason for the impending closure. At the time of the announcement, the school had a total enrollment of 90 students. It was unclear how many of those were enrolled in the University of Sunderland degree programs. The University of Surrey partnership had ended by that time. Programmes As of 2018, the school has several bachelor's programs in business and management. These are all delivered and awarded by the University of Sunderland in the UK.

He became famous for his monetary theory on seigniorage, which sees money from a different view - one that is of the jurisprudence. His idea theorized why currency has value and why it must be issued by governments and not banks. This ideal led to many public initiatives such as reform of the private banking system and the Bank of Italy. Biography Giacinto Auriti was born on October 10, 1923. He graduated in Rome, where he also became an academic, teaching Maritime, International, Private, and Comparative Law. Auriti was among the founding teachers and was the dean of the faculty of law at the University of Teramo, established in 1993. He is the author of several texts on the subject of Maritime Law. In the last period of his life, despite never having formally studied economic theory, he started teaching the subject and covering topics raised by the American poet Ezra Pound. He pioneered monetary law as an academic discipline in the University of Teramo—developing an economic theory that outlines how currency - as a measure of value and as such conventionally accepted by those who use it as a medium of exchange - is a \\"tool\\" for the exchange of goods (the theory of the induced value of money). His theory is that those who accept the convention of a currency's value, have the right to own it at its inception (the people's ownership of money). In this sense, the central banks are private corporations, who according to Auriti derive undue profits from seigniorage on the issue of paper money, assuming responsibility for an important source of public debt. This theory draws more power from the abolition of the direct relationship between money (convertible into gold) and gold reserve, established by the Bretton Woods initiative launched by the Richard Nixon administration on 15 August 1971. It, thereafter, transformed the business of issuing currency and further emphasized the conventional nature of monetary value created by the acceptance by the people of this convention. The SAUS and the Bank of Italy In the 90's, Giacinto Auriti conducted a series of initiatives as Secretary General of the \\"Union of Anti- Usury\\" (SAUS) and as a legal representative of the cultural association, \\"Alternative social property of people.\\" One of his initiatives was a request filed before the Court of Rome asking for the currency, at the time of issuance, to be owned by the Italian citizens. He also questioned the legality of the then existing system of monetary emission, leading to the transformation of the Central Bank as the managing body responsible for monetary values and policy. Auriti's theory viewed the issued banknotes as mere promissory notes and false bills of exchange issued by the banks. It was considered false because the bank promise gold that it did not have.Auriti, p. 34. Instead of gold, Auriti argued that the currency has an induced value and prediction value, which are created by social convention. The Bank of Italy opposed the request. Consequently, Auriti wrote, \\"The vision of the currency and monetary functions which the petitioner intends to credit is clearly distorted and completely unfounded\\" ... \\"Acceptance by the community, far from being due to the value of the coin, it is really just the effect, so the syllogism must be reversed; it is true that the currency is accepted as true, but if anything, as the story and the news are demonstrating that it is only accepted as having value. Hence the need for this value, responding to a fundamental public interest, should be defended and guaranteed by public authorities, were assigned to function in modern central banks.\\" The Bank of Italy posited that the coinage is an expression of state sovereignty, and therefore \\"the value of the currency draws its basis only and only by rules of the road, which, usually, regulate in detail the creation and circulation of currency shall stipulate the discharging effect, punishing the failure to accept it as payment and protect the public trust against the falsification and alteration.\\" On the question of ownership of the money raised by Auriti in the same proceeding, the Bank of Italy said: \\"The question is then plaintiff, even in substance, devoid of the slightest foundation.\\" Because it is based on \\"the premise is completely wrong\\" missing \\"in our law a law stating that the owner of the coin on the issue.\\" The appropriation of money by the Bank of Italy, the argument of the Bank, in Auriti \\"is based on a tradition of interpretation in violation of law.\\" But, notes the Bank, \\"tickets just produced by the workshop production of the Bank of Italy are a mere commodity owned by the Central Bank, who is directly printing and assume the related costs (Article 4, paragraph 5 of Act no. 204/1910)\\". Purchasing function and the value of money only when the Bank of Italy markets them and transfer the property to the recipients. The entry ticket is with operations that the Bank independently concluded \\"with the Treasury, with the banks, with foreign countries and with the money and capital markets, provided all operations and fully regulated by law and the Statute of the Bank of Italy (Articles 25 to 42 of the Act no. 204/1910 and Articles. from 41 to 53 of the Statute)\\". So- called \\"abnormal and far-fetched\\" theory Auriti for which \\"there is a tradition of interpretation in violation of law, under which the central bank when they issue mutual Italian State and the National Collective, all the money puts into circulation.\\" The coin is placed in the market according to operations under and governed by law, with which the Bank of Italy transfers ownership of the tickets. These assets are recorded as assets or liabilities in the accounts of the Bank who purchases or receives in return pledge assets or securities (bonds, currencies, etc.) That end up as an asset. In addition, the Official Gazette, as required by law, such transactions monthly reports. Adds that the Bank considered that it itself must bear the cost of manufacture of the tickets and stamp duty, while the annual profits, made withdrawals and distributions mentioned in Article 54 of the Statute are donated to the State pursuant to art. 23 of Act no. 204/1910, shows \\"the absolute inconsistency and absurdity of the thesis\\" of Auriti, according to which \\"the supply of money would be made by the Bank of Italy, charging the state and society at large the full amount without consideration.\\" Therefore, the Bank concludes, \\"there is no experience of anything arbitrary or unlawful within the prerogatives exercised by the Central Bank in the monetary field, because, contrary to what is alleged by the plaintiff, the whole subject is fully regulated by the legislature, so assigned or that any matter relating to the exercise of the function of emission can be said to be regulated by customs interpret and, least of all, by customs violation of law.\\" The request was rejected and the Court condemned Auriti to pay the legal costs. Following two bills, on 11 January 1995, presented by Senator Luigi Natali and signed by 17 other Senators of the Republic are part of five different parties, ranging from Communist Refoundation to the National Alliance and on 11 February 1997, by Senator Antonino Monteleone of the National Alliance, Auriti's thesis was implemented, even if the Senate does not discuss anything, as totally baseless. The Experiment of SIMeC In 2000, Auriti together with the help of mayor of the Democratic Party Mario Palmerio conducted an experiment in his hometown Guardiagrele by launching an alternative currency known as SIMeC, in order to prove his theories on the creation of value of currency by nationality. The experiment developed in two phases. First, the starter served to enter the SIMeC-use community that induced value that objectifies as a real asset, being owned by the carrier making it a parallel currency. Second, was the creation of an Income for the Department of Citizenship to promote 'initiative', which was moderately successful, because SIMeC were sold at par in exchange for pounds and withdrawn twice the original value. The costs were borne by the same Giacinto Auriti. Following an intervention by the Guardia di Finanza on a disposition of the Prosecutor of Chieti, the SIMeC in circulation, however, were confiscated. Despite the subsequent lifting of the seizure, the experiment was stopped. The Syndicate wear in 2001, to promote a bill of popular initiative (\\"Acceptance of EURO: basic income owned by the carrier\\") but does not collect the necessary signatures. In 2004, he ran for the elections to the European Parliament on the list \\"Social Alternative\\" by Alessandra Mussolini. On 30 May 2011, Auriti theories were repeatedly referenced in the parliament by Antonio Di Pietro, who was asking for assistance in European fora.

The battle pitted the Muslim troops of the Nasrid Emirate of Granada and its Moroccan allies against those of the Kingdom of Castile and resulted in a victory for the Emirate of Granada. The battle The Nasrid Emirate of Granada was engulfed in a civil war and was regularly devastated by Castilian forces who saw an opportunity for easy plunder due to the distraction of the Muslim forces. Muhammad II asked for help from his Moroccan allies to ease the difficulty of fighting two wars at once. The Sultan, the Marinid Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq, landed on the Iberian Peninsula in 1275 with an army and began a campaign with the strategic objective to occupy the city of Tarifa. The Castilian King, Alfonso X of Castile was abroad at the time and the country was ruled by his son, infante Ferdinand acting as regent. He immediately raised some troops and moved south but unexpectedly died of natural causes in Villa Real in August 1275. While marching north, the Muslim forces encountered a Castilian army under the command of Nuño González de Lara \\"el Bueno\\", member of the House of Lara and adelantado mayor de Andalucia, who attempted to cut off the Marinid route near the town of Écija. The Marinid forces routed the Castilian army and Nuño González de Lara was killed in the action or shortly thereafter. The Marinid Sultan ordered that Nuño González' head be cut off, sending it as a trophy to the Sultan of Granada, Muhammad II and cementing his alliance with them which would continue for the next few years against the Castilian forces. In October, a second army led by Archbishop Sancho of Toledo met a similar defeat in the battle of Martos. The kingdom in the end was saved by the infante Sancho of Castile who rallied the Castilian forces. At the end of the year, King Alfonso X of Castile was forced to sign a peace treaty with the Muslims.

Malayisation (Commonwealth spelling) or Malayization (North American and Oxford spelling) is a process of assimilation and acculturation, that involves acquisition (, literally \\"embracing Malayness\\") or imposition ( or Melayuisasi) of elements of Malay culture, in particular, Islam and the Malay language, as experienced by non-Malay populations of territories fully controlled or partially influenced by historical Malay sultanates and modern Malay-speaking countries. It is often described as a process of civilisational expansion, drawing a wide range of indigenous peoples into the Muslim, Malay-speaking polities of Maritime Southeast Asia. Examples of Malayisation have occurred throughout Asia including in Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. An early form of Malayisation occurred during the territorial and commercial expansion of Melaka Sultanate in the 15th century, which spread the Classical Malay language, culture, and the religion of Islam to the Maritime Southeast Asia. Following the demise of Melaka in the early 16th century, instances of this assimilation of people from different ethnic origins into Malay culture, continued under numerous Malay-Muslim sultanates that emerged in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. Malayisation could either be voluntary or forced and is most visible in the case of territories where the Malay language or culture were dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status. The ultimate manifestation of this cultural influence can be observed in the present dominant position of Malay language and its variants in Maritime Southeast Asia, the establishment of ethnic Malays realm within the region, the forming of new cultures such as the Peranakan, and the development of many Malay trade and creole languages. In linguistics, the term Malayisation may refer to the adaptation of oral or written elements of any other language into a form that is more comprehensible to a speaker of Malay; or in general, of altering something so that it becomes Malay in form or character. Early history A typical Baju melayu assemble, worn together with the songket. Baju Melayu traces its origin to the 15th century Malacca Sultanate, and today is one of the most important symbol of Malay culture. There is significant genetic, linguistic, cultural, and social diversity among modern Malay subgroups, mainly attributed to centuries of migration and assimilation of various ethnic groups and tribes within Southeast Asia. Historically, the Malays are descended from the Malayic- speaking Austronesians, various Austroasiatic tribes, Cham and Funan settlers of ancient polities in coastal areas of Malay peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo; Brunei, Old Kedah, Langkasuka, Gangga Negara, Old Kelantan, Negara Sri Dharmaraja, Malayu and Srivijaya. The coming of Islam to Southeast Asia constituted a new era in Malay history. The new religion transformed many aspects of the old Hindu-Buddhist-Animistic cultural practices and beliefs of the people and imbued it with an Islamic worldview. Beginning 12th century, the old polities were soon gradually superseded by Islamic kingdoms across the region. The most important of these was Melaka Sultanate, established around 1400 CE. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, Melaka exercised its special role not only as a trading centre, but also as the centre of Islamic learning, therefore promoting the development of Malay literary traditions. The blossoming of Malay literature in this era had transformed the Classical Malay dialect of Melaka, enabling it to attain the linguistic prestige. As a result, growth in trade between Melaka and the rest of the archipelago has made the dialect to spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world, and eventually became a lingua franca of Maritime Southeast Asia. It was then further evolved into Bahasa Melayu pasar (\\"Bazaar Malay\\") or Bahasa Melayu rendah (\\"Low Malay\\"), which generally believed as a form of pidgin influenced by contact between Malay and Chinese traders. The most important development, has been that pidgin Malay creolised, creating several new languages such as the Ambonese Malay, Manado Malay and Betawi language. Malays and the Javanese, hand-coloured copper engraving from Jan Huyghen van Linschoten's, Itinerario, 1596. The legend reads \\"Inhabitants of Malacca, the best speakers, the most polite and the most amorous of the East Indies. Inhabitants of Java, who are hard-headed and obstinate.\\" The period of Melaka was also known as the era of Malay ethnogenesis, signified by strong infusion of Islamic values into Malay identity, and the flourish of various important aspects of Malay culture. The term 'Melayu' (\\"Malay\\") to refer to a distinct group of people had been clearly defined, to describe the cultural preferences of the Melakans as against foreigners from the same region, notably the Javanese and Thais. The cara Melayu ('ways of Malay'), were the cara Melaka ('ways of Melaka'); in language, dress, manners, entertainments and so forth, might be referred to as 'Malay', and this Melaka-based culture or civilisation was acknowledged right across the archipelago. The aboriginal communities from Orang Asli and Orang Laut who constituted a majority original population of Melaka were also Malayised and incorporated into the hierarchical structure of Melaka. Successfully did Melakan rulers equate the kingdom with \\"Melayu\\" that one Malay text describes how, after a defeat, the people of Melaka fled into the jungle where they became Jakun, that is Orang Hulu ('upriver people'). It shows that, without the mantle of Melaka's prestige, the local inhabitants were undifferentiated from the other non-Malay elements in neighbouring areas. The Melakans were described by European travellers as \\"white\\", well- proportioned, and proud. The men normally wear cotton garments (sarongs) which cover them only from the waist down, but a few of the more distinguished wear short, silk coats, under which they carry krisses. Their women, who are olive- coloured, comely, and brunette, usually wear fine silk garments and short shirts. Nobody but the Sultan may wear yellow colours without special permission under pain of death. The faces of the natives are broad with wide noses and round eyes. Both sexes are well-mannered and devotees of all forms of refined amusement, especially music, ballads, and poetry. The rich pass life pleasantly in their country homes at Bertam which are surrounded by bountiful orchards. Most of them maintain separate establishments in the city from which they conduct their business. They take offence easily and will not permit anyone to put his hand on their head or shoulders. Often malicious and untruthful, they take pride in their ability to wield the kris adroitly against their personal enemies. In larger engagements they fight in bands with bows and arrows, spears and krises. In their beliefs, they are devout Muslims. Their language \\"is reported to be the most courteous and seemelie speech of all the Orient.\\" It is readily learned by foreigners, and is the lingua franca for the entire region. Later Malay sultanates A copy of Undang-Undang Melaka ('Laws of Melaka'). The Melaka system of justice as enshrined in the text was the first digest of laws, compiled in the Malay world, and became a legal resource for other major regional sultanates like Johor, Perak, Brunei, Pattani and Aceh. After Melaka was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511, and the ruling family had established a successor polity in Johor, it would appear that the 'ways of Malay' continued to be fostered and began to have an influence in surrounding sultanates. Startling even to the Portuguese conquerors was the extent to which most of Sumatra's east coast had been influenced by its neighbour across the straits; almost all urban elites spoke Melakan Malay, and they also acknowledged not only correct speech but also good manners and appropriate behaviour, as Malay custom. The role of Melaka as a model also becomes evident, when comparing its law codes with those of other succeeding Malay sultanates. Malay language was one aspect of the prestige of the sultanates and considered as a language of the learned in Southeast Asia in 17th and 18th century comments. An 18th-century European account even suggests that one is not considered a very broadly educated man in the east unless he understands Malay. Such observations on the influence of the Malay language and kingship concepts relate to the inter-monarchical context. At the local level, individual Malay sultanates all over the archipelago that usually based on rivers and often close to the coast, exercised sufficient attractiveness, or suasion, to foster a process of assimilation. They were operating on a range of frontiers - in Sumatra, Borneo and the Peninsula - where non-Muslim peoples, in many cases the tribal communities, were gradually being brought into Malay realm: learning to speak the Malay language, adopting Islam, changing their customs and style of dress and assuming roles of one type or another within the expanding sultanates. In an early example from eastern Sumatra, the 15th century Sultanate of Aru, believed to be the precussor of Malay Sultanate of Deli, is described in the Melaka-Johor chronicle as being of Batak origin. European observations on the same region from the 19th century suggests that people further upstream on the rivers of Deli, people who had long had a trading relationships with the coast, and were later called Karo Batak, were being incorporated in the Deli Sultanate. The Batak and Malay distinction was not racial but cultural, and by converting to Islam and taking on Malay dress and culture, the Batak could become Malay. Both European and Malay writings show them being tutored in the new culture, receiving Malay titles such as Orang Kaya Sri di Raja as part of the process of conversion. Similar developments were underway in Asahan, to the south, and on the Barus frontier in the northwest of Sumatra where entry to the new sphere entailed not only a change in manners an clothing styles, but also the adoption of the Islamic religion and the Malay language. On the peninsula, the effects of the continued contacts between the non-Malays with Malay-dominated centre is suggested in a 19th-century account of Pahang, which mentions that some of the natives who had strong trading ties with the Malays had begun to emulate their speech and dress. The population of Pattani also has been described as partly aboriginal in origin. In the case of Johor, the aboriginal people who were reported in the 19th century to be speaking Aslian languages, were called 'Malay' a century later. It has been suggested that these people would probably have joined the Jakun first before becoming Malay. The Jakun are described as being similar to Malays in their kinship arrangements, but resistant to aspects of social structure as well as the Islamic religion of the Malays. In 17th century Cambodia, a polity renowned for its Buddhism, king Ramathipadi I converted to Islam, took the name Muhammad Ibrahim, married a Malay Muslim of a princely Cham family, had his courtiers wear krisses and used Malay language in correspondence. During the same century in Champa, a once powerful Indianized polity but by that time retreating before the advancing Vietnamese, the rulers held the title Paduka Seri Sultan which is so common in the Malay polities. These rulers were in close contact with the peninsula, in particular Kelantan. French missionaries reported the presence of scribes and religious scholars from Kelantan right into the 19th century. It was believed that Kelantanese who eventually helped to give the Cham struggle against the Vietnamese, the character of a religious crusade. In Brunei Sultanate, many of the Muslim subjects of the Sultan were converts from local Dayak groups. Acculturation had also taken place in Sarawak and Northern Borneo (modern day Sabah), where Brunei Sultanate and by the 18th century the Sulu Sultanate were collecting products for China and other markets, and establishing a fairly loose, river based governmental presence. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Brunei hierarchy, being given Malay titles such as Datuk, Temenggong and Orang Kaya. What had once been independent villages were gradually built into wider units, and their leaders co-opted into the hierarchy of the polity. A colonial writing about Sarawak, observed that many non-Malays would be amazed to learn the degree to which the present Malay population derives from the local native sources, and among the latter are Sea (Iban) and Land Dayaks (Bidayuh). In northeastern Borneo, the Bulungan Malays appear to be of Kayan origin. Further down the east coast, the Paser polity had extended its influence into the Barito-speaking Dayak, and some of these people became Muslim and were eventually referred to as 'Paser Malays'. In southern Borneo, the Malay-speaking Sultanate of Banjar had been pushing inland since the 17th century, bringing Dayaks into its Muslim culture. In the west, the development of such sultanates of Sambas, Sukadana and Landak tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people. An examination of the spread of the Malay culture should not neglect the Philippines, where things may have developed differently only because of the Spanish Conquest that had morphed the archipelago into an isolated-colony. The influence of the Brunei sultanate in the Luzon region before Spanish rule is well recorded. In 1521, the ruler of Maynila known as Rajah Matanda, was a grandson of Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, and \\"Borneans\\" were described as introducing Islam to the natives of Balayan, Manila, Mindoro and Bonbon. A further account declared that the \\"Borneans\\" and the people of Luzon had become 'almost one people', and their clothing styles and ceremonies and customs were certainly similar. When Magellan expedition visited the Philippines Islands, the Malay language was used for communication, and linguistic research has revealed the extent to which Malay had become a 'prestige language'. This is partly evidenced by the fact that key terms from the Malay kingship system entered local languages. These include titles such as datu dan laksamana, and the words for 'rank' (pangkat), 'sitting legs crossed' (bersila), 'treason' (derhaka), 'magical chanting' (mantera) and 'story' (hikayat). Malayisation also occurred in the form of acculturation, in addition to complete assimilation into Malay identity. In this way, it shaped the ethnocultural development of creole ethnic group such as Betawi, Banjar, Peranakan, Jawi Peranakan, Kristang, Chitty and so forth. Such acculturation process was also reflected by assimilation of immigrants from other part of Maritime Southeast Asia, commonly known as anak dagang ('traders'), into the established Malay communities, aided by similarity in lifestyle and common religion (Islam). Among these immigrant communities, some cultural elements of Malay origin were later combined in various forms and degrees with their own elements, which partly retained. Notable groups including the Javanese, Minangkabau and Bugis Malays. Contemporary events=Malaysia Siti Nurhaliza, the most prominent Malay pop star of her era, performing in full traditional Malay costume. She is credited with having introduced and popularised the Malay traditional pop culture throughout the Malay world. The Malay peninsula, now an important part of Malaysia, has been the stronghold of Malay sultanates for centuries. As the entire peninsular was consolidated under Melaka's rule in the 15th century, it became the core of the Malay world since then, thus earning its name Tanah Melayu (\\"Malay land\\") in Malay language. The traditional institutions of sultanates in the peninsula survived the colonisation, and were incorporated into the blueprints of the modern state in 1948. Ultimately, Malay rulers remained at the highest hierarchical order of the society, in accordance with what commonly referred as Ketuanan Melayu (\\"Malay supremacy\\"). Malayness has been conceived as fundamental basis for state's ideology and it became the main driving force for Malay nationalism in a struggle against British colonisation. The state itself is largely organised around the idea of maintaining the special status of Malays as the first among equals of the Bumiputra communities. The historical identification of the Malays with Islam was entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia. The article defines specifically a \\"Malay\\" as a person who professes the religion of Islam, habitually speaks the Malay language and conforms to Malay custom. The Malaysian government also has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the 1971 National Culture Policy, which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. The government has historically made little distinction between \\"Malay culture\\" and \\"Malaysian culture\\". Although it has been a subject of criticism even by the Malays themselves, the notion of becoming a Muslim means Masuk Melayu (entering Malayness) remains popular. This could have been caused by the centuries-old unclear distinction between \\"Islamisation\\" and \\"Malayisation\\", for there is a high tendency of the new revertees having eventually Malayised by the dominant Malay-Muslim culture. Peninsular Malaysia is home to a small indigenous tribal populations, collectively known as Orang Asli. The Malayic speakers among them, already share a common cultural-historical background with the Malays, who can therefore easily see them as \\"incomplete\\" Malays, requiring only Islam and an acceptance of social hierarchy to make them \\"complete\\". There are also those who speak languages unrelated to Malay, such as Aslian-speakers, are not quite so easily seen as incomplete Malays, but the gap can be closed to a considerable extent by conversion to Islam. Governmental agencies, both state and federal, including for many years the JHEOA (now known as JAKOA) itself, have accordingly spent much effort in converting the Orang Asli to Islam. The motivation for this is sometimes authentically religious, but it is more usually seen primarily as the means of Malayisation. Governmental policy towards Orang Asli has long proposed their integration into the broader Malaysian community should be brought about by assimilating them specifically into the Malay community, which by local custom and national law is Sunni Muslim by religion. JHEOA officers have been heard to comment that the Orang Asli \\"problem\\" - usually defined as that of poverty - would disappear if they became Muslims, and hence Malays. In September 1996, for example, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Land and Co-operative Development, Nik Mohamed Zain Nik Yusof, gave the following justification for the Federal government's newly announced review of legislation relating to Orang Asli land rights: \\"If these amendments are made, Orang Asli can be more easily integrated into Malay society. It will help them to embrace Islam and follow Malay customs too\\". The impact of this institutionalised assimilation efforts has been tremendous to the demographics in certain area of the peninsular. One instance was in the Sedili valley, where modern anthropologists discovered in the 1970s that villages formerly reported by travellers to be Jakun, are now Malay communities. In the multi-ethnic state of Sabah, the period of Mustapha Harun leadership (1967–1976) saw the processes of Malayisation and Islamisation, which from the federal government's view appeared to be a check on Kadazandusun nationalism and was therefore perceived as an integration and unifying process with the other native Muslim society, namely the Bajaus, Bruneis, Sungei and Ida'an. The then-mostly pagan Kadazandusun traditionally formed minority of a third of the state population and inhabited the western shores of Sabah. The successor Berjaya government under Harris Salleh continued the same policies. The state government promoted Malay language in government-aided schools, sponsored the Quran-reading competitions and organised various dawah activities. All these the Berjaya government considered to be in line with the spirit of Article 12(2) of the Constitution of Malaysia that provide legitimacy for the state to promote and assist in the funding of Islamic institutions and instruction, the core of which was to be derived from Malay-Muslim elements. Brunei The traditional Malay notion of fealty to a ruler, charged to protect Islam in his territory, is still central in both Malaysia and Brunei. In Brunei, this has been institutionalised under the state ideology of Melayu Islam Beraja (\\"Malay Islamic Monarchy\\"). As a still functioning Malay sultanate, Brunei places Islamic institutions at the centre of the state's interest. It retains an elaborated Malay social hierarchy central to the community. As a result, there are two kind of Malayness in Brunei: the general Malay cultural pattern to which most of the population have by now assimilated, and the higher ranking social position labelled as \\"Berunai\\" which distinguishes some of those cultural-Malays from others. The other main community, the Kedayans, still rank lower, despite being Muslims and living in a manner virtually identical to that of the Orang Berunai. Thus, unlike what happens elsewhere, assimilation to Malay cultural pattern in Brunei does not necessarily eradicate difference. Singapore Singapore was once the powerhouse of sophisticated Malay cultural production, until Kuala Lumpur took over in the 1970s. Although usually thought of as an essentially Chinese city, Singapore was nevertheless a Malay city. Contrary to the stereotype, Malays were the most urbanised of the island's three main races, and there was no such concentration of urbanised Malays anywhere else in the Malay world. Here were produced a high proportion of the modernist Malay writings, including novels and newspapers, that generated Malay nationalism. The emergence of Singapore- Malay community was added to by intermarriage with Arabs, Indian Muslims and Peninsula Malays immigrants, as well as the adoption of Chinese babies. In other words, Singapore's Malayness was a creolised culture, closer in character to the Pesisir (coastal) Malay culture that had developed elsewhere in the archipelago than to the kind of Malayness that characterised the Malay world proper of Peninsula and Sumatra. In Singapore itself, assimilation to Malayness was and is purely cultural, with no guiding hand to police it. Indonesia Maimun Palace in Medan, a reminder of 19th century opulence of Malay Deli Sultanate. Although today the sultanate still crowned their sultan, he holds no actual political power, absorbed into North Sumatran provincial government. Historically, Indonesia was home to a number of Malay sultanates that were involved in the process of Malayisation throughout the archipelago. Three main elements of Malayisation; Malay monarchy or fealty to Malay ruling sultan, the preeminence of Malay identity (which include superiority of ethnic Malay and Malay language), and supremacy of Islam as the official religion, has no official recognition in modern Indonesian statehood. This is mostly because the pluralism and diversity policy enshrined in Pancasila national ideology that avoid domination of certain group over another. Contrary to Brunei and Malaysia, a major component of Malayness — fealty to a ruling sultan — was removed from the modern Indonesian republican ideology. The formation of the Java-centered Indonesia saw the effective destruction of the functioning of the Malay sultanates. Indonesian republican outlook regard monarchy as a form of ancient feudalism and incompatible to modern democratic statehood envisioned by Indonesian founding fathers. The movement against ruling monarch mainly led by leftist and nationalist that seek to dismantle traditional royal institution. In March 1946, a major uprising breaks out against several Malay-Muslim Sultanates and rich Malay classes in East Sumatra, removing the traditional feudal social structure in the region. Today, several regional kingdoms or sultanate survive, despite holding no actual political power and without real authority, being replaced by provincial governatorial administration. The exception is Javanese Yogyakarta Sultanate that won special region status, mostly owed to the sultanate's bid and support for Indonesian Republic during Indonesian National Revolution. These sultanates and kingdoms are only recognised as the custody of local culture, arts and traditions, although they might still enjoyed prestiges and held in high esteem especially among local community. Officially, Malayness has no special position in Indonesian state ideology, except as one of the constituent regional cultures — which tend to be represented on a province-by- province basis. Loyalty for a certain ethnic group was overshadowed with the new inter-ethnic loyalty, advocating the importance of the national unity and national identity of Bangsa Indonesia (\\"Indonesian nation\\") instead. Despite having widespread influence in the archipelago, ethnic Malay is only recognised as one of myriad Indonesian ethnic groups, which enjoy equal status with other Indonesians such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minang, Dayak, Chinese Indonesian, Ambonese and Papuan. Despite being the source of the Indonesian national language, Malay itself has been degraded as a mere local dialect in Sumatra, equal in status with Minangkabau, Acehnese and Batak languages. Compared to local Malay dialects in Sumatra, Indonesian language develop further which absorbs rich terminology and vocabulary from other Indonesian native languages, also rich variations of local dialects across Indonesia. Despite enjoying the status as overwhelming majority, Islam is recognized just as one among six official religions recognized in Indonesia; together with Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. There is also no legal law, apart from family and peer pressure, to restrict Malay Indonesians to Islam. The strength of nationalist sentiments, rapidly progressing democracy, the destruction of the sultanates, and rampant Javanisation, ushered in a prolonged period of Malay political acquiescence, significantly reducing the momentum of Malayisation in Indonesia. Cambodia Cham girls, wearing Baju Kurung. The strong influence of Malaysia in religious education has involved a degree of Malayisation among the Cham community in Cambodia, including the wearing of Malay dress and the study of the Malay language. The many thousands of Chams who were allowed into Malaysia as refugees from the war in Indochina tended to be referred to by Malays in Malaysia as Melayu Champa (\\"Champa Malays\\") or Melayu Kemboja (\\"Cambodian Malays\\"). Another community in Cambodia, the Chvea who tend to live in villages in the southern region of Kampot, are a separate community from the Chams, who have illustrious historic roots in Vietnam. The Khmer- speaking Chvea are distinct from the Cham, and preferred to be called as 'Khmer Islam', so as not to draw attention to their foreignness. Nevertheless, they use Malay language religious materials, write in the Jawi script, and many also speak Malay. Both Chvea and Cham have in recent years been drawn into pan-Malay conferences and networks promoted primarily by Malaysia. Sri Lanka Sri Lankan Malay Father and Son, 19th century There is a sizeable Malay community in Sri Lanka, descended from soldiers, convicts, and political exiles brought from Dutch and British colonies of East Indies and Malaya. The Sri Lankan Creole Malay varieties spoken by the community, are currently endangered as they are no longer spoken by the younger generation. However, in recent years, there are efforts in sharpening the sense of Malay identity by promoting the usage of 'standard Malay' language. This move was ideologically favoured by the urban segment of the community as it enables them to feel linked to the larger Malay groups in Southeast Asia. The community's effort to teach standard Malay to its members is largely aided by the Malaysian government through its high commission in Colombo. The high commission conducted courses in standard Malay, exclusively for members of the Malay community, and those who fared best were trained as language teachers in Malaysia. They were then expected to teach 'standard' Malay to their respective communities in Sri Lanka. These initiatives were welcomed and appreciated by the community. The language programmes and trips to Malaysia were made possible through the offices of the Gabungan Persatuan Penulis Nasional (GAPENA - the Federation of National Writers' Association of Malaysia). The Malays of Sri Lanka are constantly wooed by the Malaysian government, which chose to conduct the second GAPENA conference in Colombo in 1985, arranges periodic visits by representatives of the Malaysian government to the Malay Club in Colombo where grants are given for various community projects, and finances occasional trips to Malaysia for members of the community to attend conferences and seminars at the expense of the Malaysian state. The Indonesian government, however, does not seem to have similar aggressive efforts through its embassy in Colombo. As a result, although the Sri Lankan Malays are predominantly of Indonesian origins (especially Javanese), an attempt by a Sri Lanka 'Indonesian' Organization to reconstitute them as 'Indonesians', was declined.

The office has three primary functions: * privacy functions, conferred by the Privacy Act 1988 and other laws * freedom of information functions, in particular, oversight of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act * government information policy functions, conferred on the Australian Information Commissioner under the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. The office is an agency within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The office liaises with the Business and Information Law Branch, part of the Civil Law Division within the Civil Justice and Legal Services Group of the Attorney- General's Department. However, the office is an independent agency and reports directly to the Parliament of Australia, not to the Attorney-General. The current Australian Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner is Angelene Falk, who was appointed in August 2018.  History  The first Australian Privacy Commissioner was appointed in 1989 to the former Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulatory body until 2010. Major changes to federal freedom of information (FOI) law made in 2010 established the present office as the body responsible for FOI, privacy, and information policy. The Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 was passed in May 2010, and came into effect from November 2010. This Act introduced fundamental changes to the way information held by government is managed and accessed by members of the public (see Freedom of Information). The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was integrated into the office at this time.  Structure  The office is headed by the Australian Information Commissioner. Despite their titles, all commissioners can exercise the privacy and freedom of information (FOI) functions. However, only the Information Commissioner may exercise the information policy functions.  Responsibilities  The office’s responsibilities include: * conducting investigations * reviewing decisions made under the FOI Act * handling complaints * monitoring agency administration * education and awareness programs * providing advice to the public, government agencies and businesses.  Freedom of Information  The office has freedom of information functions, including the oversight of the operation of the FOI Act and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act. If a person is dissatisfied with the result of an FOI request, they may seek review by the office. A person may also complain to the office if they are unhappy with the manner in which their request was handled by an agency. The FOI Act has been a feature of Australia's legislative landscape since 1982. The purpose of the FOI Act was to open government activity to public scrutiny, so as to enhance accountability and encourage citizen engagement with public administration. In 2010, the Australian Parliament implemented wide-ranging open government reforms — the most significant FOI reforms in thirty years. The office was established and substantial changes were made to the FOI Act. These reforms simplified the process for accessing government information, tightened the exemptions to information release, strengthened independent oversight and review of FOI administration, promoted proactive publication of government information, and clearly stated the open government object of the FOI Act. The object of the Act is 'to increase recognition that information held by the Government is to be managed for public purposes, and is a national resource'. The Reform Act introduced a new scheme for the proactive publication of government information called the Information Publication Scheme, under which government agencies are required to provide certain operational information on their websites. The office may initiate an own motion investigation (OMI). The office can also provide information and advice on FOI to individuals and agencies, via the OAIC enquiries line.  Privacy  Privacy is one of three broad functions conferred on the office. The legislative basis of these privacy functions is drawn primarily from the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act regulates how an individual's personal information is handled. For example, it covers: * how personal information is collected (e.g. the personal information a person provides when they fill in a form) * how it is then used and disclosed * its accuracy * how securely it is kept * a person’s general right to access that information. The Act also covers more specific matters, such as: * the use of tax file numbers * how credit worthiness information about a person is handled by credit reporting agencies and credit providers. The office has a range of responsibilities under other laws, including laws relating to data matching, eHealth, spent convictions and tax file numbers. The office provides information and advice on privacy to individuals, businesses and agencies via the OAIC enquiries line. Under the Privacy Act a person can make a complaint to the office about the handling of their personal information by Australian, ACT and Norfolk Island government agencies and private sector organisations covered by the Privacy Act. In some circumstances, the office may also initiate an OMI. The office has the power to conduct privacy audits of Australian and ACT Government agencies, as well as some other organisations in certain circumstances. The Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) provides strategic advice on privacy, from a broad range of perspectives, to the Australian Information Commissioner. PAC was established under section 82 of the Privacy Act. All members except the Commissioner are appointed by Her Excellency the Governor-General. PAC consists of no more than six members and is convened by the Australian Information Commissioner.  Information policy  The Information Commissioner reports to the Attorney- General on matters relating to Australian Government information management policy and practice, including FOI and privacy. The Information Commissioner is assisted in this regard by an Information Advisory Committee (IAC), comprising senior officers from key agencies and people from outside government who have suitable qualifications or experience. The office has released a set of Principles on open public sector information and an accompanying report. The principles are based on the premise that public sector information is to be managed for public purposes as a national resource. The office encourages agencies to embed the principles in their internal policies and procedures on information management. The intention is that by doing so they will help build a culture of proactive information disclosure and community engagement.

His personal name was Tian Jian (田建), ancestral name Gui, and he did not have a posthumous title because he was the last king of Qi. Jian succeeded his father King Xiang of Qi, who died in 265 BC. He reigned for 44 years. At the time he acceded to the throne, there were only a few states left in what is now China. Qi was one of the wealthiest, and it was on the seacoast far from the most aggressive state, Qin. For years, King Jian's mother acted as his advisor. On her deathbed she wanted to tell her son the king which ministers she thought were the best. But when the writing materials arrived she could no longer tell him.

When the lips are gone, the teeth become cold....Go to the aid of Zhao!\\" In Strategies of the Warring States, The Book of Qi However, the king did nothing; during his reign he tried to stay out of wars, as the future First Emperor Qin Shihuang attacked all the states around him. The kingdom of Qi was the only opponent of Qin after Qin Shi Huang conquered every other state. King Jian and his prime minister Hou Sheng (后勝), a relation of Jian's wife, sent the Qi army to the western border of Qi to protect the country; but Qin general Wang Ben (王賁), son of Wang Jian, attacked Qi from the north instead and conquered it in 221 BC, completing Qin's unification of China. King Jian was captured with his entire court. From Discourses on Salt and Iron In one story, the king went to Qin voluntarily, resisting the urging of his loyal counselor, after the defeat, because Qin Shihuang, the First Emperor, had promised him a large property of 500 li. Instead, when he arrived in Qin, he was sent to a remote area with his wife and daughter, where he starved to death. The Qi people made a sarcastic ballad to commemorate him. \\"Oh, pine trees!

The events in the movie take place when a fellow ex-pat dies. Described as a Texas road film in a Taiwan setting, the project stars Billy Harvey, Leonora Moore, and Jeff Palmiotti. Plot Simon (Billy Harvey) and Darin (Jeff Palmiotti) are two laid-back American ex- patriates who teach kindergarten and run a magazine called The Oyster in Taiwan in 2000. When fellow ex-pat (Will Mounger) dies an unfortunate death, they learn that there is no one to contact his Stateside family and no one to claim his body.

Jarrett's original idea was to think of a low-budget road movie. He had been reading William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying and decided that his story could take place in Taiwan. Based upon the director's own experiences, the screenplay was written by director Jarrett, his brother Mitchell Jarrett, and by Jordan Heimer, and was shot at locations across Taiwan using 5D and 7D equipment. The film's title refers to the magazine published by the lead protagonists, which is itself modeled after one at which Jarrett himself worked. The Jarrett bros. returned to Taiwan in 2009 to scout locations. and filming was done through \\"repeated acts of low- budget, guerrilla filmmaking.\\" Funding was chiefly acquired through Spoonbill Pictures, LLC with a large help from two Kickstarter fundraisers. Release Slated for theatrical release in October, 2013, the film had its world premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 10, 2012. It had its Taiwan premiere April 2012, at the Urban Nomad Film Festival. Reception Variety stated that director Mark Jarrett understands that a road film should enlighten as well as entertain, and that his film did so \\"with great originality.\\" In referring to the opening showing the leads drinking heavily with a group of other ex-pats, they wrote \\"the film packs more soul than the hedonism of its early scenes suggests\\". They spoke toward the scenes where Simon, Darin, and Nikita steal Jed's body from the morgue, and offered that it was \\"one of the strangest and most invigorating heists in ages, a cross between an old Laurel and Hardy routine and the scrappy anarchy of early Wes Anderson.\\" They praised the cinematographer's camerawork, writing \\"the sheer beauty of [Mike] Simpson's frames often stands in direct contrast with the delirious indulgence on display,\\" They offered that while the film may get more play through festival screenings than theatrical release, it was a \\"striking feature\\". KUT radio called The Taiwan Oyster a \\"'Texas road trip' film set in Taiwan to a soundtrack of Bobby Bare, the Flatlanders and Bobby Gentry\\" which, even while taking place in the “Wild, Wild East” of Taiwan, has \\"a certain Texas sensibility to it\\". Film Business Asia compared the film to others that had been filmed along Taiwan's scenic East Coast Highway, but noted that the film was \\"basically a US indie that just happens to be set in East Asia\\", and that rather than being an integral part of the film, \\"the landscape and locals are there for decoration.\\" They offered though, that despite a lack of engagement with the local culture, the film did \\"convey a genuine sense of place from an outsider's perspective,\\" and that the film had good production values, and well-composed cinematography and performances. Taipei Times both interviewed Mark Jarrett and made note of the time he had spent in Taiwan, writing that the film is \\"a captivating and visually stunning indie film that ponders the idea of death\\". Twitch Film wrote that while \\"performance are all over the map\\", the onscreen chemistry between Billy Harvey and Leonora Moore \\"is at times breathtaking\\". They expanded that much of the film \\"is playful (and at times hilarious),\\" but that \\"the beautiful photography often makes for a melancholy backdrop, as the stunning countryside constantly reminds us that these characters are strangers in a strange land, made all the more small by the ancient otherworldliness that surrounds them on all sides.\\" They summarized that the film was \\"at times heavy-handed\\", but that the film \\"moves deftly between the realms of comedy and tragedy,\\" and that the characters \\"are at once likeable, and perhaps in the case of many suffering from a bit of the quarter-life crisis, even a bit familiar.\\" Don Clinchy of the Slackerwood website wrote that the film was \\"an intriguing, lyrical and visually poetic film that explores the meaning of mortality,\\" calling it \\"a deeply existential film with dark humor and darker implications.\\" He made special note of superb work by cinematographer Mike Sampson, and how the work \\"perfectly captured\\" the \\"contrasts between the rural tranquility and urban activity.\\" He did have minor issues with some of the dialogue being \\"slightly unnatural\\" for a film with \\"an otherwise authentic vibe\\". He also felt that the film's romance seemed \\"contrived and inconsequential\\" when compared to the film's \\"more substantial themes of existential angst.\\" He also found minor fault with the Nikita character agreeing so readily to take such a trip with two complete strangers, feeling that she seemed \\"too sensible\\", and her character needed \\"more development and backstory\\" to have her actions make better sense. Other than those criticisms, he found the story \\"solid and thought-provoking,\\" and performances by the film's three leads to be solid. He offered that Billy Harvey's Simon was best, and that Leonora Moore did \\"a great job as Nikita, a smart, savvy woman who is a sober, grounding influence on her intemperate traveling companions.\\" He offered that while first-time actor Jeff Palmiotti was occasionally \\"hammy\\", his performance was \\"totally believable\\". He concluded that the film was \\"a gorgeous and captivating film, a physical and spiritual journey in an exotic land. It has much to say about life, loneliness and death, and our eternal struggles with all three.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2012 films 2010s road comedy-drama films American films American road comedy-drama films Taiwanese films Films shot in Taiwan American independent films Kickstarter-funded films Taiwanese comedy-drama films 2012 independent films ","title":"The Taiwan Oyster"},{"id":"36032709","text":"City of Stormreach is a supplement to the 3.5 edition of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.

Curry was the first president of the Knickerbockers Base Ball Club, reported to be the first organized baseball club in 1845. He is also credited with participating in the drafting of the Knickerbocker Rules, the first written set of official baseball rules. He also served on the game's various rules committees from 1845 until at least 1856. Curry was also one of the founders of the Republic Fire Insurance Company and served as its secretary from 1852 to 1882. Biography Curry was born in New York City in November 28, 1812. Certificate issued by Republic Fire Ins. Co. in 1860 listing Curry as Secretary Curry worked in the insurance business for more than 35 years. From 1843 to 1852, he was the Secretary of the City Fire Insurance Company. In 1852, he was one of the founding officers of the Republic Fire Insurance Company, known as \\"The Pioneer Mutual Fire Insurance Co. Combining the Economy of the Mutual Plan with the Security of a Cash Capital.\\" He served as the Secretary of Republic Fire Insurance Company for 30 years from its formation in 1852 until 1882.(listing Curry as Secretary in the year of Republic's formation)(listing Curry as Secretary) Knickerbockers Base Ball Club=Participation in early informal games In 1842, Curry was part of a group of prominent New York businessmen who gathered in the afternoons to play a game that became baseball. Curry later recalled: \\"For several years it had been our habit to casually assemble on a plot of ground that is now known as Twenty-seventh street and Fourth avenue, where the Harlem Railroad Depot afterward stood. We would take our bats and balls with us and play any sort of game. We had no name in particular for it. Sometimes we batted the ball to one another or sometimes we played one o'cat.\\" Baseball pioneer and Hall of Fame inductee John Montgomery Ward interviewed several of the early members of the group, including Curry, and later wrote the following about the early development of the game in New York: \\"When in about the year 1842 or earlier, Dr. D. L. Adams, Alexander J. Cartwright, Colonel James Lee, Duncan F. Curry, E. R. Dupignac, William F. Ladd and other prominent business and professional men of New York City, seeking some medium for outdoor exercise, turned to the boy's game of Base Ball, there was not a code of rules nor any written records of the game.\\"John M. Ward letter to Albert Spaulding, dated June 19, 1907, on the origin of baseball. In his history of baseball, Al Spalding wrote of the group: \\"Nevertheless, it is of record that as early as the year 1842, a number of New York gentlemen -- and I used the term 'gentlemen' in its highest social significance -- were accustomed to meet regularly for Base Ball practice games. It does not appear that any of these were world-beaters in the realm of athletic sports.\\" Formation of the Knickerbockers thumbright220pxKnickerbockers Baseball Club, circa 1847. Curry at the left in the front row (The identification of Curry in this image has always been at least controversial. An article refuting the identification can be found in a Society of American Baseball Research newsletter: https://sabr.box.com/shared/static/106f79f134092a683653.pdf) In the spring of 1845, one of the members of the group, Alexander Cartwright, proposed that they establish a formal baseball club. A committee consisting of Cartwright, Curry, William Wheaton, William H. Tucker and Dupignac was charged with responsibility to secure signatures of players wishing to belong to the club and to otherwise organize the club.Spalding, p. 52.(\\"Wheaton, Cartwright, Curry, W. H. Tucker, and Dupignac were appointed by their mates to organize the club.\\") On September 23, 1845, at a meeting held at McCarty's Hotel in New York City (located at Hudson and 12 Streets), the Knickerbockers Base Ball Club was formally established, and Curry was selected as its first president. The Knickerbockers were reported to have been the first organized baseball club.While long believed, and still widely repeated, the belief was erroneous; several original Knickerbockers, including Wadsworth and Wheaton, had previously been members of the Gotham Base Ball Club, formed in 1837; the Magnolia and New York Ball Clubs were also already in existence. In Philadelphia, the Olympic Ball Club had been organized in 1833. Thorn, John, Baseball in the Garden of Eden. New York: Simon & Schuster (2011) In his history of the sport, Al Spalding cited the formation of the Knickerbockers as a seminal point in baseball history: \\"The organization of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club was the beginning of a most important era in the history of the game, for it was the first recorded movement of that kind. The right and title to the distinction of being the first organized Base Ball club in the world belongs to the old Knickerbocker Club. That honor has never been called in question. For more than thirty years the Knickerbocker Club maintained an amateur organization, and as such was regarded as a model in every respect.\\"Spaulding, p. 55. Drafting of the Knickerbocker Rules Curry also served on the committee that drafted the Knickerbocker Rules, reputed to be the first set of official written rules for the game of baseball. Differing accounts as to who deserved credit for the establishment of the Knickerbocker Rules have been posthumously attributed to Curry over the years. On one occasion, he was reported to have stated that he and William Tucker had crafted the rules. In the recounting of an interview with reporter Will Rankin, Curry was quoted as rejecting the notion that Henry Chadwick should be credited. According to Rankin, Curry said: \\"Thomas Fiddlesticks [Chadwick] had no more to do with the original rules than you had. William Wheaton, William H. Tucker and I drew up the first set of rules and the game was developed by the people who played it and were connected with it.\\" However, in a 1911 book published by Alfred Henry Spink, Curry was quoted as giving principal credit for creation of the new game to Alexander Cartwright. Spink's book attributed the following to Curry: > \\"Well do I remember the afternoon that Alex Cartwright came up to the ball > field with a new scheme for playing ball. . . . On this afternoon I have > already mentioned, Cartwright came to the field – the march of improvement > had driven us further north and we located on a piece of property on the > slope of Murray Hill, between the railroad cut and Third avenue – with his > plans drawn up on paper. He had arranged for two nines, the ins and outs. > \\"That is, while one set of players were taking their turn at bat the other > side was placed in their respective positions on the field. He had laid out > a diamond-shaped field, with canvas bags filled with sand or sawdust for > bases at three points and an iron plate for the home base. He had arranged > for a catcher, a pitcher, three basemen, a short fielder and three > outfielders. His plan met with much good derision, but he was so persistent > in having us try his new game that we finally consented more to humor him > than with any thought of it becoming a reality. . . When we saw what a great > game Cartwright had given us, and as his suggestion for forming a club to > play it met with our approval, we set about to organize a club.\\" Organization of the first baseball game Early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph). Curry and two other members arranged for the Knickerbockers to play their first game against another team. The game, long cited as the first officially recorded game of baseball,(referring to the game as \\"the first 'officially recorded' game of baseball\\")(\\"In 1846, the first baseball game between organized teams took place in Hoboken, N.J.\\")(\\"Baseball historians tend to side with New Jersey and agree the first game was played June 1846 in Hoboken ...\\")(\\"The New York Nine won this first ever baseball game, at Elysian Fields, by a score of 23-1.\\")(\\"Instead, most histories of the game are content to settle on the famous 'only accepted date of baseball's beginning' -- a game played on the Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey, on June 19, 1846\\")(\\"Baseball as it is played today throughout the world began on June 18, 1846, at the Elysian Fields in Hoboken.\\") was played against the \\"New York Club\\" on June 19, 1846, at Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey. The Knickerbockers lost by a score of 23 to 1. Curry recalled the game as follows: > \\"An awful beating you could say at our own game, but, you see, the majority > of the New York Club's players were cricketers, and clever ones at that > game, and their batting was the feature of their work. The chief trouble was > that we had held our opponents too cheaply and few of us had practiced any > prior to the contest, thinking that we knew more about the game than they > did. . . . The pitcher of the New York nine was a cricket bowler of some > note, and while one could use only the straight arm delivery he could pitch > an awfully speedy ball. The game was in a crude state. No balls were called > on the pitcher and that was a great advantage to him, and when he did get > them over the plate they came in so fast our batsmen could not see > them.\\"Spink, p. 56. Committee on Rules Curry continued to be a prominent member of the Knickerbockers for many years.Nash 2003, p. 21. He was also appointed by the Knickerbockers as a member of the game's various rules committees for more than a decade and through at least 1856. An 1848 pamphlet published by the Knickerbockers identifies Curry, Alexander Cartwright, Doc Adams, Eugene Plunkett, and J. P. Mumford as the members of the committee \\"to revise constitution and By-Laws.\\" In November 1853, Curry was assigned to a rules committee that included Doc Adams, William H. Tucker, and members of another New York baseball club, the Eagle Club. The committee met on April 1, 1854 at Smith's on Howard Street in New York. The committee adopted a set of rules that would govern play among the three leading clubs, the Knickerbockers, the Gotham Club, and the Eagle Club. Among other things, the 1854 rules included specifications for the size and weight of the ball, set the dimensions of the infield, and adopted the \\"force out rule\\" of tagging first base to put a batter out on a ground ball. In 1856, Curry became involved in a debate among the Knickerbockers as to whether to allow nonmembers to participate in games if fewer than 18 men were available to play. Curry, as the leader of the group that historian John Thorn has dubbed the \\"Old Fogy\\" or \\"exclusionary clique,\\" resisted the proposal and offered a counter-proposal that no non-members should be allowed to participate as long as at least 14 members were available. The Curry measure was approved by a vote of 13 to 11. At that time, the club also debated a new rule to replace the prior practice of playing until a team scored 21 runs. The debate focused on whether the game should consist of seven or nine innings. Curry was an advocate of the seven-inning format and was appointed to a committee to consider the question.Thorn 2012, pp. 51-52. Although the majority of the Knickerbockers sided with Curry on the seven-inning format, Louis F. Wadsworth (who favored the nine-inning format) called for a convention among the baseball clubs to agree on a format. The convention (known as the first National Association meetings) was held in 1857, at which time the delegates approved the nine-inning format. In his history of early baseball, John Thorn wrote that the adoption of Wadsworth's nine-inning format marked the end of power for the Knickerbockers' \\"Old Fogy\\" clique.Thorn 2012, p. 53. Claim as \\"Father of Baseball\\" Curry in his later years In 1905, Al Spalding wrote in his Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide that \\"the original Knickerbocker Club should be honored and remembered as the founders of our national game.\\" In particular, he cited 11 original Knickerbockers as deserving of the honor, including Curry, Doc Adams, Alexander Cartwright, E. R. Dupignac, William Wheaton and William H. Tucker.Nucciarone & Thorn, p. 210. In March 1894, a controversy developed when James Whyte Davis, who had been president of the Knickerbockers from 1858 to 1860, announced plans to request ten cent subscriptions from baseball players so that, upon his death, a tombstone could be erected identifying him as the \\"Father of Baseball.\\" Davis's request drew an angry letter from an anonymous baseball person that was published in The Sporting Life. The letter included the following comments about Curry: > \\"Mr. Curry was one of the organizers of the Knickerbocker Club and was > elected the first president of that organization in 1845 at the club's first > meeting. He was on the Committee on Rules and helped draft the first rules > under which base ball was regularly played. So if any one deserves the title > of 'Father of Base Ball,' Mr. Curry does and not Mr. Davis.\\"(\\"Among the > enrolled members of the Knickerbocker Club in 1854 - the closing of the 10th > season were: Duncan F. Curry (who died in 1894).\\") Curry died one month after the controversy. He was buried at Brooklyn's Green- Wood Cemetery with a white marble monument identifying him as the \\"Father of Baseball.\\"(\\"I stumbled across a weathered white marble monument that literally stopped me in my tracks. It read, 'Duncan Curry, Father of Baseball.'\\") In his 2003 book \\"Baseball Legends of Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery,\\" baseball historian Peter Nash wrote that Green-Wood is the common resting place of four men vying for the \\"Father of Baseball\\" title—Curry, Henry Chadwick, William Wheaton, and William Tucker.Nash 2003, p. 22. Nash opined that \\"a case can be made that \\"Curry, Wheaton, Tucker, and Cartwright were the true founding fathers of the modern game.\\"Nash 2003, p. 20. Role in Mills Commission findings Curry also played a posthumous role in the conclusion of the Mills Commission crediting Abner Doubleday with inventing the game of baseball. In an 1877 interview with reporter Will Rankin, Curry reportedly said that a Mr. Wadsworth had in 1845 brought a diagram to the field where the Knickerbockers played showing the baseball diamond laid out substantially in its current form. According to Curry, the diagram led to much discussion, and the club agreed to try it. In a decision that has been hotly debated for over 100 years, the Mills Commission concluded in 1905 that the diagram could be traced to Doubleday and cited it as evidence of Doubleday's role in the origin of the game. Family and later years At the time of the 1850 United States Census, Curry was living in New York City's 16th Ward, and his occupation was listed as a clerk. Other members of his household were his grandmother Flora Fraser (age 90),New York, Death Newspaper Extracts, 1801-1890 (Barber Collection) Record identifies Flora Frazer as follows: \\"Apr. 6 [1851] Flora Vans Faser 91y wid Duncan Fraser gr s D F Curry of 229 W 10 St.\\" Elizabeth Robinson (age 53), Margaret Blount (age 47), Mary Ann Blount (age 21), David Blount (age 15), George Blount (age 13), Duncan F.

PM Kennedy SC appeared for the appellant. There was no appearance for the first respondent, while AE Franklin SC (with DL Wood) appeared for the second respondent and PJ Olsen SC (with AA Gabriel) for the amicus curiae.  Facts  The appellant, True Motives 84 (Pty) Ltd, and the first respondent, Mahdi, were owners of adjoining properties. When the first respondent undertook extensive renovations to his property, the appellant objected, challenging the approval of the relevant building plans. The court a quo dismissed the application, and on appeal the issues were confined to * the proper interpretation of the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act;Act 103 of 1977. * the duties of a local authority with regard to the approval of building plans; and * the validity of the delegation of power to the plans examiner.  Judgment  The court held that the appellant's case rested on the validity of the following propositions: # that, on a proper interpretation of section 7 of the Act, a local authority must be satisfied that the erection of a building, in consequence of its approval of a plan, will not derogate from the value of a neighbouring property; and # that the evidence led to the necessary inference that the decision-maker had either not applied his mind to derogation of value or had done so in a superficial manner which fell short of achieving the satisfaction which section 7(1)(b)(ii) required of him. The court first considered the proper scope of the duties that section 7(1)(a) and (b) of the Act imposes on a local authority. On a proper interpretation of section 7(1)(a), the local authority must refuse approval of plans where the plans do not comply with the Act and any other applicable law, and also when the local authority remains in doubt as to the scope of the plans. Thus, the test imposed by section 7(1)(a) requires the local authority to be positively satisfied that the parameters of the test laid down are met. Next, the court turned to consider whether the facts justified the appellant's complaint that the person considering the plans did not apply his mind or, if he did, should have been satisfied that its property would probably suffer a reduction in value if the building were erected. The court found that the issues raised by the appellant in his objection to first respondent's renovations were all considered by the authority. The appellant was unable to show that the local authority misdirected itself in either its legal interpretation or factual application of section 7(1)(b)(ii) and, accordingly, failed to establish any basis for the court to have interfered in the exercise of its discretion. The court also found no merit in the challenge to the delegation of power to the plans examiner. The majority of the court therefore dismissed the appeal. The minority judgment was based on the interpretation of the Act. The minority view was that the majority judgment's interpretation was contrived, and that the ordinary meaning of section 7 should be accepted.

Morgan, a United States ophthalmologist.Home page of www.morganlens.com During Morgan's third Vietnam War tour as a volunteer physician, he concluded that many serious eye problems developed in individuals because fairly simple infections had not been treated adequately. Morgan noted that to protect the eye from being severely infected, it was necessary to have a means for steadily delivering sterile fluid or medication to the eye. Morgan noted that, especially in a war zone or an emergency room, medical personnel rarely had the time to continue administering eye drops to a patient continuously for a long enough period of time to thoroughly cleanse an irritated or infected eye. As such, in February 1969, in Vinh Long, Morgan molded a simple device for cleaning the eye.Zeke Scher, \\"The Wyoming Doctor Who Saves Eyes\\", Denver Post, Feb. 20, 1972 Morgan was familiar with contact lenses (wearing them himself and often prescribing them to his patients), and his first Morgan Lens was larger than a modern contact lens, resembling the early contact lenses of the 1940s. Morgan initially called the device the Therapeutic Lens Corneal, later renaming it the Morgan Medi-Flow Lens. Later versions of the Morgan Lens were smaller and contained directional fins.FAQs from Morgan Lens website Function The Morgan Lens provides ocular irrigation or medication to the cornea and conjunctiva. Once inserted, the Morgan Lens floats on the layer of solution it is delivering, never actually touching the cornea. When inserting the Morgan Lens, a topical anesthetic (if available) is first applied to the eye.Oregon Health Dept. guide to Morgan Lens The Morgan Lens is attached to the solution (contained in a bag resembling the bag commonly used in intravenous therapy or in a syringe). After the solution has begun flowing, the medical provider has the patient look down and inserts the lens under the upper eyelid, then has the patient look up and inserts the lens under the lower eyelid. After insertion, which usually takes less than 30 seconds, medical personnel do not need to attend the patient while the Morgan Lens cleanses the patient's eye. Also, after insertion, the patient is able to close his or her eyelids while the eye is cleansed. This provides a distinct advantage over manual methods of cleansing the eye (such as inserting eye drops) which require the patient to keep the eye open for an extended period of time and which can be very painful to the patient because of an injured patient's natural reaction of closing the eye in response to injury (blepharospasm) as well as the increased light sensitivity of injured eyes. Uses The Morgan Lens can be used in many situations requiring ocular irrigation or the application of medicine to the eye, including cases of chemical eye burns, thermal burns, irritants (e.g. gasoline, detergent), non-embedded foreign bodies, foreign body sensation with no visible foreign body, routine cleansing prior to eye surgery or eyelid surgery, or for infections.PowerPoint presentation from Morgan Lens' manufacturer The Morgan Lens is a standard piece of medical equipment; according to its manufacturer, over 90% of U.S. emergency rooms contain a Morgan Lens.Home page of www.morganlens.com, Profile of MorTan, Inc. on healthcare.zibb.com Manufacture The Morgan Lens is made by MorTan, Inc., which is based in Missoula, Montana, and headed by, Dr. Morgan's son, Daniel Morgan and Judy Devine.Profile from zapconnect.com ReferencesExternal links *Official Morgan Lens webpage *YouTube video from Morgan Lens manufacturer Eye Emergency medical equipment Ophthalmic equipment ","title":"Morgan Lens"},{"id":"36032909","text":"In the late 1960s, an independence movement was founded in Mindanao, the Philippines to separate the Muslim majority-Moro areas from the rest of the Philippines. The area is now called the Bangsamoro. In late 1968, at least 28 Muslim volunteers from Sulu who were being trained for a covert mission to Sabah were massacred by Philippine Government troops of Ferdinand Marcos in the Jabidah Massacre, resulting in the most horrific state-sponsored killings against the Tausug people, a major Muslim ethnic group in the Philippines. The first organization of the independence movement was Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) founded by Nur Misuari. Subsequent break-away groups include the Moro Islamic Liberation Front or MILF and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters or BIFF. On March 27, 2014, a comprehensive peace deal was signed between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, or GRP, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. This was after two decades of negotiations started during the administration of former President Fidel V. Ramos in 1997.  Beginning of independence movement  Areas in Mindanao Philippines under Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are in red. In pursuit of their goal of “liberating” the Bangsamoro, the MNLF engaged the government forces in extensive armed collisions, peaking in the early 1970s when the rebels’ blitz- like operations brought them control of a substantial number of municipalities surrounding Cotabato City and its airport complex. This prompted the Marcos regime to beef up military presence by deploying almost three-fourths of the army in most Muslim parts of Mindanao. Things took a different turn in 1976 when Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi brokered an agreement that led to the signing of the Tripoli Agreement that introduced the concept of an autonomous Muslim region in Mindanao. On August 1, 1989, under the mandate of the new 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act 6734 authorizing the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). However, out of the 13 provinces and 9 cities that participated in the plebiscite, only the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi opted to become part of the ARMM. The ARMM was formally established on November 6, 1990. Instead of bringing the Muslim leaders together, this agreement further fragmented the MNLF because some factions within the group preferred independence over autonomy. Thus, a group of officers led by Hashim Salamat broke away and formed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to continue their armed struggle for an independent Bangsamoro (Moro nation) in Mindanao. Though the combined strength of these two rebel forces has not reached a point of posing any real threat to the government in Manila, their existence—and the reasons for their resilience—certainly brings many headaches for the government. For nearly five decades, five presidents have tried to completely end these two rebellions, utilizing both force and diplomacy. So far, no combination has succeeded. Perhaps the most remarkable effort to bring closure to these movements was that of the Ramos Administration, which tried to reach out to both the communist and Muslim rebels through peaceful means. Ramos sat down with the rebel leaders in an attempt to solve both problems at their roots.  History of negotiations = MNLF signs peace pact, fragments the movement  Even before being elected president, Fidel V. Ramos had actively pursued the assistance of foreign Muslim leaders to solve the problem in Mindanao. Thus, he strongly sought the intercession of Gaddafi because of his instrumental role in the signing of the Tripoli Agreement earlier in 1976. Indeed, with Gaddafi's assistance, the Philippine government was able to sign the Final Peace Agreement http://mnlfnet.com/The_Final.htm with the MNLF in 1996 in what was supposed to be the end of the Moro armed struggle in Mindanao. Misuari was elected governor of the ARMM and was tasked to supervise the implementation of the peace pact. Unfortunately, other factions within the MNLF were not satisfied with this peace pact and saw this as a deviation from the framework of the Tripoli Agreement. Their desire for complete secession from Philippine sovereignty led to the establishment of the MILF, which will be another challenge to Ramos’ efforts to bring peace in Mindanao after two decades of negotiations with the MNLF.  Ramos negotiates with the MILF, Estrada balks  The exploratory and preparatory talks between the government and the MILF started in August 1996, followed by low-level negotiations commencing January the following year.Soliman Santos. Working paper on Delays in the Peace Negotiations between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front: Causes and Prescriptions An Agreement on General Cessation of Hostilities between the two parties was signed in July 1997. Ramos’ term as president ended in June 1998, but the low-level negotiations continued under the new administration of President Joseph Ejercito-Estrada. By October 1999 formal peace talks would commence, only to be suspended by Estrada's sudden policy-shift by declaring an \\"all-out war\\" against the MILF. Subsequently, the MILF's chairman Salamat declared jihad against Estrada's administration. Estrada's all-out war policy led to the capture of Camp Abubakar, MILF's main headquarters. The president himself led the military in raising the Philippine flag in the erstwhile rebel stronghold, bringing trucks of lechon (roasted pig) and beer for the triumphant soldiers in what was considered as an insult to the MILF—because pork and alcohol are both prohibited in Islam.  Arroyo resumes peace talks  When Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo assumed the presidency in January 2001, the peace process was revived with a unilateral declaration of ceasefire on the part of the government. With the assistance of the Malaysian government, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Eduardo Ermita and MILF Vice-Chair Al Haj Murad Ebrahim signed the Agreement for the General Framework for the Resumption of Peace Talks between the government and the MILF. On March 31, 2001, Republic Act 9054 lapsed into law without the signature of the president. This law amended the Organic Act of the ARMM to provide for the region's expansion from the original four provinces under its jurisdiction. The Provinces of Basilan, North Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, and the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Iligan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa, Zamboanga, Digos, Koronadal, Tacurong, and Kidapawan participated in the plebiscite. However, only Marawi City and Basilan (excluding Isabela City) voted to be included in the ARMM. Later that year, the peace process fell apart when the military attacked the MILF just a day after the ancestral domain aspect of the Tripoli Agreement was signed in Libya. This attack was based on intelligence reports that the MILF has been aiding the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, which at that time held some American and Filipino hostages in Basilan. A ceasefire would once again ensue after informal talks between the government and the MILF through the intercession of Malaysia. On October 29, 2001, the MILF and the MNLF hold unity talks, but this would fall apart barely a month later when Nur Misuari allegedly led a rebellion in Sulu and Zamboanga City to stall the scheduled ARMM elections. A hundred people died in the incident. The government quelled this rebellion and Misuari escaped to Sabah, but the Malaysian government later on deported him back to the Philippines to face rebellion charges. On May 6, 2002, the fourth round of formal peace talks between the government and the MILF resulted in both parties agreeing to veto criminal syndicates and kidnap-for-ransom groups in Mindanao, and to implement the Humanitarian Rehabilitation and Development aspect of the Tripoli Agreement. A final draft of the peace accord was presented to the leaders of Congress on February 10, 2003, but on the next day, a setback would ensue as the military launched an offensive in Buliok Complex against the MILF which would last for more than a week. Ceasefire was enforced three weeks later. By March, the parties began exploratory talks in Malaysia with a commitment from both sides for a “mutual secession of hostilities.” The aspect of a Muslim ancestral domain was laid down as the next agenda for the peace talks. Until the end of 2008, the peace process remained in a deadlock due to constitutional and legal issues surrounding the ancestral domain aspect. The Malaysian government on the other side have strongly condemn any terrorist activity and expressed unequivocal support for peace negotiations between Moro rebels and the Philippine government rather than helping the rebels as Malaysia did in 1968 after the Jabidah massacre. During the Conference on Regional Security Meeting held in Makati, Metro Manila on April 2003. Malaysian Defence Minister at the time Najib Razak make a speech on his country intention on the issues:  Muslim Ancestral Domain and the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity  On July 27, 2008, a Memorandum of Agreement on the Muslim Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) was finalized in Malaysia. Under this agreement, some 700 villages in Mindanao would hold a referendum within a year to determine if they intend to join the “Bangsamoro Juridical Entity,” an associated state which would be formed after the necessary constitutional amendments are undertaken by the government. This agreement was scheduled to be signed on August 5, with the final peace agreement set to be concluded by November. Three days before the scheduled signing of the MOA-AD, local officials of North Cotabato filed a case asking the Supreme Court to block the signing of this agreement. On October 14, the Court voted 8–7 to strike down the MOA-AD as unconstitutional. According to the decision penned by Justice Conchita Carpio Morales, “the Constitution does not recognize any state within this country other than the Philippine State, much less does it provide for the possibility of any transitory status to prepare any part of Philippine territory for independence.” Likewise, the Court held as unconstitutional the guarantees under the MOA-AD that the government will implement the necessary constitutional amendments to create a framework for its implementation. According to the Court, the peace panel and even the president do not have the authority to make such guarantees because they do not have the power to propose amendments to the Constitution, such power being vested exclusively in Congress. The junking of the MOA-AD marked another setback for the peace process, with the armed conflicts for the year 2008 reaching a record-high of 30 incidents in Mindanao. In an effort to salvage the negotiations, Arroyo declared the suspension of military operations against the MILF on July 2009.  Resumption of peace talks under Aquino Presidency  The administration of Benigno Aquino III resumed peace negotiations, the 20th round, with the MILF in February 2011, after the rebel group announced that they were no longer seeking secession from the Philippines. But the prospects for peace remained elusive as rogue MILF forces conducted sporadic attacks against government forces in several areas in Mindanao despite the existing ceasefire agreement. Worst of these attacks came on October 18, 2011 when MILF forces ambushed an Army contingent in Al-Barka, Basilan killing 19 young soldiers and wounding 12 others. Despite the MILF's half-hearted efforts to make these rogue leaders answer for their attacks, the president and the military hierarchy rejected calls for an all-out-war approach to this problem. The Al-Barka attack came just two months after Aquino’s controversial meeting with MILF chairman Al Haj Murad Ebrahim in Tokyo. This gave rise to concerns that the real reason for the stalled peace process is not just the government's lukewarm effort to make peace, but also the lack of sincerity of the rebel groups in negotiating lasting peace with the government in Philippines military for 245.  Women in the peace process  Women played active roles in both the formal and informal negotiations in the Mindanao peace process that brought an end to open hostilities in 2014. Miriam Coronel Ferrer, who led the Filipino government's team in peace negotiations with the MILF, made history in becoming the first woman chief negotiator to sign to a major peace accord in history. Women also held a number of meaningful positions on the negotiating teams of both parties to the conflict. Women reportedly fostered communication between different tracks of negotiations. Civil society groups and women's groups conducted listening workshops for Bangsamoro communities and provided recommendations to the official track I negotiation process. The resulting peace agreement includes a number of gender-specific considerations for transitional governance and women's empowerment in the future. For example, the agreement includes provisions for women's inclusion in new institutional mechanisms and suggests that women's economic participation is a crucial part of a broad national strategy for growth post-conflict. On October 15, 2012, the Philippine government signed a much-hyped document touted as the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which culminates the Aquino Administration's effort to end the deadlock in the peace process. This new document, while merely providing for a general framework for the actual peace negotiations, announces that \\"the status quo is unacceptable and that the Bangsamoro shall be established to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Bangsamoro is the new autonomous political entity (NPE) referred to in the Decision Points of Principles as of April 2012.\\" According to President Aquino, this is the agreement that \\"can finally seal genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao.\\"Speech of President Benigno Aquino III during the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro On January 24, 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferer and MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed the final annex of the peace agreement in Kuala Lumpur. Two months later, on March 27, 2014, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed in Manila and witnessed by Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, MILF Chairman Al Haj Murad Ibrahim, and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called \\"Bangsamoro\\" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. The government aims to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party to be selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area. The European Union provided €85 million to further the peace process in August 2020.

Situated approximately to the north of Yalgoo and to the west of Cue, the station has an area of consisting of saltbush plains and mulga country. with an elevation of approximately above sea level. The station was established in 1873 by Edward and Frank Wittenoom and possibly owned for a time in 1875 by the Mungarra Squatting Company that was run by A. Brown and J. H. Monger. In 1880 the Wittenooms established the homestead at the current site. In 1891 the Wittenooms sold the property to Messrs Richard Holmes and H. Maloney. Holmes later sold his share to Maloney who ran the station until his death in 1903. Th station was on the market in 1905 and had a flock of 19,000 sheep, 500 cattle and 55 horses. There were many shallow wells and 23 windmills. Divided into 15 large sheep paddocks, one large cattle paddock and ten smaller paddocks for horses or other stock, the station was sold later that same year to agents of Mr Charles Atkins for the sum of £23,200. The Aitken's imported Merino rams to the station from Victoria in 1908. In 1918, the Aitken's sold off 298 rams from the property. From 1919 the station was being managed by R. W. Fremlin, who steadily improved the properties situation. The property contained between 60-70 windmills by 1928 and had of five and six strand fencing erected. Fremlin retired from managing Murgoo and other Atkins Brothers holding including Mount Narryer and Tibradden Station in the 1930s and moved to Mullewa where he died in 1954 aged 80. The combined properties run by Fremlin ran over 40,000 sheep and routinely produced 1200–1400 bales of wool per year. During the 1920s the station would often transport sheep to Derby for export by truck, the journey would take two days. (Something not right here - Murgoo is about 820 miles from Derby, which would justify the time taken. Alternatively, Carnarvon would have been the closest port about 240miles away which matches the distance) 20,000 sheep were shorn in 1920, increasing to 28,000 in 1922 then following a drought only 23,000 in 1924. In 1924 the Atkins also sold 5,000 wethers to Mr. McKenna of Carlaminda station at 42s. per head. This was a record sale at the time. By 1926 over 31,000 sheep were clipped and in 1927 the station shore 32,000 producing over 900 bales of wool. In 1928 the station was owned still by the Aitken Brothers, who were originally from South Australia., the station also sold off 21,000 sheep from both Murgoo and the adjoining Mt. Narryer station which was also owned by the brothers. The current lessee is Reginald Seaman, Murgoo is operating under the Crown Lease number CL573-1966 and has the Land Act number LA3114/578. The Seaman family have been on the property since 1974 and in 2010 had to take the drastic step of destocking the property as a result of severe drought. Murgoo had below average winter rainfall between 2000 and 2010, receiving only of rain in 2010. Races In 1915, Charles Atkins decided to hold a race meeting in the area to liven things up a bit. The first race was held at Manfred Station, approximately 75 miles from Murgoo, in 1917 which at the time was owned by Frank and Edward Wittenoom. Races were held at Manfred until 1920 when the Murgoo Picnic Race Club was formed in 1920. A race track was made and Atkins made use of the shearing shed as a clubroom and for the race ball. In the early days women were only allowed in the clubroom when invited by a member and always received champagne as a refreshment. Two day meets were held from 1920 to 1929 and then halted over the course of the great depression and a couple of years of drought before resuming in 1935. During World War II the Murchison Patriotic Funds Committee took over and ran the race biannually, and normal race meets resumed again in 1947. No meetings were held in the drought years of 1950, 1951, 1955 and 1956, but were run regularly since until at least 1963. No bookmakers are allowed on the course and all jockeys are station hands and overseers.

It is native to western North America, where its distribution extends from western Canada to northern Mexico.Poa fendleriana. Grass Manual Treatment.Howard, Janet L. 1997. Poa fendleriana. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Description This species is a perennial grass with small rhizomes. The stems grow up to 70 centimeters tall. The dead sheath bases remain on the plant for a long time. The narrow panicle has up to 8 erect branches crowded with spikelets. One inflorescence may have over 100 spikelets. The plant is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Some populations lack male plants, while others are able to reproduce sexually. Asexual reproduction is more common than sexual, and most populations are all female. These produce seed without fertilization by pollen. The sexually reproducing populations are usually found in warmer climates with summer precipitation, while the all- female populations can tolerate colder climates and a wider range of elevations. Distribution This is a common grass in western North America. It grows in many types of habitat, including sagebrush, oak woodlands, pinyon- juniper woodlands, desert grassland, and coniferous forest. The grass often grows in dry areas, but it can occur in moist habitat, such as riversides. It can grow on many soil types. It occurs mainly on open sites or in partial shade; it does not tolerate the full shade of a closed canopy. It is a dominant plant species in several types of habitat. Uses=Forage This grass is a \\"good to excellent forage for livestock\\" and wild animals, feeding cattle, horses, sheep, elk, deer, and pronghorn.Poa fendleriana. USDA NRCS Plant Guide.

Buck. It was directed by Ray Enright and featured movie idol Randolph Scott, teamed with Ruth Warrick, Ellen Drew and Anthony Quinn. Although set in wartime China, Quinn and other lead actors portrayed Chinese characters, in keeping with other period films that employed Caucasian actors in Asian roles.Koppes and Black 1987, pp. 256–260. China Sky was one of the last in a succession of wartime films depicting the Chinese confronting Japanese invaders that included: A Yank on the Burma Road (1942), China Girl (1942), Flying Tigers (1942), China (1943), Behind the Rising Sun (1943), Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), Dragon Seed (1944), God Is My Co-Pilot (1945) and China's Little Devils, released May 27, 1945.Evans 2000, p. 41.Dolan 1985, p. 51.Hyams 1984. pp. 65, 67, 89, 93.

Plot Dr. Gray Thompson, (Randolph Scott) an American missionary doctor, works alongside Dr. Sara Durand (Ruth Warrick) in a hospital he has built in a small hilltop Chinese village, while Japanese forces descend on China. When Gray returns from a trip, he shocks Sara (who is in love with him) by introducing his new socialite wife, Louise (Ellen Drew). Bored and feeling out of place, Louise tries to persuade him to give up his dangerous cause. In the midst of aerial bombing attacks on the village, Dr. Thompson unselfishly helps the local residents, and especially the insurgent leader Chen-Ta (Anthony Quinn) who loves nurse Siu-Mei (Carol Thurston), betrothed to Dr. Kim (Philip Ahn), a sympathetic Chinese/Korean doctor. Col. Yasuda (Richard Loo), a high-ranking, injured Japanese prisoner, manipulates Dr. Kim into sending a (coded) message, purportedly from Louise, to his side that the village is secretly harboring an ammunition dump. Gray and the others become puzzled when Japanese airplanes stop attacking their village,. When Japanese paratroops descend on the village, Gray organizes the defense and sends a messenger to Chen Ta. During the brutal fighting, Yasuda fatally shoots Dr. Kim and grazes Gray. A distraught Louise runs out into the line of fire and is killed. The Japanese are defeated when Chen Ta and his men arrive on horseback. He promises to return for Siu Mei after the invaders have been driven out of their country.

Morgan, M.D.: Perennial Medical Student and World Traveler\\", Scottsbluff, Nebraska Star-Herald, Oct. 2000 He then interned at St. Luke's Hospital in Denver. While in Denver, he met his wife, Beth Ashburn, a native of Torrington, Wyoming, who was then a nurse, but who subsequently stayed at home to raise the couple's two children. Army career, 1943-46 While in medical school, Morgan served in the medical division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the United States Army in 1941. After completing his internship, he was called up by the army in December 1943 and sent to Carlisle Barracks for medical officer training. He married Beth in Carlisle Barracks in January 1944. He spent the next ten months receiving Army training, including in parachute jumping. He was stationed at Camp Forrest when he was sent to the battlefield. During World War II, Morgan served with the 40th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion. His battalion saw action on March 24, 1945 as part of Operation Varsity. Of the 300 men who made the initial jump, 50 were killed and 100 were injured, and as the battalion surgeon, he was the first doctor the wounded saw. Morgan was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his work as a doctor during this time. An interview with Morgan detailing his experiences as a doctor during this operation, and later during the Battle of the Bulge, was featured on the History Channel in 1999. After the war, 1946-57 After his discharge from the army in 1946, Morgan traveled to Torrington, Wyoming, where his wife and daughter (born on October 24, 1944, while Morgan was overseas) had lived while he was in Europe. He was then hired as a company doctor by the Empire Zinc Company, moving his young family to Gilman, Colorado. However, in 1948, during a visit to his wife's family in Torrington, he was struck with appendicitis and Dr. Krahl, the doctor who operated on him, convinced Morgan to join his practice in Torrington. He spent the next several years working as a general practitioner in Torrington. Ophthalmologist in Torrington, Wyoming, 1960-81 After suffering chest pains in October 1956, his physicians in Denver convinced Morgan to give up the demanding schedule of a general practitioner. In January 1957, Morgan returned to the University of Minnesota Medical School for three years of training as a specialist in ophthalmology. He returned to Torrington on January 11, 1960, and opened his practice, also working as the Chief Consultant in Ophthalmology for the Veterans Administration Hospital in Hot Springs, South Dakota. Although Torrington was a small community, Morgan was able to draw in patients from the surrounding area, eventually having 7,500 active files. Service in Vietnam (1967-70) and the invention of the Morgan Lens By 1966, Morgan had become aware of the pressing need for physicians to serve in Vietnam in the wake of the Vietnam War and therefore signed up for the Volunteer Physicians for Vietnam program organized by the American Medical Association. He spent two months in Vietnam in spring 1967; a second two-month tour in 1968; a third two-month tour in 1969; and a fourth one-month tour in 1970. During his time there, he and other ophthalmologists provided treatment for injured Vietnamese civilians. During Morgan's third Vietnam War tour as a volunteer physician, he concluded that many serious eye problems developed in individuals because fairly simple infections had not been treated adequately. Morgan noted that to protect the eye from being severely infected, it was necessary to have a means for steadily delivering sterile fluid or medication to the eye. Morgan noted that, especially in a war zone or an emergency room, medical personnel rarely had the time to continue administering eye drops to a patient continuously for a long enough period of time to thoroughly cleanse an irritated or infected eye. As such, in February 1969, in Vinh Long, Morgan molded a simple device for cleaning the eye. Morgan was familiar with contact lenses (wearing them himself and often prescribing them to his patients), and his first Morgan Lens was larger than a modern contact lens, resembling the early contact lenses of the 1940s. Morgan initially called the device the Therapeutic Lens Corneal, later renaming it the Morgan Medi-Flow Lens (today it is normally called simply the Morgan Lens). Later versions of the Morgan Lens were smaller and contained directional fins.FAQs from Morgan Lens website Today, MorTan, Inc., based in Missoula, Montana, and headed by Morgan's son Dan (b. Aug. 1948), continues to manufacture and sell the Morgan Lens. Morgan continued to practice as an ophthalmologist in Torrington until 1981, when he sold his practice. Later years After selling his practice, Morgan enrolled at the University of Connecticut Health Center, spending two years studying glaucoma and neuro-ophthalmology. He became an assistant professor there three months later. From there, he continued to maintain a national practice before entering a state of semi-retirement, splitting his time between Torrington and Palm Desert, California.

Stout. It was first released digitally through Stout Games own website. Four months later (March 1, 2011) it was released on Steam. Just like some other indie games (e.g. Dear Esther or The Graveyard) its status as a video game has been disputed, as it requires minimal interaction and the few small choices you make are of no consequence to the story. It does, however, give the player the opportunity to eat, drink and smoke whenever the player wants to, as long as the time isn't up. Gameplay and plot The game is a 25 minute long story exploring the subconsciousness of protagonist Julian Luxemburg as he sits by his dinner table set for two, waiting in vain for his date Meiko to arrive. As the night progresses, his thoughts continue to unfold more and more and we learn about the worries that trouble him; these worries aren't necessarily related to being stood up. Stout himself said in an interview; \\"It’s about exploring the mindset of someone who’s being stood up. Playing through the eyes of [the protagonist], you can go through the experience without the complete emotional damage.\\" He further described the game as \\"...a space to explore the 'things you can’t tell your friends'.\\" Development The game was written solely by designer Jeroen D. Stout who also provided the voice acting for the protagonist's subconscious. The score was composed exclusively for the game by Than van Nispen tot Pannerden. Reception Dinner Date received mixed reviews, with GameZone saying \\"As an intellectual experiment, Dinner Date is interesting and even profound. As a meta-narrative about the social constructs that confront the modern man, it fascinates. As a game, it barely qualifies.\\", captioning a common opinion among game critics that Dinner Date is more of an interactive art piece than a game.

The book depicts God (\\"Mr g\\") as a being that is omnipotent but not omniscient, as the universe is created through \\"trial and error\\".

Themes The book features several themes, predominantly the concept of God as a powerful entity that is not all-knowing despite being capable of Creation. Lightman was inspired to write the book due to an interest in \\"the meeting ground of science, theology, and philosophy, especially the ethical questions at the border of science and theology\\". Reception Critical reception for Mr g has been mixed, with the Toronto's The Star giving an ambivalent review for the book.

A youth prospect of SC Heerenveen, Valpoort made his first team debut in 2011. Failing to break through as a regular starter for the club, Valpoort embarked on a journeyman career, playing in Hungary, Israel, South Korea and Belgium, but achieving the most success in the Netherlands, where he had short spells with RKC Waalwijk and Almere City. In 2020, he moved to FC Dordrecht, his tenth club in nine years. Valpoort is a youth international for the Netherlands, having gained four caps for the Netherlands under-20 team in which he scored one goal. Club career=Heerenveen Valpoort joined the youth academy of SC Heerenveen at the same time as future professional Luciano Narsingh, and later stated that he saw the latter's breakthrough as a source of inspiration. In the youth teams he regularly showed his scoring ability, for example in the U19 league where he with 16 goals to his name finished third in the top goalscorers list. This achievement earned him a promotion to the first team where he initially signed a one-year contract with the option of an extra year in June 2011. On 4 December 2011, Valpoort made his debut in the Eredivisie, coming on as a substitute for the injured Narsingh in a 5–1 win over AZ. On 31 January 2012, he made his debut in the KNVB Cup in a match against Vitesse. In March 2012, Heerenveen announced that the option in his contract would be triggered, keeping him at the club until June 2013. Valpoort was officially added to the Heerenveen first team in January 2012, after joining on a training camp to Portugal. During the training camp, he made two appearances in friendlies against Hannover 96 and Bayer Leverkusen. After the training camp, Valpoort made four more appearances in the Eredivisie that season and one more in the KNVB Cup, where he failed to score. In the summer break, he appeared in the UEFA Europa League matches against Norwegian club Molde, where he scored in the return leg to secure a 2–1 win. Heerenveen was, however, eliminated based on goal difference. After a first half of the season in the 2012–13 season, in which Valpoort made five appearances, he was sent on a six-month loan deal to PEC Zwolle. =Loan to PEC Zwolle= Moving to PEC Zwolle in January indicated a new beginning for Valpoort. However, he was immediately benched for the first two matches. After his debut for Zwolle against Feyenoord, he was benched again. On 2 March, Valpoort made his debut in the starting lineup against Willem II due to an injury to Furdjel Narsingh. In that game, Valpoort made his first goal in the Eredivisie in the 57th minute on a pass from Denni Avdić. Ferencváros After his contract was not extended at Heerenveen, he trialled with Hungarian club Ferencváros in June 2013. After a successful trial, he signed a contract on 27 June with the club, coached by fellow Dutchman Ricardo Moniz. After the resignation of Moniz, he was demoted to the club's second team together with fellow countrymen Jack Tuijp and Mark Otten. Later career Valpoort signed a two-year contract with RKC Waalwijk in July 2014 after a successful trial. In February 2016, he signed a multi-year contract with Beitar Jerusalem. Valpoort scored his first ever goal for Beitar Jerusalem in an Israeli Premier League match against Maccabi Haifa. In January 2017, Valpoort signed a one-and-a- half-year deal with Almere City. In June 2018, he moved to South Korean K League 2 club Busan IPark together with fellow Dutch player Sherjill Mac- Donald.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from a story by Merriwether Williams and Tim McKeon. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 12, 2010. The episode guest stars Polly Lou Livingston as the titular Tree Trunks. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Tree Trunks joins Finn and Jake who go on a quest to fulfill her desire of picking a proposed legendary \\"crystal gem apple\\" in an evil forest. The three eventually find the tree, and Tree Trunks eats the apple, only to apparently explode and be transported to a crystal dimension. Tree Trunks is voiced by Polly Lou Livingston, a friend of series creator Pendleton Ward's mother. Ward asked Livingston to appear on his show several years after he last saw her. The original ending called for Tree Trunks to simply explode, but a new ending was amended to explain what happened to her. This served as the genesis for the second season episode \\"Crystal Have Power\\". The episode was viewed by 1.847 million viewers and received a 1.2 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with many commenting on the episode's ending. Plot Finn and Jake are invited to the elephant Tree Trunks' house for apple pie. The group begins talking about what they wish they could do if they could achieve anything, and Tree Trunks notes that she wants to pick the rare Crystal Gem Apple, which is located in the Evil Forest. Finn and Jake decide to make her wish come true. When they reach the Evil Forest, they encounter a wall of flesh and try to fight it, but because Tree Trunks is naive, she begins putting stickers on it. After defeating the monster, Tree Trunks walks away, following a skeleton butterfly. She is attacked by sign zombies and begins having a tea party with them, not knowing they want to kill her. Finn and Jake fight off the Sign Zombies and continue their adventure, until they encounter a brain beast. Finn goes to fight it, but Tree Trunks' \\"adventurer's instincts\\" tell her to put on makeup and seduce the brain beast with her womanly charms. Jake has to leap in to save Tree Trunks while Finn attacks the monster's magic gem weak spot. Finn, enraged, tells Tree Trunks that she is putting herself in danger. Dejected and crying, she leaves, only to find the Crystal Gem Apple in the heart of the forest. Unfortunately, a crystal guardian appears and begins copying Finn and Jake's actions, blocking every attempt to fight it physically. Finn and Jake realize that they have to fight the monster \\"Tree Trunks-style\\" by putting on makeup and tricking the monster into letting Tree Trunks take a bite of the Crystal Gem Apple. She bites the apple, pauses for a second, then explodes, leaving Finn and Jake shocked. In a final enigmatic scene, Tree Trunks is seen walking in front of a crystal background. Production \\"Tree Trunks\\" was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez from a story by Merriwether Williams and Tim McKeon, and directed by Larry Leichliter. Although the episode was the fourth aired, it was really the sixteenth produced; this is why Tree Trunks appears in the later season one episode \\"Evicted!\\" despite her vanishing at the end of this entry. The episode features the introduction of the titular character, played by Polly Lou Livingston. Livingston is a friend of Pendleton Ward's mother, Bettie Ward, and knew Pendleton when he was a young child. After having not seen her for eight years, he approached her, asking if she would like to play the voice of a character on Adventure Time. She noted that she \\"nearly fainted\\" when asked, and was surprised he still remembered her. Bettie claimed it was due to her unforgettable Southern drawl. Originally, the episode called for Tree Trunks to simply explode. The ending, featuring her walking in a strange crystal dimension, was added after the story board was submitted. Thus, this action was the genesis for the season two sequel \\"Crystals Have Power\\", which saw the return of Tree Trunks. The unedited version of the episode, featuring Tree Trunks simply exploding, was featured, however, on the Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD. Episode composer Casey James Basichis used a variety of basses and saws to create the whimsical music featured in the episode. He later called the resulting sound a \\"folksy massacre\\". Basichis sought to continue the \\"fun and experimental spirit\\" in other episodes that focus on Tree Trunks.Basichis, Casey James (Composer). 2012. \\"Adventure Time Music With Time + Casey\\" [Featurette], Adventure Time Season One [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network. Reception \\"Tree Trunks\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 12, 2010. The episode was viewed by 1.847 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1.2/2 percent. This means it was seen by 1.2 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. In addition, 1.242 million kids aged 6–11 watched the episode, which marked an increase in 171 percent from the previous year. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2011 Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD, which included 12 episodes from the series' first two seasons. It was later re- leased as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk rhetorically asked, \\"If anyone would like to explain just what the hell happened at the end of 'Tree Trunks' I'm all ears.\\" However, he noted that \\"If [Adventure Time] was a lesser show, episodes like that could possibly make one walk away shaking your head, but somehow it was simply another quirky bit of personality for a show bursting at the seams with it.\\" A review from the Dayton Examiner wrote that \\"Tree Trunks makes a hysterical character by just being absurd\\". They praised the fact that, in the episode, she often says lines \\"that have vague sexual overtones (some of them failing to even be vague)\\". The review enjoyed the way the episode was able to convey the message of \\"following your dreams\\" in such an absurd way. The review also praised the \\"priceless\\" twist ending, calling it \\"the absolute best moment in the episode and one of [their] personal favorites in the entirety of Adventure Time\\".

The Fitna of al-Andalus () (1009–1031) was a period of instability and civil war that preceded the ultimate collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba. It began in the year 1009 with a coup d'état which led to the assassination of Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, the son of Almanzor, the deposition of the Caliph Hisham II al-Hakam, and the rise to power of Muhammad II of Córdoba, great-grandson of Abd-ar-Rahman III. The conflict would eventually divide all of Al-Andalus into a series of Taifa Kingdoms. The Fitna finally ended with the definitive abolition of the Cordoban Caliphate in 1031, although various successor kingdoms would continue to claim the caliphate for themselves. In addition to the political turmoil, large purges were also carried out by Almanzor throughout his territories. The added pressures of financial collapse were present due to the large tax burden placed on the populace to finance the continuous war. Throughout the conflict, various Muslim kingdoms were aided by the Christian kingdoms to the north, both in an official capacity and by mercenary Christian soldiers. Córdoba and its suburbs were repeatedly looted during the war, destroying many iconic monuments such as the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos and the Medina Azahara. The capital was temporarily moved to Málaga. In a little less than twenty years, 10 different caliphates emerged as successor states to the Caliphate of Córdoba (amongst them was a restored kingdom under Hisham II). Three of these successor kingdoms formed a dynastic succession line known as the Hammudid Dynasty.  Causes  Up until the death of Al-Hakam II in the year 976, the Caliphate of Córdoba was a powerful state, both respected and feared by the Christian kingdoms to the north. After his death, his son, Hisham II al-Hakam was still a child. As a result, the vizier, Almanzor was able to easily manoeuver and seize power, usurping the Umayyad Caliphate claim and turning the Caliph into a mere puppet. The strength of the Caliphate lay in the unity of different Muslim groups, following civil wars that had drained the Emirate. To be assured in the conservation of his power, Almanzor favored the Berbers over the other groups. Similar accommodation in the pecking order was transferred to Almanzor's son Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar when he succeeded his father to the throne. To exacerbate the situation, government security was further undermined by various plots as rival groups vied for power. Abd al- Malik died in 1008, leaving his brother, Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo in power. Sanchuelo was able to convince Hisham II to name him the rightful heir to the Caliphate. This marked the last straw for the remaining Umayyad members who proceeded to launch a full scale coup d'état and revolt against the state.  Civil war  Taking advantage of the absence of Sanchuelo, who had left to fight against the forces of Alfonso V of León, the Córdoba Caliphate leader Muhammad II of Córdoba in 1009 dethroned his cousin, the Caliph Hisham II al- Hakam. Sanchuelo returned quickly to Córdoba but the morale of his Berber army was low due to the lengthy campaign, and a majority of his army deserted him. As a result, he fell prisoner to Muhammad II and was executed a short while later. Following this episode, Muhammad II's power and influence rose quickly, giving rise to a new opposition block and pitting him against another Umayyad group, led by Sulayman ibn al-Hakam. Supported by the Berbers, Sulayman was able to capture Muhammad II and became the Caliph in 1009. This chain of events, in turn, incited the Hammudid Dynasty, a powerful family from Ceuta and Algeciras, to proclaim themselves the rightful Caliphs and march on the city of Córdoba. They dethroned Sulaiman and ruled until the year 1023. In that year a new Umayyad claimant, Abd ar-Rahman V, became Caliph. Unfortunately for him, the discontent generated by the new tax caused a new revolution and his eventual fall, as the measure devastated the population. Three more Caliphs, two Umayyad and one Hammudi, reigned until the year 1031, when the Cordoban elite abolished the caliphate and established an independent state (taifa). However, various pretenders from different taifas claimed to be the caliph.  Consequences  This period of chaos, initiated by the Hammudid Dynasty, led to the fragmentation of the caliphate and the establishment of the first independent Taifa kingdoms. It is important to note that the Christian kingdoms to the north were generally supportive of the havoc that wracked the Andalusi world, often lending soldiers to both sides and helping to aid an air of instability. The period that followed was not a peaceful one. After the fragmentation of the caliphate, the individual taifas fought amongst each other. The Christian kingdoms, seeing this fragmentation and opportunity to grab land, intensified the ongoing Reconquista. It was not until this direct threat to Muslim control in the Iberian Peninsula that the Almoravid dynasty finally came to Iberia to reunify Al-Andalus.

The episode was outlined, written, and storyboarded by Patrick McHale, Adam Muto, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 19, 2010. The episode guest stars Henry Rollins, John Moschitta Jr., and Mark Hamill. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake go on a quest for the titular magical book that would prove them worthy of being righteous heroes. After passing through a series of trials and tribulations, Finn acquires the legendary book. The first episode produced for the series, \\"The Enchiridion!\\" was crafted to retain the same spirit as the earlier series' pilot. The middle section originally featured several more trials, but many of them were cut for time. The episode was viewed by 2.096 million viewers, and received generally positive remarks from critics, although several noted that it was noticeably different from the remainder of the series, due to the show's eventual evolution. The episode was later adapted as part of a Level Pack for the 2015 video game Lego Dimensions. Plot After a party that results in Finn saving Princess Bubblegum from falling from her tower, she decides that he is worthy of reading the Enchiridion: a tome of heroic knowledge. The book can only be acquired by \\"for heroes whose hearts are righteous\\". Bubblegum reveals that the book is located at the top of Mount Cragdor, past several trials. After passing the doorkeeper (voiced by John Moschitta Jr.), Finn and Jake encounter gnomes who cause Finn to doubt himself. When Jake tries to cheer him up, he is eaten by an ogre. Believing his friend to be dead, Finn steals a giant dollar from the ogre and attacks him, hitting him in the groin. The Ogre vomits Jake up, and the two glide to the end of the trials. Finn, however, makes sure to send the dollar back to the Ogre, causing Jake to call his act \\"righteous\\". Once inside the top-most building of Mount Cragdor, a malevolent entity (voiced by Mark Hamill) takes Finn to his \\"Brain World\\", wherein he is first told to slay an evil heart beast, and then slay an \\"unaligned\\" ant. Finn kills the evil creature, but refuses to kill the neutral one, defeating the being. Finn is then confronted by Mannish Man, the keeper of the Enchiridion, who gives it to Finn. Finn's first act is to read a chapter about kissing princesses. Production The episode was storyboarded by Pendleton Ward—along with Patrick McHale and Adam Muto—to feel like the original series' pilot. \\"The Enchiridion!\\" was the first episode of the series produced for Cartoon Network. Frederator Studios had pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, but the network passed on it twice. The studio then approached Cartoon Network. The network said they would be willing to produce the series if Ward could prove that the series could be expanded into a series while maintaining elements from the original short. Ward, with help from Patrick McHale and Adam Muto, turned in a rough storyboard that featured Finn and an \\"oblivious\\" Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. However, the network was not happy with this story, and asked for another. Ward then created an early storyboard for the episode, \\"The Enchiridion\\", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original short. Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and \\"The Enchiridion\\" became the first episode to enter into production. Because it was the first episode of the series made, the episode originally was twice as long. During the scene in which Princess Bubblegum tells Finn about the Enchiridion, the original storyboard featured an even longer sequence of Bubblegum detailing the history of Ooo and its heroes. Because it was largely unneeded, it was cut out. The first draft of the storyboard featured Finn encountering twelve trials, which included making friends with a giant bat, dealing with a wizard gnome, and fighting skeletons. Because the episode was too long, these were cut out, and replaced by Finn stealing the giant's dollar. The episode originally was also supposed to have a scene featuring \\"this little tumor creature dancing behind these red velvet drapes that opened up in a knot in a tree.\\" According to Ward, the red curtains were a deliberate nod to the \\"Red Room\\" from David Lynch's famous television drama Twin Peaks. However, the scene was eventually cut. Choose Goose was originally supposed to make his appearance in this episode, offering Finn and Jake some juice. The character was cut for time, but later reappeared in the second-season episode \\"Blood Under the Skin\\", wherein he became a recurring character. Henry Rollins voiced the cookie that angrily yells at Finn after he bumps into him. In an early animatic of the episode, Rollins voiced Mannish Man; he later returned to the series to voice the character of Bob Rainicorn in the second season episode \\"Her Parents\\". John Moschitta Jr. played the part of Keeper. Ward later recounted that Moschitta's dialogue in the episode was not delivered as fast as Ward wanted. Mannish Man was based on character by Justin Hunt that was originally created for a multi-user dungeon game. Originally, the character was supposed to be the start of a short that Ward and McHale made for CalArts. While it was never finished, a rough version of it was later released on the first season Adventure Time DVD. The sequence taking place in the Evil Guy's \\"Brain World\\" was written after executive producer Derek Drymon suggested that the scene could be longer. The heart beast was inspired after Ward saw several instances of Sacred Heart iconography in Mexico. Reception \\"The Enchiridion!\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 19, 2010. The episode was watched by 2.096 million viewers, and scored a 1.4/2 percent Nielsen household rating, meaning that it was seen by 1.4 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2012 It Came From the Nightosphere DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-leased as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012. In the Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast podcast, author Lev Grossman and writer Zack Smith reviewed the episode, with the latter calling it a \\"good, charming little episode with a positive message to it\\". Grossman called it a good' episode, but noted that it possessed a sort of \\"cartoon physics\\" that the series later abandoned; he specifically highlighted the scene wherein Cinnamon Bun did a backflip and destroyed a tower. Ultimately, Smith called it an \\"interesting homage to Dungeons and Dragons [and] basic mythology\\". However, not all reviews were so complimentary. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk, in a review of the It Came From the Nightosphere DVD, called the episode \\"primitive\\" and noted that the episode \\"has a sense of being locked to a traditional story structure\\", a structure that he muses later episodes do not have.

Working from the C Division headquarters at Tennent Street off Shankill Road, Belfast, he eventually caught most of the \\"Butchers\\" which led to their convictions. Having received a total of 67 commendations throughout his career, this is the highest number for any policeman in the history of the United Kingdom. In 1980, he was given the MBE \\"in recognition of his courage and success in combating terrorism\\". Early years Cavehill Road, north Belfast where Nesbitt grew up Nesbitt was born in 1934 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of James, an electrician, and Ellen. He was brought up in the Church of Ireland religion and lived with his parents and elder sister, Maureen in a terraced house in Cavehill Road, North Belfast which was considered to have been a middle-class area at the time. Having first attended the Model Primary School in Ballysillan Road, in 1946 he moved on to Belfast Technical High School where he excelled as a pupil. From an early age Nesbitt was fascinated by detective stories and dreamed about becoming a detective himself. As a child he avidly read all the celebrated murder trials in the newspapers. At the age of 16, he opted to leave school and went to work as a sales representative for a linen company where he remained for seven years. Royal Ulster Constabulary At the age of 23, Nesbitt sought a more exciting career and realised his childhood dream by joining the Royal Ulster Constabulary as a uniformed constable. He applied at the York Road station in Belfast and passed his entry exams. His first duty station was at Swatragh, County Londonderry . During this period the Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign was being waged. Nesbitt earned two commendations during the 12 months he spent at the Swatragh station, having fought off two separate IRA gun attacks which had seen a B Specials man shot. In 1958 he was transferred to Coleraine RUC station where his superiors granted him the opportunity to assist in detective work, and three years later was promoted to the rank of detective. He married Marion Wilson in 1967 and began to raise a family. By 1971 he was back in his native Belfast and held the rank of Detective Sergeant. He had entered the RUC's CID section and was based at Musgrave Street station. The violent religious-political conflict known as the Troubles was rapidly escalating in violence with many of his fellow policemen becoming victims as the new IRA ramped up its campaign with a series of bombings and shootings, with violent reactions from loyalist counterparts, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).Taylor, Peter (1999) \\"Loyalists\\" .London: Bloomsbury Plc. pp.80–84 C Division Tennent Street, Belfast where Nesbitt's C Division was based In September 1973 he was promoted to Detective Inspector and moved to head up the RUC's C or \\"Charlie\\" Division based in Tennent Street, off the Shankill Road, the heartland of loyalism and home of many loyalist paramilitaries. C Division covered not only the Shankill but also the republican Ardoyne and \\"The Bone\\" areas. The area had already been subjected to bombing attacks, rioting, home- burnings, vigilante patrols, street barricades, random sectarian murders and killings as part of sporadic loyalist feuds. Nesbitt's responsibilities were immense as C Division covered an entire fifteen square mile district which contained a population of 150,000 and more sectarian killer gangs than any other district in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, the majority of the violence committed within an area of just three square miles contained every paramilitary group – loyalist and republican – which existed in Northern Ireland at that time. The UVF Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) was based on the Shankill Road. Shortly before he was sent to C Division his policing abilities were highly praised in this assessment, > He stimulates interest among his colleagues, often drawing on his personal > experiences marrying theory with practice. He is thoroughly sound and > reliable and upholds the best traditions of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. > He brings great credit to the Force. Although he encountered considerable suspicion from his subordinates when he arrived at Tennent Street, he managed to eventually create much camaraderie within the ranks of those under his command when before there had been rivalry and discord. C Division would lose a total of 12 men as a result of IRA attacks. Described by Martin Dillon as a controlled man, he was also friendly, generous and displayed a \\"black\\" sense of humour. Moreover, he was a devoted family man and highly respected by his subordinates, who typically addressed him as \\"Boss\\" or \\"Sir\\". Belfast News Letter journalist Bobbie Hanvey who interviewed him, described him as \\"gentle in manner, extremely soft-spoken and a dapper dresser. During his tenure as Detective Chief Inspector at Tennent Street, Nesbitt and his team investigated a total of 311 killings and solved around 250 of the cases. Over one weekend in the 1970s, there were a total of nine murders committed in his district. He personally conducted interviews with some of the most ruthless and dangerous killers in Northern Ireland. Two of the three cars used in the May 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings which had been carried out by the UVF's Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades, were hijacked in Agnes Street and Torrens Road, both within Nesbitt's jurisdiction.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Defence, Equality and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, The Barron Report, cain.ulst.ac.uk, December 2003. Retrieved 28 September 2014. Shankill Butchers' killings The Shankill Butchers used a black taxi similar to this one to abduct their victims By 1975, Nesbitt was encountering death and serious injury on a daily basis as the violence in Northern Ireland showed no signs of abating; however towards the end of that year, he was faced with the first of a series of brutal killings that added a new dimension to the relentless tit-for-tat killings between Catholics and Protestants that had already made 1975 \\"one of the bloodiest years of the conflict\\". By this time he had already earned 48 commendations for his excellent detective work. On the morning of 25 November after the body of Francis Crossan, a 34-year-old Catholic, was discovered in an entry between Silvio Street and Ambleside Street in the vicinity of Tennent Street station, Nesbitt and his Murder Squad which consisted of ten CID detectives, including himself, immediately launched an investigation into the savage killing. He had been in bed when he received a telephone call from the duty officer at the station advising him about the body \\"dumped on his patch\\". He arrived at the murder scene as the victim's body was being taken away by mortuary personnel. Nesbitt addressed his nine-man murder squad on 26 November with the following statement: \\"We're looking for somebody more brutal than the average terrorist and we'd better get to him\\". Crossan had had his throat slashed so deeply by his assailant that he was almost decapitated with just a tissue of flesh connecting the head to the trunk. When his corpse was found the head was lying almost at right angles to his body. Later Nesbitt's team of ten would be augmented by men from the Belfast Regional Crime Squad and an undercover surveillance team. Less than three months later there was another killing. Following a telephone call to a Belfast newspaper made by a male caller using the pseudonym \\"Major Long of the Young Militants\\" on 7 February 1976, Nesbitt and his team found the body of Catholic man Joseph Quinn (55) lying facedown on a grass bank off Forthriver Way, in the Glencairn estate near the Upper Shankill as instructed by the caller. He had been badly beaten about the head and face and his throat deeply cut. The man calling himself \\"Major Long\\" had claimed Quinn was a \\"militant Republican\\" who had been killed in retaliation for the fatal shooting of two Protestant policemen by the IRA the day before.Note: The two RUC men shot dead by the IRA were James Blakeley (42) and William Murtagh (31). [CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths – 1976] The name \\"Major Long\\" derived from \\"The Long Bar\\", one of the Shankill Road pubs the \\"Butchers\\" frequented and often set out from to carry out their killings as they had done on the night of 6/7 February. Nesbitt did not connect the name \\"Long\\" to the Shankill pub which was a known haunt by loyalist paramilitaries. On the morning of 23 February a woman who was putting out her rubbish in an entry that ran between Mayo Street and Esmond Street in the Shankill Road area discovered the body of Francis Rice (24). Rice, an unemployed Catholic road labourer, had his throat hacked through almost to the spine. Nesbitt concluded the latest killings were perpetrated by the same person or persons that killed Crossen. By this stage the media was already using the term \\"the Butchers\\" to describe the killings. Despite Nesbitt and his men often working 18 hours a day, seven days a week in an attempt to apprehend the culprits, Nesbitt's major obstacles in solving the crime was the lack of manpower, resources and the reluctance of the local population to come forward out of fear of reprisals from paramilitaries.\\"RUC defended on 'Butchers' probe\\". Belfast News Letter. 30 March 2011. Retrieved 6 June 2012 Furthermore, the killers left behind no witnesses or evidence which provided clues as to their identity. When a paramilitary killing took place, Nesbitt and his Murder Squad were aided by other members of CID for at least three days. The detectives attempted to cover every patch of ground in the area where it was believed the paramilitaries operated. When the period of time terminated, the squad went back to teamwork and the other members of the force resumed their handling of crimes unconnected with paramilitary activity. Nesbitt and his men viewed all paramilitaries as criminals no matter from which community they originated. He received his first lead in the \\"Butchers\\"' killings when the woman who found Francis Rice's body said that on the previous night she heard voices with Belfast accents in the entry off Esmond Street and the chugging noise of a taxi. Her home overlooked the entry and the sounds had been clearly audible. Black London-style taxis were frequently used in Belfast as a means of transportation and over 200 plied up and down the Shankill Road everyday. As a result, Nesbitt ordered that all the taxis in the Shankill were to be taken in and forensically tested, including a black taxi belonging to one of the gang, William Moore, a former meat packer. However, as the vehicle had been thoroughly cleaned, no evidence remained to incriminate Moore in the attacks. Moore subsequently destroyed his taxi. Lenny Murphy The \\"Lawnbrook Social Club\\" in Centurion Street, one of Lenny Murphy's drinking haunts Nesbitt did not know at the time that William Moore was part of the murderous gang led by Brookmount Street resident Lenny Murphy, who commanded a UVF platoon that operated mainly from the \\"Brown Bear\\" pub, located on the corner of Mountjoy Street and the Shankill Road, not far from the Tennent Street station. Murphy had a pathological hatred of Catholics, and as a means of manifesting this hatred on the Catholic community at large, had formed a murder gang with like-minded friends from his \\"Brown Bear\\" platoon. The gang's modus operandi involved the abduction of innocent men walking home at night from areas that were overwhelmingly Catholic due to the sectarian geography of Belfast. Once the victims were hit over the head with a wheel brace and dragged into Moore's taxi, they were driven away to be subjected to a beating and torture session that ended with their being dumped, usually into a Shankill alleyway, where their throats were then sliced with butcher's knives. On the night Francis Rice was killed, Murphy had brought along two female acquaintances to observe the beating and murder. In addition to the cut-throat killings, Murphy and the Shankill Butchers also carried out sectarian shootings of random Catholics and punishment killings against their loyalist rivals, the most notable being that of Noel \\"Nogi\\" Shaw on 30 November 1975 as part of an internal UVF feud. Inside the \\"Lawnbrook Social Club\\", in full view of his unit, Murphy savagely beat, pistol-whipped and then repeatedly shot Shaw in the head; afterwards he ordered his body to be placed in a laundry basket. Shaw was a part of the UVF \\"Windsor Bar\\" platoon which was commanded by Anthony \\"Chuck\\" Berry and its members were rivals of the \\"Brown Bear\\" gang controlled by Murphy. The two pubs were a quarter of a mile apart from one another. Police from Nesbitt's C Division found Shaw's body in a back street off the Shankill several hours after he'd been killed. After the examination of the Shankill taxis failed to obtain results, Nesbitt called in all the informers C Division used in West Belfast and even arrested a senior UVF member on false pretexts to offer him a deal in exchange for information; but nobody was able to tell him anything about the perpetrators. He then launched a potentially risky plan to entrap the killers which he codenamed \\"Operation Knife Edge\\". The plan involved putting plainclothes RUC men on the streets at night and having them behave as if they were drunk in the hope of luring the murderers. Although the policemen were placed in streets where the \\"Butchers\\" usually abducted their victims and were closely observed by detectives in nearby cars, the \\"Butchers\\" gang never approached them. Despite Murphy being taken into police custody after attempting to kill two Catholic women in a drive-by shooting in March 1976, the killings continued with Murphy issuing orders to the other gang members on their visits to Crumlin Road Prison. He would later (11 October 1977) be sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment at the Maze on a firearms charge. On 1 August 1976 Cornelius Neeson (49) was fatally stabbed to death; on 30 October Queens University student Stephen McCann (20) fell victim to the gang and in February and March 1977 two more Catholic men (Joseph Morrissey and Francis Cassidy) were slain. As Moore had earlier been ordered by Murphy to dispose of his black taxi, he subsequently bought a yellow Ford Cortina which was used in lieu of the taxi to abduct the victims. Breakthrough Nesbitt finally received his first breakthrough in cracking the case when their last victim, Gerard McLaverty survived a \\"Butchers\\" attack. On 10 May 1977, he was abducted and taken to a disused doctor's surgery on the corner of Emerson Street and the Shankill. Once inside, he was subjected to a vicious beating, and was stabbed, partially strangled and had his wrists cut. Although his assailants dumped him in an alleyway – believing him to be dead – he had in fact survived and Nesbitt was notified of this crime which bore all of the hallmarks of the Shankill Butchers, save for the remarkable fact that he was left alive. At first sceptical of this new attack being the work of the \\"Butchers\\", upon being apprised of the details he became convinced that McLaverty was indeed a victim of the gang. He then quickly came up with a plan that would lead to the capture and subsequent imprisonment of most of the \\"Butchers\\" gang members. He instructed police to drive a well- disguised McLaverty around the Shankill in an unmarked car in the hope that he would be able to recognise some of his assailants outside some of the pubs and drinking clubs the loyalist paramilitaries were known to frequent. This took place on 19 May, the day of local government elections which meant the Shankill Road was even more crowded than usual. Nesbitt's plan bore fruit when McLaverty identified Sam McAllister and Benjamin Edwards as his attackers. The former was easily spotted by McLaverty as he stood in a small group of men outside the \\"Berlin Arms\\", a popular UVF haunt in the Middle Shankill Road, due to his girth. McLaverty upon recognising McAllister had shouted out to the detectives in the car: \\"See that big fat fucker in the middle? That's one of them\\". A search of McAllister's home by police uncovered the knives used in the \\"Butchers\\"' killings which had been hidden under his bed beneath the floorboards. Under Nesbitt's intense questioning, the two arrested men broke down and confessed, providing more names leading to the arrest of Moore, Robert \\"Basher\\" Bates\\" and seven others. They were all charged and sentenced to life imprisonment. Although Murphy was named as the gang's ringleader by Moore who also added those of two others (Murphy's lieutenants, \\"Mr. A\\" and \\"Mr. B\\"), the names were later retracted out of fear of retribution from the UVF Brigade Staff. Moore had actually confessed to Nesbitt in regards to the cut-throat killings that \\"Murphy done the first three and I done the rest\\". However, as Moore had retracted his statement, there wasn't sufficient corroborative or forensic evidence for the state prosecution to charge Murphy (named in court as the \\"Master Butcher\\"), \\"Mr. A\\", or \\"Mr. B\\" with the murders. Lenny Murphy was already well known to Nesbitt as having been one of the hardest members within the UVF, as he had interviewed him a number of times on previous occasions. Following the trial which was held in February 1979, William Moore's mother personally thanked Nesbitt for taking her son off the streets and putting him into jail.\\"A legacy of hatred\\". Belfast Telegraph – Sunday Life. Martin Dillon. 24 May 2009. Retrieved 4 June 2012 Nesbitt later ruefully commented that \\"the big fish got away\\" which was a reference to Murphy and Messrs \\"A\\" and \\"B\\".Belfast News Letter. 21 February 1979 He later visited Moore in prison in a futile attempt to persuade him to name those who had escaped being charged with the murders. Years later when Nesbitt was asked by journalist Peter Taylor how much the UVF Brigade Staff had actually known about the Shankill Butchers, he replied that their actions were not punished by the Brigade Staff because its members were afraid of them. The Committee investigation In 1991, after Channel 4 broadcast a documentary claiming that the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee had been reorganised as an alliance between loyalist paramilitaries, senior RUC members and leader figures in Northern Irish business and finance, Nesbitt and Detective Inspector Chris Webster were appointed by Chief Constable Hugh Annesley to head up an internal inquiry into the collusion allegations. The investigation delivered its verdict in February 1993 and exonerated all those named as Committee members who did not have previous terrorist convictions arguing that they were \\"respectable members of the community\\" and in some cases \\"the aristocracy of the country\\". He added further that all bar one of the RUC officers named in the programme as having been involved in Committee's \\"Inner Force\\" did not actually exist and exonerated the sole real officer, Trevor Forbes. The report claimed that the show had been a hoax perpetrated by a disreputable, unnamed witness, and Nesbitt added that this witness had been active since 1985 when he sold false information about the Inner Force to Martin O'Hagan, who subsequently published it in the Sunday World. McPhilemy denied the veracity of Nesbitt's argument and published a book in 1998 in which he discussed the investigation and also offered further evidence for the existence of the Committee and the Inner Force. McPhilemy argued Nesbitt's investigations had been perfunctory at best, failing for instance to uncover the fact that Jim Sands, the Ulster Independence Committee member who was the chief source for the documentary, was not unknown to one of the Committee's alleged two leading hit-men Billy Wright as Nesbitt had claimed but that rather the two had known each other since school. McPhilemy added that Sands, who had been questioned at some length during the Nesbitt Inquiries, had effectively been coached by the RUC as part of a whitewash. The book also reproduced the full transcript of a conversation between Sunday Express journalist Barrie Penrose and Nesbitt, in which Penrose made it clear that he was opposed to the initial programme whether it was true or not. Amongst the controversial statements made, Nesbitt was quoted as telling Penrose that he was aware of a UVF internal inquiry into the show which, he told Penrose, had pointed the finger at UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade members Jackie Whitten and Graham Long as possible sources for the documentary makers. Awards and later years Prior to his retirement, Nesbitt had received a total of 67 commendations, which is the highest number ever given to a policeman in the history of the United Kingdom. In 1980, he was awarded the MBE \\"in recognition of his courage and success in combating terrorism\\". Shankill Butchers documentary. BBC. presented by Stephen Nolan. broadcast 28 March 2011 When he was asked by journalist Bobbie Hanvey his own opinion on how criminals were able to live with themselves after committing their crimes, his response was that he'd once interviewed a murderer who had killed more than once and admitted to him that, \\"he had been advised by a leading UVF man from Mid- Ulster that the best thing to do was to keep on committing murders. This way, you would forget them because you always remember your first victim and if you kept killing they would all eventually disappear – become jumbled up and none would stand out in your mind\\". He was the subject of a series of interviews by Stephen Nolan in his 2011 televised documentary on the Shankill Butchers. Nolan posed tough questions to Nesbitt as to why it had taken the RUC so long to catch the killers and whether or not the UVF leadership had knowledge of the Butchers' identity. Nesbitt defended his actions by pointing out he had put \\"every effort\\" into catching the culprits but that Lenny Murphy was a cunning and sadistic psychopath who \\"operated a tight circle\\" leaving no evidence behind after his brutal, sectarian killings. Murphy was already dead at the time of the interview having been fatally shot by the Provisional IRA on 16 November 1982. Nesbitt died on 27 August 2014 after a brief illness.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-28248730 In his book The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-booded mass murder, Martin Dillon summed Nesbitt up as \\"undoubtedly the most professional detective in Northern Ireland\\".

The film was announced at Cannes Film Festival 2012, by Rupesh Paul- the director of the film, after the premiere of his movie, Saint Dracula 3D, at the festival. The first look of Kamasutra 3D, was unveiled at NFDC's film bazaar on 22 November 2012 which was held on the sidelines of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2012 in Goa. The Kamasutra 3D – Photo Shoot Video with Sherlyn Chopra was revealed on 19 January 2013. Production=Development Kamasutra 3D is produced under the house of Rupesh Paul Productions Limited and presented by G J Entertainments. The story has been written by the director. The film is co- produced and designed by Sohan Roy, and Dr George John is the executive producer. Rupesh Paul said: Later in June 2016 he went against this and stated: \\"My film was mistaken as an erotica but it is a war film.\\" CastTrivia The director Rupesh Paul decided to replace Sherlyn Chopra, after Chopra uploaded a video clip of the photo shoot of the film on her YouTube channel without seeking his permission. He wanted to replace her with Eva Longoria or Mila Kunis. Chopra later apologised to him in writing, stating that she would not say or write anything about the film without the consent of the producers. On 9 February 2014, Paul filed a lawsuit against Chopra for defamation, alleging that the actress had abused him on the social networking service Twitter. On 22 February Paul filed another complaint against Chopra, seeking anticipatory bail. By March 2014, however, both parties dropped the lawsuits, publicly stating that they had decided to move on from the misunderstanding. In June 2016, Chopra after being asked about the movie after a long period of silence, told the media that she was not involved with movie. She stated that it was \\"not her film\\" and wished the team well.

The Artistic Patronage of the Neapolitan Angevin dynasty includes the creation of sculpture, architecture and paintings during the reigns of Charles I, Charles II and Robert of Anjou in the south of Italy. In 1266, Charles of Anjou established the Neapolitan Angevin dynasty, a royal dynasty that ruled Naples until 1435. Upon taking the crown, Charles of Anjou (now Charles I) hoped to solidify his rule by commissioning great works of art for public display. Recognizing art's potential as a political tool, Charles invited artists from France and Italy to join him at his court in Naples. Subsequent kings of Naples would also employ art as a means of validating their dynastic claims. This forged a tradition of artistic patronage in which the Royal Court of Naples functioned as an important artistic center, drawing artists and architects from throughout France and Italy. From their impressive artistic and architectural programs, emerged a Neapolitan variation of the French Gothic style that became increasingly dominated by Italian artistic developments.John T. Paoletti and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 3rd ed. (London: Laurence King Publishing, 2005), 128. Artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio, Pietro Cavallini, and Simone Martini created works for the Angevin kings of Naples, contributing to the kingdom's wealth of artistic riches. Charles I of Anjou=Sculpture Tuscan sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio entered the service of Charles I in 1277. Prior to arriving in Rome, Arnolfo di Cambio had worked on the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral as part of the workshop of Nicola Pisano, which was completed in 1268. Arnolfo di Cambio completed a marble statue of the Charles I now housed in the Musei Capitolini. One of the first portrait statues since antiquity, the statue of Charles I helped set the precedent for royal portrait sculpture in the Renaissance.Jill Elizabeth Blondin, “Pope Sixtus IV at Assisi: The Promotion of Papal Power,” in Patronage and Dynasty: The Rise of the Della Rovere in Renaissance Italy, ed. Ian Verstegen (Kirksville, MO: Truman State University Press, 2007), 30. While the exact location of its original placement is not known, it would be fair to assume that it stood in a monumental setting where it could be admired by the King's subjects.Paul Williamson, Gothic Sculpture, 1140-1300 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998), 252. The sculpture shows the king sitting stoically with a royal scepter in his right hand and a jeweled crown upon his head. In addition to this medieval iconography, however, King Charles's royal robes and lion headed curule seat have been borrowed from Roman sculpture.Arthur Lincoln Frothingham, The monuments of Christian Rome from Constantine to the Renaissance (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1908), 240. Arnolfo di Cambio portrayed this medieval Neapolitan King as an authoritative Roman Emperor, but has also succeeded in maintaining the individual likeness of his royal patron. Architecture As the founder of a new royal dynasty, Charles I needed to build a royal residence that could function as the seat of his government. He commissioned architect Pietro de Caulis to design the Castel Nuovo (1279–87), which was to serve as the residence of the kings and queens of Naples.Janis Elliott and Cordelia Warr, “Introduction,” in The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina: Art, Iconography, and Patronage in Fourteenth Century Naples, ed. Janis Elliott and Cordelia Warr (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2004), 1. Charles I provided funding for the rebuilding of the Franciscan church of San Lorenzo Maggiore, an early example of the Neapolitan adaptation of the French Gothic style.Elliott and Warr, “Introduction,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina, 1. While the tracery designs at San Lorenzo Maggiore were inspired by the French Gothic church of Saint Denis, its “cavernous nave and its unarticulated walls” show the influence of Italian Franciscan churches.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 128. Charles II of Anjou=Architecture During the reign of Charles II of Anjou (1285-1308), the second Angevin King of Naples, the king's wife, Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, was responsible for initiating a number of architectural projects. The most important of these projects was the rebuilding of the Clarissan convent of Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia, after an earthquake destroyed the original convent in 1293. In 1307, Queen Mary donated funds to the abbess of the Clarissans for the construction of the new church. The Clarissans, or Poor Clares, were the female branch of the Franciscan Order, founded by Saint Clare of Assisi. The church comprises two levels; on the ground level is a dark, low-vaulted nave and above it is a choir supported on eight columns.Cathleen A. Fleck, “’Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See’: The Trecento Choir Frescoes at Santa Maria Donnaregina in Naples,” Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 67, no. 2 (2004): 204. The ground level was most likely for the congregation and the upper level reserved for the nuns.Fleck, “ 'Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See,’” 204 A polygonal apse with stained glass lancet windows illuminates the church, contrasting with the dark nave below. By commissioning Santa Maria Donna Regina, Mary of Hungary began a tradition of royal female patronage in the Kingdom of Naples. San Domenico Maggiore in Naples (apse area). In 1283, Charles II funded the reconstruction of the Dominican church of San Domenico Maggiore, a church similar to his father's church of San Lorenzo Maggiore in its fusion of French Gothic and Italian stylistic elements.Elliott and Warr, “Introduction,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina, 1. Painting In 1308, Roman painter Pietro Cavallini and a group of his pupils arrived at the royal court Naples. Cavallini and his students are believed to have been commissioned by Mary of Hungary to paint the fresco cycles located above the choir in the church of Santa Maria Donna Regina.Samantha Kelly, “Religious patronage and royal propaganda in Angevin Naples: Santa Maria Donna Regina in context,” in Elliott and Warr, The Church of Santa Maria Donna Regina, 27. The fresco cycles, completed between 1320 and 1323, cover all four of the church walls and include: the Last judgment on the west wall; pairs of prophets and apostles and the lives of Saint Agnes and Saint Catherine on the south wall; pairs of prophets and apostles, the life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, and the Passion of Christ on the north wall; an “angelic hierarchy” on the east wall.Fleck, “’Blessed the Eyes that See Those Things you See,’” 204. In 1308, Charles II commissioned Pietro Cavallini to paint a fresco cycle depicting three scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene in the Brancaccio chapel at the Dominican church of San Domenico Maggiore. The painter Giotto worked at the royal court of Naples from 1328 until 1332, during which time he painted a number of panel paintings and frescoes. All of these works are unfortunately lost, but a work by one of his followers survives in the Brancaccio Chapel at the church of San Domenico Maggiore, a fresco of Noli Me Tangere from around 1310.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 129-30. Robert of Anjou=Painting Robert of Anjou was the third son of King Charles II and Mary of Hungary. Charles II's first son Charles Martel of Anjou had died by 1295, putting his second son Louis next in line for the throne. Louis, however, did not desire the crown of Naples, and would instead become bishop of the diocese of Toulouse in 1296. Louis and Charles II died in 1297 and in 1308 respectively, leading to Robert's coronation in 1309. By 1317, Louis, with the help of Robert's royal influence, was canonized as Saint Louis of Toulouse. The Neapolitan House of Anjou now possessed its own saint, which Robert of Anjou would use to his political advantage.Julian Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse, Robert of Anjou and Simone Martini,” Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 39, no. 1 (1976): 19. It was around this year that the Sienese painter Simone Martini was commissioned, most likely by Robert of Anjou, to paint the Altarpiece of St Louis of Toulouse, now in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 19. In this altarpiece, Saint Louis of Toulouse sits enthroned in his brown sackcloth and crimson jeweled cope, holding his crozier with his right hand and donning his bishop's mitre on his haloed head.Timothy Hyman, Sienese Painting (London: Thames and Hudson, 2003), 49. Two angels hover over him, sustaining the crown of sainthood above his mitre.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 22. As he receives the celestial crown, the Saint, with his left hand, offers the Neapolitan crown to his brother Robert of Anjou, shown in profile, who kneels before him. Altarpiece of Saint Louis of Toulouse by Simone Martini, 1317. Despite the presence of religious iconography, the altarpiece's motives were more political than devotional.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 20. Robert of Anjou's nephew Caroberto, as the son of Charles II's first son Charles Martel, had a legitimate claim to the Neapolitan throne. Robert of Anjou sought to validate his royal ascension through Simone Martini's employment of both dynastic and religious iconography.Suzette Denise Scotti, “Simone Martini’s St. Louis of Toulouse and its Cultural Context” (master’s thesis, Louisiana State University, 2009), 37. Iconographic parallels can be identified between Simone Martini's figure of Saint Louis of Toulouse and Arnolfo di Cambio's figure of Charles of Anjou.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24. Both figures are shown frontally and are seated on lion-shaped thrones; they wield objects of power and wear jeweled crowns.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24. Saint Louis is represented more like a great king than a Franciscan saint, emphasizing the altarpiece's political function.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 24. Much of the altarpiece's dynastic political power was derived from its decorative iconography. The most prominent dynastic icon featured in the altarpiece is the fleur-de-lys, the symbol of the French monarchy. The Angevins of Naples had descended from the French House of Capet and thus utilized the fleur-de- lys as their royal emblem. The fleur-de-lys motif is punched into the traditional Sienese gold ground, forming a decorative border around Simone Martini's main panel.Hyman, Sienese Art, 50. The frame of the altarpiece is painted a deep blue and decorated with large gold fleurs-de-lys, modelled in deep relief. Below the frame is a predella in which Simone Martini painted five scenes from the life of Saint Louis of Toulouse. This would have proved challenging for Simone as Saint Louis had just been canonized, requiring him to invent a new set of iconography.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 30. These scenes function as both religious and dynastic icons by depicting the miracles of a saint from the Angevin dynasty.Gardner, “Saint Louis of Toulouse,” 30. Two additional dynastic icons can be observed on the clasp of St Louis's cope: the red and yellow heraldic colors of Provence and the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 132 By presenting these two territories, both claimed by the Angevins, Simone has revealed the extent of Robert of Anjou's political reach. Architecture Façade (right) and belltower of Santa Chiara. Robert of Anjou and his wife Sancha of Majorca financed the construction of the Franciscan double convent of Santa Chiara (Naples). The monastic complex was begun in around 1310 by the architect Gagliardo Primario and was completed by the 1340s. The structure included two cloisters to separately house the Poor Clares and the Franciscan friars.Caroline Astrid Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples: Church building in Angevin Italy, 1266-1343 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2004), 142. The main church comprised a long nave with nine lateral chapels on each side and a friars’ choir at the far end by the main altar.Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 143. A wall stood behind the friars’ choir, separating it from the nuns’ choir located on the other side.Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 143. A long gallery, supported by the lateral chapels, stretched across the length of the church, above which was a row of clerestory windows.Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 144. The design of Santa Chiara alludes to the cathedrals of Provence and Catalonia.Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 144. Santa Chiara's monumental scale surpassed that of all churches in the kingdom, turning this Franciscan convent into a display of Angevin royal power.Bruzelius, The Stones of Naples, 133-34. Sculpture Funerary monument of Mary of Hungary in Santa Maria Donna Regina by Tino di Camaino. In order to further solidify his dynastic claims, Robert of Anjou initiated an ambitious campaign to erect funerary monuments for members of the Angevin dynasty. The tomb's structure inside of Santa Chiara was designed by architect Gagliardo Primario and the individual funerary monuments were erected by a number of different sculptors. Robert commissioned the Sienese sculptor Tino di Camaino to create the funerary monument for his mother, Mary of Hungary. Tino di Camaino had arrived at the royal court of Naples in 1323 and worked for the Angevins for the last fourteen years of his life. Unlike the other funerary monuments commissioned by Robert, which were to be erected inside of the monastic complex of Santa Chiara, Mary of Hungary was to be placed inside of Santa Maria Donna Regina. Tino's sculptural monument for Mary consisted of a sarcophagus decorated with seven niches, each one containing a sculpted figure of one of her seven sons. Featured most prominently in the central niche is St. Louis of Toulouse. Robert sits to his right, affirming the king's celestial ties. In this representation of Robert, as in Simone Martini's painting, his dynastic legitimacy is emphasized. He sits majestically, wearing a crown and holding symbols of royal power. The chest of Mary's tomb is adorned with figures depicting the four cardinal virtues: Prudentia, Temperantia. Justitia, and Fortitudo.Margaret Schaus, ed., Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia (New York: Routledge, 2006), 535. Robert of Anjou's tomb was created by Florentine sculptors Pacio and Giovanni Bertini, who had most likely trained with Tino di Camaino.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 133 For his monument, erected inside of Santa Chiara, Pacio and Giovanni Bertini represented Robert of Anjou in a relief at the center of the sarcophagus, in a recumbent effigy on the sarcophagus, and in a free- standing sculpture.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 133 In the free-standing sculpture, Robert is portrayed as an enthroned Roman ruler, much like in Arnolfo di Cambio's statue of his grandfather, Charles I.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134 In the recumbent effigy, however, Robert is barefoot and wearing a friar's tunic, showing his devotion to the Franciscan order.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134 In the relief at the center of the sarcophagus, Robert is depicted with members of his royal family, including his successor, his granddaughter Joan I of Naples.Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 134 With this funerary monument, Pacio and Giovanni Bertini successfully present an image of both royal and spiritual power, and secure the dynastic claims of future Angevins rulers.

It is located in 19 Ceylon Road, Singapore 429613 in Singapore. History In the 1850s, a statue of Lord Vinayagar was discovered by the side of a pond. A Chempaka tree, Senpaga in Tamil, stood on the bank of the pond. As the Vinayagar statue was found besides the Chempaka tree, the temple came to be known as \\"Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple\\". A Ceylon Tamil, Mr. Ethirnayagam Pillai (Pillay) pioneered the building of the first structure as a modest shelter with an attap roof with the help of the nearby Indian workers. This humble abode under the Chempaka tree became the temple of Sri Senpaga Vinayagar. Management committee In 1909, the Ceylon Tamils who had grown in number to about 300 families, formed the Singapore Ceylon Tamils’ Association (SCTA). In 1913, a Management Committee of four persons was formed to renovate the premises for the ever-growing number of devotees. In 1923, the SCTA assisted the Temple by purchasing the land on which the Temple stands today. A bigger temple subsequently emerged with a priest (a pandaram) to initiate prayers (poojas) and other religious ceremonies. The present committee members can be viewed in the following link Temple Committee Members SCTA role In 1923, the Singapore Ceylon Tamil Association (SCTA) became the official keeper and manager of this autonomous temple. From that year onwards, the Temple Committee was elected from among the SCTA members. In the following year, the committee decided to upgrade the Temple. In 1926, under the chairmanship of Mr. S Muthukumaru, the plans were finalized and a sculptor was commissioned. In 1929, the construction of the concrete building was completed. Consecration ceremonies In 1930, the first Maha Kumbhabishegam was held with the help of generous donations from the chairman. Many well-placed community leaders and devotees permitted the addition of several new shrines within the precincts of the temple. They included shrines for Lord Shiva, Goddess Ambal, and Lords Subramaniam, Vairavar and Nageswarar. On 3 February 1930, a major Consecration (Maha Kumbhabishegam) of the temple was held for the first time. In 1949, during the Second World War, when a bomb damaged the temple, the restoration began under the chairmanship of Dr. P. Thillainathan and six years later on 7 July 1955, devotees witnessed another Consecration Ceremony.

The case lead to the conviction of former military dictator H. M. Ershad.  Background  Janata Tower is an eleven-storey building located in Karwan Bazar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was originally planned to be 15 floors. After construction stopped in 1991 when General Ershad stepped down the tower became a home for squatters.  History  On 14 April 1991 the Bureau of Anti Corruption (today Anti Corruption Commission) filed a case against 17 people including former president and military autocrat Hussein Mohammad Ershad and 19 others with Tejgaon Police Station. He was charged with abuse of power for collusion with M. M. Rahmat Ullah in allotting the land for the project; and possessing unaccounted money. The Justice in his 91 -page verdict said General Ershad was found guilty under the Prevention Act; on 20 November 2000, the justice sentenced the former president to seven years' imprisonment. The building was acquired by Bangladesh government. As a result, Ershad could not participate in the 2001 elections. Ershad appealed against the verdict in the High Court Division which affirmed the conviction, but reduced the sentence to five years on 24 August 2004. He was also fined 55 million taka. He was released with a year and half remaining on his sentence. Ershad's then wife Rowshan Ershad was fined Ten thousand taka. Shukur Ali Pradhan another accused in the case had filed to get the tower back from the government. The high court ruled in his favor but the supreme court overturned it and the property remains in government ownership. Ershad, the former President of Bangladesh and chief of the National Party (Jatiya Party), was released on bail on 9 April 2001 after serving four months in jail in Dhaka.  Legacy  The tower was repurposed as an Software park by the government of Bangladesh. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, editor of the daily Manab zamin was sentenced to jail in May 2002 for contempt of court. The paper had published a transcript of a phone conversation between Ershad and a High court judge in which Ershad was seeking a more favourable verdict in the Janata tower case.

It is located in the historic Glendower Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. In March 2012, it was announced that the Monmouth Police Station was one of seventeen police stations in South East Wales that would no longer be open to the public. History April 1931 funeral procession for William Bullock, Superintendent of Police Before 1881, the town of Monmouth maintained and staffed its own police station. Monmouthshire County assumed control of Monmouth for policing in 1881, and Monmouth eliminated its own police force. The county rented a building in Agincourt Street as a police station. In 1895, the Monmouthshire County Council purchased a building in Glendower Street, and redeveloped it as a police station. The Agincourt Street facility was no longer needed. Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire indicates that, in 1901, the Monmouth Police Station on Glendower Street was staffed by Captain Vincent E. Parker, \\"Superintendent of the Borough County Constabulary,\\" as well as two sergeants and seven constables. Police Superintendent Parker did not live at the police station; rather, he resided in the Overmonnow area with his family. Ten years earlier, the native of France had been Superintendent of Police in Tredegar, Monmouthshire. While Parker did not reside at the station in 1901, other members of the police force did call it (or the building to the right of it) home. Police Sergeant John Tucker resided at 13 A Glendower Street with his family. Police constable James Collins boarded there as well. In 1911, the address of the Monmouth Police Station was recorded as 15 Glendower Street. The station was the residence of Police Sergeant Charles Jones, a native of Herefordshire, and his family. Constables Albert Jenkins and Frederick Dries, of Monmouthshire and Middlesex respectively, boarded there as well. Police Sergeant Jones had lived on Hereford Road in 1901. William Bullock was Superintendent of Police in 1923. His title was \\"Superintendent of the County and Borough Constabulary.\\" Two sergeants and six constables were also at Glendower Street. The Monmouth Police Station at 19 Glendower Street is a mid 19th-century, listed building. It is located within the medieval walls of the town, built around 1300. The main building is three storeys with a four-bay elevation, and there is a two-storey extension to the right with a three-bay elevation. The exterior is stucco and there is a hipped tile roof. Glendower Street, the site of the Monmouth Police Station since 1895, has been partially renumbered since the early 20th century. In 1901, the station (or the building housing some of the police staff) was documented at 13A Glendower Street, the record immediately next to that for the Druid's Head Inn at 19 Glendower Street. In 1911, the station was at 15 Glendower Street. Decades later, at the time of the heritage listings, at least a portion of the police building was recorded at 17 Glendower Street. There is a separate Coflein listing at 19 Glendower Street. It describes an old pub with a two-storey, two-bay elevation and a roughcast exterior. This is a reference to the Druid's Head Inn, to the immediate left (southeast) of the police station. It was the public house that had the 19 Glendower Street address for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Monmouth Police Station was grade II listed on 15 August 1974. The fencing and gate behind 17 Glendower Street, also part of the station, are adjacent to those of the Henry Burton Court residences and are positioned in front of Chippenham Park. They were grade II listed on 8 October 2005. The building not only houses the local police, it also serves as a response center for the Gwent Police. The Gwent Police are responsible for an area of approximately 600 square miles. The Monmouth Police Station was one of the Monmouth facilities that welcomed visitors in September 2011 during Open Doors 2011, European Heritage Days in Wales. The event was put together by the Monmouth Civic Society and the Civic Trust for Wales. On 31 May 2012, the Gwent Police announced that the next Monmouth Off Street Project (MOSP) event had been scheduled for 24 June 2012. The MOSP began in 2009 in response to the perceived increase in anti-social behaviour of Monmouth youths. When queried, local children had noted the lack of youth facilities in the Monmouth area and had suggested a new skate park. The MOSP team meets regularly and plans fundraising activities to finance the skate park, with the event scheduled for June 2012 a zip line in Chepstow. On 13 March 2012, the BBC News reported that as of July of that year, seventeen police stations in South East Wales would close to the public, with only five still offering front desk service. The closures were reported to be undertaken as part of a program of cost-saving measures at Gwent Police. The Monmouth Police Station was one of the buildings that would no longer be open to the public.

Early life and education Hadleigh-West was born in Fairbanks, Alaska to parents; Katherine Talbot a legal secretary and Frederick Hadleigh West a college professor in Archeology and Anthropology, both of whom grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. As a child, she was influenced by 1960s radical politics and economic injustice. After the divorce of her parents in 1970, her mother moved with Hadleigh-West and her two brothers Fred Jr. and Dickson to Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. In high school, Hadleigh-West first picked up a camera, intending to videotape her good friend Joanne Liebeler in character as a gypsy in downtown Minneapolis. While shooting she became distracted by a pimp in full 1970’s regalia, a moment in her development she believes pointed directly to her film Player Hating: A Love Story. In 1984, Hadleigh-West enrolled at George Washington University where she majored in Visual Communications. For the next ten years, Hadleigh-West worked as a Graphic Designer/Art Director, and later attended graduate school at School of the Visual Arts in New York City where she got her masters in Fine Art. Her thesis was an experimental documentary short titled War Zone (1991, 13 min.) which she later expanded into a feature and launched her career as a filmmaker. Her latest film is Player Hating: A Love Story which chronicles Brooklyn rapper Half-A-Mil in his journey from obscurity to celebrity inside one of America's most dangerous housing projects. Film and television career Hadeigh-West's thesis garnered a story in Glamour Magazine which led to a media bilzt and the creation of her own company, Film Fatale Productions. Film Fatale's goal is to expose and explore the manifestations of prejudice and oppression in marginalized communities throughout the United States and abroad. Clients have included: Department of Defense, Department of Justice, the Smithsonian Museum, Williams College, Middlebury College, the Juilliard School, University of California at Berkeley, Albright College, Boys and Girls Club of America, juvenile prisons, alternative detention centers, among other clients.

It is mostly employed for finding the patch that introduced a bug. Another application area is finding the patch that indirectly fixed a bug. Overview The process of locating the changeset that introduced a specific regression was described as \\"source change isolation\\" in 1997 by Brian Ness and Viet Ngo of Cray Research. Regression testing was performed on Cray's compilers in editions comprising one or more changesets. Editions with known regressions could not be validated until developers addressed the problem. Source change isolation narrowed the cause to a single changeset that could then be excluded from editions, unblocking them with respect to this problem, while the author of the change worked on a fix. Ness and Ngo outlined linear search and binary search methods of performing this isolation. Code bisection has the goal of minimizing the effort to find a specific change set. It employs a divide and conquer algorithm that depends on having access to the code history which is usually preserved by revision control in a code repository. Bisection method=Code bisection algorithm Code history has the structure of a directed acyclic graph which can be topologically sorted. This makes it possible to use a divide and conquer search algorithm which: * splits up the search space of candidate revisions * tests for the behavior in question * reduces the search space depending on the test result * re-iterates the steps above until a range with at most one bisectable patch candidate remains Algorithmic complexity Bisection is in LSPACE having an algorithmic complexity of O(\\\\log N) with N denoting the number of revisions in the search space, and is similar to a binary search. Desirable repository properties For code bisection it is desirable that each revision in the search space can be built and tested independently. Monotonicity For the bisection algorithm to identify a single changeset which caused the behavior being tested to change, the behavior must change monotonically across the search space. For a Boolean function such as a pass/fail test, this means that it only changes once across all changesets between the start and end of the search space. If there are multiple changesets across the search space where the behavior being tested changes between false and true, then the bisection algorithm will find one of them, but it will not necessarily be the root cause of the change in behavior between the start and the end of the search space. The root cause could be a different changeset, or a combination of two or more changesets across the search space. To help deal with this problem, automated tools allow specific changesets to be ignored during a bisection search. Automation support Although the bisection method can be completed manually, one of its main advantages is that it can be easily automated. It can thus fit into existing test automation processes: failures in exhaustive automated regression tests can trigger automated bisection to localize faults. Ness and Ngo focused on its potential in Cray's continuous delivery-style environment in which the automatically isolated bad changeset could be automatically excluded from builds. The revision control systems Fossil, Git and Mercurial have built-in functionality for code bisection. The user can start a bisection session with a specified range of revisions from which the revision control system proposes a revision to test, the user tells the system whether the revision tested as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", and the process repeats until the specific \\"bad\\" revision has been identified. Other revision control systems, such as Bazaar or Subversion, support bisection through plugins or external scripts. Phoronix Test Suite can do bisection automatically to find performance regressions.

The Astrologer who Fell into a Well is a fable based on a Greek anecdote concerning the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales of Miletus. It was one of several ancient jokes that were absorbed into Aesop's Fables and is now numbered 40 in the Perry Index. During the scientific attack on astrology in the 16th–17th centuries, the story again became very popular. The fable and its interpretation The story of Thales falling into a well while gazing at the stars was originally recorded in Plato's Theaetetus. Other ancient tellings sometimes vary the person or the rescuer but regularly retain the rescuer's scoffing remark that it would be better to keep one's mind on the earth.Andrados F. R., History of the Graeco-Latin Fable vol.3, Brill 2003, pp.57-8 The Roman poet Ennius summed up the lesson to be learned from the story in the line (\\"No one regards what is before his feet when searching out the regions of the sky\\") and was twice quoted by Cicero to this effect. The anecdote was repeated as an amusing story in the English jest book Merry Tales and Quick Answers (1530). In this the philosopher Meanwhile, Andrea Alciato was mounting a more serious attack on astrology in his Book of Emblems, the first of many editions of which appeared in 1531. In that first edition there was an illustration of the astrologer, head in air, about to trip over a block on the ground.Memorial web edition The accompanying Latin poem referred to the story of Icarus and later editions used instead an illustration of his fall from the sky. However, the emblem is titled \\"Against Astrologers\\" and the poem concludes with the warning 'Let the astrologer beware of predicting anything. For the imposter will fall headlong, so long as he flies above the stars.' The English emblem compiler Geoffrey Whitney followed Alciato's lead in including the story and an equally fierce attack in his Choice of Emblemes (1586). At much the same time, John Lyly's play, Gallathea (first performed in 1588) features a sub-plot involving a phony alchemist and a sham astronomer who, in gazing up at the stars, falls backward into a pond. The Neo-Latin poet Gabriele Faerno also included the story of the stumbling astrologer in his collection Centum Fabulae (1554), but concluded with the more philosophical point, 'How can you understand the world without knowing yourself first?' As with several others, it was from this source that Jean de la Fontaine included the plot among his Fables (II.13). His poem is remarkable in confining the story to a mere four-line allusion before launching into a 45-line denunciation of astrology (with a side-swipe at alchemy too). But the battle against superstition had been won by the time that Charles Denis included a mere digest of La Fontaine's poem in his Select Fables (1754). His conclusion is that speculation about the future is idle; how many folk, he asks, Samuel Croxall is even more curt in his Fables of Aesop (1732). The moral of the tale, he concludes, is \\"mind your own business\\".

Without patent or trademark protection, the Kentucky Reel was quickly copied by many others, including Meek, Milam, Sage, Hardman and Gayle. These artisans were trained in jewelry fabrication and were experienced in cutting gears, constructing small parts, and doing precision work. In time, the Kentucky Reel was mass-produced by the emerging factories located in the Northeast, where they could be produced at a fraction of the cost and time required for hand-built construction. The availability of more affordable fly reels greatly stimulated the sales and popularity of fly fishing equipment, and was soon applied to bait casting reels, resulting in a surge in the popularity of fishing as a pastime among all levels of American society.Land, Bill.

Music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja and the film was produced by Ramana Communications and co- produced by Shakthi International (P.Loganathan). The film had a theatrical release across India in February 2004. Plot The narration is divided into three phases. The pre-Independence period, depicting Kamaraj's childhood, the influence of Satyamurthy, Kamaraj's growth as a politician and his prison life. The second phase depicts his taking over as the Congress Chief Minister of the state, the reforms he tries to bring in, especially in education, his largesse and his bending the rules for a good cause-like for the urgent eye- operation of a kid. It also displayed his sense of humour (like his response when his mother in the village sends word that she needed a fan and a blanket), his refusal to take advantage of his position (asking for the newly installed tap to be removed from his village-house). The third phase where he puts forth the Kamaraj Plan, resigns from the post of CM, involves himself in party work; his influence on national politics, his emergence as a kingmaker and finally his disillusionment with the emerging non-ethics in political life.

The flying training was undertaken in two stages; the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) at the elementary training school. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to a service flying training school in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.Stephens (2006), pp. 68–70 No. 12 Elementary Flying Training School (12 EFTS) was established at Bundaberg Airport on 16 October 1940.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 35 This aerodrome pre-dated the war, and had been used as a civilian airport since 1931. 12 EFTS relocated to Lowood Aerodrome on 12 January 1942.

It follows the failed love between Zainuddin, a mixed-race man, and Hayati, a pure Minang woman. Hamka, an Islamic scholar who disapproved of Minang adat (traditions), wrote Van der Wijck as a critique of the discrimination against mixed-race persons prevalent in Minang society at the time, as well as the subservient role of women. Originally released as a serial, Van der Wijck was republished as a novel after favourable popular reception. Described by the socialist literary critic Bakri Siregar as Hamka's best work, the work came under fire in 1962 because of similarities between it and Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr's Sous les Tilleuls (Under the Limes; 1832). Background Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, better known as simply Hamka, was the Sumatran-born son of a devout Muslim who viewed local traditions as hindering the progress of religion – his father's opinions influenced his. After a trip to Java and Mecca beginning when he was sixteen, he became a religious scholar in Deli, East Sumatra, then in Makassar, South Sulawesi. During these travels, especially while in the Middle East, he extensively read works by Islamic scholars and authors, such as those by the Egyptian writer Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti, as well as Arabic-language translations of European works. In 1935 he left Makassar for Medan, North Sumatra, where he became the editor of an Islamic weekly magazine, Pedoman Masjarakat. It was while in Medan that he wrote Van der Wijck, which was inspired in part by the sinking of an actual vessel in 1936. Plot Zainuddin is an orphan. His Minang father died in exile after killing a relative over inheritance; his non-Minang mother has also died. He is now living with his father's friend Mak Base in Batipuh, Sumatra. As a person of mixed descent, he faces much discrimination from Minang conservatives. Although he loves Hayati, the daughter of local nobleman, he is not allowed to be with her. He decides to move to Padang Panjang, although he continues to write to Hayati. One day, Hayati goes to Padang Panjang to see Zainuddin and stays with her friend Khadijah. However, Khadijah's elder brother Aziz falls in love with Hayati, leading to Zainuddin and Aziz to compete for Hayati's affections. Aziz, who is of purely Minang descent and a noble background, is favoured by her family; they look down on Zainuddin, who is poor and of mixed heritage. Although Zainuddin receives a sizeable inheritance from Mak Base, he is too late to inform Hayati's family, and Aziz marries her. In despair, Zainuddin and his friend Muluk go to Java, first to Batavia and then to Surabaya, where Zainuddin becomes known as a writer and philanthropist. Aziz and Hayati also move to Surabaya, after Aziz is transferred. However, their relationship has soured and Aziz's temper leads to him being fired, leaving the couple homeless. After a period living with Zainuddin, Aziz runs away to Banyuwangi, leaving Hayati for Zainuddin; in a letter, Aziz writes that Zainuddin is more deserving. Zainuddin, who has suffered from his longing for Hayati, spurns her and tells her to return to Sumatra. The next day she boards the Van der Wijck, which sinks off the coast of northern Java. Hearing the news, Zainuddin and Muluk rush to Tuban to search for her. They find her in a hospital, where Zainuddin and Hayati make up; she then dies in his arms. Zainuddin's health worsens not long afterwards. After he dies, he is buried next to Hayati. Themes Like Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah (Under the Protection of Ka'bah; 1938) before it, Van der Wijck is critical of Minang adat (traditions), such as the treatment of persons of mixed descent and the role of women, an issue shown through Hayati's work to be an ideal wife despite Aziz mistreating her. Hamka found some traditions incompatible with the tenets of Islam and common sense. and continued to criticise adat in his works. Release and reception Van der Wijck was first published as a serial in his weekly Islamic-themed magazine Pedoman Masjarakat in Medan in 1938. According to Yunan Nasution, an employee of the magazine at the time, when the magazine was shipped to Kutaraja, Aceh (now Banda Aceh), readers would wait at the train station to buy and read the next instalment as soon as possible. Hamka also received fan mail, in which readers described the book as reflecting their own lives. However, conservative Muslims denounced the book, arguing that an Islamic scholar should not write romances. After this generally favourable feedback, Hamka decided to publish it with a private publisher owned by his friend M. Syarkawi; by using a private publisher he avoided the censorship imposed on authors by Balai Pustaka, the official publisher of the colonial government. A second printing was with Syarkawi's publisher, then the next five printings, beginning in 1951, were by Balai Pustaka, which had become the state-owned publisher of Indonesia after independence in 1945. The eighth printing, in 1961, was published by Nusantara in Jakarta, with printings after that by Bulan Bintang. The work has also had several printings in Malaysia. The Indonesian socialist literary critic Bakri Siregar wrote that Van der Wijck was Hamka's best work, noting with interest the way in which Zainuddin writes about politics after losing Hayati. The Indonesian literary critic Maman S. Mahayana found Van der Wijck to have good characterisation and use suspense better than contemporary Balai Pustaka publications; he suggested that this was a benefit of the work originally being published as a serial. Plagiarism case In September 1962 a man named Abdullan S.P. wrote in the newspaper Bintang Timur that Van der Wijck was plagiarised from Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr's Sous les Tilleuls (Under the Limes; 1832), via the Arabic translation by Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti; rumours of such plagiarism had been around before that. This became a widespread polemic in the Indonesian press, with most accusers originating from the leftist literary organisation Lekra, while non-leftist writers defended the novel. Critics found similarities between the two in both their plot and technique, especially the use of an exchange of letters between the main characters to further the plot. The literary documentarian HB Jassin, who compared the two using an Indonesian translation of Sous les Tilleuls entitled Magdalena, wrote that there was very little chance that the novel should be called plagiarism, as Hamka's descriptions of locations were highly detailed and consistent with his earlier works. Jassin also emphasised that the novel discussed issues with Minang adat, which would not be found in a foreign work. Siregar, however, considered the similarities between Zainuddin and Steve, as well as Hayati and Magdalena, too close, suggesting plagiarism. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw noted, without concluding whether similarities were conscious or unconscious, that the books had similarities, but agreed that Van der Wijck had purely Indonesian themes.

From history of battle period between the Shirvanshahs and Ardabil sheikhs it is known, that Shaykh Junayd - grandfather of Shah Ismail I – perished in the battlefield with Khalilullah’s army in 1456 and was buried there. Construction of the mausoleum on his grave was carried out significantly later. A ligature in the northern façade of the complex evidences about it. Investigation of the building shows that a part of the building, where the construction ligature is located now, has been attached to the building of the mausoleum later. Then it should be acknowledged that this ligature has been brought here from the main building during construction of the annex. History There is also information that remains of Sheikh Juneyd were brought to Ardabil in the 16th century. According to this information it should be supposed that remains were brought to Ardabil significantly later after the construction of the mausoleum, or the mausoleum was built at the same time with displacement of the remains. Considering the fact that the Safavids were already the great rulers till the construction of the mausoleum, then it is quite possible, that after displacement of the remains of his ancestor perished in the battle for strengthening the power of the Safavid dynasty, shah Tahmasp I constructed this mausoleum as a monument to Sheikh Juneyd, giving the erection character of a sepulchral mosque. Indeed, the mausoleum has many similarities with domical mosques. Architecture The mausoleum is quadrangular shaped with sides of 7,23 meters. There are apertures in all four walls of the building. From three sides – the western, eastern and southern – they are located in big niche-portals with the width of 4,67 meters in the depth of 2,9 meters. Origination of small rooms in the corners, apparently, used as auxiliary rooms, is connected with the presence of these portal-niches, which are compositional elements of the façade. There is an access to the cupola from the south-eastern cell-rooms, which is at the level of its foundation. Inner walls of the mausoleum with the heights of 1,42 meters are faced with quadrangular glazed plates of two colors – blue and dark-violet, placed in staggered order. It should be mentioned that the glaze is of low quality – its surface is not smooth, it is covered with cracks and is porous. Stalactites including a passage from the quadrangular foundation to the cupola are determining details of the interior. For showing their dominating importance in the interior of the mausoleum it is enough to show that heights of stalactite band reach to approximately 4 meters (3,88). Due to their large cells, stalactites are perceived as constructive elements of the building at first sight. Heights of the first raw of stalactites is 1,87 meters, but the second is 1,7 meters. There is a cupola on the upper stalactite band, which has a conical shape from the inner side. The whole surface of the walls and stalactites is covered with plaster, except the lower part which is covered with glazed plates. Interior of the mausoleum amazes with its greatness. Such an impression is related to the general scale of divisions and especially a trumpet arch of stalactites. The northern wing of the mausoleum is undoubtedly a later annex. It is apparent not only from the whole plan of the building, with which this annex is not harmonized compositionally, but also from the fact that the walls of the annex are only attached to the wall of the mausoleum and are not its continuation.

He was popularly known by his religious name Haxhi Qamili, though he was also known as Baba Qamili (Father Qamil). Biography=Early life Qamili was a villager from Sharra (in Tirana) and was the Sheikh of a tekke belonging to the Melami order of dervishes that sought social equality and rejected wealth and luxury. Peasant revolt The uprising began in mid-May 1914, but had its origins in 1913. The rebellion was mainly uphold by illiterate peasants that fearing to lose the lands they were given during the Ottoman Empire objected the laws of a foreign ruler. The uprising base was in the regions of Shijak, Kavaja and Tirana. On 3 June 1914, the rebels, who were led by mufti Musa Qazim Beqari, made their demands known at a gathering in Kavaja, among which was the overthrow of the Western- installed Prince Wied. The Muslim insurgents demanded the reunion of Albania with the Ottoman state or at least to be ruled by an Ottoman ruler, the reinstatement of the Shariah, the removal of the Albanian flag and its replacement with the Ottoman flag. The revolt gained moderate success in central Albania, being able to seize Lushnjë and on 1 September Vlorë. Two days later, Prince Wied in Durrës was forced to abandon his six-month kingdom and the Muslim rebels legislated the re-union of Albania with the Ottoman state. With Weid removed, Essad Pasha, who had the support of Italy, returned from exile in October 1914. =Characteristics= Haxhi Qamili's inspiration was Musa Qazimi, a local mufti who supported the Young Turks' policies. Qamili referred to Christians, who Haxhi Qamili referred to as \\"kaurrët\\" (i.e. \\"heathens\\", a very pejorative slur when applied by Muslims to Christians) and \\"bad people... who even God doesn't love\\"Jelavich B, History of the Balkans: Twentieth century,The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, UK 1999, p. 103. During his pro-Ottoman revolt, Christians were slaughtered and tortured. The movement also attacked Albanian nationalist teachers who had been teaching using the Latin alphabet. The motto of the rebels was \\"Duam, duam Babën-- Turqinë!\\" (We want, we want our father -- Turkey) and they raised the flag of the Ottoman Empire and restored Ottoman Turkish as the national language. Haxhi Qamili and his movement were opposed by many Albanian Muslims. In the Elbasan region in particular, local Muslim community leaders and other Muslim notables denounced the movement as \\"archaic\\" and \\"fanatical\\" with many opposing it with arms. Elbasanlli clerics also supported the Latin alphabet, opposing Haxhi Qamili's view and also the views of more conservative Sunni clerics elsewhere.Carcani, Leonard. Fete ne Elbasan. Page 16. Rebels killed several Muslim clerics who were involved in Albanian nationalist cycles. The rebellion was only tacitly supported by the Ottomans, who as a consequence of the Balkan Wars were physically separated from the Albanian lands. The Ottoman preoccupation with the looming First World War also rendered diplomatic and material support impractical. War with Essad Pasha Essad Pasha Toptani, a supporter of the feudal lords, took power with Serbian support. Qamili became one of the leaders of the renewed rebellion and was elected by the Islamic rebels as their commander-in-chief. by the end of November 1914, the rebels had regained the upper hand in Tirana and burnt Essad Pasha’s palace to the ground. The rebellion achieved rapid successes, confining Essad's government of central Albania to Durrës itself. With the start of the First World War, Albania was invaded by Greek, Italian and Serbian forces, which changed the situation of the uprising entirely. In January 1915 Qamili along with other rebel leaders convened a National Congress in Tirana, declaring on behalf of the whole Albanian people the illegitimacy of Essad's Durrës-based government while affirming Albanian neutrality in World War I. In May 1915 Qamili was elected leader of the rebels. Death In an effort to aid Essad's government and to further its own territorial aims, the Kingdom of Serbia launched an invasion of central Albania on June 2, 1915 but was promptly met by resistance led by Qamili at Qukës where, however, the rebels' outnumbered and outgunned forces were defeated by the Serbs. Through this intervention the \\"rebellion, with [its] vague, unsettled political objectives, which did, nevertheless, have both a popular and a social basis\\" was suppressed. The Serbian forces arrested Qamili and other rebel leaders and sent them as prisoners to Durrës, where they were tried in a court presided over by Xhelal Bey Zogu and sentenced to be hanged. Analysis Enver Hoxha believed that the peasant movement under Qamili's direction was primarily one of the rural poor, which relied upon traditional forms of government such as village councils to organize and direct a struggle against feudal interests. Qamili preached that all property in excess of personal needs should be given to the impoverished, quoting the Quran and also expressing the sentiment of the Melami sect, which was against the concept of private property. Works published during the communist period stated that the peasant rebels under Qamili's command confiscated the estates of the large landowners, set fire to houses of the beys, and provided support for the poor, infirm and orphans. Hoxha summed up Qamili's movement as being \\"against the feudal lords, pashas, beys and aghas, landowners and privileges in general.\\" Modern historiography has criticized this portrayal of Haxhi Qamili and his movement by works published under the communist regime, lambasting them as \\"Albanian historiography which tried to prove Hoxha's truths instead of searching for the truth\\". Disputing the communist line that the movement was egalitarian, progressive and \\"anti-feudal\\", Kolasi and Rrapaj maintain that the revolt was a \\"reactionary Muslim uprising\\" motivated by the \\"fear of peasants that their lands would be taken by the new government\\" (during the early period of Albanian independence, a controversial issue was land reform and redistribution to address the situation of disparity whereby Christians had much less land than Muslims due to legalized discrimination in the time of the Ottoman Empire). Kolasi and Rrapaj also note the desire of peasants for a return to Ottoman rule, the replacement of Albanian with Ottoman Turkish as the official language, and the raising of the Ottoman flag. Lulzim Hoxha meanwhile argues that the movement shows the \\"worship towards the central authorities as a patrimonial figure\\" and the perceived \\"necessity of a central paternal authority\\" under a \\"Sultanistic\\" political culture that he views as inherited from Ottoman rule but continued and sharpened under Enver Hoxha's communist regime noting that the movement used as a slogan \\"dum Baben\\" (we want our Father). He analyzes the slaughters of Christians involved as an attempt to \\"fill up the ideological place prepared and cultivated during the Ottoman dominion with humiliating acts for the Christians\\".

It is in a very close orbit with an O9.5 main sequence star. The two stars are deformed into ellipsoidal shapes and eclipse each other every 3.9 days. The total brightness change is only 0.15 magnitudes. The third component is a B0.5 main sequence star in a long eccentric orbit around the close pair. It is fainter and cooler than either of the two close stars, yet it is calculated to be more massive than δ Cir A, so it is suspected that it may also be a close binary system.

While still at school he began playing the trombone with the Merseysippi Jazz Band. Cricket Frank Parr played first-class cricket for Lancashire primarily as a wicketkeeper and a lower-order batsman, in his career of 49 matches spanning from 1951 to 1954. Herbert Strudwick said that he was \\"the most promising keeper I've seen in years\\", and in 1952 he was tipped to play for England. At the end of the following season he was almost selected for that winter's tour of the West Indies. His teammate Brian Statham described him as \\"an arty, untidy type who looked what he was, a spare-time musician\\". Lancashire's captain, Nigel Howard had been prepared to overlook Parr's scruffiness and laid-back approach, but for the 1954 season Cyril Washbrook succeeded him. A stricter disciplinarian than Howard, Washbrook insisted on tidier dress and better behaviour from his side, and dropped Parr after only five matches. Worcestershire offered Parr a job, but withdrew after Washbrook wrote to warn them against employing him, saying that he could be \\"a grave social risk\\". That marked the end of his cricket career. Parr himself said: \\"I thought it was the end of the world. It's probably why I took up serious drinking.\\" In his book Owning Up, George Melly, who performed with him in the Mick Mulligan Band, wrote that Parr's fellow band members never learned the reason for his quarrel with Washbrook, but that \\"after a month or two in his company we realised it must have been inevitable\\". He also wrote that Parr \\"was an extreme social rebel\\" who \\"concealed a formidable and well-read intelligence behind a stylised oafishness\\". Music Having played with the Merseysippi Jazz Band for six years, in 1956 Parr joined the Mick Mulligan Band as a full-time professional musician and moved to London. By the late 1950s he had become a fine trombonist, though Melly said that his music was \\"aimed beyond his technique. Sometimes a very beautiful idea came off, more often you were aware of a beautiful idea which existed in Frank's head.\\" The band's performances often suffered from the effects of alcohol, and Parr himself was often drunk. The band's style of revivalist \\"trad\\" jazz was becoming less popular by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 it disbanded, and Parr's career as a performer ended. He was Acker Bilk's manager for ten years, and subsequently worked in advertising. Later he had small parts in television shows and films, including The King's Speech (2010). He remained a cricket enthusiast, captaining a team of jazz musicians called The Ravers and attending Lancashire Players' Association functions at Old Trafford.

The company produces and markets its own products, apart of commercializing other licensed brands such as Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Bruynzeel. Products commercialised include acrylic paints, oil paints, watercolor paintings, brushes, markers, inks, pastels, pencils, pens, gouache, canvas, papers. In the past Talens has also produced fountain pen ink, typewriter ribbon, carbon paper and other office supplies.  History  The company was founded in 1899 by former banker Marten Talens, as \\"Talens & Co.\\", a Dutch factory that produced paint, varnish and ink. Whilst this initially involved only office supplies, in 1899 it started to produce Rembrandt oil colours as well. In 1904 the company name was changed to \\"Talens & Zoon\\", when son Hildebrand Talens became a partner in the business. Exports to the United States and Russia commenced in 1905. In 1912 a sales office opened up in the United States. The factory, too, expanded, and in 1920 it switched to steam power. A local ink factory was also taken over and the company put into operation its own tin factory. In 1927 a new head office was built. The building's architect was P.W. van den Belt, and it now enjoys the status of an industrial monument. As of 1932 the typewriter became increasingly popular in offices, and the mimeograph became all the rage. Talens started to supply carbon paper, typewriter ribbon, stencils and stencil ink. The brand Gluton, the glue in the famous pot-and-brush, became a household name. During World War II there was a shortage of raw materials, and the factory sustained a great deal of damage by a stray bomb. After the country’s liberation the factory started operations once more. In 1949 Talens received the designation 'Koninklijke' ('Royal') and changed its name to \\"Koninklijke Fabrieken Talens & Zoon\\" (Royal Works Talens & Son). The subsequent years were characterized by enormous growth for the company, and branches were set up in more than 50 countries. In 1963 Talens joined the Sikkens Group, which was eventually taken over by AkzoNobel. Royal Talens continued as a subsidiary within this group. In 1970 acrylic paints were launched, and since 1974 Royal Talens has been putting together an art collection. In the years that followed new brands were introduced, and in 1989 a modern new plant was opened. In 1991 Royal Talens became part of the Sakura Color Products Corporation, a privately owned firm based in Osaka. In 1996 a factory for easels and stretched canvases was set up in the Polish city of Lesko. In 1999 a new distribution hall was built in Apeldoorn. Several new brands and products have since been added to the range.  Brands  Royal Talens is as manufacturer active in the fine art segment with the following brands: * Talens (oil paint, acrylic paint, watercolor, gouache, brushes, indian ink, crayons, oil pastels, easels, papers, canvas) * Amsterdam (acrylic paint, markers, spray paint, accessories) * Bruynzeel (writing pencils, coloured pencils, felt tips) * Cobra (water mixable oil colour) * Rembrandt (oil paint, acrylic paint, pastels, water colour) * Sakura (gel pens, crayons, pencils, markers, drawing pads) * Schjerning (hobby paint, textile paint, glass paint) * Strathmore (sketchbooks, drawing paper) * Van Gogh (oil paint, acrylic paint, pastels, water colour) ReferencesExternal links * Art materials brands Retail companies of the Netherlands Dutch brands ","title":"Royal Talens"},{"id":"36034684","text":"Simon Francis Murphy (born 26 August 1973 in Balmain, Sydney) is an international award-winning, Dutch based, Australian conductor and viola player with a focus on the music of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Murphy is especially notable for his pioneering work in rediscovering and reintroducing forgotten 18th century, European, symphonic composers, particularly from and related to the Mannheim School (Mannheimer Schule). Resulting from his research, Murphy has also been responsible for unveiling the previously unknown Dutch 18th century symphonic tradition, presenting this to the world through performances, radio and TV broadcasts, and the first CD recordings of this symphonic heritage. In particular, he has championed 18th-century composers Joseph Schmitt \\"The Dutch Haydn\\" and Francesco Zappa, making first CD recordings and new editions of their symphonic works. Murphy has won major music industry awards, including the Dutch Edison Award and Luxembourg's Supersonic Award. His groundbreaking performance of Corelli's Concerti Grossi at the Utrecht Early Music Festival in 2003, recorded for CD by Pentatone, was chosen as one of the top 5 highlights of the festival's 30-year history. Murphy made his Amsterdam Het Concertgebouw and Brussels Le Palais des Beaux- Arts (BOZAR / Centre for Fine Arts) conducting débuts in 2004, and his débuts at the Handel Festival, Halle, in 2008 and Bachfest Leipzig in 2010.

International concert touring has taken Murphy through Europe, the US, Canada, Russia, Asia and Australia. His live concert performances have been broadcast by NTR, AVRO, RNW, EBU, DLF, MDR, RAI and ABC.

It was voted by Dutch national radio as one of the top 5 highlights in the 30-year history of the festival and was reviewed by the BBC Music Magazine as \\"the best of both worlds ... the NDA is a big band playing on period instruments\\".

The main block was built in 1890, and is a four-story, stone and brick building. An adjacent annex building was built in 1896. The annex is connected by an enclosed bridgeway at the second, third, and fourth levels. The main entrance features a sandstone archway. Note: This includes The National Transit Building is a jewel in the tapestry of the Oil City Downtown Commercial Historic District. Once the hub of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, it has been transformed by the Oil City Civic Center into artists’ studios. Architects of the building were Curtis and Archer of Fredonia, New York. The builder of the structure, Horace B. Robinson of Oil City, etched his initials into a window on the second floor of the building with his diamond ring. At a cost of $90,000.00, it was the first building in the nation with offices for companies specializing in the transportation of oil by pipeline. Located at Center and Seneca Streets, the red brick structure opened in 1890, followed six years later by the yellow brick Annex. The two structures were connected by an architectural “bridge” for a total of 25,880 square feet. The foundation of the building was constructed from cut stone taken from the Humboldt Refining Company near Plumer. The round corners of the original building were achieved by using curved bricks, with decorative bricks providing various patterns in other areas of the building. Between the main building and the Annex is the beautiful wrought iron, spiral fire escape. There was a great attention to details in the construction of The National Transit Building. The main entrance floors are marble. Wall paneling is solid oak. The banisters and newel posts are wrought iron with ornate brass and bronze appliques. American Civil War cannonballs were fashioned into doorknobs. Another impressive site is the water-powered elevator in the Annex. It is modeled after an elevator built in the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The elevator was operable until this type of elevator was banned by the state, although the intricate mechanism is still visible. In 1978 The National Transit Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. After several owner transitions, the building was purchased by Ralph Nader’s organization and later donated to the Oil City Civic Center. In 2005 a wrap-around lobby mural, printed on vinyl, was dedicated. At a cost of $33,000.00, the mural is based on historical research and focuses on the crude oil and natural gas exploration of this region. I recently spoke with a National Transit tenant involved in the development of the arts (with keys in hand – see photo) who provided the following information: It has an amazing history – at the turn of the last century, as the national headquarters for the oil industry under John D. Rockefeller and more recently, as the focus of a growing arts movement in Oil City. This magnificent historic building went through some hard times in the late 1980s and 1990s. At one point there were plans to tear it down and put up a CVS! Ralph Nader heard about it, bought the building and several years later turned it over to a non-profit corporation founded to manage it, the Oil City Civic Center. It has been restored chiefly through the efforts of volunteers. Today it is the hub of Oil City's arts revitalization and it offers work and teaching spaces for visual artists, musicians, dancers, two galleries and a performance space. The Oil City Civic Center, Inc. is charged with preserving the historic complex and to provide affordable space for nonprofit organizations. In 2016, the building hosted the inaugural Oil Valley Film Festival.

While working at IBM he was part of the initial team of ten programmers who created FORTRAN, and later suggested the use of electron beam lithography for the fabrication of X-ray Fresnel zone plates. The International Union of Crystallography awarded Sayre the Ewald Prize in 2008 for the \\"unique breadth of his contributions to crystallography, which range from seminal contributions to the solving of the phase problem to the complex physics of imaging generic objects by X-ray diffraction and microscopy(...)\\". Life and career Sayre was born in New York City. He completed his bachelor's degree in physics at Yale University at the age of 19. After working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, he earned his MS degree at Auburn University in 1948. In 1949, he moved to Oxford with his wife Anne Colquhoun, whom he had married in 1947. Sayre completed his doctoral studies in Dorothy Hodgkin's group in 1951. It is at this time that Sayre discovered the equation now named after him, based on the concept of atomicity. Although the key to most direct methods still in use today, Sayre did not share the 1985 chemistry Nobel prize awarded for their discovery. It is also around this time that Sayre, inspired by Claude Shannon's recent work, suggested in a short paper that the crystallographic phase problem could be solved more easily if one could measure intensities at a higher density than imposed by Bragg's law. This insight is widely seen as the initial spark that lead to recent lensless imaging techniques. Back in United States, David Sayre worked on structure determination of a carcinogen molecule in the lab of Peter Friedlander at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The structure determination program he wrote for the IBM 701 attracted the attention of John Backus, who hired him to be part of the initial team of 10 programmers that developed the high-level programming language FORTRAN at IBM for the IBM 704 mainframe. Sayre remained at IBM until his retirement in 1990. In the early 1970s, Sayre became interested in X-ray microscopy. He suggested to use the newly developed electron beam lithography apparatus at IBM to produce Fresnel zone plates, a type of X-ray lens now widely used in Synchrotron facilities. In the '80s, he came back to the goal of achieving lensless imaging, which he pursued the rest of his life.

On 11 March 1942, during World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and members of his family and staff left the Philippine island of Corregidor and his forces, which were surrounded by the Japanese. They traveled in PT boats through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships and reached Mindanao two days later. From there, MacArthur and his party flew to Australia in a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, ultimately arriving in Melbourne by train on 21 March. In Australia, he made his famous speech in which he declared, \\"I came through and I shall return\\". MacArthur was a well-known and experienced officer with a distinguished record in World War I, who had retired from the United States Army in 1937 and had become a defense advisor to the Philippine government. He was recalled to active duty with the United States Army in July 1941, a few months before the outbreak of the Pacific War between the United States and the Empire of Japan, to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), uniting the Philippine and United States Armies under one command. By March 1942, the Japanese invasion of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and his family moved to Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese. Fearing that Corregidor would soon fall, and MacArthur would be taken prisoner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to go to Australia. A submarine was made available, but MacArthur elected to break through the Japanese blockade in PT boats under the command of Lieutenant (junior grade) John D. Bulkeley. The staff MacArthur brought with him became known as the \\"Bataan Gang\\". They would become the nucleus of his General Headquarters (GHQ) Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA).  Background  Douglas MacArthur was a well-known and experienced officer. The son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur Jr., who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his services in the American Civil War, MacArthur graduated at the top of the United States Military Academy class of 1903. He was an aide-de-camp to his father from 1905 to 1906, and to President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1907. During World War I he commanded the 84th Brigade of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division in the fighting on the Western Front. After the war he served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and as Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He retired from the United States Army in 1937, and became a field marshal in the Philippine Army. MacArthur's job was to advise the Philippine government on defense matters, and prepare the Philippine defense forces when the Philippines became fully independent, which was to be in 1946. The Philippine Army, almost entirely manned and officered by Filipinos with only a small number of American advisors, was raised by conscription, with two classes of 20,000 men being trained each year, starting in 1937. In addition, there was a regular U.S. Army garrison of about 10,000, half of whom were Filipinos serving in the U.S. Army known as Philippine Scouts. When MacArthur was recalled from retirement in July 1941 to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) at the age of 61, he united the Philippine and United States Armies under one command. alt=A painting of a godlike General MacArthur in his peaked cap, staring into the rising sun. In getting the Philippine Army ready for war, MacArthur faced an enormous task. On a visit to the United States in 1937, MacArthur lobbied the Navy Department for the development of PT boats—small, fast boats armed with torpedoes—for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and many coves, was ideally suited. The nascent Philippine Navy acquired three, known as \\"Q\\" boats, after President Manuel L. Quezon. In August 1941, the U.S. Navy created Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, under the command of Lieutenant (junior grade) John D. Bulkeley. It was a half- strength squadron, with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It arrived at Manila in September 1941. It was understood that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines. As early as 1907, U.S. naval and military planners had concluded that it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippines should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force. Soon after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, MacArthur, in accordance with the pre-war plan, declared Manila an open city, and ordered his forces on Luzon to withdraw to Bataan. The Philippine government, the High Commissioner's office and MacArthur's USAFFE headquarters moved to Corregidor Island. Although the dependents of U.S. military personnel had been sent back to the United States, MacArthur was, until his recall from retirement, a Philippine government employee, so his family had remained in the Philippines. MacArthur's wife, Jean MacArthur, and young son, Arthur MacArthur IV, went with him to Corregidor. Arthur celebrated his fourth birthday on Corregidor, on 21 February 1942. When an aide asked about Arthur's possible fate, MacArthur replied: \\"He is a soldier's son.\\" Most of the United States Asiatic Fleet retired to the south of the Philippines. A small force was left behind under the command of Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell consisting of the submarine tender , the submarine rescue ship , gunboats , and , minesweepers , and , five tugboats, three small patrol boats, and the PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three. The loss of Manila and the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay meant that fuel and spare parts became scarce. The PT boats relied on Canopus and the floating dry dock for assistance with maintenance. Despite this, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three continued to patrol. On 17 December, , and rescued 296 survivors from SS Corregidor, which had been carrying refugees to Australia when it struck a mine and sank in Manila Bay. A week later, ran aground while patrolling south of Manila Bay, and was set on fire to prevent her being salvaged by the Japanese. met a similar fate a month later, after its engines failed and it drifted onto a reef. The PT boats attacked enemy barges off Luzon on the night of 23 January 1942, a small Japanese warship on 1 February, and a small vessel, probably a fishing trawler, on 17 February.  Decision = Washington  In a message to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D.C., on 11 February, MacArthur announced that he and his family intended to \\"share the fate of the garrison\\". This meant surrender at best; MacArthur knew that death from artillery fire or an air raid was also likely. Three days later, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, George C. Marshall, urged MacArthur to send his family away, but MacArthur ignored this part of the message. Singapore, once considered impregnable, fell on 15 February, and in Washington, the possibility that Corregidor would also fall and MacArthur would be taken prisoner was considered. MacArthur was America's most experienced general, but would be of little use in a prisoner of war camp. Moreover, he had become a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese. The brave but doomed defense of Bataan had captured the imagination of the American public, who saw MacArthur as the only Allied general who knew how to fight the Japanese. Walter R. Borneman noted that: The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, George C. Marshall (left) confers with the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, in January 1942 Secretary of State Cordell Hull raised the possibility of MacArthur's evacuation. Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower wrote in his diary: The President considered sending MacArthur to Mindanao to coordinate the defense of the Philippines from there, but another consideration arose. The fall of Singapore sealed the fate of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA), of which MacArthur's command was nominally a part. Discussions were held with the British about future command arrangements. A broad agreement was reached that the United States would assume responsibility for the Southwest Pacific. A senior American officer was required, and MacArthur was the obvious choice. On 23 February, MacArthur received a message that had been drafted by the President, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Marshall. It read:  Corregidor  MacArthur responded with a request that he might select the time of his departure. \\"Unless the right moment is chosen for this delicate operation\\", he wrote, \\"a sudden collapse might occur.\\" \\"With regard to the actual movement\\", he went on, \\"I deem it advisable to go to Mindanao by combined use of surface craft and submarine, and thence by air, further movement by submarine being too time consuming.\\" Marshall replied that the President would allow him to choose the time and method of his departure. ABDA was dissolved on 27 February, and MacArthur nominally came under Dutch command, but was ordered to continue communicating directly with the War Department. MacArthur inspected the PT boat squadron on 1 March. With air cover provided by his four remaining Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, MacArthur and his wife Jean took a half-hour ride on PT-41. Although the sea was tranquil, Jean still felt queasy. Ostensibly, the purpose of MacArthur's visit was presenting Bulkeley with the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking an \\"unidentified 5,000-ton enemy ship with torpedoes without serious damage to his ship or casualty to his crew\\", but afterwards MacArthur took Bulkeley aside and asked him if it would be possible to make the journey through uncharted waters at night in PT boats. Bulkeley told him that it would be \\"a piece of cake.\\" When some days passed without any further word on the matter, follow-up messages were sent on 6 and 9 March. By 10 March, MacArthur had decided that the Bataan front was not in danger of imminent collapse, and replied that he planned to depart on 15 March, when the submarine was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor. Radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur's headquarters in Corregidor, and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too. There were ominous signs: Japanese surface patrols had been stepped up in the Subic Bay area, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern Philippines. MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the Permit, but to leave as soon as possible, by PT boat on the night of 11 March. Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright was left in command on Bataan and Corregidor. \\"When I get back\\", MacArthur told him, \\"if you're still on Bataan, I'll make you a lieutenant general.\\" Wainwright replied: \\"I'll be on Bataan if I'm still alive.\\" Of the decision to depart by PT boat rather than wait for the submarine, Lieutenant Robert B. Kelly, executive officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, and commander of PT-34, later recalled:  Escape = Preparations  alt=A man in a dark suit and tie, with a white peaked cap. Hears wears the two gold stripes of a lieutenant on his sleeve, and ribbons including those of the Distinguished Service Cross and Silver Star. Bulkeley and his crews overhauled the PT boats for the voyage. All of the engines had performed hard war service, and had been operated for double the recommended mileage without overhaul. As a result, they were reduced to operating at half speed. Since there were no replacement parts, the gaskets, which normally would have been discarded, had to be carefully cleaned and replaced. Each PT boat would carry twenty 55-gallon drums of additional fuel on the deck. This reduced the top speed of the boats to about . To make room for the passengers, Bulkeley had to leave 32 of his men behind, who would be sent to fight as infantry on Bataan. MacArthur's chief of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland, drew up the passenger lists. Rockwell and his chief of staff, Captain Herbert J. Ray, were ordered to accompany MacArthur. They were already under orders to return by submarine, but this was switched to accompanying MacArthur when his date of departure was brought forward. A United States Army Air Corps officer, Brigadier General Harold H. George, was included at the request of the United States Army Air Forces. MacArthur was accompanied by his family: his wife Jean, four-year-old son Arthur, and Arthur's Cantonese amah, Ah Cheu. MacArthur later defended his decision to take her instead of an American nurse. \\"Few people outside the Orient\\", he wrote, \\"know how completely a member of the family an amah can become, and Ah Cheu had been with us since Arthur's birth. Because of her relationship to my family, her death would have been certain had she been left behind.\\" In case a doctor was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to accompany the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff, who were loyal and experienced; some had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines, where they would have been taken prisoner. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post. Because there was no food for the passengers on the PT boats, Jean and MacArthur's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, packed tins of food into four duffel bags, one for each boat. Huff removed the four-star rank number plates from MacArthur's car so they could be used in Australia, and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold. Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur's residence in the Manila Hotel had been loaded on board the PT boats, even, in one version of the story, the piano. In fact, each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing or less. Jean took a small suitcase with some clothes. It sported a label from the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama, where she stayed during her honeymoon. Ah Cheu wrapped her possessions in a handkerchief. MacArthur took nothing. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" + PT boats and passengers ! scope=\\"col\\"  Boat ! scope=\\"col\\"  Skipper ! scope=\\"col\\"  Other officers ! scope=\\"col\\"  Passengers - ! scope=\\"row\\"   Lieutenant (junior grade) Vince Schumacher  Ensign Cone Johnson  Brigadier General Spencer B.

Morhouse }  PT boat voyage  Only PT-41, which carried MacArthur and his family, departed from Corregidor's North Dock. The passengers of the remaining boats were taken to Bataan in launches and boarded their PT boats there. While his family boarded, MacArthur spoke to Major General George F. Moore, the commander of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. \\"George\\", he told him, \\"keep the flag flying. I'm coming back.\\" PT-41 departed at 19:45 on 11 March and joined the other three 15 minutes later. A navy minelayer led the PT boats through the protective minefield in single file. The boats then assumed a diamond formation, with PT-41 in the lead and PT-34 bringing up the rear. If attacked by the Japanese, PT-41 was to flee while the other three boats engaged the enemy. The seas were moderate, but most of the passengers quickly became seasick. MacArthur later recalled: alt=Three men at the con of a boat. One wears a white peaked cap and holds the wheel. During the night, the four boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time looking for the other three boats, but was unable to find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the alternative hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats. PT-32, which had only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what appeared to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it. He ordered his crew to man the .50-caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes. Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look through the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but PT-41, carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove. In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 made their way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a discussion about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at the rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well. Route of MacArthur's escape by PT boat (red) and B-17 (blue) At 19:00, about an hour after they had left Tagauayan, PT-34 and PT-41 spotted a Japanese cruiser. Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west, and headed at top speed, about , into the setting sun. Whether because of the high waves, the glare of the sun, or simple inattentiveness, the cruiser did not spot them. After midnight, the weather began to worsen, with heavy swells and sporadic squalls. Kelly later recalled: By dawn, the winds and swells had subsided, but the delay caused by the bad weather had slowed the two boats, and they now had to travel across the Mindanao Sea in daylight. Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06:30 on 13 March. Although PT-34 had led all the way from Tagauayan, Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead, as he had the channel charts. PT-41 therefore pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer on the staff of the Brigadier General William F. Sharp, the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley \\"I'm giving every officer and man here the Silver Star for gallantry. You've taken me out of the jaws of death, and I won't forget it.\\" A few hours later, PT-35 reached Cagayan. Willoughby later recalled: USS Permit, under the command of Lieutenant Wreford G. Chapple, reached Tagauayan on 13 March, and found PT-32. With two of his three engines out of action, Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer seaworthy. He had Chapple destroy the boat with Permit deck gun. Chapple then took the fifteen PT-32 crewmen back to Corregidor. There, eight of the crew were disembarked, while Chapple embarked forty more passengers, thirty-six of them codebreakers. Nonetheless, Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol, which he did. He finally reached Australia on 7 April. Unaware of this, Bulkeley attempted to locate PT-32. Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft, including a P-35 and a P-40, in the hope of finding it.  Aircraft  The commander of U.S. Army Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General George H. Brett, received a radiogram from General Marshall in Washington, D.C., alerting him that MacArthur would be requesting bombers to transport his party from Mindanao to Australia. A subsequent message from MacArthur requested his \\"most experienced pilots, and the best available planes in top condition\\", but the only long-range aircraft that Brett had were Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns. He therefore approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary, the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area, to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived Navy B-17s. Leary, who had a reputation for refusing requests unless he could see how the Navy would benefit, turned Brett down. alt=Three olive green four-engined propeller aircraft fly over the ocean. Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Two were forced to turn back with engine trouble. One of the others accidentally dumped of its fuel. The pilot flew on, and nearly made it to Del Monte Field, but, just a few miles from his destination, the fuel tanks ran dry and the engines stopped. The B-17 crash landed in the sea. Two of the crew were killed, but the rest made it to shore, and thence to Del Monte Field. Only one B-17, piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease, reached Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, with no brakes and a faulty supercharger. Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease made the return trip, carrying sixteen passengers. Thus, with the arrival of PT-35, all of MacArthur's group had reached Mindanao safely, but there were no aircraft at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked in the hope that the general would have some news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was disturbing to the party, as the Japanese were only away, at Davao on the south coast of Mindanao. MacArthur evacuation memorial at the site of the Del Monte Field, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon, Philippines Brett went back to Leary, expecting to be turned down again, but this time, Leary gave Brett the aircraft he wanted. \\"Perhaps\\", Brett speculated, \\"Leary had heard from Washington\\". The newly formed 40th Reconnaissance Squadron manned the bombers. One B-17 turned back, but two made it to Del Monte Field on 16 March, landing in the dark on a runway lit by flares. Lieutenant Frank P. Bostrom, the pilot of the first plane, calculated that everyone could be carried in just two planes if they left most of their baggage behind. They divided into two groups and the two bombers took off at 01:30 on 17 March. MacArthur rode in the radio operator's seat, which did not need to be manned as the aircraft were travelling under radio silence. For most of the passengers, the trip was dark and cold, with only a blanket between them and the metal skin of the aircraft. As the two planes approached Darwin, word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there. The two B-17s therefore flew on to Batchelor Airfield, where they touched down at 09:30. MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews of the two bombers. Brett's chief of staff, Brigadier General Ralph Royce, was on hand to greet them, and Brett had sent two Australian National Airways DC-3s to bring them to Melbourne. However, Jean now refused to fly any further, so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station, which was at Alice Springs, away. Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid, and asked Morhouse to intervene. Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur, who had suffered badly from seasickness and airsickness, was on an intravenous feed, and could not guarantee that he would survive the trip across the desert. MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft, which took off as the air raid siren sounded. At Alice Springs, the party split up. MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff took a special train that Brett had borrowed from the Australians, while the rest of the staff flew down to Melbourne via Adelaide in the DC-3s. His famous speech, in which he said, \\"I came through and I shall return\\", was first made at Terowie railway station in South Australia, on 20 March, where he changed trains. On 21 March, MacArthur's journey was completed when his train rolled into Melbourne's Spencer Street station, where he was greeted by the Australian Minister for the Army, Frank Forde.  Aftermath  Roosevelt issued a public statement on 17 March: On Bataan, the reaction to MacArthur's escape was mixed, with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed. When Wainwright broke the news to his generals \\"they were all at first depressed by the news… But I soon saw that they understood just as I understood.\\" Some people with family members in the Philippines were dismayed. One wrote to Roosevelt that \\"Nothing you could have done would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly\\". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To Joseph Goebbels, MacArthur was a \\"fleeing general\\", while Benito Mussolini labeled him a coward. Marshall decided that the best way to counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor. Bulkeley (right) receives the Medal of Honor from President FranklinD. Roosevelt (left). Admiral William D. Leahy looks on. In April 1942, Bulkeley led his squadron in an attack on the . The PT boats scored a hit on the cruiser, but the torpedo was a dud, and failed to explode. No damage resulted. With the loss of Cebu City, there were no more torpedoes, so the active careers of the remaining boats of Bulkeley's squadron came to an end. MacArthur gave PT boat officers a high priority to be flown out from Mindanao. Bulkeley was flown out on MacArthur's orders on 13 April. Knox, Kelly and Akers were evacuated on 23 April, and Brantingham also made one of the last flights out from Mindanao. Sharp surrendered on Mindanao on 10 May. MacArthur subsequently nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Ernest King was not going to let MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer, so he wrote a citation for Bulkeley on behalf of the Navy. Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley contributed to a book about his PT squadron's exploits, entitled They Were Expendable. Parts were serialized in Reader's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a movie of the same name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley, John Wayne one based on Kelly, and Donna Reed in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated. The staff that MacArthur brought with him from Corregidor formed the nucleus of General Headquarters (GHQ) Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). The \\"Bataan Gang\\", as they came to be called, remained with MacArthur for the duration, and were noted for their fanatical loyalty to him. So too was Bulkeley, who lauded MacArthur as \\"the greatest general as well as statesman since George Washington\\", and hailed his decision to escape on PT boats as a stroke of genius. MacArthur eventually kept his promise, and returned to the Philippines. The Bataan Gang returned to Corregidor in March 1945 on four PT boats.

Life  Richard (or Rycharde) Teale was a minstrel-retainer of the Earl of Derby about the middle of the 16th century. He was technically an itinerant vagabond, and (probably a skilful) beggar. He obtained most of his income \\"on the road\\". He was honest in so far as he preferred to pay his debts. He was married and, with the help of his wife, managed to save sixty pounds. Unfortunately in that he was stopped by highwaymen while crossing Dunsmore Heath (in Warwickshire and about 7 miles from Rugby) and his money stolen. He thought that he was safe carrying the money because of his reputation of his calling for poverty. He wrote a song to tell of this tale, and possibly collected many times more by collection from the audience’s sympathy. Before his performance he pronounced that \\"his patron has given him letters, friends everywhere have contributed, and he hopes present company will do the same\\". Sheale was like many other beggars of the time, in so far that his begging was better than his poetry, and much of the poetry or songs called on generous giving by the listeners. By now, the days of the court jester were ending, yet there were still a few men, such as Richard Sheale, who managed, to some extent, to fill the shoes of the previous courtly minstrel of the Middle Ages. Such were several \\"known\\" beggars who were generally decent beings, singing songs to educate. Some would join the several guilds of minstrels which gave, or claimed to give, those licensed by them protection from the law against vagabonds. But in the words of the poem \\"A Minstrel in the Stocks\\" (From one of the Roxburghe Ballads): Beggars they are with one consent, And Rogues by act of Parliament.

While in Australia, Patrizi played for Western Australia at Under-17 and Under-19 level between the 2002/03 and 2004/05 seasons. He also played for the Western Australia Second XI in the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons, though he was unable to force his way into the first eleven. In 2009, he played a single Second XI match in England for the Hampshire Second XI against the Somerset Second XI. Patrizi qualified to play for Italy due to his Italian heritage. His first appearance for Italy came against Ireland A in the 2010 European Cricket Championship Division One, in which Patrizi played five matches. He was then selected as part of Italy's squad for the 2010 World Cricket League Division Four, which was hosted by Italy. He made five appearances during the tournament, helping Italy earn promotion to the 2011 World Cricket League Division Three. Division Three was played in Hong Kong in January 2011, with Patrizi selected as part of Italy's thirteen man squad. He played in all six of Italy's matches in the tournament, scoring 158 runs at an average of 31.60, with a high score of 78. This was one of two half centuries he made in the tournament. Behind the stumps he took nine catches and made a single stumping. In July 2011, Patrizi played in the European T20 Championship in Jersey and Guernsey, which saw Italy end the tournament as runners-up to Denmark. This result qualified them to take part in the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates in March 2012. He was selected as part of Italy's fourteen man squad for the qualifier. He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Oman, with him making eight further appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Kenya. In his nine matches, he scored 34 runs at an average of 6.80, with a high score of 10 not out. Behind the stumps he took ten catches and made two stumpings. Italy finished the tournament in tenth place and therefore missed out on qualification for the 2012 World Twenty in Sri Lanka.

One of Los Angeles' foremost trial advocates, Albert introduced several practices – such as the use of dummies and other tools in reconstructing incidents – familiar in current legal practice but virtually non-existent when he began his career. He was a pioneer in the development and use of biomechanical devices and modeling in major personal injury cases to explain the mechanical properties of the musculoskeletal system in relation to the physics and dynamics of collisions with cars, trains, and human beings involved in accidents. He was the lead trial attorney in \\"bet the company\\" cases for the Union Pacific Railroad, the Santa Fe Railroad, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Swinerton Construction Co., and the Regents of the University of California. Some of his more dramatic trials are recounted in Tales of the Rails: Railroad Claims Stories by Norman Udewitz. Early Life and education Albert was born on April 19, 1923 in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his brother were later abandoned by their mother at an Oakland, California orphanage. Left under the name of Merrill Smith, he picked apples at the Salvation Army Home for Boys during the Great Depression. He was placed in several foster homes until being permanently settled with the Tucker family of Oakland. After graduating at the top of his class from Oakland Technical High School in 1940, he attended the University of California, Berkeley. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, when Albert joined the United States Merchant Marine discovering upon entrance that \\"Albert\\" rather than Smith was his birth name. After becoming the youngest officer ever to obtain a Master's License in the Merchant Marine, Albert stopped sailing and returned to his studies at UC Berkeley. There he was elected president of his fraternity, Sigma Nu, and would become a two-time captain of the varsity tennis team. He made the team's \\"All Star\\" list for 1949-1951.http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB;_OEM_ID=30100&ATCLID;=208195941 After completing his undergraduate degree, Albert was admitted to UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, where he was subsequently published as the reviewing editor of the California Law Review. He graduated in 1955, the sixth in his class. Legal career In the three decades following his graduation from law school, Merrill Albert practiced law in Los Angeles, specializing in defending large corporations against a wide range of high- exposure personal injury and other \\"bet the company\\" lawsuits. It was during this time that Albert began using incident reconstructions during trials in order to demonstrate whether or not the plaintiffs' claims were physically possible. He was also a pioneer in the early use of biomechanical accident reconstruction dummies at trial. He tried over 300 cases, winning the vast majority of them, many against the foremost plaintiff's trial attorneys of the era. His courtroom tactics were likened by many of his contemporaries to those of the fictional Perry Mason, which reportedly more than once took their inspiration from Albert's actual trials. Retirement and writing In 1990 Albert retired from the practice of law and devoted himself to the full-time enjoyment of opera, tennis, horse racing (he was a long-time member of the Santa Anita Park Turf Club), and various other pursuits. He also began writing, and his novel, The Big Casino, was published posthumously in 2003. The book has proved popular in Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. It was followed in 2011 by the collection The Year 2012 Ushers in the Age of Fire and Other Short Stories, a series of tales centering on a coming apocalypse and a Polynesian tribe's attempts to prepare for it. At the time of his death Albert was at work on two other books. Adolf Hitler is Alive! – which postulates an enclave of Nazis who had escaped from Berlin to set up a secret society in the Antarctica to plot their revenge – and the Trinity of Life, a philosophical speculation on tripartite confluences in history, politics, and religion throughout human history – will be published posthumously.

Asia’s modernity was first achieved by Japan and India. Japan's success was emulated by the four economic tigers: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. China followed soon after by launching its \\"Four Modernizations\\" program. China's success of the past three decades in turn inspired the rise of India. Asians are marching to modernity.  Overview  Kishore Mahbubani used the term in his book, The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East. March to Modernity indicates the first and most likely of the three possible scenarios of Asia's modernization in the globalization era. Mahbubani discusses how the rise of Asia will alter the world between the East and the West in the next fifty years. He argues that the modernizing Asia will be good for the whole world in ethical as well as political terms. The West (primarily America), a pioneer of the globalization and modernization, has triggered Asian modernization. The desire of Asian states is simply to follow, not to dominate West, which refers to rather the triumph of the West. However, many Western leaders made remarks defining the coming world of rising Asia as dangerous or challenging. (President Bush in 2006, French minister of foreign affairs Barnier in 2005, etc.) This conception is out-dated. The Asian March to Modernity represents a new opportunity both for the West and for the world.  Scenario 1: March to Modernity  Kishore Mahbubani’s main argument and first scenario is when the March to Modernity succeeds, the world would become more peaceful, stable and prosperous. Mahbubani’s first argument is that the March to Modernity will have a positive co-relational relationship in which modernization of material gains will cause Asia to experience a positive psychological boost. By gaining access to the modernization of the three basic human needs of shelter, water, and electricity, the poor of the Asian hemisphere will experience a boost in hope for a better life. Mahbubani uses the example of India’s recent liberalization and shows that in the past decade poor, rural Indians feel more hopeful due to the increase in modernization. The satisfied people will also as stated by Mahbubani have a greater sense of self-dignity. Taking South Korea for example, people feel more liberated and full of hope for the future because they have numerous choices and several possibilities to choose from. Second, entering the modern universe inevitably leads to a greater adherence to the rule of law. Mahbubani argues this point by explaining that through increase of material wealth a greater presence of law will occur, thus creating a sense of ownership and certainty. Through democratization, empowered humans will become responsible in setting world history in a positive direction due to the belief that they have the ability to control their destiny. Lastly, Mahbubani explains that the March to Modernity will also lead to a more ethical universe. Larger shares of the population will be lifted out of absolute poverty, followed by social benefits such as improvements in health and education and a decrease in crime rates. For instance, ideas of Western secular education that emphasizes economy and society are taught in China while the pages of socialism ideas are reduced. According to Mahbubani, the Chinese government spends more money and effort on child education with a heavy bias towards science and technology. However a decade ago, previous education focused on Chinese dynasties and communist revolution rather than globalization. Adopting free-market economy not only gave China progression in economic activity as well as liberated the minds of Chinese people. Mahbubani believes that the success of North America and the European Union was caused by the middle class who are reluctant to sacrifice their comfortable life due to warfare. When disputes between individuals and societies emerge, they would be settled on the basis of agreed rules and procedures, not by warfare. According to Larry Summers, “there can be no personal freedom without personal security”. Therefore, the March to Modernity creates a more secure world due to adherence to rules and order. Examples of Economic Prosperity in Asia • Modernization of China and India has succeeded in reducing the number of people in absolute poverty. • Spread of Cell phone users in India has changed Indian mindset on modern instruments. This “mobile miracle” empowered the less fortunate to fight poverty and to be connected to the global economy. Cell phones are now connecting the World’s poor to the global economy, which leads to higher productivity. Examples of Political Stability in Asia • China has actively responded to the call of the World Bank to become a \\"responsible stakeholder\\" in the international order (Sept. 2005). • Most Asian countries want to take responsible parts in the open multilateral international order.  Other Two Possible Scenarios = Scenario 2: The Retreat into Fortresses  In the second scenario, Mahbubani believes that the Western hemisphere, will become threatened by Asia's success. Thus, the West will engaged in rigid protectionism to halt Asia’s rising status. However, Mahbubani explains that Europe has engaged in protectionist techniques since the end of the Cold War. These strategies includes massive subsidies to the wealthy few in Europe and using tax payers’ dollars on unnecessary language translations. Although the European Union’s protectionist policies has not hindered the overall growth of the global economy, according to David Hale, a Wall Street journalist,“the greatest threat to this [global] boom is that the United States will lose confidence in the free market ideology\\". Protectionism is also happening in the investment sector of global politics. The United States has backed out of foreign investment due to the concern of national security issues. Paul Krugman, one of America’s leading economist acknowledges that free trade is not universally beneficial in that there will be some winners and some losers. However the World Bank, states that countries that engaged in free trade will actually see a rise in their economies as well due to the laws of comparative advantage.  Scenario 3: The Triumph of the West  The Triumph of the West is the last scenario presented by Mahbubani. The West, having positioned itself as a superpower after the Cold War, Westernization will increase thus causing all other nations to adopt Western values and become \\"cultural clones of the West\\". This argument was elaborated by Francis Fukuyama in his book \\"The End of History\\" arguing for the \\"end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government\\". Mahbubani contends that three fundamental flaws exists in this scenario. The first flaw is the belief that the West had triumphed over the Soviet Union because of its values and political system. Mahbubani illustrates it was the economic system that led to Western triumph, and the success of China and the failure of Soviet Union reveal the flaw of the argument. Deng Xiaoping focused on introducing free-market economics to China by correctly understanding the source of Western strength, while Gorbachev focused on glasnost (political openness) over perestroika (economic restructuring). In other words, Gorbachev's failure to realize the power of Western economic system led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The belief that \\"any society anywhere in the world at any state of social and economic development could be immediately transformed overnight into a liberal democracy\\" is the second flaw of the Western triumphalist thesis. The author points out that everywhere else apart from the East European countries, which shared common history and culture with Western Europe, democratization failed. He offers the example of the Balkans to argue that \\"without the right institutions and political culture, long-smoldering ethnic, religious, and nationalistic sentiments in many countries can be whipped up by opportunistic demagogues\\", leading to failure in transition to democracy. Although democratic elections were held in Croatia and Serbia, instead of liberal democrats, nationalist demagogues were elected. The leaders then appealed to visceral nationalist sentiments to retain their power, which led to war. Unprepared democratization can also lead to internal ethnic conflicts, as illustrated by the ethnic cleansing of Croats in parts of the former Yugoslavia, the attacks on the Chinese minority in Indonesia, and the Tutsi slaughter in Rwanda. Lastly, disregarding cultural differences by believing that the model of Western liberal democratic society is universally applicable to all societies is another flaw in the triumphant post-Cold War thesis. Mahbubani claims that cultures are different and failing to see this shows generosity but also arrogance of the West. The author asserts that there is nothing superior about the Western values, rather, other dormant cultures simply underwent revival of cultural confidence and dynamism when the West was experiencing one of its most triumphant moments. Based on the flaws, Kishore Mahbubani argues that this scenario is least likely to happen in the future.  Reasons For Asia's Rise  In his book, The New Asian Hemisphere, Kishore Mahbubani explains seven pillars of Western wisdom that have contributed to Asia's march to modernity: # Free-market economics # Science and technology # Meritocracy # Pragmatism # Culture of peace # Rule of law # Education  Cases of Asia's Modernity  Kishore Mahbubani suggests two significant cases of Asia's modernity; China and India. * China According to 'The China Modernization Report', China measures its modernization level with two assessment criteria; first stage, \\"industrialization and urbanization\\" and second stage, a \\"knowledge-driven and information-driven\\" society. The 2007 China Modernization Report predicts that by 2015, China will have reached modernization \\"to the level of developed nations in 1960\\". *India The mobile phone revolution in India shows how \\"just one modern instrument\\" impacts modernization. It is not just the spread of mobile phones but the spread of communication and information.

William Bates (27 February 1825 - 12 January 1891) was a politician in colonial Victoria, Australia. Bates was born at Uxbridge, in Middlesex, and emigrated to South Australia in 1850. In 1852 the gold discoveries tempted him to Victoria, where he went into business at Sandhurst, and after four years' successful trading, removed to Melbourne, where he had a prosperous career as a general merchant. In 1868 he was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the electoral district of Collingwood as a supporter of the Darling Grant, defeating no less a candidate than the Hon. James Service. He was Minister of Public Works in the M'Culloch Government from April 1870 to June 1871, but did not re-enter Parliament after 1874, though he contested for the districts of Fitzroy (1877) and Collingwood again (1880). Mr. Bates was a prominent member of the Congregationalist body, and was Treasurer of the Jubilee Fund which was raised a few years ago to celebrate the jubilee of the establishment of the first church of the denomination in Victoria. That movement was so successful that close upon £48,000 was raised, and the denomination was able to pay off the debts on all its churches in the colony. Mr. Bates died at Fitzroy, Melbourne, on 12 January 1891, at the age of sixty-five. He married Anne Cramer Williams in Melbourne in 1857, and they had 2 sons and 5 daughters.

Owned by the museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan, the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930, and brought to Detroit. It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time,The Wedding Dance, The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569). The painting depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides wore black and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted throughout the entire art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times. Background Pieter Bruegel the Elder completed The Wedding Dance in 1566. It was believed to have been lost for many years, until discovered at a sale in London in 1930 by William R. Valentiner, the director of the Museum Detroit Institute of Arts at the time. Valentiner paid $35,075 for The Wedding Dance through a city appropriation. It is still owned by the museum. The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) are also by Bruegel which share the same wedding theme and elements and were painted in the same period in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat. Robert L. Bonn, an author, described these trilogy of works as \\"superb examples\\" of anthropological paintings, and states that \\"in three genre paintings Bruegel stands in marked contrast both to painters of his day and many others who followed.\\" Thomas Craven summarises The Wedding Dance as \\"One of several celebrations of the joys of gluttony painted by Brueghel with bursting vitality\\". Walter S. Gibson also views the paintings as a \\"sermon condemning gluttony\\" and \\"an allegory of the Church abandoned by Christ.\\" Description and themes Lower right-hand detail The popular painting shows a group of 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in an apparently chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees. The brides wore black as it was the Renaissance period and the men wore codpieces, which were an important part of their clothing at the time. Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the work. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period and there are many peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat. The movements of the people show that their behaviour is inappropriate or a caricature of rustic buffoonery, but its representation of fertility and reproduction is presented in a joyful manner. Indeed, the painting reflects a degree of ambiguity in that it can both be seen as an attack on the stereotypical oversexed behaviour of the lower orders as well as evoking a comical picture. In the sixteenth century, when this was painted, dance was subject to a strict code and regarded by the authorities and church as a social evil. People could not swing their arms or legs or laugh too loud, as that would be considered a type of rudeness to many people. The painting therefore \\"expresses the peasants' liberation from the stricter limits of upper classes\\" by failing to adhere to the expected social standards of the times. The author of The Theme of Music in Northern Renaissance Banquet Scenes, Robert Quist, has said that the painting was part of a series of Seven Deadly Sins and Virtues and that the paintings \\"attest to [Bruegel's] moral devotions\\". He says \\"While dancing may appear innocuous or natural for peasants, it poses a palpable threat to the human soul. Its [dancing] usefulness in characterizing the peasantry as wild and unruly undoubtedly derives from the moral opprobrium in which dancing was held by religious and civil authoriries alike.

Zinc finger protein transcription factors can be encoded by genes small enough to fit a number of such genes into a single vector, allowing the medical intervention and control of expression of multiple genes and the initiation of an elaborate cascade of events. In this respect, it is also possible to target a sequence that is common to multiple (usually functionally related) genes in order to control the transcription of all these genes with a single transcription factor. Also, it is possible to target a family of related genes by targeting and modulating the expression of the endogenous transcription factor(s) that control(s) them. They also have the advantage that the targeted sequence need not be symmetrical unlike with most other DNA-binding motifs based on natural transcription factors that bind as dimers. Applications By targeting the ZF-TF toward a specific DNA sequence and attaching the necessary effector domain, it is possible to downregulate or upregulate the expression of the gene(s) in question while using the same DNA-binding domain. The expression of a gene can also be downregulated by blocking elongation by RNA polymerase (without the need for an effector domain) in the coding region or alternatively, RNA itself can also be targeted. Besides the obvious development of tools for the research of gene function, engineered ZF-TFs have therapeutic potential including correction of abnormal gene expression profiles (e.g., erbB-2 overexpression in human adenocarcinomas) and anti- retrovirals (e.g. HIV-1).

He calls himself a peintre-alpiniste (climber-painter) because he uses rope access techniques such as rappelling to create large outdoor murals. Early work After studies in the decorative arts and a short period working as an illustrator in a graphics design studio, Gracia began his career as a painter working for Club Med as a decorator-scenographer.Jacques Daimé, \\"Frédéric Garcia: la peinture sur un fil\\" , Chantier de France 387, February 2006 (pdf at Damtrix) In 1986, while travelling in Asia, he painted a fluorescent backdrop for a concert by Chick Corea in Hong Kong. In 1990, he worked for Paquet Cruises aboard the Mermoz, providing scenery for the night-time entertainment. Large trompe-l'œil works As a child, he was equally fascinated by mountain climbing; looking for a painter able to work at great heights, Jean-Marie Pierret hired him in 1991 to paint Aquarius, a giant mural on one of the four cooling towers of the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant in Ardèche, France. He did so with the assistance of eight mountain guides. This led to more commissions. For example, in 1995 he worked with Catherine Feff and the Bouygues company on the inside of the dome of a mosque in Turkmanistan; for this job, scaffolding was used. In 2007, directing a team of rappelling painters via walkie-talkie over two months, he decorated the two 52-metre chimneys of the thermo-electric plant at Bagnolet, in the suburbs of Paris, with murals of drops of water 1.1-metres in diameter.\\"La métamorphose des cheminées de Bagnolet\\", Le Parisien, 25 September 2007 Владислав Карелин, \\"Художники расписывают французскую энергетику\\", Membrana.ru 9 July 2008, retrieved 10 June 2012 In 2009, his services were suggested as an alternative to an as yet incomplete computer-controlled large-scale printer for the projected decoration of all the dams in Valais, Switzerland, with murals 700 metres wide and 250 metres high.Zian Marro with Karim Trabelsi and Philippe Lahaye, \\"Dessine-moi un barrage\\", Nuovo, RTS, 17 December 2009 (with video) . However, he prefers to work alone, using rope access techniques. He compares the work to spelunking, since the movement is downwards, not upwards as in climbing. On commission from various settlements, he has painted water towers http://www.sade- cgth.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/04_nos_realisations/pdf/FlashSADE_48_GenieCivil.pdf for example with his brother Pascal at Treffiagat,\\"Art.

The awards aim to seek out, recognize and nurture great talent in Australian writing. They draw national and international attention to some of our best writers and to Queensland’s recognition of outstanding Australian literature and publishing. These Awards have a focus on supporting new writing through the Emerging Queensland Writer — Manuscript Award and Unpublished Indigenous writer - David Unaipon Award. \\"They give local writers and new writers something to aspire to.\\" \\"Literary Awards: Early own-goal from Premier Newman\\" History The Queensland Literary Awards was established by a not-for-profit association of passionate Queensland volunteers and advocates for literature, in response to Queensland Premier Campbell Newman disestablishing the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards in 2012.\\"New premier tears up literary awards\\" , 3 April 2012, The Sydney Morning Herald In 2012 and 2013 the program was run by a volunteer workforce.

It is located approximately northwest of Adelaide River and is situated on Stapleton Creek.  Nomenclature  Stapleton Creek was named by surveyor Gilbert McMinn in 1870 to honour James L Stapleton, a field operator working on the Overland Telegraph who would later be killed in an incident that led to the 1874 Barrow Creek Massacre. The locality takes its name from the creek.NT Place Names Register Stapleton Creek  History  The Awarai Aboriginal people are the traditional owners and original inhabitants of the Stapleton area. The first European exploration of the area occurred with the survey party of 1869 led by George Goyder. In 1873, Mr W Barlow, director of the Virginia Prospecting Company discovered a quartz reef and established a mining claim in the area. A hotel known as the \\"Our House Hotel\\" was opened by Edward D Matthews next to Stapleton Creek in 1874. The end of the same year, applications had been received for a growing number of mining leases in the area, lodged by both the Virginia company and a number of private prospectors.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article3143418?searchTerm=Stapleton+Creek Virginia&searchLimits;= A siding and station was constructed and opened with the North Australia Railway to Pine Creek in 1889 to support the mining industry and growing population. Prior to the line, the settlement had been served by the Haimes Royal Mail coach between Southport on its way to the goldfields near Pine Creek. A cemetery was in use between 1874 and 1902 and is today commemorated by a plaque erected by the NT government with the names of those interred according to the records of the NT genealogical society. http://members.iinet.net.au/~genient/photographs_Plaques_nt_cemeteries.html By the 1920s, mining activity had declined and agriculture was becoming the dominant industry in the area. To support the operation of Vestey's Meatworks in Darwin the railway station was expanded with additional sidings as well as stock yards and cattle loading facilities between 1914 and 1917,http://www.atr.org.au/specials/nt_all_aboardnov06.pdf a sign of the changing local economy and stronger emphasis on pastoralism. Small scale cotton crops were grown with some success during this period.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article64186298?searchTerm=Stapleton+Creek&searchLimits;=l-decade=192 During World War II, the railway sidings were further expanded and the station became an unloading point for meat and fresh food supplies for troops camped in the area. In 1966, a site where Stapleton Creek crosses the Stuart Highway, east of the settlement (by this stage little more than a railway siding) was considered for the construction of a flood mitigation and irrigation dam. Despite a geological survey and investigation being conducted by the Commonwealth Government, the dam was not constructed.  Present Day  Little trace remains of the former hotel and railway station today. The area is mostly a rural locality with a number of agricultural properties and a few dwellings close to the creek. A plaque marks the site of the one time cemetery. The unsealed roads through the area are used by locals as an alternative route between Batchelor and Adelaide River.

Etymology Tripoli is the third U.S. Navy ship named for the Battle of Derne in 1805. It was the decisive victory of a mercenary army led by a detachment of United States Marines and soldiers against the forces of Tripoli during the First Barbary War. It was the first recorded land battle of the United States fought overseas. Fallujah, after the Second Battle of Fallujah, was suggested as a name but was ultimately not chosen. Design The design of Tripoli is based on , which is itself an improved version of the . Approximately 45% of the Flight 0 design is based on LHD-8, with the well deck removed to allow more room for aircraft and aviation fuel. The removal of the well deck for landing craft allows for an extended hangar deck with two significantly wider high bay areas, each fitted with an overhead crane for aircraft maintenance. Other enhancements include a reconfigurable command and control complex, an on-board hospital, and numerous aviation support spaces. The design of Tripoli features an enlarged hangar deck, realignment and expansion of the aviation maintenance facilities, and a significant increase in her available stowage for parts and support equipment. She was intended to be the first LHA replacement ship to deliver fully ready to integrate the entire future air combat element of the U.S. Marine Corps to include the F-35B Lightning II, but construction delays have pushed final F-35 capability installs until delivery. History Tripoli was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding (Huntington Ingalls Industries) at the company's shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Fabrication of ship components began in July 2013, and the ship's keel was laid in a ceremony on 20 June 2014 in Pascagoula. Tripoli was christened on 16 September 2017, with Lynne Mabus (wife of former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus) as her sponsor. By 2019, Tripoli was about a year behind production schedules. The ship was delivered to the Navy on 28 February 2020 in preparation for commissioning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, on 17 April 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Navy officials had stated that at least 9 sailors assigned to the ship had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At the time, the ship was docked in Pascagoula. About 630 sailors were moved off the ship as a preventative measure, which resulted in the outbreak spreading to only \\"around a couple dozen sailors\\". As a result of the pandemic, the ship's public commissioning ceremony originally planned to occur at NAS Pensacola in June was also cancelled.

The film was written and directed by Guy Lee Thys. It stars Cem Akkanat and Simon Van Buyten. Synopsis Ibrahim is a 27-year-old Muslim born in Belgium. He lives in a multicultural residential area with his parents. He is integrated in western society. That's why he prefers to be called Bram, a frequently used Belgian masculine name. Although his father was born in the Netherlands and his mother in Belgium, the family still sticks to many Turkish traditions. Furkan, Bram's brother, frequently skips class. When he's confronted by his brother, Furkan blackmails him because he knows Bram frequently visits the gay nightlife. If Bram does not inform their parents about the skipping, Furkan will also hold his tongue. There are also rumors about Bram's sexual orientation in the Turkish pub. Bram's father refutes the gossips as his son is going to visit Turkey to meet his niece, Elif. Both parents have planned an arranged marriage. In the meantime, Bram met Kevin, a 19-year-old Belgian boy who helps his mother in a bistro. Kevin's mother is almost sure her son is gay. She is also convinced Bram is attracted to Kevin. Bram visits the bistro quite often and can't keep his eyes off Kevin. That's why she encourages them to spend the evening together, but they merely become good friends. When Bram is about to leave for Turkey, he also buys a ticket for Kevin to join him. In Turkey, Kevin doesn't hide his feelings any more and the two start a secret love affair. This is, however, noticed by one of the hotel clerks. The clerk is also in love with Elif, but is rejected since Elif knows she's going to move to Belgium. The hotel clerk is jealous and takes photos when Bram and Kevin are making love. Bram meets Elif and prepares all the paperwork to get her a Belgian visa. The hotel clerk gives the photos to Elif. Although she is shocked, she decides to go to Belgium as she only hopes for a better life. After a week, Bram and Kevin fly back to Belgium. Bram thinks Elif should stay in Turkey as women are more emancipated there than the Turkish women in Belgium. Meanwhile, Furkan has become a member of an Islamic fundamentalist religious group. They want to introduce Sharia in Belgium and want shopkeepers only to sell halal. Furthermore, they take as many photos as possible of all kinds of police interventions in order to try to convince the Muslim population that the police are against them. Furkan's father is upset, as some members of the group have connections with Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. The rejected hotel clerk sends the photos to Belgium. Bram admits he is gay and in love with Kevin. He is not willing to marry Elif because both of them will be unhappy. Bram is then disowned by his family. But the word is spreading and soon the whole family is being shunned by the Muslim community. Furkan wants his family's honor to be restored and he dreams of an honour killing in which he murders Kevin by cutting his throat. His action is approved by the fundamentalist group. Just before entering the bistro, Furkan is stabbed by a youth gang because he once beat up one of its members. However, Bram quickly intervenes and saves Furkan's life. Bram is reunited with his family in the hospital and Kevin walks away unharmed. The fate of their relationship remains uncertain at the end.

The book was first published in 1985 by Day's own publishing company, Green Tiger Press. Good Dog, Carl has been followed by a whole series of popular Carl books, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Day was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Meanwhile, Day began a career in illustration, and illustrated her first book in 1983: The Teddy Bears' Picnic, based on a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. Day and her husband live in Seattle, Washington. Carl Books According to Day, the inspiration for Good Dog, Carl came from a trip to Zurich, Switzerland. Day was looking through antique picture sheets for her postcards when she found an image of a dog left to guard a baby. Day's own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character, and since then other family Rottweilers have been models for the books.

Plot introduction Hounded introduces the character of Atticus O'Sullivan and his world, a secret history where magic, vampires, werewolves, gods, and other supernatural elements exist (albeit in hiding). O'Sullivan, the last Druid and proprietor of Third Eye Books and Herbs occult shop, comes into contact with many of the supernatural characters of his home city of Tempe, Arizona. He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer. And for Hounded (book one), this particular sword sets off a series of godly events. The novel blends elements of mythology and urban fantasy.

Author of this review tends to agree with that, but their presence alone is not enough to save Decoy from well-deserved road to \\"straight-to- video\\" oblivion. Everything else is a complete mess - the plot is incoherent, the action scenes look terrible, so in the end Decoy sinks below the standards, which are lowest, even for B movies.

A Democrat, he served as a U.S. Senator from North Carolina from 1954 to 1974. A native of Morganton, he liked to call himself a \\"country lawyer\\", and often told humorous stories in his Southern drawl. During his Senate career, Ervin was a legal defender of the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation, as the South's constitutional expert during the congressional debates on civil rights.Campbell (2007) Unexpectedly, he became a liberal hero for his support of civil liberties. He is remembered for his work in the investigation committees that brought down Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954 and especially for his investigation of the Watergate scandal in 1972 that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. Early life Ervin was born in Morganton, North Carolina, the son of Laura Theresa (Powe) and Samuel James Ervin. He served in the US Army in combat in France during World War I with the First Division at Cantigny and Soissons, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. He graduated from the University of North Carolina, where he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, in 1917 and from Harvard Law School in 1922. Ervin was fond of joking that he was the only student ever to go through Harvard Law \\"backwards\\", because he took the third-year courses first, then the second- year courses, and finally the first-year courses. Already admitted to the bar in 1919, before completing law school (later calling himself \\"a simple country lawyer\\"), Ervin entered politics straight out of Harvard.Sam Ervin, during the Watergate hearings Even before he had received his degree, Democrats in Burke County, North Carolina had nominated him in absentia for the North Carolina House of Representatives, to which he was elected in 1922, 1924, and 1930. In 1927, in his role as attorney for Burke County, NC, Ervin served as the legal advisor to the local sheriff during the hunt for Broadus Miller, a black man believed to have murdered a teenaged white girl. The county officials invoked the outlaw provision of the North Carolina constitution which permitted any citizen to kill a declared outlaw without formal charges being brought. Miller was shot down while being pursued and his body displayed in the local courthouse square. Ervin was also elected and served as a state judge in the late 1930s and early 1940s. U.S. Senate career Ervin was serving as an associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court when he was appointed in June 1954 by Governor William B. Umstead to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Clyde Hoey, who had died in office. He ran successfully for the seat in November 1954. Ervin made a deep impact on American history through his work on two separate committees at the beginning and ending of his career that were critical in bringing down two powerful opponents: Senator Joe McCarthy in 1954 and President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. In 1954, then-Vice President Richard Nixon appointed Ervin to a committee formed to investigate whether McCarthy should be censured by the Senate. The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices, which investigated Watergate, was popularly known as the \\"Ervin Committee\\". In 1956, Senator Ervin helped organize resistance to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision calling for desegregation of schools by drafting The Southern Manifesto; this influential document encouraged defiance of desegregation and was signed by all but a few of the Southern members of Congress.Kyle Longley, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.: Tennessee Maverick (Louisiana State University Press, 2004), p. 123. (In his autobiography, Preserving the Constitution, Ervin said he later changed his mind on the Brown decision, stating that the decision, to the extent it eliminated mandatory segregation, was correct, but that forced integration, required under later decisions, was improper.) Defenders of Ervin argue that his opposition to most civil rights legislation was based on his commitment to the preservation of the Constitution in its pristine formulation, and a general belief that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution only applied to white men. He repeatedly stated the Constitution encapsulated civil, human and equal rights for all those he considered worthy. There is little if any evidence that he engaged in the racial demagoguery of many of his Southern colleagues. Some historians consider Ervin's position to be one of \\"cognitive dissonance\\" because he opposed federal legislation to combat race-based discrimination, but did not do so in harsh terms. While he once maintained that Americans were entitled to \\"their prejudices as well as their allergies\\", Warren's defendants claim he did not seem to be motivated by prejudice himself, but more by his suspicion of federal power. Ervin said he disliked what the Warren Court \\"has done to the Constitution\\". On March 30, 1965, Ervin announced that he would offer a substitute to the Johnson administration's voting rights bill. Ervin referred to the administration's bill as cockeyed and unconstitutional and that his version would provide for federal registers being appointed in areas certified to having finds of racial discrimination as defined under the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Ervin said he would seek approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee and that he would carry the fight to the Senate floor in the event that the committee rejected his legislation. Ervin was also a staunch opponent of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which abolished nationality quotas beginning in 1968. He felt that the principle of tying allowed numbers of immigrants from a given country to the number of people who had ancestral origins in that country and lived in the United States should be retained. Meanwhile, Ervin's strict construction of the Constitution also made him a liberal hero for his support of civil liberties, his opposition to \\"no knock\\" search laws, and the growing intrusions of data banks and lie-detector tests as invasions of privacy. In 1966, Senator Ervin played a major role in the defeat of Senator Everett Dirksen's Constitutional amendment to allow prayer in public schools. Ervin also favored the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment, which made illegally seized evidence inadmissible in criminal trials. In November 1970, Ervin was one of three Senators (all from Southern states, the others being James Eastland and Strom Thurmond), to vote against an occupational safety bill that would establish a federal supervision to oversee working conditions. When the Senate voted on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1971, Ervin proposed an amendment that would exempt women from the draft; Ervin's amendment to the ERA overwhelmingly failed. However, he was a staunch opponent of the ERA and after it passed the Senate Ervin used his influence to dissuade the North Carolina General Assembly from ratifying it, maintaining that it was the \\"height of folly to command legislative bodies to ignore sex in making laws\\".Ervin Jr., Sam J. \\"The Question Of Ratification Of The Equal Rights Amendment CON.\\" Congressional Digest 56.6/7 (1977): 171. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Retrieved: 2010-08-3. He became involved in Senate investigations before Watergate, when in January 1970 it was revealed by Christopher Pyle, an investigator for Ervin's Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, that the U.S. Army was performing domestic investigations on the civilian population. Ervin's further work into the matter over the following years, together with the Church Committee inquiries, led to passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (after Ervin had left office). Sam Ervin (right), as chair of the Senate Watergate Committee Ervin gained lasting fame through his stewardship of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices, also known as the Senate Watergate Committee, from the 1972 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield chose Ervin because it was unlikely Ervin was going to run for re-election in 1974 (and in fact did not), had no aspirations beyond his office, had deep knowledge of the law and the Constitution, and because he was considered to be an even-keeled, conservative, independent-minded Democrat. President Nixon thought at first that Ervin might potentially be supportive, but that turned out to not be the case. Following the 1972 elections, Ervin proposed five bills to limit the power of the presidency. Two restricted the President's ability to use funds for reasons other than their appropriated purpose, one allowed more congressional oversight of appointed officials, one banned the President from pocket vetoing legislation when Congress was not in session, and the final bill required the President to inform Congress of any executive agreements made with foreign governments. Later life Ervin resigned in December 1974, just before his term ended. After retirement, Ervin practiced law, wrote several books, and appeared in various commercials for products. As a lawyer, he served as a co-counsel with Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice PLLC on several high-profile cases, including a successful appeal in Joyner v. Duncan. Karl E. Campbell, Senator Sam Ervin, Last of the Founding Fathers (2007) In 1973, Ervin was recorded on CBS Records on the LP record, Senator Sam at Home, which featured tracks of Ervin speaking his mind and telling anecdotes, separated by tracks of him singing popular songs. One of those songs, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" was released as a single, and subsequently appeared on the 1991 compilation album Golden Throats 2. Ervin was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, where he was elevated to the 33rd and highest degree of Master Mason. Sam Ervin died in 1985 at a hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, from complications of emphysema. He was 88 years old. Legacy Entrance to Ervin Library at Western Piedmont Community College in Morganton Ervin's Senate desk A glimpse of Ervin's restored office Ervin's son, Samuel J. Ervin, III, was appointed in 1980 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit by President Jimmy Carter. His grandson, Sam J. Ervin, IV, was elected in 2008 to the North Carolina Court of AppealsNC Utilities Commission: Commissioner Ervin and in 2014 to the North Carolina Supreme Court. Another grandson, Robert C. Ervin, was elected in 2002 as a North Carolina Superior Court Judge for District 25A. Ervin's office and personal library has been preserved as the \\"Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. Library and Museum\\", which is housed in the Phifer Learning Resource Center at Western Piedmont Community College in his hometown of Morganton Privacy activism In a 1964 essay called \\"The Naked Society\\", Vance Packard criticized advertisers' unfettered use of private information to create marketing schemes. He compared a recent Great Society initiative by then-president Lyndon B. Johnson, the National Data Bank, to the use of information by advertisers and argued for increased data privacy measures to ensure that information did not find its way into the wrong hands. The essay inspired Ervin to fight Johnson's flagrant disregard for consumer privacy. He criticized Johnson's domestic agenda as invasive and saw the unfiltered database of consumers' information as a sign of presidential abuse of power. Ervin warned that \\"The computer never forgets\\". Accolades * 1972: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association * 1981: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement Quotations In an interview on William F. Buckley's Firing Line program, Ervin suggested that people in public life need to have more \\"backbone\\", and Buckley playfully suggested Gordon Liddy as a model to which Ervin responded, \\"Well, Gordon Liddy has a little too much backbone. I'll have to admit that I have a sort of sneaking admiration for a fellow like Gordon Liddy that does have an excess of backbone. His backbone exceeds his intelligence, really.\\" Ervin was a staunch opponent of the polygraph calling the tests \\"20th century witchcraft\\": > Probably no instrument in modern time so lends itself to threats to > constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so- > called lie detector.

From a family of Persian origin, he was described as one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages. His biographical dictionary Bughyat al-wuʻāh fī ṭabaqāt al-lughawīyīn wa-al-nuḥāh contains valuable accounts of prominent figures in the early development of Arabic philology. He was appointed to a chair in the mosque of Baybars in Cairo in 1486, and was an authority of the Shafii school of thought (madhhab).  Biography  Al-Suyuti was born on 3 October 1445 AD (1 Rajab 849 AH) in Cairo, Egypt. He hailed from a Persian family on his paternal side. His mother was Circassian. According to al-Suyuti his ancestors came from al-Khudayriyya in Baghdad. His family moved to Asyut in Mamluk Egypt, hence the nisba \\"Al- Suyuti\\". His father taught Shafi'i law at the Mosque and Khanqah of Shaykhu in Cairo, but died when al-Suyuti was 5 or 6 years old. Al-Suyuti's studies included: Shafi'i and Hanafi jurisprudence (fiqh), traditions (hadith), exegesis (tafsir), theology, history, rhetoric, philosophy, philology, arithmetic, timekeeping (miqat) and medicine. He started teaching Shafi'i jurisprudence at the age of 18, at the same mosque as his father did. In 1486, Sultan Qaitbay appointed him shaykh at the Khanqah of Baybars II, a Sufi lodge. He was a Sufi of the Shadhili order. Al-Suyuti was named the mujaddid of the 9th century AH and he claimed to be a mujtahid (an authority on source interpretation who gives legal statements on jurisprudence, hadith studies, and Arabic language). This caused friction with scholars and ruling officials, and after a quarrel over the finances of the Sufi lodge, he retreated to the island of Rawda in 1501. Al-Suyuti died on 18 October 1505.  Works  The Dalil makhtutat al-Suyuti (\\"Directory of al-Suyuti's manuscripts\\") states that al-Suyuti wrote works on over 700 subjects, while a 1995 survey, put the figure between 500 and 981. However, these include short pamphlets, and legal opinions. He wrote his first book, Sharh Al-Isti'aadha wal-Basmalah in 866 AH, at the age of seventeen. Ibn al-ʿImād writes: \\"Most of his works become world famous in his lifetime.\\" Renowned as a prolific writer, his student Dawudi said: \\"I was with the Shaykh Suyuti once, and he wrote three volumes on that day. He could dictate annotations on ĥadīth, and answer my objections at the same time. In his time he was the foremost scholar of the ĥadīth and associated sciences, of the narrators including the uncommon ones, the hadith matn (text), isnad (chain of narrators), the derivation of hadith rulings. He has himself told me, that he had memorized One Hundred Thousand hadith.\\"Al- Kawākib as-Sāyirah 1/228 In Ḥusn al-muḥaḍarah al-Suyuti lists 283 of his works on subjects from religion to medicine. As with Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi in his medicinal works, he writes almost exclusively on prophetic medicine, rather than the Islamic-Greek synthesis of medicinal tradition found in the works of Al-Dhahabi. He focuses on diet and natural remedies for serious ailments such as rabies and smallpox, and for simple conditions such as headaches and nosebleeds, and mentions the cosmology behind the principles of medical ethics.Emilie Savage-Smith, \\"Medicine.\\" Taken from Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Volume 3: Technology, Alchemy and Life Sciences, pg. 928.

Plot A collection of three macabre tales, presented by an agoraphobic middle-aged man, named Philip, who lives in a seedy section of Los Angeles. As he sorts through his piles of yellowed newspaper clippings, he relates his paranoid nightmares through three stories. \\"The People You Meet\\" is based on a couple, Joe and Amy, who are on their second honeymoon, when they are forced off the road by a speeding sportscar. They get a lift from an odd local who is not what he seems. They pick up another hiker, who just happens to be a friend of the local, and they kidnap Joe and Amy and take them to an abandoned cabin. It concludes with the man and woman both turning on one another, as they had set each other up. \\"The Clinic\\" finds a workaholic traveling salesman, Crenshaw, who after stopping for gas late one night in a nowhere town is attacked by a vicious dog. He finds sanctuary in a private clinic where he is treated by the young Dr. Roberts and a beautiful nurse. Very strange things seem to be happening in this clinic. Blood on the walls, bone chilling screams, patients dancing in the hall. Crenshaw is told that the hallucinations are caused by a rare form of rabies however it turns out that inmates have taken over the clinic, which is an asylum. \\"Stolen Moments\\" shows a shy and pretty Cindy Craig who has trouble meeting men, living her life in an apartment with a plethora of pets. One evening she goes to a bar and is picked up by two men, they go back to an abandoned house and have sex, but then she murders them and resumes her life as the 'quiet' woman she is.

It was produced by Canadian studio Filmline International (in conjunction with The Movie Network), with American studio Paramount Pictures later acquiring distribution rights. Filming occurred in Montreal, Quebec and Léry, Quebec.Twists of Terror credits. Filmline International, 1997. The cast consisted of local actors from Quebec and other parts of Canada, aside from the first segment, which features American actress Jennifer Rubin, who had notably appeared in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors ten years prior in 1987. Release Twists of Terror premiered on The Movie Network in its native Canada on July 2, 1997. Later in 1997, the film was released on video in Germany and Australia (where it received an R18+ rating for an explicit sex scene in the third segment), and then in the UK and Japan in April 1998. It made its television premiere in the US, October 17, 1998, on Showtime. It would continue to be aired heavily during the early 2000s, on both The Movie Network and Showtime. After getting released on VHS by Paramount in the US, a DVD was released in Canada on November 26, 2003. Reception Twists of Terror is included in the 2000 book Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide, with author John Stanley writing \\"This loosely knit trilogy of horror stories, lifting its narrative styles from Tales from the Crypt and Amazing Stories, captures a surreal quality usually missing from this type of anthology. Scriptwriter John Shirley sets his stories in a dark world where innocence and guilt are turned topsy-turvy, where sex and retribution are the standards of the night. The only connecting link is a storyteller called simply \\"The Host,\\" but he's an odd duck, having none of the cackling charm of the Cryptkeeper. No, this creepy yarnmeister is in dire need of a shave, haircut, and bath as he wanders through the upper story of a run- down mansion surrounded by old newspapers with screaming headlines that recount the tales he spins.\\" Allmovie gave the film two out of five stars and claim it \\"offers up three spooky stories.\\" Reelfilm gave the film two and a half out of four stars, and wrote \\"What really kills Twists of Terror is the painfully dull second story, which just seems to go on and on for far too long. And by the time the twist comes, it's really hard to care. The third tale isn't bad, but after that second one, all of my interest had vanished and was replaced by growing irritation. Mancuso was good, though, as was Rubin (she was also in the dreadful Little Witches - it's really a shame that she's getting typecast as a horror chick).\\" Canuxploitation.com wrote an unfavorable review, stating \\"As with much of his work, Jackson manages to put a nice professional sheen on Twists of Terror, but like so many Canadian direct-to- video timewasters, the film falls victim to its lack of resources--from an underdeveloped script to unconvincing actors and a wretched synthesizer score. The films trio of terrible tales may not be as flagrantly stupid as those in Freakshow, but they also fail to live up to the promise of The Uncanny, which managed to integrate an interesting wraparound vignette with its well-thought- out (if not always successful) stories. Too uninteresting and sanitized to recommend to the horror fans that might be interested in it, Twists of Terror is a triple disappointment.\\" Apollo Guide gave a rating of 31/100. Emanuel Levy awarded the film three out of five stars. The book DVD & Video Guide 2005 (Ballantine Books) gave the film two and a half out of five stars.

He was also active in Aliyah Bet (illegal immigration organization) that organized the immigration of Holocaust survivors to Israel. He help set up of State of Israel’s Customs and Excise Department, served as Deputy Minister of Commerce and Industry, as a special assistant to Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek for the development of culture, the economy and tourism in the city, and directed the Jerusalem International Book Fair. Among those who nurtured Israeli cinema, he was a founder of Sam Spiegel Film & Television School.  Biography  Zev Birger was born in Kovno (Kaunas), Lithuania, to Feiga Tzippora née Kaplan and Pinchas Birger. Feiga and Pinchas Birger had a solidly Zionist worldview and a strong belief in the need to establish a national home for the Jewish people in the Land of Israel, and passed these views on to their children. When Zev was ten, World War II began but it had only a marginal effect on Lithuania until September 1940, when Lithuania was annexed to the Soviet Union. When the Soviets invaded, the activities of Zionist organizations were banned. At first, many people, including Zev’s parents, thought the Soviets would be better than the Germans, but the Soviets immediately began to confiscate property and persecute the Lithuanian bourgeoisie, including many Jews. In mid-June 1941, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, and it took only one week for all of Lithuania to fall into their hands. In July, they began to gather all of the Jews into a ghetto in Slobodka, a suburb of Kovno. Like many other Jews, the Birger family left almost all of their possessions behind, and moved into a small room in the ghetto. Periodically, there was an “aktion” or round-up in which groups of Jews were chosen randomly and sent to be executed. At the beginning of the war, in 1940, Zev Birger was among the founders of the Sons of Zion Organization that undertook the Zionist education of Jewish teens and struggled to preserve Hebrew culture and language, which had been outlawed by the Soviet authorities. The movement published a journal, Nitzotz (“Spark”). Birger was partner in publication of the hand-written journal that was distributed in the Lithuanian underground, in the ghetto and even in the camps, where five issues were circulated, handwritten by the editor Shlomo Frankel, prior to liberation. The Sons of Zion also built bunkers where food and water were stockpiled. On July 8, 1944, it was decided to evacuate all residents of the ghetto. Zev and his family tried to avoid evacuation by hiding in a bunker. For five days they succeeded, but on July 13, the Germans found them. Together with another 300 Jews who had remained in the ghetto, they were marched to the railroad station. On the way, there a selection, and Feiga Birger, Zev's mother, was sent to the left with the elderly and sick. That was the last time he saw her. Zev, his brother Mordecai and his father were loaded onto a freight train headed for Germany. Zev later said that he and his brother had several opportunities to jump from the car but they did not want to leave their father. The Birgers were taken to Stutthof, and transferred to Dachau only a few days later. From there, they were taken to Kaufering IV, where they were forced to work in an underground German munitions factory that produced airplanes. Within a short time Zev remained alone, after his father died in his arms, of a serious infection, and his brother was sent to another work camp, where he died. Zev was transferred to Kaufering V and then to Kaufering VII, which were even worse. Throughout it all, be repeated to himself: “You will survive. This will be our revenge.” On April 27, 1945, the camp was liberated by American soldiers and Zev was transferred to the hospital in Bad Woerishofen. His physical condition was very poor, but the doctors were able to save his life and heal his abscess- covered body. The Americans identified his abilities, and Zev became their translator. They equipped him with a US army uniform and attached him to the unit. Although the unit's commander implored him to return with his soldiers to the United States and receive US citizenship, Zev was convinced that his place was in Israel, as part of the effort to build a state for the Jewish people, so that similar events would not occur again in the future. Zev parted from his American saviors, and went to Frankfurt where he joined the illegal immigration operation that brought Holocaust survivors to the Land of Israel. There, he met Trudi née Simon, and they married in July 1946. On November 20, 1947, the young couple disembarked on the coast of Haifa, together with Trudi's mother. At the beginning of the War of Independence, Zev was drafted to the nascent Israeli army. After his discharge, the Birgers lived in Haifa and Zev was a founder of the Customs and Excise Department, and helped shape the young State's tax system. In the 1960s, Birger was given responsibility for moving the Customs Office to Jerusalem, and also moved, with his family, to the capital. In 1967, Birger joined the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry as Deputy Minister and charged with reorganizing the ministry. He divided it into professional divisions, based on the ministry's areas of responsibility, and established the Light Industries Division. He identified the relative advantage of Israel's human capital for culture and creativity, and therefore set new goals for promoting publishing, design and electronic (later, hi- tech). In this position, did much to promote Israeli cinema, establishing the Israel Film Center and helping to found Sam Spiegel Film and Television School in Jerusalem. After his retirement from the civil service in 1977, Zev Birger managed the Paris office of world's largest arts management firm, ICM. In 1980, Birger helped his wife Trudi Birger establish a free dental clinic for poor children in Jerusalem - Dental Volunteers for Israel, which continues to provide care for thousands of at-risk children and youth every year, thanks to volunteer dentists from around the world. Trudi and Zev's sons Doron, Oded and Gili Birger serve on DVI's Board of Directors today. In 1982, Teddy Kollek, then mayor of Jerusalem, asked Birger to help develop industry and tourism in Jerusalem. He considered this an opportunity to make Jerusalem into an international meeting place, a venue for cultural dialogue that would pave the way for tolerance and peace. As a result of this perspective, the Jerusalem International Book Fair, which Birger managed, became one of the most important international book fairs in the world, a prestigious and respected institution where authors, editors and publishers from around the world meet. Birger manager the book fair until his last day. In 1999, William Morrow published an English version of Zev Birger's memoir, No Time for Patience: My Road from Kaunas to Jerusalem. The book was translated into several languages and published in six countries. In 2000, the Jerusalem Municipality honored Zev Birger as a Yakir Yerushalayim (“Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem”) in recognition of the many years he worked to promote culture, the economy and tourism in Jerusalem. He was also honored by the governments of Germany and Lithuania. In his eulogy, the British author Ian McEwan, who was awarded the prestigious Jerusalem Prize in 2011, said: “He saw how low humanity could sink, and then he rose and gave so much. He was an indestructible spirit and an example to all mankind. Not only Jerusalem or Israel but the whole world that loves culture and friendship will feel this loss keenly.” Similarly, the Japanese author Haruki Murakami, who was awarded the prestigious prize in 2009, wrote: “I heard the tragic news of Zev’s death. I was so surprised and shocked. I have a beautiful memory of him, and am missing him truly.” President Shimon Peres also eulogized Birger and wrote: \\"Only someone like Zev could have brought authors with international reputations to Jerusalem and make it into a literary capital.”  Death  In July 2011, he died after being hospitalized in coma for ten days, as result of a head injury sustained in a traffic accident in Jerusalem. He is survived by the three sons, Doron, Oded and Gil, and eleven grandchildren.

Torums Scarf Michael (aka Mick or Mike) (29 May 1996 – 3 October 2011) in Liverpool, England, was a Kerry Blue Terrier who is best known for being the 2000 Best in Show winner at Crufts, and 2003 Best in Show of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He is the first dog to win the \\"Triple Crown\\" of dog shows, having also won the 2002 AKC/Eukanuba National Invitational Championship. Early life Mick was born on 29 May 1996, to Ch. Dasumianco Quietner and sired by Ch. Arranshire Pioneer. His breeder was Ron Ramsay. Show history Torums Scarf Michael was entered into the 2000 Crufts dog show at the Birmingham NEC in the UK, as one of over 20,000 dogs competing. He was named Best in Show, while the English Cocker Spaniel Sh Ch. Wiljana Waterfall won reserve place. Mick and his owner were presented with the Crufts Best in Show trophy by Prince Michael of Kent and the Chairman of the Kennel Club, Peter James. It was the final Crufts competition prior to the relaxation of UK border controls, which would allow animals to more easily cross borders with the British Government's Pet passport scheme. Following his victory at Crufts, his owner thought he would retire Mick from show competition as he did not think he could have a more successful year than the one the dog had in 2000. Mick had won five Best in Show titles, and two Reserve Best in Shows, and was ranked as the top Terrier in the UK. However, instead of retiring him, breeder and owner Ron Ramsay sold Mick overseas to send the dog to America. He was purchased by Marilu Hansen, of Newton, New Jersey. America and Westminster Torums Scarf Michael won the 2002 AKC/Eukanuba National Invitational Championship, winning a $50,000 prize. He was entered in the 2001 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and after winning the breed group, he went on to take the Terrier group. However, he did not win the title of Best in Show, the Bichon Frise Ch. Special Times Just Right taking the title instead. At the Westminster Kennel Club Show in 2002, Mick managed to win the Terrier Group once again and reached the Best in Show round as the favourite. He was one of only two returning group winners from the previous year, the other being the Schnauzer Ch. Charisma Jailhouse Rock. However, his composure broke during the round and the crowd inside Madison Square Garden distracted him sufficiently that despite being ranked the number one dog in the United States at the time, the Miniature Poodle Ch. Surrey Spice Girl was named the winner. The New York Times described the upset as \\"not quite of New England Patriots proportion but not far from it\\". The handler of Surrey Spice Girl, Kaz Hosaka, said of Mick, \\"I thought he'd win, I'm surprised.\\" In 2003, Mick competed in the Westminster show once more alongside 2,602 other dogs. At the time of his entry he was once more the favourite to win, having won 116 championship ribbons since moving from Britain to the United States. After winning his breed group once more, he won the Terrier Group for the third time in succession, qualifying once more for the Best in Show round. Irene Biven judged the final round, in front of over 10,000 spectators. Lining up with Mick was the German Shepherd Ch. Kismets Sight for Sore Eyes, the Standard Poodle Ch. Ale Kai Mikimoto On Fifth, the Pekingese Ch. Yakee Leaving Me BreathlessAtFranshaw, the Newfoundland Ch. Darbydale's All Rise Pouchcove, the Brittany Ch. Magic Sir-ly You Jest and the Ibizan Hound Ch. Luxor's Playmate of the Year. Mick was named the Best in Show, causing his handler, Bill McFadden, to burst into tears as Biven pointed towards the pair. His victory sealed his \\"Triple Crown\\", becoming the first dog to be Best in Show at Crufts, Westminster and the AKC National Championship. Legacy Mick was credited with raising the profile of the Kerry Blue Terrier in the United States due to his victory at Westminster. He was called the \\"most influential Kerry Blue alive\\" in 2008 by The New York Times. Sixty one of his children have gone on to qualify as show champions, and his sperm has been frozen for artificial insemination in the future.

Olson argues that the number of interests groups within a society has a sclerotic effect on economic growth . It seeks to explain economic growth and performance of societies across different countries by focusing on the role of institutions - specifically interest groups. This concept formulation builds up on Olson's previous work, the Logic of Collective Action (1965). It sets focus on the problem of Collective Action, where individuals are driven by social incentives to join collectives in concern of the provision of goods and services. Nevertheless, there are others, who are reluctant to contribute, whilst still benefiting from the input .. The Logic thus results in individuals creating and joining smaller interest groups with the goal to prevent the Free-rider problem, as larger groups are more likely to suffer from this phenomenon . The turnout and consequence of this logic will reveal an increase of number of interest groups. This might create a situation of political stability, however Olson argues that these groups are limited to a certain set of interest and activity that will have a static effect on the development of society . Hence, this will create a situation of distributional coalition and rent-seeking behaviour, which will eventually hinder the advancement of technology, accumulation of capital and growth . Additionally, groups will want to remain significantly small in size, to prevent problems of Collective Action. This means there will be little room and possibility for influence from the outside to adapt to changes and innovation . In general, he notes that societies with a higher number of interest groups are \\"expected to be less flexible and less innovative\\". This in turn will result in a sclerotic effect on growth . The conceptualisation of institutional sclerosis has sparked an array of debate among scholars in reference to economic growth. Diverse research has covered a variety of topics, but many have agreed to the fact that Olson will always be most closely connected to interest group formation and their macroeconomic consequences. A recent study on institutional volatility has shown that institutional sclerosis remains to be a concept of relevance in present research on understanding economic growth . It argues that it will be relevant for a country to be in a phase of institutional sclerosis to undergo institutional volatility .  History  The idea of institutional sclerosis was first applied by Olson to provide an explanation for the divergence in growth rates of post World War II winners and losers. This can be connected in more specifically understanding the rise and decline of nations. During these times, countries like Germany and Japan suffered great loses especially in terms of their economy. However, not many years later the economies in both Germany and Japan were described as economic miracles. In looking at these two cases Olson derived that politically weak nations such as Germany and Japan had the ability to enjoy prosperity through rapid growth, whereas a country like Great Britain was struggling with increase of growth. In his research on economic growth he therefore empirically demonstrated that economic growth can be measured through the advancement of technology, accumulation of knowledge and capital .. Thus, institutional sclerosis offers a description to understand the measures that hinder economic growth.  Implication  Societies or individual institutions that fail to adapt and change at a sufficient pace are sometimes described as displaying institutional sclerosis. It is associated with continuity and stability, and may hamper economic growth. The concept implies that economic growth can be measured and linked to the number of interest groups within a country . This means that politically stable economies allow room for more interest groups. However, at the same time the high number of interest groups has a negative effect on the growth rate, as the country is less likely to adapt to structural shifts . National level The American political economist Mancur Olson, in his 1984 book, \\"The Rise and Decline of Nations\\", first offered \\"institutional sclerosis\\" as a partial explanation for the divergent growth rates experienced between the winners (with relatively low post-war growth rates) and losers (with relatively high post-war growth rates) of World War II. In liberal democracies experiencing continuity and stability, interest groups form over time and grow to exact rents, becoming vested. The accumulation of vested interests and rent-seekers ultimately slows the ability of a government to reform, adapt, and secure perfectly competitive markets thanks to a related phenomenon studied by Olson: the collective action problem. This sclerosis saps an economy's dynamism and lowers growth rates. In liberal democracies with young institutions, by contrast, competition remains perfect and natural economic dynamism and creative destruction ensue, generating high growth.Mancur Olson. \\"The Rise and Decline of Nations\\" (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984). Institutional level Institutional sclerosis may also be applied to an institution that is effective in changing in some areas but unable to adjust to changes in other areas. Institutions can evolve efficiently either by expanding original goals to meet a changing environment or by including more members. At the same time, however, institutions or organizations face difficulties adjusting to new structures or internal policies.

It is part of the Berlin State Museums. From the Alte Nationalgalerie, which was built for it and opened in 1876, its exhibition space has expanded to include five other locations. The museums are part of the Berlin State Museums, owned by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.

From the start it was bound up with the ambitions of Prussia and the wish for Berlin to become a capital of world renown.Hildegard Vieregg, Vorgeschichte der Museumspädagogik: Dargestellt an der Museumsentwicklung in den Städten Berlin, Dresden, München und Hamburg bis zum Beginn der Weimarer Republik, Museen, Geschichte und Gegenwart 2, Münster: Lit, [1991], , p. 42 . The decision was finally taken in 1861, after the death of the banker and art patron Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener, who bequeathed his extensive collection (262 artworks) to the then Prince Regent, the future King William I, in the hope of catalysing the formation of a gallery of \\"more recent\\" art.Peter Gay, The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud Volume 5 Pleasure Wars, New York/London: Norton, 1998, , p. 184.Vieregger, p. 25.Emil Kueschke, \\"Die Nationalgalerie in Berlin\\", Unsere Zeit NF XIII.2 (1877) 241-66, p. 242 : \\"zu einer nationalen Galerie heranzuwachsen, welche die neuere Malerei auch in ihrer weitern Entwickelung darstellt\\". The collection was initially known as the Wagenersche und Nationalgalerie (Wagener and National Gallery) and was housed in the buildings of the Prussian Academy of Arts.Kueschke, p. 243. Friedrich August Stüler began working on a design for a gallery building in 1863, based on a sketch by William I's father, King Frederick William IV of Prussia.Keisch, p. 7. Two years and two failed plans later, his third proposal was finally accepted. Stüler died before planning was completed and Carl Busse handled the remaining details in 1865. In 1866, by order of the king and his cabinet, the Kommission für den Bau der Nationalgalerie (Commission for the construction of the national gallery) was created.Bernhard Maaz, ed. Die Alte Nationalgalerie: Geschichte, Bau und Umbau, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin: G + H, 2001, , p. 226 Ground was broken in 1867 under the supervision of Heinrich Strack. In 1872 the structure was completed and interior work began. The opening took place on March 22, 1876 in the presence of William I, who was by then German Emperor.Kueschke, p. 241. The building, today the Alte Nationalgalerie, resembles a Greco-Roman temple (a form chosen for its symbolism that, it has been pointed out, is not well suited to displaying art)James J. Sheehan, \\"Aesthetic Theory and Architectural Practice: Schinkel's Museum in Berlin\\", in David Wetzel, ed., From the Berlin Museum to the Berlin Wall: Essays on the Cultural and Political History of Modern Germany, Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1996, , pp. 11-30, p. 26. and is stylistically a combination of late Classicism and early Neo-Renaissance. It was intended to express \\"the unity of art, nation, and history\\", and therefore has aspects reminiscent of a church (with an apse) and a theatre (a grand staircase leading to the entry) as well as a temple. An equestrian statue of Frederick William IV tops the stairs, and the inside stairs have a frieze by Otto Geyer depicting German history from prehistoric times to the 19th century. The inscription over the door reads \\"To German art, 1871\\" (the year of the founding of the Empire, not the year the gallery was completed).Keisch, p. 9.Frank B. Tipton, A History of Modern Germany Since 1815, Berkeley: University of California, 2003, , pp. 132-33. On his first visit to Berlin, in November 1916, the young Adolf Hitler sent a postcard of this building to a comrade in arms to congratulate him on receiving the Iron Cross.Thomas Friedrich, tr. Stewart Spencer, Hitler's Berlin: Abused City, New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2012, , p. 6. Until 1933 The first director of the National Gallery was Max Jordan, who was appointed in 1874, before the building was completed. When the building opened, in addition to Wagener's collection, it contained over 70 cartoons for friezes on mythological and religious subjects by Peter von Cornelius; high-ceilinged galleries were designed to accommodate them. Wagener's collection was not limited to German art; in particular, it included Belgian artists who were popular at the time; and under Jordan the gallery's holdings rapidly came to include an unusually large collection of sculpture and a drawings department. However, Jordan was hampered throughout his tenure by the Regional Art Commission, which was made up of representatives of the academic art establishment and resisted all attempts to acquire modernist art.Eberhard Roters, \\"The Birth Pangs of Modernism\\", in Berlin/New York: Like and Unlike: Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the Present, ed. Josef Paul Kleihues and Christina Rathgeber, New York: Rizzoli, 1993, , pp. 180-93, p. 187. In 1896, he was succeeded as director by Hugo von Tschudi, formerly assistant head of the Berlin museums under Wilhelm von Bode. Although he had previously had no association with modern art, he was fired with enthusiasm for Impressionism on a visit to Paris where he was introduced to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, and became determined to acquire a representative collection of Impressionist art for the National Gallery. When the commission vetoed his requests, he secured the patronage of a large number of wealthy bourgeois art collectors, most of them Jewish.Roters, p. 188. He also rearranged the exhibition spaces, putting many items in storage to make room for works by Manet, Monet, Degas and Rodin as well as the earlier Constable and Courbet. One of the first, soon after Tschudi took up the post, was Manet's In the Conservatory; in 1897, the Berlin National Gallery became the first museum in the world to acquire a painting by Cézanne.Emily D. Bilski, Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918, Exhibition catalogue, Berkeley: University of California / New York: Jewish Museum, 1999, , p. 3. This moved the gallery decisively away from emphasis on Prussia and the rest of the German Empire. In response to complaints from the academic connoisseurs, William II decreed in 1899 that all acquisitions for the National Gallery must have his personal authorisation; Tschudi initially complied and rehung the old works, but the imperial decree proved unenforceable, prompting the Kaiser to build public monuments to his power instead. In 1901, at the inauguration of the memorials on the Siegesallee, he gave a speech denouncing \\"gutter art\\" which became known as the Rinnsteinrede (gutter speech).John C. G. Röhl, Wilhelm II Volume 2 Der Aufbau der persönlichen Monarchie, 1888-1900, Munich: Beck, 2001, , pp. 1022, 1025 : \\"Das kann sie nur, wenn die Kunst die Hand dazu bietet, wenn sie erhebt, statt daß sie in den Rinnstein niedersteigt!\\"John C. G. Röhl, tr. Sheila de Bellaigue, Wilhelm II: The Kaiser's Personal Monarchy, 1888-1900, New York: Cambridge University, 2004, , p. 922: \\"That situation can only be brought about if Art lends her hand to the task, if she elevates instead of sinking into the gutter.\\" Crown Prince's Palace, which became the National Gallery's annexe for modern art in 1919 Tschudi also had a great appreciation for the German Romantics, many of whose paintings were included in Wagener's original bequest.\\"Magere Schultern\\", Der Spiegel, 9 September 1968 Keisch, p. 31. An exhibition of 100 years of German art at the National Gallery in 1906 contributed to reawakening interest in artists such as Caspar David Friedrich. This was also an interest shared by Tschudi's successor, Ludwig Justi, who was director from 1909 to 1933 and added to the gallery's holdings in early 19th- century German painting. In 1919, after the abolition of the Prussian monarchy, the gallery acquired the Crown Prince's Palace (Kronprinzenpalais) and used it to display the modern art. This became known as the Neue Abteilung (New Department) or National Gallery II, and met the demand by contemporary artists for a Gallery of Living Artists.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Art treasures of the Berlin State Museums, New York: Abrams, 1965, , p. 65.Françoise Forster-Hahn, Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings from the Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Exhibition catalogue, National Gallery, London, National Gallery of Art, Washington, London: National Gallery, 2001, , p. 55.Brian Ladd, The Companion Guide to Berlin, Woodbridge, Suffolk/Rochester, New York: Companion Guides/Boydell & Brewer, 2004, , p. 32. It opened with works by the Berlin Secessionists, the Impressionists and the Expressionists.Joan Weinstein, The End of Expressionism: Art and the November Revolution in Germany, 1918-19, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1990, , p. 85. This was the first state promotion of Expressionist works, which were unpopular with large numbers of the public,Elizabeth M. Grady, \\"The Popular Opposition: Politicizing Modern Art in the National Gallery in Berlin, 1918-1933\\", in Julie F. Codell, ed., The Political Economy of Art: Making the Nation of Culture, Cranbury, New Jersey: Fairleigh Dickinson University/Associated University Presses, 2008, , p. 96. but the collection was, in the judgement of Justi's assistant Alfred Hentzen, superior to that of all other German galleries then collecting modern art.Stephanie Barron, Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany, Exhibition catalogue, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, New York: Abrams, 1991, , p. 116. By far the largest share of artworks in the 1937 exhibition of 'Degenerate Art' under the Nazis were taken from this collection.Tessa Friederike Rosebrock, Kurt Martin und das Musée des Beaux- Arts de Strasbourg: Museums- und Ausstellungspolitik im 'Dritten Reich' und in der unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit, Ars et scientia 2, Berlin: Akademie, 2012, , p. 74 Under the Third Reich Justi was one of 27 art gallery and museum heads forced out by the Nazis in 1933 under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, to be succeeded for a few months by Alois Schardt\\"Schardt, Alois Jakob, 1889-1955\\", Archives Directory for the History of Collecting in America, Frick Collection, retrieved 25 August 2012. and then by Eberhard Hanfstaengl, who was in turn dismissed in 1937;Jonathan Petropoulos, The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany, New York: Oxford University, 2000, , p. 16. he had refused to meet with the commission under Adolf Ziegler, president of the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts, who were charged with purging the gallery of \\"degenerate\\" works. Some artwork from a dealer had been burnt in the furnaces of the National Gallery building in 1936,Petropoulos, p. 25. and the modern art annexe in the Crown Prince's Palace was shut down in 1937 as a \\"hotbed of cultural Bolshevism\\".Keisch, p. 11.\\"Magere Schultern\\", Der Spiegel: \\"Brutstätte des Kulturbolschewismus\\". The gallery was placed under the control of the Berlin State Museums and Hanfstaengl was after a while replaced by Paul Ortwin Rave,Rosebrock, p. 75. who despite being more acceptable to the Nazi regime, conscientiously guarded the artworks and as the war drew to an end, went with them to the mine where they were to be stored for safety's sake and was there when the Red Army arrived.Petropoulos, p. 60. He remained in charge of the gallery until 1950.Rosebrock, p. 172. Post-war The second National Gallery building, the 1968 Neue Nationalgalerie 19th-century sculpture on exhibit in the Friedrichswerder Church After the Second World War, the gallery and the other museums on Museum Island were located in the Soviet Occupation Zone which became East Berlin. The National Gallery's collection, much of it confiscated and then returned by the various occupying powers, was split between East and West and had been further diminished by the war; 19th-century paintings from the former annexe had been destroyed by fire. While the Alte Nationalgalerie building was renovated, in the Western sector, paintings were initially housed in Charlottenburg Palace. The city of Berlin (West) founded a new museum of 20th-century art in 1949;\\"Echter Mies\\", Der Spiegel, 21 August 1963 this was eventually merged with the Western branch of the National Gallery, and West Berlin then created its own cultural centre, the Kulturforum, which included the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery), a modernist building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. This opened on 15 September 1968 and initially exhibited the full range of 19th and 20th-century art.Roland Keitsch, \\"Rückblick auf die tollsten und chaotischsten Ausstellungen: Neue Nationalgalerie hat Geburtstag\\", Bild, 15 September 2008 T.H.

Werner Haftmann, who had become the director in 1967, said he was nervous about the gallery moving into the prestige modern building, comparing himself to \\"a wretched learner ... getting into a luxury Mercedes.\\"\\"Magere Schultern\\", Der Spiegel: \\"Es ist ... als ob ein armer Lehrling in einen Mercedes 600 stiege.\\" The Friedrichswerder Church, a Gothic landmark designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, was ruined in the war; between 1979 and 1986 it was restored, and it was then reopened in September 1987, as part of the celebrations of Berlin's 750th anniversary, as an annexe of the National Gallery displaying 19th-century sculpture. There is a Schinkel museum in the gallery.Collection - History , Friedrichswerder Church, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz.Peter-Klaus Schuster, Die Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin: Berlin: SMB-DuMont, 2003, , p. 45. Following German reunification, the old building was extensively renovatedHans Belting, The Germans and Their Art: A Troublesome Relationship, New Haven: Yale University, 1998, , pp. 106-07 has pictures of the exterior under renovation and says that the question of exhibiting East German art had yet to be resolved. and the new building is now used for 20th-century art and the old building for 19th- century art. In 1996, while the Alte Nationalgalerie was still being slowly renovated, two further exhibition spaces were added for modern art. In September, the Berggruen Museum, housing Heinz Berggruen's collection of modern classics, especially focussed on Picasso, opened in the western of a pair of neoclassical buildings opposite the Charlottenburg Palace, like the Alte Nationalgalerie designed by Friedrich August Stüler as realisations of sketches by Frederick William IV; it had housed the West Berlin Museum of Antiquities until that collection was returned to Museum Island after German reunification.\\"Die unheimlichen Retter\\", Der Spiegel, 28 October 1996 Museum Berggruen , Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz. Berggruen initially leased the collection to the Berlin State Museums for a ten-year period, but in 2000 sold it to them for a small fraction of its assessed value.\\"Ein Giacometti zum Abschied\\", Tageszeitung, 16 December 2006 In November, the Hamburger Bahnhof, formerly a museum of technology but ruined in the war, opened after a six-year renovation as the Museum für Gegenwart, housing contemporary art, initially most from Erich Marx's collection. In 2008, the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection of 20th-century art opened in the eastern Stüler building, which had housed the Egyptian Collection until it moved back to Museum Island. The collection is on a ten-year lease from the Stiftung Sammlung Dieter Scharf zur Erinnerung an Otto Gerstenberg (foundation of the Dieter Scharf collection in remembrance of Otto Gerstenberg), which focusses on the fantastic and the surreal and was built by Dieter Scharf based on some of the works in his grandfather Otto Gerstenberg's collection.Opening of the Collection Scharf-Gerstenberg \\"Surreal Worlds\\", Collection Scharf- Gerstenberg, National Gallery, 11 July 2008, News, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, retrieved 4 June 2012\\"Kunstjuwel für Berlin\\", Zeitung heute, Der Tagesspiegel, 10 July 2008 In December 2011, it was announced that the Old Masters currently displayed in the Gemäldegalerie in the Kulturforum would be moved out to make way for a representative permanent exhibition of modern art, for which the Neue Nationalgalerie does not have adequate space.Axel Lapp, \\"Berlin’s 20th-century art to gain space of its own: The director of the Nationalgalerie, Udo Kittelmann, gets the green light to rehang Gemäldegalerie with modern masters\\", The Art Newspaper, 14 December 2011.

While in college, they meet through some common friends and hang out often as a group. Shwetha has a childhood friend Genni, who is very protective of her and often wards off the boys who try to hit on Shwetha, and Karthik's friend Jai on the other hand encourages him to fall in love. Karthik falls in love with Shwetha eventually, but he hesitates to tell her. On Shwetha's birthday, Karthik intends to propose her but when he hesitates yet again, Jai lets the cat out of the bag, and tells that Karthik loves her, but Shwetha rejects the proposal. After a series of pursuing and some serious drama like falling from a moving bus, Shwetha agrees to Karthik's proposal. Genni advises Shwetha to avoid Karthik, since Shwetha is equally interested in Karthik, she conceals all the proceedings from Genni. But Genni happens to find out about them, and she confronts and Shwetha seems to apologize, but after Genni finds that Shwetha has made Karthik to overhear their girl talk through her mobile, she splits up from Shwetha and complains to Shwetha's mom that she is going out with some guy. Shwetha tackles her mom by blaming that she avoided Genni because is rotten in mind and is jealous. So to seek revenge, she must be doing this on purpose. Her mom gets suspicious but still believes Shwetha's side of the story. Karthik and Shwetha continue to see each other. Soon one thing leads to another and they get intimate during overnight trips and outings. Within two months, Shwetha finds that she has missed her period, coincidentally her mom asks why she has not used her sanitary napkins and there are so many left overs. She manages the situation by telling that she used the pads from her friend's house when she stayed there. Shwetha confides in Karthik and few other friends that she might be pregnant and they ask her to perform a self pregnancy test which turns out to be positive. So they go to some unknown place to abort the foetus posing as a married couple. But the doctor gets suspicious when they answer irrelevantly and chucks them out. They find another person who does the abortion through a hostel warden and learn that this new place is pretty expensive. Karthik, Shwetha, Jai and other friends try to arrange for money and finally on the day the abortion is supposed to be done, Shwetha vomits in front of her mother at her house. When her mom insists that they go to a doctor to check for food poisoning, Shwetha becomes restless and shouts at her. Her mom relates the unused pads and her vomiting and her behavior and realizes that she is pregnant and then all hell breaks loose. Shwetha's dad speaks to Karthik's dad along with few relatives, and they argue. Shwetha's family, being on the receiving end want to finish the problem by getting them married. But Karthik's dad is not interested since his reputation will be spoiled. So, the lovers plan to elope and while they are on the way, Shwetha changes her mind and tells that her parents will feel bad. Karthik on the other hand tells that his parents will not agree for them to be together. They argue a lot and that forms a rift between them, but still they choose to stay together and return home. The families continue to argue about the marriage, and then finally Karthik's parents agree, provided Shwetha aborts the baby. But she refuses telling that the sole evidence will be lost and then again Karthik's parents will not get them married. Karthik tries to convince her, but it only leads to another argument and Shwetha walks off leaving an irate Karthik behind. The parents also argue about the marriage and when some relatives speak ill about Shwetha and her character, (that she has acted like a prostitute and so she must take money for her services and not ask for marriage) Shwetha's father gets insulted and he leaves the place in tears. When Shwetha's mom knows this, she fights with Karthik's parents in front of their house, but Karthik has now changed his mind about marrying Shwetha because of the previous argument and he doesn't care anymore and is selfish and stone faced even when her whole family is in tears in front of his house. That is when Shwetha too decides that she doesn't want to be with Karthik anymore. And they leave his place. Finally,a few months later a baby boy is born and Shwetha's dad leaves him in an orphanage. Two years later, we find that Shwetha is happily getting engaged to someone else, while Karthik is busy in a coffee shop flirting with another girl and the little child grows up in the orphanage without parental love and care.

You cannot classify this film as mainstream. The enormous impact of the script will be felt in the film’s second half\\", he said. Santhosh, a third year Loyola College student, plays the hero, while Manisha Yadav, who played one of the leads in the critically acclaimed Vazhakku Enn 18/9, the heroine. Some students from both Loyola and MOP Vaishnav colleges have acted in the film. Actor Poornima Bhagyaraj makes a comeback with this film. Apart from her, actors Jayaprakash, Thulasi and Arjun, who played a commendable role in Kadhalil Sodhapuvadhu Eppadi, are the other three familiar faces in the cast. The rest are newcomers. For the film all artistes attended a two-month rehearsal. Suseenthiran came up with the script of Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer while chatting with a friend who was talking about one of his relatives, a college girl, who had fallen in love. \\"As he discussed her story, several issues one would normally not associate with a couple in love emerged. The impact was such that I was prompted to make a movie out of the story,\\" says Suseenthiran. Suseenthiran has convinced the young music director Yuvan Shankar Raja to appear in a music video for a song from the film. Unlike most other films, this film's title will not be showcased at the beginning but at the end. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. There are six songs but only four will be featured in the album as the director feels that the lyrics of the other two songs would give out the plot details. These two songs will only be a part of the film. The audio launch was held on 17 October at Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai. The first audio CD was released by actor Mohan and received by director-actor K. Bhagyaraj. The music was praised by critics. Behindwoods wrote, \\"Yuvan Shankar Raja proves why he is the 'Little Maestro' in the finale of the movie and the little pathos song sung by Yuvan himself, will surely move you\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"topping the list of other highlights is Yuvan Shankar Raja’s score. The songs have been chartbusters for quite a while. Now you notice his RR beautifully enhancing the mood of the sequences\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Yuvan Shankar Raja’s background score is a key strength to the film\\". Rediff wrote, \\"music by Yuvan Shankar Raja is melodious and pleasing to the ear, particularly the Poovum Poovum number by Vijay Yesudas and Vinaitha\\". Sify wrote, \\"Yuvan Shankar Raja’s music is peppy and the pathos song sung by the music director in the climax and picturised on the child artist is heart- warming and will move you to tears\\". Release It was released by Udhayanidhi Stalin's Red Giant Movies though Studio Green had initially acquired the distribution rights of the film. The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay. The film was given a \\"U\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. The film which supposed to hit screens on 23 August 2013 was advanced to 15 August, on Independence day. Reception Suganth of The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and called Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer, \\"a return to form for the director after the misfire that was Rajapattai. Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer comes as a breath of fresh air. Clear and focused in its screenplay, it is sensitive in handling the issue of premarital sex and teen pregnancy. Brilliantly narrated by Suseenthiran, it capsules a relevant issue in just 106 minutes. Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer is an experience not to be missed\\". Sify wrote, \\"Suseenthiran is back in form with his latest realistic Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer. He has come out with a different kind of film which is sure to pull at your heartstrings and at the same time make you think of the realities of life\\". S Saraswathi of Rediff gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote \\"Aadhalaal Kaadhal Seiveer is a must watch. A simple and honest screenplay with a liberal dose of realism coupled with some excellent editing, but most of all, the totally unexpected climax, sets this film apart\\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, \\"Nearly two years after Rajapaatai, Suseenthiran bounces back with AKS that has a neatly told story and a finale that touches an interesting emotional acme\\". Indo- Asian News Service wrote, \\"Suseenthiran handles the film bravely without compromising on the message it sets out to deliver to its audiences. Any story dealing with a social problem is either extremely preachy or overtly melodramatic, but what we get here is an intelligent output sans cliches. Kudos to the director for writing and narrating an impactful story\\". Behindwoods wrote, \\"AKS is a 'slice of life' tale topped by a really impactful climax. Suseenthiran is back in form with a short impactful teenage romance\\".

The population was 4,116 at the 2010 census. Situated beside Wilson Pond, the former mill town is today primarily a recreation area. History The land replaced an invalidated 1727 grant by Massachusetts to veterans for service in the French and Indian Wars. The first grant (now part of Manchester, New Hampshire) was originally dubbed Harrytown after a particularly dangerous Native American, then renamed Tyngstown for Captain William Tyng, leader of the expedition of \\"snowshoe men\\" that killed him in 1703.History of Farmington, Maine, from Its First Settlement to 1846, Thomas Parker, J.S. Swift, Farmington, Maine, 1875 Abraham Butterfield, a settler from Wilton, New Hampshire, paid the cost of incorporation in 1803 to have the new town named after his former residence. Wilton is known for being the location of Maine's first cotton mill, started in 1810 by Solomon Adams.http://www.wiltonmaine.org/workers.html In 1876, George Henry Bass (1855–1925) founded G.H. Bass & Co. and became the best- known businessman in Wilton's history. Bass shoes (including those worn by Charles Lindbergh during his Atlantic crossing and Admiral Byrd in his expeditions to Antarctica) were made exclusively in Wilton for more than a century until 1998. By then the Bass family had sold out,The Bass family sold G. H. Bass & Co. to the conglomerate Chesebrough-Pond's for $27 million in 1978. and in 1998 Bass' parent company, Phillips-Van Heusen, moved operations overseas. John Russell Bass (b. 1878), son of G. H. Bass, was treasurer for the firm and served as Maine delegate to the Republican national convention in 1920, 1944 and 1952. The company built much of its success on the Bass penny weejun, introduced in 1936 and said to be based on Norwegian fisherman's shoes. The style was an instant hit, and became a staple on college campuses across the nation. The shoe was later renamed the Leavitt penny weejun; it is no longer made in Wilton.Made in America: From Levi's to Barbie to Google, Nick Freeth, 2005 The first toothpick manufacturing mill was also located in Wilton.

The film premiered at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival.  Plot summary  A young man meets his dream woman (and isn't the least rather troubled that she's a washed-up porn actress 30 years his senior) in this independent coming-of-age comedy. Tobe Hulbert (Dustin Ingram) is a 17-year-old high school graduate who is the working definition of a loser—he's nerdy and socially inept, he lives with his eccentric grandfather (Brian Dennehy), his closest friend, Kenny (Daniel Yelsky), is only 12 years old, and he drives a beat-up hot-dog wagon with a giant frankfurter bolted to the roof. Among his other obsessions, Tobe is fascinated with adult movies of the 1970s and 1980s, and his favorite actress is Monica Velour (Kim Cattrall), who in her heyday was the hottest star in porn. When Tobe discovers there's a collector living in Indiana (Keith David) who is willing to buy his wagon for a good price and Monica Velour will be appearing at a gentleman's club nearby, he decides fate is smiling on him and hits the road. However, the \\"gentleman's club\\" turns out to be a sleazy dive and time hasn't been kind to Monica; when several patrons begin shouting insults at her, Tobe defends her honor and gets beat up for his trouble. Monica gratefully befriends Tobe and lets him stay at the trailer park she calls home; he begins to imagine he might have a chance with the woman of his dreams, but while she sees Tobe as a kindred spirit, she has bigger things to deal with, including a career that's going nowhere, an ugly relationship with her ex-husband, and a contentious battle to win back custody of her daughter.

Early life  John Catnach was born in Burntisland, a former Royal burgh in Fife, Scotland in 1769. His father was the possessor of some Powder mills. He started work as a bound apprentice to his uncle, Sandy Robinson., a printer in Edinburgh, and on completion of his apprenticeship, moved to Berwick-upon-Tweed in the late 1780s where he founded his own printing business, and then moving on to Alnwick a couple of years later, where he continued his print-shop. The work produced by Catnach’s business was of very high quality, and at an early stage employed Thomas Bewick to provide the engraving works. Unfortunately John Catnach himself was not a businessman. He was declared bankrupt in 1801 and a sale of assets took place, the assets including about 1200 books were auctioned at Alnwick Town Hall on 2 March 1802, hence the sale advertised in a hand-bill, a rare copy of which is now in the National Library of Scotland He managed to re-start in business and in 1807 he took on 2 apprentices, one was his son James, and another was a lad named Mark Smith, (see later); a few months afterwards he entered into partnership with William Davison to form Catnach and Davison. Unfortunately this partnership did not appear to work, as it lasted not more than 2 years, after which it was dissolved.  Family  John Catnach (1769–1813) married in Berwick on Tweed (sometime in the late 1780s) Mary (née Hutchinson), (1766 – 24 Jan 1826) a native of Dundee, Scotland. John had been raised as a Roman Catholic and his wife as a Presbyterian, but in the baptismal records of St. Michael’s Church, Alnwick, she is described as a (religious) Dissenter. . They had (at least) 9 children, the first three born in Berwick on Tweed and the remainder in Alnwick. They were – John (? Jan 1789 – 27 Aug 1794), Margaret (26 Dec 1790 – ????), James (18 Aug 1792 – 1 Feb 1841), Mary (26 Feb 1794 – ????), Nancy who became known as Anne (2 Sep 1795 – 20 April 1870), Elizabeth (21 Mar 1797 – ????), Isabella (2 Nov 1798 – burned to death c1811), Jane (c1799 – ????), and John H (? Dec 1802 – 5 Mar 1802) His son James (18 August 1792 – 1 Feb 1841) (popularly known as \\"Jemmy\\" later became famous for the street literature publications produced on his press at Seven Dials, London.  Midlife  John Catnach moving his side of the business to Newcastle in 1808, taking a small shop in Negate Street. He took on the printing of John Thompson’s story, Thompson had been a British seaman who lost a leg and suffered at the Battle of Trafalgar, but just as the book was being bound, he died, leaving John Catnach with the entire stock. He had always been a little irregular with his habits and the way he ran his business, and now that went from bad to worse. He got into more debt and the business suffered from his increasing lack of interest, until eventually he became a bankrupt and as such ended up in the Debtors' prison. He had managed to send his wife and family to London together with a small wooden printing press, some type etc. and other small items which they had managed to secret away.  Later life  The family moved into lodgings in a court off Drury Lane, where they were joined by John in 1812 on his release, but the accommodation was to prove temporary. Very shortly after, they were evicted and moved firstly to a small shop in Wardour Street, Soho (while living in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square), followed by another move to Gerard Street, where on 29 August 1813, whilst moving in, he fell down stairs and injured his leg. Although taken immediately to St George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, he contacted rheumatic fever, and being already in a run-down state, eventually succumbed, dying on 4 December 1813. Just to add to the tragedy, the funeral itself was postponed due to an accident to the horse due to pull the hearse. The funeral was re-arranged for the following day, but several of the mourners, including Mark Smith, were unable to attend due to other commitments.  Mark Smith  When the two partners, John Catnach and William Davison dissolved the partnership, the indentures on son James Catnach and the lad Mark Smith became void, and they afterwards worked together as \\"improvers\\" in their trade with Mr Joseph Graham, a printer from Fenkle Street in Alnwick. Mark Smith moved away to London and later, on learning that the family had arrived there, went to visit them at their lodgings in a court off Drury Lane. There he helped to set up the press in readiness for John Catnach's freeing from prison. He kept in touch, helped out the family by providing firstly utensils, later paying off the rent arrears and whilst John was in hospital, by working at night-time to finish off the jobs on his books.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, and has often been overlooked in Darabont's directorial catalogue due to the success of his later films. Plot Clint Goodman is a successful contractor who built his comfortable house and his construction company in his hometown through hard work. He loves his wife Joanna, but she is resentful of him most of the time. They have been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby. Clint's best friend is Sheriff Sam Eberly. Every now and then, they spend the night fishing on the lake. Unknown to Clint, Joanna has been having an affair with local doctor Cortland van Owen. He plans to kill Clint and have Joanna sell his company and house. With the money, they will move to Beverly Hills to buy a clinic. Cortland gives poison to Joanna, which is taken from a poisonous tropical fish. Though hesitant at first, Joanna goes along with the idea. While having dinner with Clint, she begins to have a change of heart and starts pouring the poison away at the kitchen sink, but stops herself. She spikes his wine with the poison, but Is startled by Clint and drops the vial with a small amount of the liquid left In It. After drinking the poisoned Wine, Clint has a heart attack and apparently dies. When the coroner asks if an autopsy should be done, Cortland refuses. While Clint's body is at the morgue, he shows signs of life. Just before he is to be embalmed, Joanna instructs that he be given a quick and cheap funeral instead, skipping the embalming process. Clint is placed in a cheap water-damaged casket, varnished to look like new. After his funeral, Joanna and Cortland celebrate. During a stormy night, Clint, who has survived the lower dosage, wakes up buried alive. After breaking through the coffin lid and escaping his grave, he returns to his house and learns the truth about his wife and the doctor. He hides in the basement to recuperate. The next morning, Joanna meets with a lawyer to discuss selling Clint's business for $1,500,000. Clint plans to kill Joanna, but when Cortland comes by to visit her, Clint overhears that Joanna was pregnant and that she and Cortland had had his child aborted behind his back. Convinced that merely shooting her would be too easy, Clint plots a dark revenge against Joanna and Cortland. That night, while Joanna is passed out from sleeping pills, Clint cleans himself up in their bedroom bathroom and tends to his injuries. The next morning, after Joanna has sold Clint's business and collected the money, Sam discovers that Clint's grave has been opened and the body is missing. Examining the coffin, he realizes that the hole in the coffin lid was made from the inside, and so believes that Clint could still be alive. Joanna goes into the bathroom and finds the floor and tub covered with mud. Suspecting that someone has been in her house, she frantically calls Cortland (only getting his answering machine) and is startled by Clint's dog, Duke, whom she chased away earlier. Just as she's about to shoot the dog, Clint, disguised in a welding mask and body armor, appears from behind the open basement door. Surprised, she falls in the basement, knocking herself unconscious, while Clint locks her inside and boards up the basement windows. Meanwhile, at his apartment, Cortland loads a syringe with more fish poison and leaves after listening to a recorded message from his landlord demanding payment of unpaid rent - but just before Joanna's message is played. Arriving at Clint's house, he is unable to find Joanna, but finds the money in a suitcase on the bed, which he takes. Searching for Joanna, Cortland enters the basement, the door of which is now open. Believing Cortland to be the masked figure, she knocks him unconscious with a blow to the head, causing him to drop the syringe which rolls out of view. She then takes the money and tries to escape, but Clint locks them both inside. As Cortland regains consciousness, Joanna realizes her mistake, to which he argues about burning the money to prove his love. Cortland tries to open the door by shooting the lock with the shotgun, only to discover that Clint has replaced all the shells with blanks, In the meantime, Clint knocks out some walls and moves furniture, with Duke guarding the basement windows and preventing the pair from escaping. While they wait for the figure to hopefully release them, Cortland suspects that Sam may be behind everything and that he wants the money. Joanna then finds the fish poison syringe and realizes that Cortland was going to kill her. Cortland shows his true colors, revealing that there never was a clinic; his real intention was to take the money for himself so that he can move to the tropics and live an easy life. They fight, and just as Cortland is about to use the syringe on Joanna, the door opens. Exiting the basement, the pair finds out that most of the house is now blocked off by wooden panels. While trying to find a way out, they are led through a maze and separated by sliding panels. At the end of a passage leading to an unblocked window, Cortland sees a shadowy figure and, still thinking it's Sam, tries to bribe him, secretly planning to inject him with the poison. Clint reveals himself, saying \\"Keep it\\"; a stunned Cortland tries to flee, but trips on the briefcase of money and falls, accidentally injecting himself with the poison and killing himself. Shortly afterwards, Joanna is trapped between Clint and a small hatch. As her only option, she crawls through the hatchway along a low passage to where it suddenly dead-ends, allowing Clint to shut her inside. Clint reveals himself to her and mentions their aborted child, asking if it was a boy or a girl. He dumps the dead Cortland and the money inside with her in what is now a large wooden coffin. and nails it shut. He then loads it onto his truck and sets fire to the house before leaving with Duke. Sam, who now believes that Joanna and Cortland either murdered, or tried to murder Clint, rushes to the house to find it ablaze. After the fire is extinguished, no bodies are found inside the house. Returning to the cemetery, Sam sees a man standing at Clint's re-filled-in grave, with his back to Sam. Realizing it is Clint and presumably realizing his revenge scheme as well, Sam tells him to never come back, obliquely promising to keep his secret. Clint and Duke drive away, and the final shot reveals that the still-alive Joanna and the dead Cortland now occupy Clint's grave, with the money. Cast * Tim Matheson as Clint Goodman * Jennifer Jason Leigh as Joanna Goodman * William Atherton as Dr. Cortland 'Cort' van Owen * Hoyt Axton as Sheriff Sam Eberly * Jay Gerber as Quintan * Wayne Grace as Bill Scorby * Donald Hotton as Reynolds * Brian Libby as Earl, the embalmer * Peg Shirley as Helen Eberley * David Youse as Billy * Milt Hamerman as The Coroner Production Buried Alive stars Tim Matheson as Clint Goodman, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Joanna Goodman, William Atherton as Dr. Cortland 'Cort' van Owen and Hoyt Axton as Sheriff Sam Eberly. Others in the film include Jay Gerber as Quintan and Wayne Grace as Bill Scorby. The film's budget was $2,000,000, whilst the film had the working title Till Death Do Us Part. According to John Carpenter on the audio commentary for Vampires, director Darabont (who are very close friends and Frank had a cameo in that film) asked Carpenter to play as a truck driver. Carpenter turned the offer down because he stated that he would only play a character that is killing someone or about to or if he's in bed with a beautiful woman. Release The film first premiered on May 9, 1990 on the USA Network. The film was released under two taglines which read \\"She planned on her husband's death. But not on his coming back for revenge.\\" and \\"One of them put an end to the marriage, until the other came back for revenge.\\" Following the film's release, it remained only available on out-of-print VHS in America on March 21, 1991. It was released on DVD in the UK in October 2011, where the sequel Buried Alive II was also released on DVD after being on out-of-print VHS. Other previous DVD releases included a Dutch import and the Australian double feature DVD which included the 2001 film They Crawl. Kino Lorber will be releasing it on Blu-ray and DVD in America on January 12, 2021 in a new 2k master featuring an audio commentary by author and journalist Bryan Reeseman and an interview with William Atherton. Reception AllMovie gave the film two and a half stars out of five, and wrote \\"Produced for cable TV, this pedestrian thriller purports to be a riff on Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Premature Burial' but actually bears more of a resemblance to Diabolique.\\" Tom Leins for Devon & Cornwall Film wrote a favorable review, stating \\"Buried Alive is a quirky little curio elevated above TV-movie nonsense by committed performances from the three charismatic leads. The horror genre has loomed large in Darabont's work since he scripted A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors back in 1987, and although his work in the horror sphere arguably reached its peak with zombie series The Walking Dead – prior to his untimely sacking – Buried Alive represents an appealing footnote in an often-inspired career.\\" Flickering Myth gave a favorable review and wrote \\"Although the plot of Buried Alive is fairly predictable, the film benefits immensely from some inventive direction from Darabont, while a capable cast of familiar faces including Matheson, Leigh, Atherton and country singer Hoyt Axton also helps to elevate it above your typical TV movie standards.\\" In the book Time Capsule: Reviews of Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films and TV Shows from 1987-1991 by J. P. Harris, a mixed review of the film wrote \\"Buried Alive is more of a murder story than a horror movie. Whilst the plot actually makes sense and is professionally presented with a nicely ironic ending, there is little suspense and the whole thing is somewhat of a disappointment, given Frank Darabont's previous excellent genre record.\\" The book DVD & Video Guide 2005 (Ballantine Books) gave the film four out of five stars, whilst TV Guide (Triangle Publications) gave two stars out of five. Sequel A sequel followed in 1997, titled Buried Alive II, which starred Ally Sheedy and Stephen Caffrey. The film also was directed by and co-starred Tim Matheson, who along with Brian Libby were the only cast members from the original to return. The film followed a similar plot to Buried Alive, switching the genders of the leading characters.

The state name and slogan is displayed at the top centre of the plate, and the \\"Federal Republic of Nigeria\\" is written at the bottom. The unique plate combination itself is in the format ABC-123DE. The first three letters indicate the Local Government Area in which the vehicle was registered, which are followed by three digits and two letters. The background consists of an outline of a map of Nigeria. Before 2011, the three letters indicating the Local Government Area were at the end, in the format AB123-CDE.http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/09/oct-1-deadline-63-7-of-vehicle- owners-yet-to-get-new-number-plate/ Other types of license plates are also in use.

Its title was revealed on April 7, 2009, in a blog which described both itself and another song from the album, \\"Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon\\". Music details A blog by Metal Hammer describes \\"WOW\\" as \\"a grinding, NIN-tinged sex anthem. Genuinely filthy and intensely sexy, The Wow sees Manson riding a dirty Twiggy Ramirez bassline in an almost spoken-word style. Quirky keyboards interject all the way through the track while sexual female groans (occasionally spoken in German) swarm behind the crunching industrial backing track. The Wow doesn't have anything in the way of memorable hooks but it is the sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth stripclub...if one existed.\\" Reviewing for Thrash Hits, Hugh Platt stated that \\"for every killer track there's one like 'WOW', a gutful of sickly electro honky-tonk with Manson at his lyrically most self-absorbed.\\" John Robb of The Quietus deems that the song \\"is very Iggy [Pop]; Iggy when he swerved and went industrial on The Idiot.\\" In an interview with BBC Radio's 6 Music, Manson acknowledged this influence, and also explained the song has literary references to the 1868 Fyodor Dostoevsky novel The Idiot (which the aforementioned Iggy Pop record lifts its name from). Music video On May 11, 2010 a music video for \\"WOW\\" was released to Manson's MySpace account. It was directed by Marilyn Manson and consists of nothing more than a two-second clip being looped for about six minutes. The clip shows Evan Rachel Wood, in make-up reminiscent of the Black Dahlia, playing with the strap of her dress. According to the video's description it was filmed in 2008, about a year before the album's release, and was a \\"torture production technique [Manson] used to write the song with the boys.\\" Presumably this means the video existed before the song itself. Oddly the video continues for over a minute longer than the song.

They inform Damon that the world will end in less than three weeks when a series of asteroids will strike the Earth. However, a glimmer of hope remains in the form of a secret spaceship orbiting the Earth that can house up to 2,000 people. In exchange for a ticket to this spaceship, they task Damon with documenting the final moments leading up to the asteroid strike. Seeing an opportunity to save Ann and his unborn child, a chance to mend the rift his obsession has created, Damon accepts the assignment. As the end of days arrives, Damon watches London descend into madness, with families torn apart and friends lost.

Biography His father, Erik Lundgren, was a manufacturer. After 1829, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on \\"bergshantering\\" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked in Eskilstuna and at the cannon foundry in Finspång. This type of work was apparently not to his liking as, in 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. Neapolitan Fruit Sellers From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. London and India In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare.Gunnar Carlquist, Svensk uppslagsbok, Vol.17, Malmö, pgs.830-832 (1937) With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. A Lady of Rank In 1864, he was elected a member of the Royal Watercolour Society. He continued his travels throughout the 1860s, visiting Norway, Egypt, Spain and Italy and making his first trip back to Sweden. Although he returned there permanently in 1867, he generally spent the winters elsewhere. He made his last trip to Italy in 1873. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries called En målares anteckningar 1 - 2 (A Painter's Notes), compiled from earlier publications. In 1905, a comprehensive edition was issued by the National Library.

He was the first president of the Reichskammergericht. As a close friend of the Archduke and later Emperor Maximilian I, he gained great influence in the imperial politics. He managed to consolidate and expand his own territory.  Relationship with the Franconian line  Eitel Friedrich II was the son and heir of Count Jobst Nikolaus I (1433–1488). He continued his father's policy of good relationships with the Franconian line of the House of Hohenzollern, who ruled the Burgraviate of Nuremberg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. During his father's reign, he spent several years at the court of Elector Albrecht Achilles. From 1481, he served as captain of the Lordship of Krosno Odrzańskie, east of the Oder. In 1483, he became a Councillor in Brandenburg. Later, he served as governor of Kottbus and Züllichau. In 1482 in Berlin, he married Magdalena, the daughter of Margrave Friedrich of the Altmark, thus creating a family relationship between the two lines of Hohenzollern. Elector Albrecht Achilles, who held some possessions in Swabia himself, protected his Swabian relatives against the powerful Counts of Württemberg, who had formed a threat to the Swabian Hohenzollerns for a long time.  Relationship with the House of Habsburg  Eitel Friedrich II was a close friend of Maximilian I and maintained excellent relations with the House of Habsburg. This gained great influence on imperial politics. He provided diplomatic services for Maximilian and fought for him in the Netherlands. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Guinegate in 1479 and in 1488, he led the vanguard against rebellious citizens of Bruges, who held the newly elected Emperor captive. Eitel Friedrich had served Maximilan as judge and when the Reichskammergericht was established in 1495, Eitel Friedrich was its first president. In 1497 or 1498, he was appointed as Councillor in Austria. In 1499, Eitel Friedrich and Dietrich Blumeneck led a small army against Switzerland and conquered Rorschach on the south bank of Lake Constance. In 1500, he occupied the County of Gorizia for Austria. In 1501, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece. On 12 September 1504, during the Landshut War of Succession, he fought at Regensburg against Bohemia and the Palatinate. He commanded the right wing of the cavalry and contributed significantly to the victory.

She represented Great Britain at the 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics. Career Bond-Williams took up fencing at Chipping Campden School. She quickly showed promise, winning the West Midlands championships for her age class when she was twelve. She was then coached by David Kirby at Shakespeare's Swords, the fencing club at King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1999, first year where women's sabre was allowed at top-level competitions, she earned a silver medal at the Cadet World Championships in Dijon and posted a last-16 finish at the Senior World Championships in Seoul.

The school mascot was the Burro and the school colors were red and black. Currently, the elementary school and primary school in town still have the same mascot and colors today. History In 1894, the high school was established, meeting upstairs in the Junken Building. In 1913, the school was built at the cost of around $23,000, containing both the grade school and high school. Four high school students graduated in 1914. In 1919, a gym was added on to the school by the local citizens. Due to overcrowding, the new high school was built in 1921 on North Meridian, costing $70,000. The new building was built next to the 1913 building. When the new high school was completed, the old building housed grades 1-7 and the new building contained grades 8-12. The graduating class of 1921 was eleven. The last class from the high school graduated in 1975 and the building was abandoned in 1978 before being demolished in 1981. The school was around for 82 years. Pittsboro High School History After 1975, students that lived in Pittsboro, would go to Tri-West Hendricks High School instead.

History The RG-6 was required to increase the firepower of the infantry during urban combat, seen in small-scale conflicts, such as the Chechen wars. The RG-6 entered limited production by the mid-1990s and is now in use by various elements of Russian Army and special forces such as those in the MVD. Design RG-6 is designed to fire all standard 40mm \\"caseless\\" grenades, available for the general issue GP-25 underbarrel launcher. The design of the RG-6 is, apparently, heavily influenced by the South African Milkor MGL grenade launcher, with some differences. The key difference is RG-6 uses \\"caseless\\" rounds, and thus its cylinder is loaded from the front. The \\"barrel\\" is, in fact, a smoothbore tube, which served only as a support for front grip and sights. The double-action only trigger unit is also modified from GP-25, with manual safety and several automatic safeties. The cylinder is rotated using a clockwork-type spring, which is manually wound during reloading. For reloading, the front cylinder plate with the \\"barrel\\" tube is unlocked from the frame and then rotated sideways, to expose the front of the cylinder. Each chamber in the cylinder is a separate muzzle-loading rifled barrel, similar in design to the GP-25 barrel. The sights are folded for more convenient carry and storage, with a ladder-type rear sight. The buttstock is fitted with a rubber recoil pad, and when it is not in use, it is telescoped into the frame.

History  The club was founded on 16 August 1949 and joined the Royal Belgian Football Association on 24 June 1950, with matricule number 5343 being assigned to the team. Bambrugge played for decades in the provisional leagues, but climbed steadily, and remained at the top of the Second Provincial for years. They were the winners of their series in 2009, resulting in promotion to the highest provincial level, the first club ever from Erpe- Mere to achieve this.  Merger plans  There are ongoing plans for the four remaining clubs from Erpe-Mere (SK Aaigem, KRC Bambrugge, KFC Olympic Burst and FC Mere) to merge. A new stadium will be built on the domain of Steenberg, with an objective of it being ready by 2015. However, the merger is not expected to happen before 2016 at the earliest due to the need for a multi- purpose hall to be built first in Steenberg (source: municipality Erpe-Mere). The new football club will use the matricule number of KRC Bambrugge, that plays in the first provincial league, as the other teams play in lower series. It is thought to be almost certain that there will be black in the new club's colours, because of the four clubs that are still active, and the three clubs who merged into FC Mere, all had black in their club's colours. The K of Koninklijke (Royal) and Erpe-Mere will appear in the new club's name. More information about the name is currently unavailable.

After the theatre closed it was used as a machinery factory which closed in 2005 and the theatre has remained empty until last October with the proscenium, fly house and balcony still intact. 8-Count Studios now claims the Rialto as its home, housing multiple dance studios, artist studios, an art gallery, offices, production space and event space in hopes of forming beneficial relationships between artists of many media and art supporters. The facility boasts over 5,000 square feet available for classes, networking, fundraisers, fashion shows, or performances, divided into three event spaces which provide a variety of options for set-up and event production.

According to Lessig, the idea is not to hack at the branches of the problem but rather focus on its root, which Lessig views as a corrupt campaign finance system, and hence he named the organization rootstrikers. History Rootstrikers was founded in April 2011. In November 2011, Rootstrikers, previously known as Change Congress and Fix Congress First, became a project of United Republic, a non- partisan 501(c)(4) organization. In September 2012, Rootstrikers reorganized under the umbrella of Fund for the Republic, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to challenging the influence of money in American politics. As of July 2013, Rootstrikers became a project of Demand Progress, an organization cofounded by Aaron Swartz, an internet activist.http://archive.rootstrikers.org/www.rootstrikers.org/announcing_rootstrikers_merger_with_demand_progress.html The organization plans to use technology to help engage people. The name \\"Rootstrikers\\" is based on a quote from the first chapter of Henry David Thoreau's book Walden: \\"There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root\\". In December 2011, Lessig appeared on The Daily Show starring Jon Stewart and suggested that the public needs to strike at the root of money in politics; Stewart advised Lessig \\"You need a better term than rootstriker.\\" Lessig credits the line quoted above from Henry David Thoreau's book Walden for inspiring the name. Positions In his 2012 book One Way Forward, Lessig proposes what he termed the Anti-Corruption Pledge. Lessig launched the Pledge as a project of Rootstrikers on February 24, 2012 on MSNBC’s show Morning Joe. The pledge is available for people to sign to show their support for the fight against corruption. The Pledge has four provisions: :*publicly funded elections :*political expenditures which are limited and transparent :*ending the revolving door between Congress and K Street :*reaffirmation that when the Declaration of Independence spoke of entities “endowed by their Creator with unalienable Rights,” it was speaking of natural persons only, and not corporations. Activities Over the weekend of October 29, 2011, a coalition of Rootstrikers and the conservative Tea Party Patriots held a \\"Conference on the Constitutional Convention\\" in hopes of generating support for the calling of a national convention to propose proposing amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Such a convention, also called an \\"Article V Convention\\", is one of two ways processes authorized by Article Five of the United States Constitution whereby the Constitution, the nation's frame of government, may be altered, and must be called by the United States Congress upon the request of two-thirds (presently 34) of the state legislatures. Amendments may also be proposed by Congress itself with a two- thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Thirty-three amendments to the United States Constitution have been approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. (Twenty-seven of them have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution.) As of 2016 the convention process has never been used for proposing constitutional amendments.\\",Korte, Greg. \\"Balanced budget amendment push sparks debate\\", USA Today (November 29, 2011). Rootstrikers is one of 15 organizations in the Money Out / Voters In coalition that sponsored \\"A 28th Amendment\\" conference at the UCLA School of Law, Saturday, November 17, 2012. Lawrence Lessig was the keynote speaker. The agenda included presentations by other experts, including Greg Colvin, who provided a dozen questions that he thought should be answered for any proposed amendment on this issue. The conference web site also includes a comparison chart of 21 alternative amendments, 18 that have already been introduced in the US congress plus language proposed by Free Speech for People, Greg Colvin, and Move to Amend. Of the proposed amendments, five were identified as primarily attempting to limit the constitutional rights of corporations; the other 16 were described as dealing more with campaign finance, though there is overlap. The conference ended with breakout sessions and a call to further action.

Plot For thousands of years, the inhabitants of Foxton have avoided Swallow Woods, but approximately every fifty years a number of people go into the woods and never come out. The Doctor realises this is the result of a spatial distortion caused by a crashed spaceship and discovers that a week after the last disappearances the entire area will be destroyed and replaced with a lake. He has Rory befriend Emily Bostock shortly before she disappeared in 1917 so he can accompany her into the woods. He and Amy will then follow one of three young women who were the last to disappear, approximately a hundred years later, and both groups will activate a homing device on finding the ship so they can get a bearing on its position. Unfortunately, when Rory and Emily enter the woods and are taken aboard the spaceship, Rory loses his memory and forgets to activate the device. Furthermore, Detective Inspector Gordon Galloway, who is investigating the disappearances of Laura Brown and Vicky Caine, becomes suspicious of the Doctor's behaviour and arrests him. With no other option, Amy elects to accompany the third woman, Jess Ashcroft, into the woods. Amy and Jess find Vicky alone in a clearing which they keep being led back to whichever way they go. A humanoid fox appears and Amy chooses to follow him, which allows Amy and Vicky to head in the opposite direction and emerge from the woods. They are unable to convince Galloway of the Doctor's innocence and he insists on organising a search of the woods for Laura. Galloway's partner DC Ruby Porter, whose uncle was the only person to disappear in the 1960s, releases the Doctor without authorisation and he realises the ship's pilot is still in the woods. The fox, Reyn, takes Amy to an artificial environment resembling a fairy tale castle where they meet Laura, now an elderly woman having lived there with Reyn for over sixty years. Reyn reveals his ship has been drawing people to it to try and recharge themselves and he has been trying to lure them to this realm to save them. If the ship departs now, when it has become interwoven with its surroundings, it will cause the destruction of the area. Meanwhile, Rory and Emily find the ship communicating with them through the body of Harry Thompson, who disappeared just before Emily. When they confront it with the reality of its kidnapping people and draining their memories, the ship suffers an overload of guilt and wants to self-destruct. The Doctor joins the others in the woods and travels back to 1917, where he manages to talk the ship round, helping it achieve sentience and returning Rory and Harry to normal. However, with the ship now stable, Reyn wants to return to the war he was fighting when he crashed, even though doing he will have to rob the ship of its sentience and destroy the area to do so. The Doctor uses the triangulation devices to bring the TARDIS into the woods and convinces Reyn to let him take him home in that. Instead, he takes him to thousands of years in the future, where, despite his people losing the war, the empire that conquered them has fallen and they now live in peace. The Doctor has also planted a legend in the planet's history of a lost traveller and Reyn is welcomed as a hero. Returning to the present, the Doctor reveals he can bring the ship into one time zone, so the disappearances never occurred, causing Ruby's uncle and the others to be restored to their original position with no-one knowing they were gone. Laura, Emily and Harry elect to stay with Ship as it safely departs to the stars.

Background Born in Derry, Ireland on 22 February 1836, he was the son of Sir George Hill, 3rd Baronet and Elizabeth Sophia Rea. Ordination and early curacies He was ordained a priest in the Anglican ministry in 1860 and served a number of positions in the south of England before becoming Vicar of Sheffield in 1873. Bishop of Sodor and Man He was nominated Bishop of Sodor and Man by Queen Victoria on 9 August 1877 and consecrated on 24 August 1877. At his appointment he was the youngest bishop in Anglican communion. At the time of his appointment there was a proposal to add the Archdeaconry of Liverpool to the Diocese of Sodor and Man, but this met with considerable resistance both on the Isle of Man and in Liverpool, resulting in the formation of the Diocese of Liverpool in 1880. Hill resided on the island for most of the year and devoted considerable efforts to placing the Manx Convocation on a more professional footing, and revitalizing church life on the island, where he became extremely popular. He married twice, firstly in 1863The Belfast Newsletter. Belfast, Northern Ireland. 5 May 1863 to Caroline Maud Chapman (1839-1882) and secondly in 1884 to Alice Probyn (died 1930).

Among these are seven Masses, two requiems, and sketches for two additional Masses and one requiem. The three early Masses, composed between 1842 and 1844 during Bruckner's stay in Windhaag and Kronstorf, were short Austrian ' (country Masses)Österreichisches Musiklexicon online: Landmesse for use in local churches. The lost Requiem for men's choir and organ, composed in 1845, the Requiem in D minor, composed in 1849, and the Missa solemnis, composed in 1854, were composed during Bruckner's stay in Sankt Florian. The three Masses, Mass No. 1 in D minor, Mass No. 2 in E minor and Mass No. 3 in F minor, which Bruckner composed after eight years of study with Simon Sechter and Otto Kitzler, are the most advanced and elaborate of these compositions.  Windhaag and Kronstorf  During his stay as schoolteacher's assistant in Windhaag (3 October 1841 - 23 January 1843) and Kronstorf (23 January 1843 - 23 September 1845), Bruckner composed three Landmessen, the Windhaager Messe, the Kronstorfer Messe and the Messe für den Gründonnerstag. These Masses were intentionally simple, because they were intended for the meagre resources of the local village churches.J. Williamson, p. 43 *The Windhaager Messe in C major (WAB 25) is a Choral-Messe for alto soloist, two horns and organ, which Bruckner composed in 1842 during his stay in Windhaag. *The Kronstorfer Messe (WAB 146) in D minor is a Missa brevis for mixed choir a cappella, which Bruckner composed in 1843-1844 during his next stay in Kronstorf. *The Messe für den Gründonnerstag (WAB 9) in F major is another Missa brevis for mixed choir a cappella, which Bruckner composed in 1844 during his stay in Kronstorf. The extra Kyrie and Gloria, composed in 1845, are lost.U. Harten, p. 245C. Van Zwol, p. 700 During this period () Bruckner also composed a 17-bar sketch for the Kyrie in G minor of a Missa pro Quadragesima (Mass for Lent) for mixed choir, three trombones and organ (WAB 140).R. Haas, p. 42C. van Zwol, p. 710U. Harten, p. 288 Theses compositions are put in Band XXI of the '.Gesamtausgabe - Kleine Kirchenmusikwerke  Sankt Florian  Between 23 September 1845 and 24 December 1855, during his stay as organist in Sankt Florian, Bruckner composed a lost requiem, the Requiem in D minor and the Missa solemnis. * Requiem (WAB 133), for men's choir and organ, a lost work composed in 1845 for the funeral of Johann Nepomuk Deschl.U. Harten, p. 350 * Requiem (WAB 39) in D minor, for mixed choir, soloists, three trombones, one horn, strings and organ, composed in 1849 for the death anniversary of Franz Sailer. * Missa solemnis (WAB 29) in B-flat minor, for mixed choir, soloists, orchestra and organ, composed in 1854 for Friedrich Mayer's installation. In Bruckner composed also a 58-bar sketch for the Kyrie of another Mass in E-flat major (WAB 139), intended for mixed choir, 2 oboes, 3 trombones, strings and organ.U. Harten, pp. 287-288 The similarity to Mozart's early Masses was possibly the reason why Bruckner broke off the composition of the Mass. A recording of the sketch using notation software can be heard on John Berky's website.A Chance to Hear Bruckner's Kyrie in Es-Dur  Linz  In the 1860s, after the end of Sechter's and Kitzler's tuition, Bruckner composed successively the three numbered Masses, No.1 in D minor, No. 2 in E minor and No. 3 in F minor. * The Mass No. 1 (WAB 26), in D minor, composed in 1864, is scored for soloists, mixed choir, organ and orchestra. * The Mass No. 2 (WAB 27), in E minor, composed in 1866 to celebrate the accomplishment of the construction of the Votive Chapel of the new cathedral of Linz, is scored for eight-voice mixed choir and a small group of wind instruments. * The Mass No. 3 (WAB 28), in F minor, composed in 1868 and intended for a performance in the Hofkapelle, is scored for soloists, mixed choir, organ ad libitum and orchestra. This Mass, which was clearly meant for concert, rather than liturgical performance, is the only one of Bruckner's Masses in which the first line of the Gloria and of the Credo are set to music. The composition of the Mass in F minor may have been influenced by Schubert's late Mass No. 5 in A flat major and Mass No. 6 in E flat major.P. Hawkshaw  Vienna  In 1875, during his stay in Vienna, Bruckner drafted an 18-bar sketch for the Introit of another requiem in D minor (WAB 141). The bass-ostinato of the fragment is similar to that of the \\"nullified\\" Symphony in D minor and the Te Deum.

First hired armed cutter Nile The first hired armed cutter Nile was of 136 tons (burthen}. She carried ten 12-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder bow guns. Her contract ran from 29 March 1799 to 21 November 1801.Winfield (2008), p.389. From at least May her commander was Lieutenant George Argles. On 17 November, Captain Sir Richard Strachan in chased a French convoy in to the Morbihan where it sheltered under the protection of shore batteries and the 20-gun corvette Réolaise. Lieutenant Argles skillful maneuvered Nile, as the first British vessel up, and kept the corvette from the north shore. was then able to force the corvette onto the shore at Port Navale, though she got off again.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.58. The hired armed cutter Suworow then towed in four boats with Lieutenant Hennah of and a cutting-out party of seamen and marines. Nile and the hired armed cutter Lurcher towed in four more boats from Magicienne. Although the cutting-out party landed under heavy fire of grape and musketry, it was able to set the corvette on fire; shortly thereafter she blew up. Only one British seaman, a crewman from Suworow, was killed; seven men from Captain were wounded.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.507-8. However, Suworow's sails and rigging were so badly cut up that Captain had to tow her.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.529. Nile captured a merchant vessel that was then burnt. Nile and Argeles captured the brig Assistance, A.H. Stark, master, on 12 October 1800. This was the Swedish brig Assistansen, Alex Stark, master, that had been sailing from Bayonne to Stockholm with a cargo of rosin and that Nile brought into Plymouth on 22 October.London Chronicle, Vol. 87, p.400. About three weeks later, on 13 November, Nile and Lurcher captured the French brig Prothee. Five days later they captured a French privateer brig of 14 guns.The Naval chronicle, Vol. 4, p.518. On 7 December, Nile discovered a convoy of 15 or 16 small vessels coming round the point of Croisic near the mouth of the river Vilaine in Quiberon Bay. Lurcher joined Nile and together the two cutters captured or destroyed nine vessels at a cost of only one man wounded on Lurcher, despite fire from shore batteries. The four largest were decked and Argles believed that they could be sailed back to England. The others were not. The four largest had been sailing from Boulogne to Brest with cargoes of brandy and wine. They were: *Aimable François, of 55 tons, Geldo Bouligan, master; *Maria Joseph, of 48 tons, Pierre Midago, master; *St Pierre, of 39 tons, Pierre Hoeck, master; and lastly, *Notre Dame De Consolation, of 36 tons, Clouarie, master. On 8 February 1801 Nile came into Plymouth from Quiberon with the officers of , which had wrecked there, with no loss of life. However, the French had captured 20 of her men when they reached shore. Nile went in with a flag of truce to ascertain their fate. rescued those crew members of Requin that the French hadn't captured.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p. 182. Earlier during this cruise, Lieutenant Argles and Nile drove on shore a cutter of sixteen 12-pounders and a lugger of twelve 9-pounders. Heavy fire from shore batteries prevented Nile from recovering them. At high tide the French were able to recover the two vessels, though fire from Nile had damaged them badly, and take them into Morbihan.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p. 182. Around this time Argeles received promotion to the rank of Commander. Lieutenant T. Newton replaced him in command of Nile.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.183. On 13 May Newton brought Nile into Plymouth after a two-hour battle with a French 16-cutter in Douarnenez Bay. The French vessel, which had a large number of soldiers aboard, eventually took refuge under the guns of a large shore battery. Both vessels were much damaged and Nile suffered one man wounded. Newton believed that the French cutter had tried to disable Niles rigging so that it could come up with and take her by boarding.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.460. Nile shared with , , and the hired armed cutter Flirt in the proceeds of the capture of San Pedro D'Alcantare. San Pedro D'Alcantare was captured on 27 July 1801. On the same day Nile also captured Egalité. In August 1801, Niles boats attempted to cut out a French brig sheltering in Douarnenez Bay Bay. A musket shot killed Newton and the fire from shore batteries was so intense that the boats withdrew, giving up their attempt.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.165. On 19 November 1801 Nile departed Torbay for Plymouth to be paid off. 1803 Nile may have been the cutter Nile, of 135 tons (bm), 30 men, and twelve 6 & 12-pounder guns, whose master, Solomon Bellevill jnr., received a letter of marque on 11 June 1803.– Letter of Marque against the United States. Accessed 20 December 2016. In August the privateer Success, of Jersey, and the cutter Nile, of Hastings, captured Union, Pancen, master. Union had been sailing from Cayenne to France. Union was off Hastings by 21 August.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10.Lloyd's List №4379. Second hired armed cutter Nile The second hired armed cutter Nile had a burthen of 166 tons. She carried ten 12-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder bow guns. Her contract ran from 30 May 1804 to 1 March 1805. In 1804 she was renamed Phyllis. In 1806 she resumed the name Nile and served a second contract, this time from 18 February 1806 to 12 December 1806.Winfield (2008), p.393. 1804 Nile, under the command of Lieutenant John Nugent, recaptured several vessels in 1804: Excellent (21 June), Mary of Newcastle (6 July), and Providence (7 July). Excellent, Davis, master, had been sailing from Carmarthen to London when a French privateer captured her. After Nile recaptured her, Nile sent her into Ramsgate.Lloyd's List №4465. A French privateer had captured Mary, which had been sailing from Emsworth to Hull, and Providence, Lownsbro, master, which had been sailing from Jersey to Petersburg. Nile, operating out of Hastings, had recaptured them near Bordeaux.Lloyd's List №4474. On 23 July Nile recaptured Albion. Then on 3 September Nile captured Nostra Senora del Bon Voiage. While in command of Nile, Nugent chased a praam on shore off Fecamp, recaptured five brigs, and drove on shore and destroyed, off St. Valery, the French lugger Etoile.Allen (1853), p.95. 1806 On the evening of 14 January 1806 two French privateers anchored themselves off the harbour at Dover. The Sea Fencibles went to man their batteries, only to have sentinels turn them away. The commanding general, Lord Forbes, was away at Canterbury and the sentinels would not permit the Fencibles to proceed without his permission.Grocott (1797), pp. 208-9. At the same time Nile was in the harbour, and under the command of Thomas Johnson. A concerned citizen asked him why he did not set out to chase them away. The Times quoted him as saying: The Times went on to comment: A few months later Nile captured the American brig Truxton on 20 April. Then she captured the French chasse maree Elizabeth 30 June and the sloop Susannah Margaretta on 14 July. This may be the cutter Nile that the Royal Navy purchased and registered on 3 November 1806.

Predominantly an outside right, Rolfe was also known for his versatility which allowed him to play in many different positions for the likes of Liverpool, Chester and Crewe Alexandra.  Liverpool  Aged 15, Rolfe was spotted playing for adult side Eastham Athletic in the West Cheshire League by Liverpool Scout Keith Peters. Rolfe attended training and manager George Kay was impressed enough to pay a visit to Rolfe's home in the City Centre Tenements and sign him up.http://www.scottiepress.org/gallery/hocross.htm Rolfe progressed well through the B and A teams and was picked regularly for the Liverpool County Youth Team which selected the best young players from Liverpool, Everton and other local clubs. Rolfe was part of the County team that reached the semi finals of the FA Youth Cup in 1950. Rolfe's progress was halted at the age of 18 due to National Service. Whilst on duty in Germany, Rolfe spent his time as a PT Instructor and played for local side Munster 08. On passing out of the Army, Rolfe returned to Anfield and was signed as a full-time professional by new manager Don Welsh. Rolfe became a regular in the Reserves but struggled to shift the likes of Billy Liddell, Albert Stubbins, Bob Paisley and Ronnie Moran from the First Team. The absence of modern-day features of the game such as substitutes, the League Cup and squad rotation hindered his chances of breaking into the side and he left to join Chester in 1953.  Chester  Rolfe became a regular at the Sealand Road and his performances were not going unnoticed. Interest started to arrive from larger clubs, including Sheffield Wednesday, with manager Harry Catterick attempting to strike a deal to take both Rolfe and fellow ex-Liverpool player Johnny Molyneux to Hillsborough. However, Chester were not prepared to give up their main assets lightly and the pair stayed with The Blues. Rolfe played for Chester in the Final of the Welsh Cup in 1954 but finished up with a runners up medal after his side went down 2–0 to Flint Town in front of 15,000 people at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham.  Crewe Alexandra, Barrow and Non-League  In 1955, Rolfe left to join Crewe Alexandra and spent three seasons at Gresty Road, racking up over 100 games, including a run of 71 consecutive starts. In 1958 Rolfe was transferred to Barrow in exchange for goalkeeper Jerry Lowery. While at Barrow, who were then an established Football League club, Tranmere Rovers manager Peter Farrell, an ex-Republic of Ireland international, allowed Rolfe to train with the Prenton Park club on a daily basis due to the long distance between Barrow and his Liverpool home. Rolfe left after just one season with the Bluebirds before enjoying spells with various Non-League teams such as Buxton, Runcorn, New Brighton and Holyhead. Rolfe played in numerous Testimonials and Charity Games and on occasion featured in teams with the likes of Bert Trautmann and Sir Tom Finney.
