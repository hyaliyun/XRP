It is named after the Polynesian path to the underworld. Mahiki was opened in October 2006 by Piers Adam and Nick House.Say Cheese. Daily Candy. 25 October 2006.Mahiki opens Park Lane whisky club for bankers in their 40s. Evening Standard. Benedict Moore-Bridger. 9 June 2008. The club has attracted media attention as a favourite haunt of royals including Princes William and Harry and celebrities such as Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Kelly Rowland, and Paris Hilton. Its themed Thursday nights, hosted by Henry Conway, a socialite, were particularly popular, and rival club owner Charlie Gilkes has said \\"Thursday nights at Mahiki ... are the night in London, there are queues going round the block.\\" Hooray Henry! Loving the limelight. The Independent. Henry Deedes. 8 May 2008 About the club Inside Mahiki, June 2008 The club was opened at 1, Dover Street in 2006 (the site of an earlier nightclub) by Piers Adam, David Phelps and Nick House. Mahiki is a nightclub and bar, with a Polynesian and tiki theme, predominantly specialising in rum. Mahiki claims that it adheres to a mostly open door policy. Its co-founder Nick House has said \\"The vision with Mahiki is that whether you're fat, thin, bald, ugly or old, you can get in. Admittedly, when it gets to 11pm, it might be more difficult. But certainly, until it reaches capacity, anyone can get in.\\" Some papers have attributed its popularity with London's upper class in part to promotions manager Guy Pelly, who is a close friend of Princes William and Harry.Model 'raped' at nightclub popular with young Royals. The Telegraph. Aislinn Simpson. 9 July 2008. For a time, Mahiki was managed by Jack Brooksbank, who later married Princess Eugenie.  The Mahiki brand = Other clubs = A Mahiki club in Dubai, located at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, opened in 2011 and closed in 2018, due to ‚Äúunforeseen circumstances during the renovation‚Äù of the hotel, as stated by the owners at the time. In 2017, Mahiki's owners further expanded and franchised the brand. In the course of that year, Mahiki Clubs have opened in Marbella, Spain, in the Forte Village Resort in Sardinia, in Manchester (in collaboration with Gary Neville's company GG Hospitality Management Ltd. , closed in 2018, reopened in 2019) and at a second London location (Mahiki Kensington, closed in 2019). There is also a Mahiki club in Gothenburg, Sweden. = Branded liquors = In 2003, a line of three rum blends exclusively sold at Selfridges (not available anymore) was released under the Mahiki brand. Mahiki Coconut, the club's branded rum coconut liqueur, was first introduced in 2011. In 2017, it was relaunched with a new bottle design by fashion designer Henry Holland, as Mahiki Coconut Rum. The liqueur is described as ‚Äûrefined with Jamaican and Polynesian rum and rounded off with Samoan coconuts‚Äú. Later that year, Mahiki introduced three ready-to- drink canned cocktails adapted from cocktails on the Mahiki menu (Treasure Chest, Pina Colada and Coconut Grenade). For production of the beverage range, Mahiki partnered with Diageo; marketing and distribution were overseen by the UK drinks distributor Cellar Trends. Since 2018, international production and packaging of the Mahiki beverage portfolio is managed by the German drinks distributor MBG Group. For the UK, MBG has signed a new distribution agreement with Cellar Trends. MBG has launched the Mahiki drinks range ‚Äì with some changes in product design ‚Äì on the German market, in Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and Spain in 2019. The original canned pre-mixes were replaced with the new products ‚ÄûMahiki Coconut Pineapple Cocktail‚Äú and ‚ÄûMahiki Coconut Maracuja Cocktail‚Äú. In the six months period after the launch on the German retail market, more than 100.000 bottles of the rum liqueur have been sold. Later in 2019, a rum coconut liqueur with cream (‚ÄûMahiki White Coconut‚Äú) was added to the Mahiki range. New pre-mixes (‚ÄûMahiki White Coconut Pina Colada‚Äú and ‚ÄûMahiki White Coconut Cherry Coconut‚Äú) were introduced in June 2020.  Ownership  The London Mahiki club is operated by Mahiki Ltd. (owners are Piers Adam and David Phelps). The Mahiki brand was originally registered to Taihiti Ltd. and is now owned by Tiki Brands Holding Ltd. (Piers Adam is listed as the owner of both companies). In 2018, the German drinks distributor MBG announced the acquisition of a 34,44 percent share in Taihiti Inc. , together with the production licence for the Mahiki Coconut Rum beverages and exclusive distribution rights for the entire Mahiki range in Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands. Since May 2019, Andreas Herb, the managing director of MBG, is the sole director of Tiki Brands Holding Ltd. A confirmation statement published in 2020 lists Piers Adam and MBG as the main shareholders of Tiki Brands Holding Ltd., with a 34,44 percent stake each.

It presents itself as a history of the troubadours. Today it is regarded as largely fantasy, though nuggets of historical truth remain. Nostredame lists three sources for his accounts, but none of these survive. In the eighteenth century Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni was influenced by Nostredame, but in the twentieth, Camille Chabaneau and Joseph Anglade showed definitively that most of Nostredame cannot be corroborated.

When they were older, she met Fritz and they instantly fell in love with each other. But Ruth also wants Fritz. She told them she would kill herself if Fritz would not marry her. So Barbara again gave way and made Fritz marry Ruth even with a heavy heart. She stayed in the States as a hospital nurse, but one day she received a call from the Philippines saying that Ruth killed herself and it was witnessed by her only daughter Karen. She quickly came to the country to mourn with her stepmother and to take care of her currently unstable niece. But when she arrived, strange things start to happen. It seems that Ruth killed herself because of her paranoia that her husband is seeing Barbara in the States during his business trips. Ruth always knew that Fritz will always love Barbara and not her. To exact revenge on Barbara, she haunts the house through the doll, Chelsea and through her own daughter. She hurts and even kills all the people that are dear to Barbara until there is nobody left but Barbara herself.

Investigators discovered the accident was caused by the failure of a main rotor blade. Accident The 22-year-old helicopter was flying at an altitude of about when workers on the Global Santa Fe Monarch heard \\"a loud bang\\". No witnesses were actually watching the aircraft at the time, but some saw it dive steeply into the sea. A witness also reported seeing the helicopter's rotor head with rotor blades attached falling into the sea after the body of the helicopter had impacted. The accident caused the death of all those on board (two crew members and nine Shell workers as passengers). The body of the eleventh man has never been recovered. Search and rescue The rig Standby Vessel, Putford Achilles, which was about from the location immediately launched its two fast rescue craft, which recovered four bodies and some floating debris. The search was continued, resulting in the recovery of another body. Great Yarmouth Coastguard launched rescue helicopters and other vessels arrived on the scene that night, but no survivors or further bodies were recovered from the surface of the sea. An underwater search for the six missing bodies began on 17 July, the debris field was located in of water by a remotely operated vehicle from the vessel Kommandor Subsea on 19 July. The Diving Support Vessel Mayo arrived later that day and began the recovery of bodies and wreckage, five more bodies being retrieved. An underwater search for the remaining missing body was eventually halted on 23 July. A surface vessel search was maintained for two more days and an aerial search until 30 July, without success. Investigation The wreckage, which included the helicopter's flight data recorder, was brought ashore at Great Yarmouth on 21 July, and transferred to an Air Accidents Investigation Branch facility near Aldershot, Hampshire, where it was examined by investigators from the AAIB, the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, the aircraft manufacturer, and the operator. =Cause= The audio recordings from the Cockpit voice recorder revealed that the crew were unaware of any significant abnormality until the flight from the Clipper platform to the Monarch platform. About 4.5 minutes into this flight, they discussed an increase in vibration. The non-handling pilot carried out a \\"rotor track and balance\\" procedure; the increase in vibration did not cause the crew any immediate concern and the procedure was carried out to enable the Integrated Health and Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) to log rotor track and balance data for later analysis. Frequency spectrum analysis of the audio recordings indicated an increase in the amplitude of frequencies associated with main rotor vibration towards the end of the recording. The recording ended abruptly with three unusual, probably structure-borne, sounds. Wreckage analysis showed that, while three of the main rotor blades exhibited only superficial damage, the fourth was fractured at a position approximately from the blade root, while the main rotor gearbox's casing was also fractured. Neither the gearbox nor the rotor head could be recovered. The rotor blade, which had been manufactured in March 1981, had been struck by lightning in 1999, when it was repaired by the manufacturer and returned to service. After the accident, the AAIB and the helicopter's manufacturer, Stratford, Connecticut-based Sikorsky Aircraft, reached the opinion that the electrical energy imparted by the lightning strike in 1999 exploited an anomaly that was built into the blade at manufacture and damaged the spar. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch report stated that the manufacturers should have noticed the error, unless it was permitted by concession. Aftermath Shell suspended North Sea helicopter flights by the operator for six weeks after the accident until 3 September 2002. The inquest into the deaths opened on 31 October at the Great Yarmouth Coroner's Court and the jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death on 2 November 2005 on the basis of an AAIB report finalised during that year. Earlier, in late 2003, the company Bristow had agreed to a compensation deal for five children, whose fathers were killed in the crash. The names of the deceased are engraved on a glass porch in St Nicholas Church, Great Yarmouth. In 2007, a Norwich coroner's officer launched legal action over claims he suffered stress following the tragedy, claiming compensation, stating he received insufficient support at the time of the incident and in its aftermath. A Norfolk police spokesman confirmed the traumatic nature of the 2002 incident for all those involved, the more so since it had occurred on the eve of a one-day general strike of council's workers in the UK and two days before a royal visit to Norwich.

Ro√±o and written by Ricardo Lee. It is a remake of the 1974 horror film by Celso Ad. Castillo. Plot Being the loving older sister, Barbara (Lorna Tolentino) has always been overly indulgent of her little sister Ruth's every whim. Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him. Her past comes back to haunt her (in more ways than one) when Barbara receives news that her younger sister has killed herself and was witnessed by Ruth's only daughter Karen (Antoinette Taus). Barbara immediately returns to the Philippines to mourn her sister and comfort her unstable niece. But strange events happen upon Barbara's return and she learns the reason surrounding Ruth's mysterious death. Throughout their marriage, Ruth felt that Nick never really loved her, but instead still harboured feelings for her sister. In a state of paranoid delusion, she suspects that Nick was having an affair and used his business trips to the United States as an excuse to rendezvous with Barbara. In a jealous rage, she commits suicide and haunts the household and everyone she deemed who have wronged her. It was later revealed that ever since Barbara left her for the US, she indulged herself of everything that can ease her helplessness which includes witchcraft and spiritual medium sessions. Through this she learned that even after death she can return to the world of the living on a limited time to haunt and exact revenge on anyone she wants. Maestra Beatriz, whom Barbara sought advise and also was responsible for teaching Ruth black magic offered help and have tried to make contact with her tormented soul via spiritual session together with Barbara and her maid. During this session Ruth possessed her only child and manages to kill the old woman. Through an act of sacrifice, Maestra Beatriz manages to drive away Ruth's spirit. All seems well, until Barbara and Nick learned that what happened during Barbara's encounter with Ruth's spirit was only temporary and now, since it was the 9th day of Ruth's passing, she now have grown more powerful and with the help of evil spirits whom she now have given purpose. Ruth appears and manages to convince Barbara to join her in the world of the tormented souls until Nick arrives just in time and instead sacrificed himself by holding the physical manifestation of Ruth and plunging both themselves to the fiery pits of hell.

Life Kanaga was born on May 25, 1894 in Astoria, Oregon,Cf. the second child of Amos Ream Kanaga and Mathilda Carolina Hartwig. Her father was a successful lawyer and judge in Ohio. After moving to Astoria he became the district attorney for the city, and he also traveled widely, often leaving his family behind with little notice. After they moved to California in 1915 her mother became a real estate broker, a highly unusual occupation for a woman at that time. The last name \\"Kanaga\\" is of Swiss origin, and a family genealogy traces its roots back at least 250 years. She spelled her first name \\"Consuela,\\" at least in the 1920s and '30s, but it is generally listed now as Consuelo, a more common Spanish name. Her middle name \\"Delesseps\\" is said to have come from her mother's admiration for Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French diplomat and developer of the Suez Canal. In 1911 the family moved from Oregon to Larkspur in Marin County, California. In 1915 Kanaga got a job as a reporter, feature writer and part-time photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle. Dorothea Lange later said that Kanaga was the first female newspaper photographer she had ever encountered. It was there that she discovered Alfred Stieglitz's journal Camera Work and decided to become a photographer. Lange encouraged her to take up photography as a career and introduced her to the growing San Francisco Bay Area community of artistic photographers, notably Anne Brigman, Edward Weston, Francis Brugui√®re, and Louise Dahl-Wolf. In 1919 she married mining engineer Evans Davidson, but they separated within two years. In 1922 she moved to New York in order to work as a photojournalist for the New York American newspaper. While in New York a co-worker at the newspaper, Donald Litchfield, introduced her to Alfred Stieglitz. Stieglitz worked with Kanaga to help transform her vision from photojournalism to a more artistic photographic style. By March 1923 she was living with Litchfield, although at the time she had not yet divorced Davidson. In 1924 she and Litchfield moved to California, living at times near Santa Cruz, San Francisco and Los Angeles. By the end of the year she had finalized divorce proceedings against Davidson, and she became engaged to Litchfield. The engagement lasted only six months, however, and by the end of the year they were no longer a couple. In 1926 she met Tina Modotti, who was visiting San Francisco, and she put together a small exhibition of Modotti's photographs at the Kanaga Studio on Post Street. Aided by art patron Albert Bender, she began planning a prolonged \\"tour\\" of Europe, and in 1927 she spent the latter part of the year traveling and photographing in France, Germany, Hungary and Italy. While there she met up with Dahl, and the two of them spent many weeks traveling together. While traveling to Tunisia in January 1928, she met James Barry McCarthy, an Irish writer and ex- pilot, and by March they were married. In May they returned to New York City and took up residence there. Kanaga initially found work as a photographic retoucher, but within a few months she had her own darkroom and was printing the first of her many photos from Europe. In 1930 she and McCarthy moved to San Francisco, and soon she was re-established in the photographic community there. In 1931 she met and began to employ African-American Eluard Luchell McDaniels, a young \\"man-of-all-trades\\" who worked for her as a handyman and chauffeur. She began to photograph him around her home, and as they talked she became captivated by the plight of African-Americans and their continuing fight against racism. Soon she was devoting much of her photography to images of African-Americans, their homes and their culture. in 1932 she was invited by Weston and Ansel Adams to participate in the famous Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, and she showed four prints. There is some confusion about whether Kanaga should actually be called a \\"member\\" of Group f/64. The announcement for the show at the de Young Museum listed seven photographers in Group f/64 and said \\"From time to time various other photographers will be asked to display their work with Group f/64. Those invited for the first showing are: Preston Holder, Consuela Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, Brett Weston.\\" However, in 1934 the group posted a notice in Camera Craft magazine that said \\"The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, Imogene [sic] Cunningham, Consuela Kanaga and several others.\\" In an interview later in her life, Kanaga herself said \\"I was in that f/64 show with Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke and Ansel Adams, but I wasn't in a group, nor did I belong to anything ever. I wasn't a belonger.\\" In 1935 she moved back to New York without McCarthy, and the two apparently were divorced sometime that year. She began plans for a portfolio of African Americans and interviewed several families in Harlem with whom she hoped to live while documenting their lives. While there she encountered painter Wallace Putnam, whom she had met the last time she lived in New York. Within three months they were married. They spent part of their honeymoon visiting Alfred Stieglitz at his home at Lake George. In 1938 she joined the Photo League, where she lectured a new generation of artistic photographers and became the leader of the Documentary Group projects, including Neighborhoods of New York.Consuelo Kanaga bio at The Jewish Museum Her photographs were printed in progressive publications of the time, including New Masses, Labor Defender, and Sunday Worker.Kanaga Untitled (Tenements, New York) at The Jewish Museum (New York) By 1940 she found teaching too restrictive, and she returned to taking photographs full time. She was actively photographing and exhibiting throughout the 1940s, 50s and 60s. In the latter decade she became very active in civil rights, and she took part in and photographed many demonstrations and marches. In 1963 she was arrested in Albany, Georgia during the Walk for Peace. She finally seemed to have found the right romantic and creative partner in Putnam, and the two of them remained together for the rest of her life. They traveled frequently and spent the last half of the 1960s going back and forth to France. A review published in The New York Times described that \\"She continued to work into her 70s, despite suffering from emphysema and cancer, which were probably caused by the chemicals used in creating her prints. Her body of work, though comparatively small, is consistently exceptional. Consuelo Kanaga died virtually unknown on February 28, 1978, but her talent endures.\\" Her entire estate amounted to $1,345 in photographic equipment, almost 2,500 negatives and 375 prints. Everything else she had given away to friends. Photography Consuelo Kanaga has been called \\"one of America's most transcendent yet, surprisingly, least-known photographers.\\" She had a wide range of visual interests, from pictorialism to photojournalism to portraiture to cityscape to still lifes. It's been said that the dominant theme in her work is an \\"abiding interest in, and engagement with, the American scene.\\" She celebrated the human in every photo she took, whether it was images of sharecroppers and their homes in the South or found still lifes of flowers and curtains. She was also noted as a technician of the highest skills in the darkroom. Her portraiture included many well-known artists and writers of the 1930s and '40s, including Milton Avery, Morris Kantor, Wharton Esherick, Mark Rothko and W. Eugene Smith. Kanaga, who was white, was one of the few photographers in the 1930s to produce artistic portraits of black people. Significantly, the four prints she contributed to the first Group f/64 exhibition were all portraits of blacks, including two of Eluard Luchell McDaniel, whom she would photograph repeatedly in ensuing years.Charles Hagen, \\"Photography/Review: Images of Blacks When They were Mostly Invisible,\\" New York Times, 10 December 1993 Kanaga also photographed black writers and intellectuals, among them Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen. In 1949 she was included in the very important show 50 Photographs by 50 Photographers: Landmarks in Photographic History at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. = Family of Man = Kanaga's best-known image, \\"She Is a Tree of Life to Them,\\" Los Angeles County Museum of Art- New Acquisitions was given its title by Edward Steichen when he selected it for the landmark Family of Man exhibition in 1955. The picture, from a study of migrant workers in Florida, portrays a slender black woman, framed against a white wall, who gathers her children to her with a tender gesture. She continued photographing through the 1960s, including a series of photographs of civil rights demonstrations in Albany, Georgia in 1963. In 1974 Kanaga had a one-person exhibition at the Lerner-Heller Gallery in New York and in 1976, a small but important retrospective at The Brooklyn Museum. In 1977 she had an exhibition at Wave Hill, Riverdale, New York, followed by participation in an historical exhibition of the original f.64 group of photographers at the University of Missouri. On October 15, 1993 the first major retrospective of Consuelo Kanagas work was held at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition was titled, Consuelo Kanaga: An American Photographer and ran until February 27, 1994. The exhibition contained approximately 120 gelatin silver prints, many of which had never been seen before or published. They were all drawn from a cache of more than 2000 negatives and 340 prints left to the Brooklyn Museum in 1982 by the artists husband and painter, Wallace Putnam. A fully illustrated catalogue published by the Brooklyn Museum in association with University of Washington Press accompanied the exhibition. The publication included an introduction by William Maxwell and essays by Barbara Head Millstein and Sarah M. Lowe. About her work, she said: > I could have done lots more, put in much more work and developed more > pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple > things like a little picture in the window or the corner of the studio or an > old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very > much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always > said, \\"What have you got to say?\\" I think in a few small cases I've said a > few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or > the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is > what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. > A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to > eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one > true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers. Gallery File:Consuelo Kanaga (American, 1894-1978).

Alexander was of Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian and Persian ancestry. He was the son of the Herodian Prince, later king Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli. His father in the spring of 58 was crowned as king of Armenia by Roman Emperor Nero in Rome and ruled until 63\\\\. Alexander had a sister called Julia, who married the Anatolian Roman Senator Marcus Plancius Varus. Alexander's paternal grandparents were the Judean Prince Alexander and his unnamed wife. Through his father, Alexander was the great-grandson of Cappadocian Princess Glaphyra and Judean Prince Alexander. He was the great-great-grandson of king Archelaus of Cappadocia, king of Judea Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne. Alexander along with his sister and father were the last of the known descendants of the kings of Cappadocia. Prior to the year 58, little is known on Alexander's life. He was an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that he attempted to exert influence on Judean Politics. Tigranes had arranged with king Antiochus IV of Commagene, who he was an ally to when he was crowned king, to marry Alexander to Antiochus' daughter Julia Iotapa. The betrothal was held in Rome after Tigranes' coronation. The marriage was mostly a political alliance that occurred between the fathers of Alexander, Iotapa and possibly Nero. After the betrothal, Nero crowned Alexander and Iotapa as Roman client rulers of the small Cilician region of Cetis, that had previously been ruled by Alexander's Seleucid ancestors, his ancestor Archelaus of Cappadocia, the son of this, Archelaus of Cilicia, and Antiochus IV. The Cilician city of Elaiussa Sebaste was made a part of their kingdom. Alexander and Iotapa ruled Cetis from 58 until at least 72\\\\. Little is known on the marriage and reign of Alexander and Iotapa. Iotapa bore Alexander three children: two sons Gaius Julius Agrippa, Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus and a daughter Julia Iotapa. Their children were born and raised in Cetis. A possible descendant from their marriage was the usurper Jotapianus, who lived in the 3rd century. His name and the names Alexander gave his sons indicate that their family connections from the Herodian Dynasty were not wholly broken. In Vespasian‚Äôs reign (69-79) or Titus‚Äô reign (79-81), Alexander had entered the Roman Senate; had reached and served either as a suffect consul during Trajan‚Äôs reign before 109.

He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain. Early life and career Winder was born in the town of Easton in Talbot County, Maryland, a nephew of future U.S. naval officer Franklin Buchanan and a second cousin to future Confederate general John H. Winder. He attended St. John's College, also located in Maryland. Then in 1846 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated 22nd of 44 cadets in 1850. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. Exactly a year after leaving West Point, Winder was promoted to second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery on July 1, 1851.Eicher, p. 757. Winder served as the 3rd's Regimental Adjutant from April 4, 1854 to March 3, 1855, with a promotion to first lieutenant coming on April 5, 1854. In 1854, while en route to California, the vessel on which he was aboard, the San Francisco, was struck by a hurricane. For his valor in the face of this crisis, Winder was promoted to captain in the 9th U.S. Infantry on March 3, 1855, at the relatively young age of twenty-six. He later saw action against Native Americans in the Washington Territory. At the outbreak of hostilities between North and South, he resigned from the Army in 1861.Freeman, p. 326. Civil War service Winder resigned his U.S. Army commission on April 1, 1861, and was appointed a captain of artillery in the Confederate Army on March 16, and then quickly promoted to major later that day. He was appointed colonel of the 6th South Carolina Infantry on July 8, leading it to prominence in the Confederate army. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 1, 1862, and assigned to the Shenandoah Valley under the command of Stonewall Jackson. Having recently court-martialed Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett, Jackson placed Winder in command of his old brigade. This, combined with Winder's reputation as a strict disciplinarian, was widely resented by both the officers and men now under him. In fact, so general was the feeling of animosity toward him, by August 1862 it was widely rumored Winder would be shot by one of his own men in the next battle.Krick, p. 19 =Cedar Mountain and death= Approximate location at Cedar Mountain battlefield where Gen. Winder was standing when mortally wounded by a Union shell. Facing south. On August 9, 1862, Winder led his men into battle at Cedar Mountain, on the left flank of the Confederate line. He did so despite having been ill for several days, and in defiance of a surgeon's order to rest. He was personally directing the fire of a battery when a Union shell struck him in his left side, horribly mangling him. Borne to the rear on a stretcher, Winder died later that evening.Krick, pp. 96, 377. Winder's body was initially buried in nearby Orange Court House, before being disinterred and transported to Richmond. There, a state funeral was given in his honor, followed by re-interment at Hollywood Cemetery. Three years later, his family had his body again removed, this time to be permanently buried in the family cemetery at Wye House, located near his birthplace of Easton, Maryland.Krick, pp. 377-78.

North Shore Rescue is a non-profit organization dedicated to wilderness search and rescue around Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It consists of a team of approximately 40 volunteers who perform an average of 79Emergency Management British Columbia Incident Summaries average incidents 2003 to 2010 including mutual aid search and rescue operations each year, mostly in the rugged, steep, and thickly forested North Shore Mountains. North Shore Rescue assists hikers, skiers, snowshoers, mountain bikers, and others who are reported to be lost or in distress. It also provides education on mountain safety, and some services in urban search and rescue. History North Shore Rescue formed in September 1965, originally with the intention of preparing to assist in the event of an urban nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. After the threats of the Cold War subsided, the group transitioned to wilderness search and rescue tasks. The team has since been involved in more than 1000 mountain search and rescue operations. Injuries or deaths were involved in approximately 25% of calls. As extreme sports and other wilderness activities have become more popular in the region, the need for rescues has risen dramatically, with call volume tripling between 1995 and 2005. North Shore Rescue members perform a rescue training exercise on a vertical cliff. Operations North Shore Rescue volunteers respond at the discretion of police, often after family members or friends call 9-1-1 to report that someone has failed to return from an outing in the mountains. Because the North Shore Mountains are very close to Vancouver, the dangers of their terrain and weather are often underestimated. Underpreparation and recklessness are factors in many incidents. In addition to searching on foot, the team sometimes uses a Helicopter Flight Rescue System, in which a volunteer is lowered from a helicopter via a rope to evacuate a stranded and/or injured person. The team has an annual budget of approximately $250,000, which covers team equipment, fuel, and medical supplies. Its budget is covered in part by government funding, however the organization also relies on fundraising and private donations. All operations are provided free of charge to the lost or injured persons involved. The group's position is based in the belief that charging for rescues could encourage people to delay in calling for assistance, and even occasionally lead to subjects hiding from rescuers in order to avoid being charged. The group concentrates its efforts in the 480 km2 area of the North Shore Mountains near Vancouver. However, its skills and equipment are occasionally called into play by other agencies looking for missing persons. Sgt. Ron Fairweather of the Vancouver Police Department has said, \\"They're an awesome unit, the equipment they have is phenomenal. We don't have the extent of equipment they have access to. And their expertise is second to none.\\" Volunteers The all-volunteer team is made up of highly skilled hikers, mountaineers and backcountry skiers, some of whom dedicate more than 500 hours per year and often conduct rescues at night, in bad weather, and on short notice. The team trains together every fourth weekend and every Tuesday night. Volunteers also attend special courses, devote time to education and fundraising, and pay for their own personal equipment and clothing. Recruiting and retaining skilled volunteers is an ongoing challenge, and in 2007, the Vancouver Courier reported that the team's most experienced leaders were nearing retirement age. Some volunteers have served for decades, and as of 2007 the team included three father-son pairs. In 2005, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of North Shore Rescue, a group including team members set out to climb Mount Logan. The expedition nearly became a tragedy after a severe storm hit, trapping three team members on an exposed ridge. All were rescued, although one team member suffered severe frostbite. In 2008, team members Tim Jones and Gord Ferguson received a Royal Canadian Mounted Police commendation for their role in saving the life of a snowshoer in a three-day-long rescue operation on Mount Seymour. On January 19, 2014, North Shore Rescue Team Leader, Tim Jones (Search and Rescue), died while hiking down from the team cabin on Mount Seymour. Tim was honoured in an unforgettable parade and service with thousands of emergency responders from across Canada and members of the community. He was instrumental in search and rescue advocacy, building a state of the art rescue facility, implementing a world class helicopter rescue program, and most importantly, saving thousands of lives over his two decades of service.

The ICAED is promoting the early ratification and effective implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 20, 2006. It was opened for signature on 6 February 2007 and entered into force on 23 December 2010.\\"Iraq Paves Way for UN Treaty on Enforced Disappearance\\" 20 November 2010 , 94 states have signed the convention and 46 have ratified it. The ICAED was founded officially in September 2007 during a side event to the Human Rights Council session in Geneva. The ICAED forms the next phase in the international cooperation of all those working towards better protection from enforced disappearances. The Latin American federation of family member organisations FEDEFAM debated the possible project of a convention already in their 1982 congress in Lima. In that same year several eminent lawyers, such as Eduardo Novoa Monreal of Chile and Alfredo Galletti of Argentina, drafted the first text for a Convention against enforced disappearances. During the negotiations for the convention from 2001 to 2003 in Geneva in the 'Open ended working group to draft a legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance' family members of disappeared from all continents and international human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists and FIDH cooperated on an ad hoc basis to convince UN member States to adopt the strongest possible text. After the adoption of the text by this working group on September 23, 2005 and later the adoption of the General Assembly the attention shifted from the level of the United Nations to the national level. Ratification by all governments was the next phase. Because of the ambiguous position of some governments towards the convention the ICAED was founded to organise an international campaign for the convention. By May 2015 the ICAED has 53 member organisations that come from all around the world. National campaigns for the Convention have been developed in various countries. The Country by Country Ratification Campaign, which was launched in March 2009 with successful actions on Morocco, is the latest of the joined activities of the coalition members.

A ruckman, he was a member of Essendon's 1911 and 1912 premiership teams. His 14 goals in 1915 was enough to top Essendon's goal-kicking.

Walker did not resume his career in 1918, when Essendon re-entered the competition. =VFL Tribunal (30 July 1913)= In July 1913 Walker, who played in a long-sleeved guernsey, was reported by both Dan Feehan, the match steward, and Jack Elder, the central umpire, for striking (ex-Essendon) Fitzroy's Jim Martin with his elbow during the 26 July 1913 match against Fitzroy. In the evidence given to the tribunal it was established that Mertin had, indeed, been elbowed by somebody; and that the perpetrator had been wearing a short-sleeve guernsey. Martin gave evidence that it was not Walker who had struck him, but it was Jack Woolley. Jack Woolley also appeared before the tribunal, stating that he had worn a short- sleeved guernsey, and that it was he, rather than Walker, who had had struck Martin with his elbow.

He \\"reigned\\" in Karlin, near Pinsk, in the government of Minsk (currently in Belarus), in succession to his father and his grandfather, Aaron ben Jacob. A few years before his death, he quarrelled with a family of Karlin and moved from there to Stolin, a town several miles distant. Considering the amount of business that the yearly influx of strangers brought to the city where he resided, his removal was regarded as a misfortune for Karlin. He died, aged seventy years and seventeen days, in Malinov, near Dubno, in Volhynia, while on a journey to the wedding of his granddaughter, and was succeeded by his son, Asher of Stolin. Asher died in Drohobycz about one year after the death of his father, and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, the so-called Yenu·∏≥a (Baby) of Stolin, against whose rabbinate (in the ·∏§asidic sense) Schatzkes ‚Äî or, according to others, Judah Lob Levin (called Yehallel of Kiev) ‚Äî under the pseudonym \\"·∏§ad min ·∏§abraya\\" (One of the students), wrote a satire in \\"·∏§a-Sha·∏•ar\\" (vi. 25-44).

The aerodrome was used during World War II and was in operation between 1942 and 1944. History The aerodrome was constructed for use as a satellite aerodrome for RAAF Base Richmond. Identified as a base for the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm of the British Pacific Fleet on 5 February 1945 and commissioned as HMS Nabthorpe, later renamed HMS Nabstock. HMS Nabstock was decommissioned on 9 June 1946 and the aerodrome was returned to RAAF control. In 1949, part of the aerodrome was utilised to house migrants, some 21 huts being outfitted as accommodation for 300 people, known as Schofields Migrant Hostel. the migrant hostel closed on 4 February 1951. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) opened a RAN Aircraft Repair Yard (RANARY), following the formation of the RAN Fleet Air Arm at the aerodrome in 1951, and was known as HMAS ALBATROSS II, RANARY Schofields. In January 1952, the RAAF transferred control of the base to the RAN, however the RAAF remained in residence until leaving in September 1952. The RAAF transport and fighter units moved to the larger bases at RAAF Base Richmond and RAAF Base Williamtown. Commissioned as HMAS Nirimba on 1 April 1953 as a joint RANARY and technical training establishment for RAN Fleet Air Arm. HMAS Nirimba decommissioned on 25 February 1994. =Civil aviation= The aerodrome at Schofields had been operating as a civil field for many years until it too finally closed to flying in 1994. Hosted by the Schofields Flying Club, the aerodrome was the venue of Australia‚Äôs first international Air Show on 8 November 1977, called the Schofields Jubilee Air Show attracting up to 300 aircraft, and exhibits from around the world. Schofields was the host to airshows in 1978, 1979, 1983 and 1985; and the Schofields Flying Club organised the 1988 Australian Bicentennial Airshow at RAAF Base Richmond; and ran a second and final airshow at RAAF Base Richmond in 1991 to celebrate the RAAF‚Äôs 70th Anniversary. These events were a precursor to the Avalon Airshow. =Other uses= Schofields, subsequently titled Schofields Defence Depot, was used as a rehearsal ground for the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. A Wall & Rose Garden Memorial to the Armed forces that have occupied the area in the past has been dedicated on the site and a Commemorative Plaque was erected on the site by The Naval Historical Society of Australia. In the late 1950s the aerodrome was used as a venue for motor racing by several Sydney car clubs, with the opening meeting taking place on 6 July 1958. The circuit used was approximately in length, and used one main runway and an access road in a roughly oval shape. While fast and open, the temporary nature of the track meant that volunteer officials had to set up and dismantle facilities such as grandstands, covered pits and timing towers all on the same day.

It was built and completed in 1932, and officiated by Tuanku Muhammad ibni Almarhum Tuanku Antah who moved there after it was completed. The Istana Besar complex has extensive facilities to support the residence of the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar. In the main building, there is a grand hall, waiting and audience rooms, residential apartments spread over three floors. In the adjacent building, there is a throne room (Balairung Seri) where formal ceremonies are held which includes investitures, oath of allegiance / appointment ceremonies and where large congregational prayers are held. The main Banquet Hall, which was constructed almost seventy years later, can house approximately two thousand people. The current Yang Di-Pertuan Besar is Tuanku Muhriz. There are also offices, facilities and general quarters for palace officials and staff. Istana Lama The Istana Lama Seri Menanti, is one of the famous landmarks in Kuala Pilah District, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia is made in part of Chengal (Penak) wood Neobalanocarpus and iron wood or belian wood Eusideroxylon zwageri and held together using only wooden pegs. The palace took six years to build and was completed in 1908 at a cost of $45,000.00 at that time. The design has subtle hints of Minangkabau architecture, has five levels rising to a height of sixty seven feet or approximately twenty meters high and has ninety nine columns to support the main structure. Four of the main columns of sixty seven feet are the Chengal timber that came from Bukit Pergai, Jelebu and is the central feature of the structure which holds up the apex of the palace, namely the Treasury Room. The Istana Lama was a replacement for Istana Pulih which was burned down by British soldiers. The drawings and plans for Istana Lama was detailed by Mr. Woodford (Public Works Department) based on the designs provided by two local craftsmen, Kahar and Taib. This palace was used until 1932 after which the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar moved to Istana Besar. The significance of the ninety nine columns is meant to represent the ninety nine officers of the palace (Hulubalang), while the four columns at the center is signify the four senior officials of the palace (Orang Empat Istana). The design of Istana Lama was expected to represent the ideals of familyhood, education, heritage and culture, and the historical bond with the Minangkabau kingdom of Pagaruyung. Istana Lama was used as a religious school between 1959 and 1964, and was unoccupied until 1992. The Istana Lama has been designated as a national heritage site and was converted into a Royal Museum on July 14 1992, with the consent of and officiated by HRH Tuanku Ja'afar the Yang Di- Pertuan Besar at the time. It is currently closed to the public to facilitate repairs and upgrading works which is expected to be completed in 2020. The palace has been assigned as building number 115 by the JKR. Istana Tasik Istana Tasik or Lake Palace is located at the entrance to Istana Besar on the left, next to a small lake. It is quite small, has basic amenities and is used occasionally when required. Heritage In February 2009, the Unity, Culture, Arts and Heritage Minister Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal announced that the Istana Lama Seri Menanti is among ten historical structures in Malaysia gazetted as a national heritage, along with Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur and The Stadthuys in Malacca.

History It was a thoroughly conventional gun, being a modernized version of Krupp's FK 73 gun, but failed to incorporate any recoil system other than a partially effective spade brake, and fired a 12-pound projectile. Thus it was rendered obsolete when the French introduced their Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 the following year. Most guns were rebuilt to modern standards (only the barrel was retained) in 1904 as the 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. (neuer Art) [new model] which served throughout World War I as one of Germany's main light field guns. The remaining unmodified guns were then known as the 7.7 cm FK 96 a.A. (alte Art or old model). A number of 7.5 cm Krupp L/24 quick firing guns, similar to the 7.7 cm Feldkanone C/96 (FK 96 a/A) guns, were sold to the Boer republic of Transvaal. These guns were used with good effect against the British in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1902.

The media has historically been state funded, and focused on radio broadcast media, as the nation's population is spread over great distances. Niamey boasts scores of newspapers and magazines, many of which are fiercely critical of the government. These papers though have very small circulations, and almost none outside the cities. The majority of Niger's population live in rural communities, are relatively poor and are illiterate. Consequently, radio, in contrast to print or more expensive television is the primary source of information and entertainment amongst most Nigeriens. More than a dozen public and private radio networks broadcast across the more populated south of the nation. Many are highly critical of the government. Despite this, there is a strong government regulatory regime, and this combined with strong libel laws, have seen many journalists arrested and private media shut down during the 2000s. History While the first newspapers were founded in the 1950s, until the end of military rule in the early 1990s, print and broadcast media were limited to government controlled outlets. With the coming of democracy in the 1991-1993 period, many print news sources were founded, mostly in the capital of Niamey and most weekly publications. From 1994, private radio stations began to appear. As illiteracy rates are high and distances around the nation are great, radio has become the primary medium for entertainment and information. State, private, and international satellite television has also begun to appear in the 2000s. Free media was suspended following the 1996 and 1999 coups, with the short Fourth Republic of 1997-1999 imposing severe restrictions on media.SEMINAIRE-ATELIER DE FORMATION ET DE SENSIBILISATION \\"Mission de service public dans les entreprises de presse d‚ÄôEtat et priv√©e\\".

Since the re-installation of democracy in 1999, Nigerien media has been judged independent of central government control by international observers, although since the advent of the Tuareg rebellion of 2007-2009 Niger has seen harsh local and national restrictions on journalists. Print The government publishes a French-language daily newspaper, ', and its weekend edition. There are approximately 12 private French-language weekly or monthly newspapers, some of which are affiliated loosely with political parties, and most of which appeared with the formation of the Third Republic in the early 1990s.

Anfani FM, Radio Sarounia, Radio et Musique, Radio Bouclier, Radio Malibero, Radio Tambara, and Radio Tenere are urban-based commercial format FM networks in the major towns. These private radio stations generally are less critical of government actions than are the private newspapers. These stations broadcast programs in French as well as local or regional languages, including Djerma and Hausa. Radio Anfani and Radio et Musique presented news coverage that has included a variety of points of view. Radio Sarounia has presented regular news coverage. Its news director, Moussa Kaka, was arrested by the government in 2007 for interviewing Tuareg rebel leaders and held awaiting trial for more than a year. The other private domestic radio stations are smaller and offer little domestic news programming.U.S. Department of State. Report on Human Rights Practices - Niger. 1993-1995 to 2006.

Freedom of the press Despite instances of arrest and detention of journalists, West African observers generally judge Nigerien press to be independent and lively in attacking the government.Niger: Press harassment hinders development, watchdogs warn, 15 January 2008 (IRIN) Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The north, under a state of emergency, has become a no-go zone for foreign press, and the independent Radio Agadez in the north has been closed by the government. Since mid-2007, there have been a number of arrests of foreign and local journalists. Two local journalists were imprisoned in 2007 under charge of aiding the Tuareg insurgency in the north, and several radio stations have been closed. The journalist Moussa Kaka was held over a year on charges stemming from a radio interview of Rebel leaders, before being provisionally released. Foreign journalist circulated and reported freely prior to mid-2007, but since have been restricted from reporting on or traveling to the north of the country (Agadez Region). Since this time radio re-broadcasts of foreign news services have been restricted, having previously been a staple of Nigerien news coverage. Legally, there are two instruments used regulate press behavior. Libel laws may be used against writers and publishers of material, either by the injured party or the government. The CSC is the only government agency with the legal power to close radio stations, and it may do so only after receiving a complaint. Despite this, as recently as 2005 the government have closed radio outlets without recourse to the CSC. In this case, a private radio station publicised protests to tax increases, and although initial police closures were overturned, the CSC ordered the station to refrain from broadcasting political news, sports coverage, or commercials.Niger: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2005.

The Class 62s were developed and delivered by the firm of Henschel for the Reichsbahn during the 1920s. The engines were two-cylinder superheated steam locomotives. Fifteen units were manufactured. Although the engines were built as early as 1928, the Deutsche Reichsbahn did not take over numbers 62 003‚Äì015 until 1932. This was due to the low priority for such engines in the Reichsbahn, as well as the high cost. During the 1930s they were stationed at the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke or Bw) of D√ºsseldorf marshalling yard, Sassnitz on the island of R√ºgen and Meiningen. After the Second World War eight examples were left in the hands of the DR in East Germany and seven with the Deutsche Bundesbahn. Up to 1967, engines in GDR were distributed around various depots including, for example, Meiningen, Berlin Ostbahnhof and Rostock. The engines also spent a short while in Wittenberge and Berlin- Lichtenberg depots. Number 62 007 was stationed from 8 April to 6 May 1967 in Schwerin, but was only stored there. In 1968 they were assembled at Frankfurt (Oder) shed. There the engines hauled trains on the Frankfurt (Oder)-Erkner route. At the beginning of 1970 only numbers 62 007, 62 014 and 62 015 were still in operation, in the Est Wriezen where they headed trains to Berlin- Lichtenberg. Number 62 007 was retired there in 1972, the last engine in schedule services, but continued to be used as a heating engine until 1973. The only surviving locomotive, no. 62 015, is today owned by the DB (Nuremberg Transport Museum) and is housed in the locomotive shed of the former Dresden- Altstadt depot. Until 1997 the engines was used to haul for special trains. Immediately after the war, after they had been sent to Wuppertal, the Deutsche Bundesbahn housed its vehicles at Dortmund, D√ºsseldorf, Essen, and Krefeld. By 1956 the DB's Class 62s had been taken out of service. The last engine, 62 003, was retired in 1968 in Schwerte, after it had served as an instructional model from 1956 to 1966 in the engine driver school in Troisdorf.

Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than trans- border trafficking and the majority of victims are children. Within Senegal some boys called \\"talibes\\" are victims of trafficking , by promising to educate them, but subjecting them instead to forced begging and physical abuse. A 2007 study done by UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank found that 6,480 talibe were forced to beg in Dakar alone. Women and girls are trafficked for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, including for sex tourism, within Senegal. Transnationally, boys are trafficked to Senegal from The Gambia, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea for forced begging by religious teachers. Senegalese women and girls are trafficked to neighboring countries, the Middle East, and Europe for domestic servitude and possibly for sexual exploitation. Women and girls from other West African countries, particularly Liberia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria may be trafficked to Senegal for sexual exploitation, including for sex tourism.\\"Senegal\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). The Government of Senegal maintained a steady commitment to rescuing and caring for victims, though law enforcement efforts. Prosecution The Government of Senegal demonstrated modest law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the last year. Senegal prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2005 Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims. The law's prescribed penalties of five to 10 years' imprisonment for all forms of trafficking are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for rape. In December 2007, nine individuals, two of whom were truck drivers from Guinea-Bissau and one of whom was Senegalese, were arrested at the southern border for attempting to traffic 34 boys. The suspects are in jail awaiting trial. In 2007, a religious teacher was prosecuted and sentenced to four years' imprisonment for beating a talibe to death. The Ministry of Tourism activated a police unit to combat sex tourism in Dakar, though a similar unit established in Mbour is not yet operational. During the year, the Ministry of the Interior activated the Special Commissariat Against Sex Tourism‚Äîwhich it had established in 2005‚Äîin Dakar and Mbour. The Ministry of the Interior, through its Bureau of Investigations, works closely with Interpol to monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. Senegalese police continued to work closely with Bissau-Guinean authorities to repatriate children trafficked for forced begging back to Guinea-Bissau. Protection The Government of Senegal demonstrated solid efforts to protect trafficking victims over the last year. Senegal continued to operate the Ginndi Center, its shelter for destitute children, including trafficking victims. In its record keeping, the Center does not specifically track the number of trafficking victims it receives. However, the Family Ministry, which funds and operates the Center with help from international donors, has recently begun using an NGO-funded computerized database to track trafficking victims. Last year, the center received 917 destitute children, including trafficking victims. With international organization assistance, all of these children were reunited with their families in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and The Gambia. The government provided 77 of these children with vocational training and 329 with medical care. The government also continued to operate its free child protection hotline out of the Ginndi Center. The hotline received 66,823 calls last year. The government also sometimes refers victims to NGOs for care on an ad hoc basis. The government encourages victims to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions by permitting closed- door victim testimonies during trafficking prosecutions and by interviewing victims to gather evidence to prosecute traffickers. The government provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Trafficking victims have the option of remaining temporarily or permanently in Senegal under the status of resident or refugee. Victims are not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The Government of Senegal made minimal efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the reporting period. As part of its program against the worst forms of child labor, the Family Ministry conducted donor-funded workshops and roundtables in Mbour, Dakar, and other areas of the country to raise awareness about forced child begging, child domestic servitude, and prostitution of children. A magistrate at the High Commissary of Human Rights, the government's focal point agency to combat trafficking, holds monthly meetings with representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Tourism, Interior, Women, and Education to better disseminate and enforce the law prohibiting trafficking. The government took measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts in Senegal by activating a tourism police unit and a special police commissariat to combat child sex tourism. The government did not take measures to ensure that its nationals who are deployed abroad as part of peacekeeping missions do not engage in or facilitate trafficking. The Family Ministry is working with a foreign donor to develop a new national action plan against trafficking.

Made by a group of young independent film lovers, the movie turned out to be considered by many as one of the most successful hip-hop beach movies. Plot During a glorious Southern California summer, high school student Benny King (Hopkins) is doing time flipping burgers. Benny's father wants him to learn the work ethic, rather than have him sit around the house all summer, dreaming and writing. When his old friend Durrell (Brian Hooks) comes by with a more attractive alternative, Benny jumps at it. His family goes on vacation and Benny borrows his father's Mercedes and heads on down to the beach with Durrell. At the beach, they meet the Mikey Z, a homeboy wannabe, played by actor Gregg Vance. They have told themselves that they are there to sell beach-goers cheap sunglasses, but they are really there to show off their 'phat' box and attract the finest girls with portable beats on the beach. Comic encounters with the beach girls and a continuous playful banter between Mickey Z and the Durrel-Benny duo form the mainstay of the movie.

(1735 in Manchester - 1808 in Ruan Lanihorne), was an English historian and Anglican clergyman. Besides historical studies on the Roman Empire and on the early history of Great Britain he was a reviewer for London magazines and a poet. Life He was the son of James Whitaker, innkeeper, and was born in Manchester on 27 April 1735. In 1771, he published the first volume of The History of Manchester; and the second volume in 1775. A copy of Whitaker's manuscript of the continuation to the fifteenth century is in Chetham's Library, Manchester. Whitaker's views on early British society were idiosyncratic: in his History of Manchester, (1771‚Äì75) he argued that the ancient Britons had already established a feudal system, and under the Romans had been entirely converted to Christianity (his erudition was recognised as remarkable but the theories were mostly illfounded). The Life of St Neot, published posthumously in 1809, was similarly intended to challenge traditional orthodoxies in the form of the extant saint's lives. He took his degrees at Oxford: B.A. 1755; M.A. 1759; and B.D. 1767: he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1771. After taking his degrees and holding two curacies he became Rector of Ruan Lanihorne in Cornwall in 1777 or 1778. He also published a number of sermons, poems, and articles for Richard Polwhele's History of Cornwall. He was a prolific reviewer for the English Review, British Critic, and Anti-Jacobin Review, finding this an important means of supplementing his income and paying for the books necessary for his studies. In addition to his published works he had planned or contemplated a number of other projects: a parochial history of Cornwall, a military history of the Romans in Britain, a history of Oxford, one of London, notes on Shakespeare, and illustrations to the Bible. He was a man of fiery temperament and extreme views, and a fervent belief in all the tenets of ‚Äòorthodox‚Äô Christianity. He was able to inspire considerable friendship and loyalty from those who knew him best. His close friend Richard Polwhele described him as being of a tall, muscular frame, dark featured, and with light greenish eyes. He reputedly had a squint and wore false teeth made of ebony.

Foreign victims are trafficked to Serbia from Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Albania, and the People's Republic of China. Serbia is a transit country for victims trafficked from Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia and destined for Italy and other countries. Internal sex trafficking of Serbian women and girls continued to increase as of 2007, comprising more than three-fourths of trafficking cases in 2007. Some children continue to be trafficked into forced labor or forced street begging. According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and law enforcement, efforts to shut down known brothels continue to prompt traffickers to better conceal victims of trafficking. According to the U.S. government, the government of Serbia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking set out by the U.S., though it is making significant efforts to do so. In 2007, the government increased national funding for combating trafficking in persons, actively investigated trafficking, prosecuted high-level cases, and took a step in addressing trafficking-related corruption by investigating and charging a state prosecutor for complicity. During 2007, the government improved its capacity to assist trafficking victims via the establishment of 11 new municipal teams made up of government officials and NGO representatives. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Serbia actively investigates trafficking cases, though its court often imposes relatively lenient sentences on convicted trafficking offenders. The criminal code for Serbia criminally prohibits sex and labor trafficking in article 388 and prescribes penalties that are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave offenses, such as rape. In 2007, the government investigated and charged 62 persons with trafficking. The government reported at least 23 trafficking convictions in 2007. Trials often last months or years, and convicted traffickers often delay serving their sentences, sometimes by several years, by filing multiple appeals. This sometimes results in convicted traffickers remaining free and possibly continuing to exploit victims. Protection The government cooperates with NGOs on victim assistance, but does not provide any funding for NGOs providing victims of trafficking with services such as counseling, legal assistance, and reintegration programs. The Agency for the Coordination of Protection of Victims of Trafficking reported the identification of 60 victims in 2007, including 26 minors; 48 of the 60 were Serbian victims. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, according to NGOs in Serbia; 90 percent of victims reportedly participated in the investigation of their traffickers. However, many victims refuse to testify in court, out of fear of reprisals by their traffickers. The government used its 2006 Witness Protection Law to protect only one trafficking victim during the year. According to NGOs, trafficking victims were often directly or indirectly forced to testify against traffickers and some courts continue to demonstrate insensitivity to trafficking victims by scheduling victims and their accused traffickers to appear in court together, despite victims‚Äô objections. Serbian law allows victims to file civil suits against traffickers for compensation, but as of March 2008 no trafficking victim had been awarded compensation. Victims pursuing criminal or civil suits are entitled to temporary residence permits and may obtain employment or leave the country pending trial proceedings. The government awarded temporary residence status to a total of six victims in 2007. Identified victims are not detained, jailed, prosecuted, or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. However, one NGO reported that authorities failed to identify some trafficking victims in 2007, resulting in their arrest, detainment, and subsequent deportation. To address this issue, the government expanded its training program for law enforcement. In 2007, thirty-seven trafficking victims were accommodated in two NGO shelters, 21 in a short-term shelter and 16 in transition housing (including two babies). Reintegration services were provided to 47 women and four men (including 22 children). During the reporting period, 11 new municipalities established social assistance teams composed of social workers, police, and NGO staff to provide assistance to potential victims of family violence and trafficking. Prevention The Government of Serbia demonstrated mixed efforts in its prevention activities in 2007. The government has yet to begin implementation of its December 2006 National Strategy to Combat Trafficking in Persons. Furthermore, the government‚Äôs anti-trafficking team charged with leading Serbia‚Äôs anti-trafficking efforts met only once during the year. However, the government increased its educational prevention programs during the year, and in 2007, launched a fund-raising drive for the Agency for Coordination. It also sponsored a month of anti-trafficking programs on national television during October 2007. Although the government finalized scripts for a project to which it earmarked $100,000 for a 13-episode television series entitled ‚ÄúModern Slavery,‚Äù NGOs expressed concerns about the series being completed. The government did not conduct any awareness campaigns aimed to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. Although the government expanded its training program, with the help of U.N. Trafficking expert Dr. Gilly McKenzie, to educate law enforcement how to identify victims, concerns remained about victims sometimes not correctly identified and punished as a result of being trafficked.\\"Serbia\\".

Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and the majority of victims are children. Within the country, women and children are trafficked from rural provinces to towns and mining areas for domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and forced labor in diamond mines, petty trading, petty crime, and for forced begging. Women and children may also be trafficked for forced labor in agriculture and the fishing industry. Transnationally, Sierra Leonean women and children are trafficked to other West African countries, notably Guinea, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and The Gambia for the same purposes listed above and to North Africa, the Middle East, and Western Europe for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation. Sierra Leone is a destination country for children trafficked from Nigeria and possibly from Liberia and Guinea for forced begging, forced labor in mines and as porters, and for sexual exploitation. There have also been cases of children trafficked from refugee communities in Sierra Leone. The Government of Sierra Leone does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The government reported that it prosecuted five traffickers, but was unable to provide data on trafficking convictions. While Sierra Leone reported that it referred victims to an international organization's shelter, the number of victims referred was low.\\"Sierra Leone\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Sierra Leone made modest law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in the last year. Legislatively, Sierra Leone prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2005 Anti- Trafficking in Persons Act, which prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. This penalty is stringent, but not commensurate with penalties for rape, which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Between January and December 2007, the government reported that it conducted 14 trafficking investigations. Five of these cases are being prosecuted‚Äîas compared with seven cases prosecuted in 2006. Although an international NGO reported that Sierra Leone convicted three traffickers, the government was unable to corroborate this information. In January 2008, the Sierra Leonean Embassy in Conakry received from the Guinean government four Sierra Leonean women whom Guinean authorities suspected of trafficking children to Sierra Leone, and transported them back to Sierra Leone. Rather than prosecuting them, the government and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) determined that the women were actually trafficking victims and returned them to their communities. Protection The Sierra Leonean government demonstrated limited efforts to protect trafficking victims during the last year. The government does not operate its own shelter, but refers victims to the nation's only trafficking victim shelter, which is located in Freetown and operated by IOM. The Family Support Units (FSU) of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) turned over intercepted trafficking victims to the Ministry of Social Welfare (MOSW), which then referred the victims to IOM for assistance. Some victims outside Freetown were not referred for care, however, due to lack of transport to the capital or the difficulty of travel during the rainy season. The government reported that it referred 14 trafficking victims to IOM for assistance in the 2007 calendar year. In January 2007, the Sierra Leonean Embassy in Conakry received from the Guinean government and protected 10 suspected child trafficking victims and returned them to Sierra Leone. The MOSW and IOM determined that the children were in fact not trafficking victims, but were related to the aforementioned four Sierra Leonean women whom Guinean authorities had suspected were trafficking these children into Sierra Leone. The children were reunited with their parents under the supervision of the MOSW. In March 2008, the government donated shelter space to IOM in order to replace the facility IOM currently rents. Although the government permits victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions, cases take so long to go to court that many victims are no longer available at the time of trial. As a result, some cases are dropped, since many cannot be successfully tried without a victim witness. The government does not actively encourage victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions. Sierra Leone does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. There were no known cases during the year of trafficking victims inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked. However, authorities' conflation of trafficking and smuggling has probably led to some trafficking victims being penalized as illegal immigrants. Also, NGOs report that police raid brothels and arrest females engaged in prostitution without following procedures to identify trafficking victims among them. Prevention The Government of Sierra Leone made inadequate efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the reporting period. The government failed to conduct trafficking information or education campaigns. While the National Anti- Trafficking Task Force, which is composed of government officials, NGOs, and international organizations, met monthly for half the year, meetings were less frequent in the year's second half and government authorities from some key ministries rarely attended. While the 2005 anti-trafficking law mandates the creation of a Trafficking Secretariat to coordinate national anti-trafficking activities, it has yet to be established. Sierra Leone does not monitor immigration and emigration patterns for trafficking activity. Border officials continue to lack a full understanding of the distinction between smuggling and trafficking. The government took some measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts by raiding brothels, but did not follow procedures to identify trafficking victims among females in prostitution. Sierra Leone has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Some women from India, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the People‚Äôs Republic of China who travel to Singapore voluntarily for prostitution or work are subsequently deceived or coerced into sexual servitude. A significant number of foreign domestic workers in Singapore face the unlawful confiscation of their travel documents, restrictions on their movement, confinement, and/or physical or sexual abuse.\\"Singapore\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2020.  Definition  Human trafficking is defined as a hidden crime that shows very low indicators of the crime even occurring. The people that get drawn into trafficking are usually forced into the trade by fraud and coercion because they are emotionally, psychologically, or economically vulnerable. Sex trafficking Sex trafficking in Singapore is a significant problem. Singaporean and foreign women and girls have been forced into prostitution in brothels and been physically and psychologically abused.  Extent  The Singaporean Government follows the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which works with other pre existing trafficking laws and makes benefits available to victims of trafficking. Although Singapore does not have specific laws to prevent trafficking it has laws that protect people that may be in the world of human trafficking. Some of these laws are the Women's Charter, Children and Young Persons' Act, and the Penal code. The Women's Charter is an act \\"to provide for monogamous marriages and for the solemnization and registration of such marriages; to amend and consolidate the law relating to divorce, the rights and duties of married persons, the protection of family, the maintenance of wives and children and the punishment of offences against women and girls; and to provide for matters incidental thereto\\". The Children and Young Persons' Act protects the welfare, care and protection of children and young persons by making homes safe and any other laws protecting children and young persons are consolidated within this act. The Penal code though does not make using 16- and 17-year-olds a criminal act, but criminalizes the majority forms of human trafficking.  Prosecution  The codes already in effect in Singapore have a series of consequences. The Prevention of Human Trafficking Act which took effect on 1 March 2015 makes all forms of human trafficking illegal and has penalties of up to 10 years' in jail, fines up to 100,000 Singapore dollars and caning up to 6 strokes. Some other consequences include even more fines along with the initial fine of trafficking. As the first case of imprisonment under the Act, Muhammad Khairulanwar Rohmat, a 25-year old final-year student at the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM), was found guilty and sentenced on 19 February 2016 of four charges of recruiting a child for sexual exploitation, receiving payment from this exploitation, and sexual penetration of a minor, alongside 14 charges that were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to six years and three months‚Äô jail and fined S$30,000.  Prevention  The Singaporean government's Ministry of Manpower tries to give out prevention information and raise awareness of trafficking. The Ministry of Manpower prints information on employee's rights and police hotline numbers, and mails newsletters with employee's rights on it to deter trafficking.

He was the first foreigner introducing the historical value of Jikji to the world through the Paris International Exposition(1900). At the suggestion of Victor Collin de Plancy, Emperor Gojong, the king of Joseon Dynasty, participated in the Paris International Exposition(1900) and became an opportunity for Joseon's history and culture to be known to the world. Victor Collin de Plancy set up an exhibition hall with hanok at the Paris International Exposition to display Korean traditional items and promote them to the world. At that time, one of the Korean books he displayed at the Korean Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition was \\"Jikji,\\" the oldest existing metal type printed book. In addition, he accurately recorded the value of Jikji in 'Joseon Seoji'.http://jikji.prkorea.com/ourdream/ambassador/His accumulated books became part of the core of the Korean collection of the French Biblioth√®que Nationale, and his accumulated artworks became part of the core of the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris. Life Collin de Plancy was born on November 22, 1853 in Plancy, a small town near Troyes in the Champagne region of eastern France, the son of Jacques Collin de Plancy, a Jesuit priest and prolific writer on the occult whose name is still much more familiar in France than that of his son. Despite the name, Collin de Plancy was not of noble pedigree. Against the strict laws of lineage Victor's father had illicitly added the \\"de Plancy\\" to his family name of Collin in a move that would later bring accusations against the son.Daniel Kane, \\"The Empire of Great Han at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition\\". Seoul Journal of East Asian Studies 4:2 (August 2004):47. Victor Collin de Plancy, ca. 1900. As a very young man Victor Collin de Plancy studied in Paris at the Ecole de l'Immacul√©e Conception before gaining entrance to the prestigious √âcole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, where he trained in Chinese, graduating in 1877.Roudaut, Fran√ßois. Le Fonds Collin de Plancy d√©pos√© √† la Biblioth√®que de Troyes. Gen√®ve: 1994, 13. Though he had ambitions for entering the diplomatic corps, he was posted instead to Peking as a junior interpreter, often a preliminary step to seeking consular duties. Prevented by his stationing in Peking from taking the requisite exam for consular assignment (administered only at Paris), it was 1883 before he finally received his coveted consular position, when he was named consul second class at Peking. In 1884 he was promoted to acting French consul at Shanghai, where he served during the Sino-French War, distinguishing himself by services rendered to a cholera-stricken French fleet harbored in Shanghai during the conflict for which he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor.Roudaut, 13. It was during this posting that Collin de Plancy served briefly as the first French consul to Korea, when relations were opened with that country in 1887. He would go on to serve as French consul in Japan before returning to Korea in 1896 as the resident French consul in that country. Except for extended sick leaves in 1899‚Äì1900 and 1905‚Äì1906, Collin de Plancy would spend the years from 1896 to 1906 in Seoul, where he would eventually be promoted full minister. He would serve only briefly as French minister to Bangkok in 1906 before requesting full retirement 1907. The young Collin de Plancy was described alternately as laborious, impartial and instructed, while being lauded as well for his more social qualities ‚Äî charm, elegance of manners, impeccable taste and perhaps most importantly, amiability. The introduction to his collected papers in the French Foreign Ministry notes the qualities for which Collin de Plancy seemed best known, \\"his tact, courtesy, and refined manners\\" and as one who excelled in \\"issues of etiquette... but who rarely ventured into the realm of general ideas\\".Kane, 48. In Seoul he became known for his charming garden parties. Particularly well-received were his \\"chrysanthemum festivals\\" held every autumn in the gardens of the French legation, during which guest strolled the peaceful grounds in the midst of the budding capital, admiring the park with its greenhouses of flowers.√âmile Bourdaret, En Cor√©e (Paris: Plon Nourrit et Cie., 1904):97. In 1896 De Plancy had constructed an elegant European style compound for the French legation, filling it with antiques from the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceaux. He was himself a collector; his respectable assortment of Asian art and ceramics was eventually donated to the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris where it forms a core part of the Korean collection. Victor Collin de Plancy never married. Collin de Plancy's diplomatic acumen proved a boon for French interests in Korea during the last decade or so of the 19th century. He became occupied in procuring the concession for of the Seoul-Uiju line for Five-Lilles, personally negotiating with the Korean foreign minister. Along with the above railway concession he also successfully petitioned for mining rights on behalf of French companies along the proposed railroad. However, other efforts spearheaded by Collin de Plancy to gain railway concessions to Mokpo and Wonsan were not so successful.Kane, 48. Collin de Plancy was successful in raising the French visibility and prestige in other realms more successfully than in railroads and mining. As chief French diplomat in Korea, and enjoying a wide range of contacts, Collin de Plancy was the natural hinge for the expansion of French influence. Collin de Plancy helped a certain Mr. Saltarel establish official contacts in Seoul upon his arrival there as representative of several French companies in early 1898. Saltarel eventually gained a mining concession in Korea. In late 1899 a French military attach√© in China, Commander Polyeucte Vidal, was also brought in through Collin de Plancy‚Äôs efforts to assess the state of the Korean arsenal and make recommendations as to its improvement and the establishment of a Korean arms industry. Eventually the French, represented by Vidal, would join with the Russians in a mutual campaign to reorganize the Korean arsenal. Collin de Plancy also brought in an expert from the S√®vres Ceramic Works to recommend ways of modernizing and expanding the Korean porcelain industry. But France's most visible representative, behind Collin de Plancy himself, was undoubtedly E. Clemencet, who had been brought to Korea in 1898, shortly after Korea's entrance into the International Postal Union, to organize a modern Korean postal service. Upon the bureau's opening in January 1900 Clemencet sent the first international letter to Collin de Plancy (then on leave in France), as the \\"only fitting homage\\" to the man who had contributed so much to making the service a reality.Kane, 49. The French consul also proved instrumental in paving the way for Korea's participation at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. In 1906, shortly after Korea became a protectorship of Japan, Collin de Plancy left Korea for a posting in Bangkok, Thailand. He went into retirement the following year. After his death in 1924 a large part of his art and book collection made its way into the possession of the Mus√©e Guimet, the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, and the Coll√®ge de France. Collin de Plancy was also an amateur naturalist and authored several texts on the insects and reptiles of his native France.Roudaut, 87‚Äì88.

The Slovak Republic prohibits all forms of trafficking through Sections 179-181 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties under the criminal code ranging from four to 25 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police conducted 14 trafficking investigations in 2007, including one labor trafficking investigation, compared to 20 investigations in 2006. The government prosecuted 16 defendants in four cases, compared to 32 trafficking cases in 2006. Seven trafficking offenders were convicted during the reporting period, down from 18 convicted in 2006. Most convicted traffickers were given sentences of up to two years‚Äô imprisonment; one trafficker was sentenced to seven months‚Äô imprisonment. There were no official cases of high-level government officials involved in trafficking during the reporting period. The government extradited one person to Austria to face trafficking charges during the reporting period. Protection The government demonstrated modest efforts to assist and protect victims in 2007. The Ministry of the Interior funded a new NGO program which provided shelter and assistance to four victims. In 2006, government funding to NGOs aided 10 victims; an additional 43 victims were assisted by nongovernmental-funded programs. The Ministry of Interior published a training manual and provided victim identification, referral, and sensitivity training for 490 police officers. Police identified and referred 15 victims to NGOs for assistance during the reporting period. Victims are encouraged to participate in investigations and prosecutions; foreign victims who cooperate with law enforcement are permitted to remain in Slovakia and work for the duration of the investigation or trial. Prevention Slovakia demonstrated limited efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. The Border and Alien Police monitored the border for evidence of trafficking. The government continued to operate a 38-bed shelter for unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally, thus helping to prevent the trafficking of this vulnerable population. In 2007, the government allocated $22,000 to develop and implement future awareness campaigns to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The Ministry of Education approved the use of NGO-produced anti-trafficking materials in schools in 2007, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs cooperated with NGOs in a series of training and trafficking awareness activities aimed at vulnerable population groups, including Roma populations. During the reporting period, the government published a brochure educating its nationals traveling to other EU countries for employment opportunities about the dangers of trafficking. Slovakia did not provide trafficking awareness training for deployed peacekeeping officials during the reporting period.

In 2007, disabled men from Slovakia were trafficked to Slovenia for the purpose of forced begging. Slovenian women are trafficked within the country or to other European countries for commercial sexual exploitation. The Government of Slovenia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government sustained its strong law enforcement efforts and generous victim assistance funding during the reporting period. In 2007, Slovenia increased funding for victim assistance from $85,000 to $105,000. The government also increased and diversified its public awareness efforts.\\"Slovenia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government demonstrated adequate law enforcement efforts in 2007. The government prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 387(a) of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from six months to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Authorities conducted six trafficking investigations in 2007, up from three in 2006. Courts prosecuted three cases and convicted five traffickers in 2007, down from six cases prosecuted and seven traffickers convicted in 2006. Four traffickers were given sentences ranging from 15 to 57 months‚Äô imprisonment and one convicted trafficker served no time in prison. The Slovenian Police Directorate provided eight training sessions for 165 police officers during the reporting period. Protection The Government of Slovenia provided quality victim assistance and protection during the reporting period, although the number of victims assisted and referred by government officials declined in 2007. The government provided $105,000 to two NGOs to provide both short-term and extended victim assistance including shelter, rehabilitative counseling, medical assistance, vocational training, and legal assistance. In 2007, these NGOs assisted 26 victims or potential victims compared to 43 victims assisted in 2006. The government continued to implement its formalized victim identification and referral mechanism during the reporting period; however, during the year, police referred only four victims to NGOs for assistance, down from 21 victims referred in 2006. After identification, victims were granted a 90-day reflection period, and were encouraged to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; foreign victims who assist law enforcement are eligible to stay in Slovenia for the duration of the trial. Eight victims assisted law enforcement officials with trafficking investigations and prosecutions in 2007. Victims were not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The government increased its prevention efforts during the reporting period. Slovenia continued to fund an NGO to provide trafficking awareness classes for students in elementary and secondary schools, reaching 400 students, parents, and teachers nationwide in 2007. With government funding, one NGO conducted a radio campaign simulating a trafficking victim‚Äôs call to the NGO‚Äôs hotline to encourage victims to seek assistance. In September 2007, the Ministry of Education introduced the theme of human trafficking into the standard Slovenian primary school curriculum. Slovenia continued to monitor its borders for evidence of trafficking. The government continued to provide Slovenian troops assigned to peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan with trafficking awareness training.

Generally, South African girls are trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, while boys are used for street vending, food service, and agriculture. Anecdotal evidence suggests that South African children can also be forced to provide unpaid labor for landowners in return for land occupancy, living accommodation, or for maintaining labor tenancy rights. In any case, this form of unpaid labor has caused human trafficking to be described as a modern form of slavery. Human trafficking is the result of a combination of several factors, including gender inequality, economic instability, and political conflict. Since Africa experiences all of these, it is an active hub for human trafficking. Many urge for the need of a cultural shift to reduce instances of human trafficking by lessening the demand for sex and unpaid labor. Terminology Human trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain labor or commercial sexual act, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The definition of human trafficking does not require that victims be transported. They can remain stationary and still be classified as victims of human trafficking if they are being sexually exploited or serving as indentured laborers. A sex exploiter is any person who expresses desire or engages in sex with at least one victim of human trafficking. Debt bondage refers to a form of indentured servitude where payment is given to a person's legal guardian/family member(s) in exchange for said person. They must work to pay off this debt for release. Kidnapping is the taking of a person to another place against their will, or the restraint of a person's freedom by force, as defined the Wex Legal Dictionary. Abduction is the taking of a child from their legal guardian with the specific intention of defiling or prostituting the child, according to the Wex Legal Dictionary. An origin country is one where traffickers recruit victims for exploitation. A transit country is an intermediary country where a victim is moved to after recruitment. These countries often have ineffective border control and corrupt government officials. A destination country is one that receives victims. Its economy is generally prosperous enough to support sex trafficking. An internal/domestic country is one whose victims are both recruited and trafficked within the same country. Victim demographics It is estimated that there are millions of victims; though only about 50‚Äì100,000 cases are found each year. The University of Johannesburg reports that trafficking occurs at a slightly higher rate for girls than boys, with 55.5% of all trafficked people in South Africa being female, and 44.5% being male. It is estimated that more than three-quarters of all victims are between the ages of 12‚Äì25. Though many victims are recruited through deceit on behalf of the trafficker, sometimes victims of human trafficking enter on their own accord, as they are faced with economic hardships that leave them desperate for a better life. This can occur as agentic victims are coerced by employers or pimps to become a trafficked person for a number of false benefits such as better pay, for example. The uneven distribution of wealth in South Africa leaves victims vulnerable to promises of wealth. There are first wave victims, classified as people recruited for trafficking, and second wave victims, such as women who were trafficked and now serve as recruiters. Traffickers have learned to find victims in places where there is little to no protection for exploitation, weak government, poverty, corrupt law enforcement, temporary working positions, and places where diaspora is common. Many traffickers convince their victims to fear the police, as they are not to be trusted, which helps to keep victims trapped in the cycle of trafficking. =Driving forces of trafficking= Traffickers can range from people who engage in activity occasionally to those who are a part of organized crime networks, according to the International Organization for Migration. It is often easier for traffickers to work in the latter situation because it facilitates the movement and organization of victims. Following the apartheid of South Africa during the 20th century, inequality increased as the higher classes held most of the state's income. This exacerbated the tendency for women in Africa to not be in positions of power, as it is difficult for many to obtain education and skills training. This makes women easy targets for traffickers. Many agree to go abroad with prospects of a better life. Traffickers also seek children from Africa due to a lack of a birth registration system. This leaves children vulnerable to trafficking because they are unidentified and difficult to trace back to their country or origin. These victims are then transported to South Africa. Ukuthwala (child marriage) is a tradition common in some South African provinces wherein young girls are married to older men, which may also account for some trafficking victims. Case study One hospital in Durban, South Africa pleaded guilty to 109 counts of illegal organ transplants, wherein Brazilian and Romanian victims were compensated as little as $6,000 for organs worth anywhere from $100,000‚Äì120,000. This is a violation of the South African Human Tissue Act of 1983 that protects minors from being used for organ transplant and the sale of organs for profit. South Africa is a prominent place for organ harvesting because the exchange rate between South African currency and United States dollars allows recipients a maximum payout. Additionally, South Africa has only 2% of the population on the organ transplant registry, and many qualified doctors willing to perform the transplant. Trafficking routes Trafficking rings choose transit locations where government officials and police are corrupt, leaving traffickers with little risk of being caught and victims with little hope of being helped. Child sex tourism is prevalent in and between a number of South African cities, notably the capital city Johannesburg and Cape Town. Women and girls from other African countries are often imported to South Africa for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, and other jobs in the service sector. Occasionally, these women are taken as far as Europe for sexual exploitation. Many Thai, Chinese, and European women are often trafficked to and sexually exploited in South Africa for debt bondage. Young men and boys from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi are notably trafficked to South Africa for farm work, extending for months without pay before \\"employers\\" have them arrested and deported as illegal immigrants. Organized criminal groups‚Äîincluding Nigerian, Chinese, and Eastern European syndicates, local gangs and individual policemen facilitate trafficking into and within South Africa, particularly for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. South African victims are usually taken to Ireland, the United States, and the Middle East as domestic servants. Victims from several different countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, China, and Russia are trafficked into South Africa. Because of this, South Africa is considered an origin, transit, destination, and internal/domestic country in terms of child trafficking. Protection and prevention There is an absence of reliable statistics about human trafficking, masking the truth about human trafficking in South Africa. Since such little is known, it is difficult to assess and combat the situation. The United States Parliament passed the Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act in 2013, which the former president of South Africa Jacob Zuma signed. However, little change was affected and only 3 traffickers were convicted, and 12 suspects were prosecuted that same year. In 2008, South Africa was placed on the US Department of State's Tier 2 list, which designates it as a country whose government does not currently comply with TVPA's minimum standards against human trafficking, but is making efforts toward compliance. The government provided inadequate data on investigations or prosecutions of trafficking crimes or on resulting convictions or sentences. In addition, it did not provide information on its efforts to protect victims of trafficking and continued to deport and prosecute suspected foreign victims without providing appropriate protective services.\\"South Africa\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (4 June 2008). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" once again in 2017. Failure to address trafficking is perhaps due to poor screening procedures and identification measures. Many traffickers evade persecution because there is no law that criminalizes human trafficking. The South African Penal Code lacks criminal codes that specifically outline human trafficking, instead grouping incidents into crimes like rape, sexual assault, and abduction. This lack of systematic data collection makes it difficult to record incidents of human trafficking and take measures against it. To help reduce instances of human trafficking, the South African Department of Home Affairs began requiring an Unabridged Birth Certificate in 2015 for minors travelling in and out of South Africa. An Unabridged Birth Certificate contains information about the child's legal guardians, if a child entering/exiting South Africa does not have a UBC, they are denied passage. The implementation of this policy, however, may not reduce trafficking, as traffickers tend to use illegitimate ways of crossing the border or victims may be trafficked within borders. South Africa also partnered with the Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in 2016. South Africa was one of 13 countries asked to join this effort due to the prevalence of human trafficking. A Trafficking in Persons Task Team was established in 2012 by the National Prosecuting Authority's Sexual Offenses and Community Affairs Unit (SOCA). This task team works toward collecting data on trafficking in South Africa and taking measures to reducing incidences. The Child Protection Directorate helps survivors of trafficking return safely to their parents or guardians.

Prosecution The Government of Spain demonstrated strong efforts to combat child trafficking through law enforcement in the last year. Spain prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 318 of its Criminal and Penal Code. The prescribed penalties for sex trafficking is five to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment, and the penalty for labor trafficking is four to 12 years in prison. These are sufficiently stringent, and the penalties prescribed for sex trafficking are commensurate with the prescribed penalties for rape. The government implemented new legislation in 2007 that increased prescribed penalties for trafficking by two to six years in prison if the offender is found to be part of a criminal organization, and passed additional legislation in 2007 that allows Spanish courts to prosecute cases of trafficking that have occurred outside Spain‚Äôs borders. During the reporting period, police arrested 530 individuals for sex trafficking and 161 for labor trafficking. Government officials prosecuted 102 trafficking cases, convicted 142 trafficking offenders, and imposed an average prison sentence of 4.6 years on those convicted. Over 67 percent of these sentences were greater than four years, and approximately 25 percent of the convictions resulted in a fine and/ or suspended sentence. Spain announced in early 2008 that it would allot $8.6 million to fund an anti-trafficking cooperation agreement with several Central American countries. Protection The government sustained impressive efforts to provide care for trafficking victims during the reporting period. In 2007, Spain increased funding to anti-trafficking NGOs providing care to victims. Spain does not have a formal mechanism for referring victims to service providers; however, Spanish police continued informally to refer rescued victims to NGOs providing temporary shelter and rehabilitation services. Victims receive medical assistance, including emergency care, through the national health care system. The police identified 1,035 sex trafficking victims and 445 labor trafficking victims in 2007. The government encourages foreign victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions by providing work and residence permits to victims choosing to assist, giving them the option of either permanent residence status or funding to return to their own countries after the prosecution. There is no indication that victims are inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Spain does not employ formal procedures for identifying victims among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution. Prevention Spain sustained efforts to raise awareness about trafficking over the past year. The Spanish government instituted a toll-free hotline that offers trafficking victims and potential victims information. Regional offices of the national police conduct quarterly reviews to set goals for combating trafficking and to assess progress. Spain has not yet, however, enacted its National Integral Plan Against Trafficking in Persons which was expected to be finalized in 2007. The plan includes a government pledge of almost $45 million per year and the dedication of over 200 new police and civil guards to its enforcement. Local governments continued demand-reduction campaigns. The city of Madrid targeted potential sex solicitors with the slogan, ‚ÄúDo not contribute to the perpetuation of 21st Century Slavery.‚Äù Spanish military troops deploying abroad as international peacekeepers received anti-trafficking training through participation in multilateral training efforts. Under the motto ‚ÄúThere Are No Excuses,‚Äù the Spanish government warned travelers against child sex tourism. In January 2008, the Ministries of Labor and Social Affairs and Foreign Affairs teamed up with Save the Children to host an international conference on child trafficking, which addressed child sex tourism.

Sri Lankan men and women migrate willingly to Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and South Korea to work as construction workers, domestic servants, or garment factory workers. However, some find themselves in situations of involuntary servitude when faced with restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and debt bondage that is, in some instances, facilitated by large pre-departure fees imposed by recruitment agents. Children are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and, less frequently, for forced labor. The designated Foreign Terrorist Organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continued to recruit, sometimes forcibly, children for use as soldiers in areas outside the Sri Lankan government‚Äôs control. Government security forces may also be complicit in letting a pro-government paramilitary organization recruit, sometimes forcibly, child soldiers. Reports also indicate that a small number of women from Thailand, China, Russia, and other countries of the Newly Independent States are trafficked into Sri Lanka for commercial sexual exploitation. In November 2007, over 100 Sri Lankan peacekeeping soldiers were repatriated based on accusations that they engaged in sexual misconduct, some cases involving minors, in Haiti. The Government of Sri Lanka does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Sri Lanka is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons over the previous year, particularly in the area of law enforcement. The government failed to arrest, prosecute, or convict any person for trafficking offenses and continued to punish some victims of trafficking for crimes committed as a result of being trafficked. At the same time, Sri Lanka protected some victims of trafficking, including Sri Lankan nationals trafficked abroad. The government appointed a focal point on trafficking in persons in July, who convenes a monthly anti-trafficking working group to develop and coordinate anti-trafficking policy.\\"Sri Lanka\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). (This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.) U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution Sri Lanka made little progress on its law enforcement efforts this reporting period. The Sri Lankan government prohibits all forms of trafficking through an April 2006 amendment to its penal code. Trafficking offenses are punishable by up to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment; these penalties are commensurate with those assigned for other grave crimes. While the government took administrative action against 350 labor recruiters engaging in fraudulent recruitment practices, it did not criminally prosecute, convict, or sentence recruiters for practices that amounted to trafficking. The government initiated one investigation of a recruitment agent involved in a case where three females were to be trafficked to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants. Sri Lanka similarly failed to report any prosecutions or convictions for trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation, including trafficking of children. Sri Lanka, in cooperation with the United Nations, launched an investigation into allegations of the complicity in sexual misconduct of Sri Lankan peacekeepers in Haiti, including sexual exploitation of minors. The government investigated 47 cases of child abduction for forced labor as child soldiers, resulting in 37 being returned home. No arrests, prosecutions, or convictions were made in relation to these cases, however. There were no public officials arrested for facilitating trafficking, nor were there substantiated reports that any officials were involved in trafficking. Protection The Sri Lankan government‚Äôs efforts to provide protection for trafficking victims improved nominally, but remained limited. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they would suffer retribution or hardship. Sri Lanka also failed to ensure that victims of trafficking were not punished for acts committed as a result of being trafficked. Of particular concern are ongoing reports that women arrested on suspicion of being trafficked into Sri Lanka for the purpose of sexual exploitation were asked to pay fines in exchange for release from prison and were usually deported thereafter. Law enforcement officers continue to lack a formal system to identify potential victims of trafficking. The government does not provide specialized training for victim identification, though law enforcement officers participated in NGO-provided training. For Sri Lankan victims, the government relies primarily on NGOs to provide victim protection services due to resource constraints. Police encourage these victims to assist in investigations against their traffickers, but do not undertake any specific measures to ensure victim or witness safety. For Sri Lankan victims trafficked overseas, the government operates shelters in diplomatic missions, offers repatriation assistance, and provides compensation to some who have registered with the government before leaving. In early 2008, the government paid for the repatriation of over 200 Sri Lankan domestic workers from safe houses in the Middle East. For repatriated Sri Lankan victims, however, there is little government effort to investigate the crimes committed against them. Limited aid is offered in terms of shelter, counseling, and medical care upon return. The government opened two temporary shelters for women who are victims of violence, and these were made available to trafficking victims. The government established an inter-ministerial committee to address the issue of child soldiers. Sri Lanka provides two rehabilitation centers specifically for children conscripted as soldiers; since their establishment in 2005, the rehabilitation centers have assisted 52 children. Prevention Sri Lanka made modest efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. In August 2007, the Bureau of Foreign Employment (BFE) began requiring that all overseas employment contracts be signed in the presence a BFE official to ensure that migrant workers understand the contracts‚Äô terms. The government conducted 26 awareness campaigns on child sexual exploitation among teachers, students, hotel staff, taxi and rikshaw drivers, and others employed in the tourism industry. In February 2008, the government established a hotline for complaints about child labor, sexual exploitation, and other abuses. Sri Lanka has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. History In 2007, Greek law enforcement authorities identified a female sex trafficking victim from Sudan. The terrorist rebel organization, Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), continues to harbor small numbers of Sudanese and Ugandan children in the southern part of the country for use as cooks, porters, and combatants; some of these children are also trafficked across borders into Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In March 2007, six Sudanese girls were abducted by the LRA near Maridi, Western Equatoria. Sudanese children are unlawfully conscripted, at times through abduction, and utilized by armed rebel groups‚Äîincluding all SLA factions, the Popular Defense Forces, Janjaweed militia, and Chadian opposition forces‚Äîin Sudan's ongoing conflict in Darfur; the Sudanese Armed Forces and associated militias also continue to exploit young children in this region. There were confirmed reports of unlawful child recruitment in mid-2007 by the JEM/Peace Wing among communities of internally displaced persons in Dereig, South Darfur. Militia groups in Darfur, some of which are linked to the government, abduct women for short periods of forced labor and to perpetrate sexual violence. Forcible recruitment of adults and particularly children by virtually all armed groups involved in Sudan's concluded north-south civil war was commonplace; thousands of children still associated with these forces await demobilization and reintegration into their communities of origin. In addition to the exploitation of children by armed groups during the two decades-long north-south civil war, thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes during this time. An unknown number of children from the Nuba tribe were similarly abducted and enslaved. A portion of those who were abducted and enslaved remained with their abductors in South Darfur and West Kordofan and experienced varying types of treatment; others were sold or given to third parties, including in other regions of the country; and some ultimately escaped from their captors. While there have been no known new abductions of Dinka by members of Baggara tribes in the last few years, intertribal abductions continue in southern Sudan, especially in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria states. The Government of National Unity of Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. While the government did take limited steps to demobilize child soldiers, combating human trafficking through law enforcement or prevention measures was not a priority for the government in 2007.\\"Sudan\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Prosecution The government's anti- trafficking law enforcement efforts were negligible during the reporting period; it did not investigate or prosecute any suspected trafficking cases. Sudan is a large country with porous borders and destitute hinterlands; the national government has little ability to establish authority or a law enforcement presence in many regions. Sudan's criminal code does not prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons, though its Articles 162, 163, and 164, criminalize abduction, luring, and forced labor, respectively. The Interim National Constitution prohibits slavery and forced labor. No trafficker has ever been prosecuted under these articles. In 2007, the Council of Ministers approved the Child Protection Act, which prohibits the recruitment or enlistment of soldiers under the age of 18; the act must be approved by the parliament before it can be implemented. The draft Sudan Armed Forces Act, which was expected to be debated in the National Assembly in October 2006, was returned to the Council of Ministers for review. The bill prescribes criminal penalties for persons who recruit children under 18 years of age, as well as for a range of human rights violations, including abduction and enslavement. In June 2007, Southern Sudan's Child Protection Act of 2006, which prohibits the recruitment of children, passed its first reading in the Southern Sudan Assembly and is now in its second reading. The government does not document or track anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts; nor does it provide specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial personnel. Protection Sudan's Government of National Unity (GNU) made only minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking and focused primarily on the demobilization of child soldiers during the last year. The government continued to have funding and capacity gaps in its own entities involved in combating trafficking, and the GNU continued to demonstrate extremely low levels of cooperation with humanitarian workers in the Darfur region on a broad spectrum of issues, including human trafficking. In 2006, the GNU and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) passed legislation formally establishing the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) Commission, and its Northern and Southern components‚Äîthe Northern Sudan DDR Commission (NSDDRC), and the Southern Sudan DDR Commission (SSDDRC), respectively. During the period, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration commissions were established in the northern cities of Nyala, Geneina, and El Fasher, and provided with staff. However, while the training of staff in child protection and the demobilization and reintegration of children began, the work of these commissions cannot commence in the absence of a clear agreement between the GNU and armed groups as to how to proceed. In 2007, the NSDDRC demobilized 283 children serving with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in South Kordofan. The NSDDRC also facilitated cross- border return to Bentiu of child soldiers demobilized from the SPLA. The staff of the SSDDRC grew to 225 people in 2007 and representatives were posted to all southern states. In contrast to the previous reporting period, SSDDRC staff received salaries and training on child protection, demobilization, reintegration, and family tracing. The SSDDRC, with the coordination of and assistance from UNICEF, demobilized approximately 1,000 child soldiers, including girls, between 2006 and 2007, with 1,500 remaining, including 227 at an SPLA camp in Southern Blue Nile. The SSDDRC continued to register child soldiers throughout the year and coordinated with the NSDDRC to trace and reunify them with their families. The Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC), established in 1999 to facilitate the safe return of abducted women and children to their families, was not operational during the majority of the reporting period. Before March 2008, its most recent retrieval and transport missions took place in January‚ÄìFebruary 2006; since that time, neither the GNU nor the GoSS provided CEAWC with the necessary funding for the transport and reunification of previously identified abductees with their families. However, in early March 2008, the GoSS provided CEAWC with $1 million to resume its program; soon after, CEAWC negotiated the release of 95 individuals in the Nyala region and 71 individuals in the Ed Daein region of South Darfur from their abductors, and transported them to transit centers. However, the return process was fraught with serious protection concerns. Reports indicate that CEAWC's community workers regularly denied social workers from the State Ministries of Social Welfare access to those arriving at the transit centers, and prevented United Nations (UN) staff from interviewing new arrivals, visiting the transit centers, and viewing convoy departure manifests. CEAWC arranged convoys to transport released abductees to the south, but failed to provide access to sufficient food and water. In addition, CEAWC made no preparation to provide for the basic needs or shelter of the former abductees after their arrival in southern Sudan; lacks a mechanism to conduct family tracing or reintegrate abductees into their former communities; and does not follow up with the abductees after their return to assess their well being or the success of their integration. In April 2007, the Governments of Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish claims facilities to compensate Sudanese children who worked as camel jockeys in the U.A.E. for their injuries. In June 2007, three child camel jockeys were repatriated from the U.A.E and received by their extended families. In January 2007, the Khartoum State Police established a child and family protection unit with the support of UNICEF. The unit, which offers various services such as legal aid and psychosocial support, assisted more than 400 child victims of abuse and sexual violence and could potentially provide these services to trafficking victims. Similar units are slated to open in Western Darfur, Ghedaref, and Kassala States. Prevention The government made limited efforts to prevent future incidences of trafficking during the reporting period. The National Council on Child Welfare collaborated with UNICEF to launch a comprehensive child protection awareness campaign in North Kordofan as part of the celebration of the June 2007 Day of the African Child. Aiming to create a much greater community response to grave child rights violations, the campaign was also launched in Darfur, Eastern Sudan, Khartoum, and the three areas, and consists of messages on a number of child protection issues, including unlawful child recruitment and sexual and gender-based violence. Sudan has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

It is also a source country for underage Surinamese girls, and increasingly boys, trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Some of these children are trafficked into the sex trade surrounding gold mining camps in the country‚Äôs interior. Foreign girls and women from Guyana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia are trafficked into Suriname for commercial sexual exploitation; some transit Suriname en route to Europe. Chinese men are subjected to possible debt bondage in Suriname, and are subject to forced labor in supermarkets and the construction sector. Chinese women reportedly are exploited sexually in massage parlors and brothels. Haitian migrants, typically en route to French Guiana, sometimes are forced to work in Surinamese agriculture. The Government of Suriname does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government sustained a moderate level of law enforcement action against trafficking crimes, and modestly improved victim assistance and prevention efforts. However, official complicity with suspected trafficking activity is an area for concern.\\"Suriname\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Surinamese government sustained moderate anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year. Suriname prohibits all forms of human trafficking through its criminal code, prescribing punishment from five to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. These punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. An interagency anti-trafficking in persons working group leads government efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers. During the reporting period, the government convicted a defendant charged with trafficking Brazilian women into prostitution, and sentenced him to 2.5 years in prison. A trial against four brothel owners charged with trafficking women from the Dominican Republic for sexual exploitation continued. In February 2008, police arrested two brothel owners for trafficking Brazilian women into the country; these cases are pending. An anti-trafficking police unit randomly checked brothels for children as well as adults in forced or coerced conditions. Police cooperated with authorities in Guyana and the Dominican Republic on transnational trafficking cases, and sought improved cooperation with Colombia, the Netherlands Antilles, and French Guiana. There were reports that some Surinamese immigration and customs officials facilitated trafficking into the country by accepting bribes. No prosecutions of such trafficking complicity have been initiated, although investigations of these allegations continue. Protection The government made modest improvements to protect victims of trafficking during the year. Police and prosecutors relied chiefly on civil society partners, particularly a recently established NGO, the Trafficking-in- Persons Foundation, to shelter and assist victims. The government assisted these NGOs with finding safe houses to shelter victims, and worked closely with consular representatives from other countries on repatriation efforts. The government also extended services provided to domestic violence victims to trafficking victims, and widely distributed among key personnel an operations manual on how to identify and treat trafficking victims. Surinamese authorities encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. There were reports that some foreign victims were incarcerated and deported for immigration violations. Suriname does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. The government‚Äôs anti-trafficking in persons working group is finalizing draft legislation to provide trafficking victims with temporary residency status. Suriname continued discussions with governments in neighboring Guyana, French Guiana, and Brazil on modalities for repatriating trafficking victims. Prevention The government improved prevention efforts during the reporting period. Senior officials continued to condemn and draw public attention to the problem of human trafficking in Suriname. The government‚Äôs anti-trafficking in persons working group worked with the International Organization for Migration to implement awareness- raising campaigns across the country, reaching approximately 40,000 people. Outreach activities also were directed to the nation‚Äôs border area with Guyana, where many trafficking victims enter the country. Military police, who man ports of entry in this area, were trained on identifying potential trafficking victims. The anti-trafficking in persons working group also issued widespread media warnings about potential trafficking activity after suspicious advertisements were placed in local newspapers recruiting young people to work abroad. However, no discernible government campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts took place during the reporting period. Suriname has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

EWL membership extends to organizations in all 27 EU member states and the three candidate countries, as well as to European-wide bodies. With a secretariat based in Brussels, Belgium, the EWL is one of the longest-standing European level NGOs, and works closely with European institutions and civil society partners. At the international level, the EWL has a consultative status at the Council of Europe, and participates regularly in the activities of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). History European women's organizations had conferences as early as 1982 to create a structure of cooperation within the EEC. Among the leading figures were Fausta Deshormes, Hilde Albertini, Odile Quitin, Liliana Richetta, Helga Thieme, and Jacqueline de Groote. In November 1987 in London, 120 women, members of 85 organizations representing 50 million individual members, came together, and adopted two resolutions. The first called for the \\"creation of a structure for influence, open to all interested women's organizations, to exert pressure on European and national institutions to ensure better defence and representation of women's interest\\". In a second resolution, the delegates called upon the European Commission to \\"lend its support for the organization in early 1988 of a meeting with a view to the implementation of such a structure\\". Support was granted, and the European Women's Lobby and its secretariat in Brussels were formally established in 1990. The EWL was founded in 1990 by Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom national coordinations and 17 large European-wide women's organizations. At the time, just twelve countries formed the European Union, then known as the European Communities (EC). Over the years, as new Member States joined the EC, new national co-ordinations became members of the EWL. While the EU enlarged to countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the EWL established links and cooperation with women's organizations in these countries. The European Women's Lobby was created in response to a growing awareness of the need to defend women's interests at the European level, since: * Equality between women and men is one of the missions of the European Union, which has a strong competence to adopt legislation in this area affecting all women and men living in Europe. * The scope of the European Union's activities were, and continue to be, extending, and affect areas with a direct effect on women's daily lives, particularly with the establishment of the internal market. * It became urgent for women and their organizations to participate in the programs established by the Union, and to get acquainted with European legislation affecting them. * The creation of such an organization, and its designation of lobbying, also corresponds to the particular character of the European-level decision-making process, which allows space for the creation of many organizations, founded to represent all types of interest groups and categories of the public (including various economic sectors as well as trade unions, professional and social grouping). * These organizations were responding to a real need on the part of the European institutions. Contrary to perceived ideas, the number of European officials is low, the institutions therefore often call on experts in the course of their work, due in particular to the diversity of the Member States' people and legislation. * As decision- makers within the European institutions are not directly elected by the citizens, with the exception of the European Parliament, the creation of organizations such as the EWL also corresponds to the need to fill the democratic gap between the EU institutions and the citizens. Theory of change Change does not follow a straight path. It is, however, happening every day because of the passion, vision, and commitment of people working across borders, social groups, and experiences, who are more powerful when they work together. EWL believes change can happen when: * EWL Members and the wider feminist movement work in solidarity with each other across Europe and internationally * We use effective and accessible communication, including digital communications, to shift values and behaviours that discriminate against women * We build awareness, promote feminisms, and empower all citizens to fight patriarchy * Feminist leadership works to eradicate stereotypes and engage men and women to participate in and influence democratic processes * Legislation and public policy support women's equal control over, and access to, spaces, resources, and services Objectives Acting as a forum for increased exchange, cooperation, and integration, EWL exists as a platform to support the women's organizations of Europe to play an active role in shaping a European framework for gender equality. EWL envisions a society in which women's contribution to all aspects of life is recognized, rewarded, and celebrated - in leadership, in care, and in production; in which all women have self-confidence, freedom of choice, and freedom from violence and exploitation; and in which no woman or girl is left behind. The EWL believes in a feminist Europe in which an end to gender inequality is not only possible, but imperative, to achieve the well-being of all people and the planet. Its vision is holistic, transformational socio-economic, based on well-being, equality, social justice, and with a powerful voice against women's poverty. EWL envisions a culture in which women enjoy equal rights and participation in re-imagined power and decision-making structures, in which all forms of violence against women has been eliminated, and women have been liberated from all forms of oppression. EWL's mission is a credible source of expertise and experience on equality between women and men and women's rights, representing the diversity of the women's movement across the European Union; to represent an inclusive, confident, loud, independent feminist voice and bring real women's voices into the EU political arena; to build consensus and mobilize the EWF members' collective experience to work on major issues affecting women, to realize women's rights, equality between women and men, and social justice. To act as a catalyst connecting different actors and organizations to bring change at EU level. In a strategy framework from 2016-2020, the European Women's Lobby, through its member organizations, aims: # To raise more, better, and sustainable funding for women. # To work together effectively at different levels and in different contexts: local, national, European Union, and international. # To promote and debate diversity, advancing consensus, and strengthen our collective voice. # To put an end to all forms of violence against women and girls, and promote a society of peace, human security, and dignity. # To challenge and change the culture of sexism and stereotypes, and promote positive roles for women and men. # To promote the feminist transformation of a sustainable economy based on new economic models based on equality, well-being, care, and social justice. # To position women at the heart of political, social, and economic participation and decision-making. # To ensure sustainable and strong institutional mechanisms for equality between women and men at EU level.

In Taiwanese laws, all nationals with household registration are issued a National Identification Card. The Resident Certificate is issued by the National Immigration Agency. Currently, there are several types of Resident Certificate that reflect the bearer's immigration status. The Alien Resident Certificate (), or ARC, is given to foreign residents in Taiwan, while the nearly identical Taiwan Area Resident Certificate (), or TARC, is given to national without household registration including qualified overseas Taiwanese, qualified overseas Chinese, and recently naturalized nationals. Nationals of the People's Republic of China (including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau) are given Taiwan Area resident certificates with special annotations. Alien Resident Certificate There are various methods of qualifying for an ARC, including undertaking sanctioned employment with a work permit, joining family members (including parents, children and spouses) who are themselves legal residents in the Republic of China, undertaking missionary work, investing in a local business, or studying at an approved institution. The relevant authorities may also choose to grant an ARC to foreigners who fit none of the above categories on an ad hoc basis. The ARC is issued by the National Immigration Agency. The document itself is a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit containing confidential personal data, and costs the applicant NT$1,000 per year. The electronic ARC cards replaced a paper version in 2007‚Äì8, and were intended to \\"not only bring new convenience to foreigners but would also contribute to the government's anti-forgery and anti-terrorism drives.\\" As of October 2009 around 60,000 foreign residents have yet to exchange their old paper ARCs for a new IC card. The paper cards were phased out on 1 February 2010. A multiple entry permit is now included on the card, whereas previously it was stamped separately in the holder's passport. The applicant may apply for a maximum of three years validity for the ARC, with some categories (for example missionary work or study) being limited to a maximum of one year at a time. Some types of ARC (Joining Family or Teaching) require a medical examination conducted at an approved hospital. Besides entitling the bearer to remain in Taiwan for the duration of the certificate's validity, the ARC is also needed to apply for a driving license in Taiwan. There is also an Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (), or APRC available. To obtain the APRC, residence (classed as 183 days or more in a year) must have been maintained for five years. Other conditions apply, including meeting minimum salary or assets requirements, and a criminal record check carried out in the applicant's home country. The fee for an APRC is NT$10,000, and the holder must either remain in the country for 183 days per year or else arrange an exemption with the National Immigration Agency in order to maintain permanent residency. The APRC card itself does not carry an expiration date and thus renewals are not required. The law permitting permanent residency was established in 1999, and the first APRCs were issued in 2000. Taiwan Area Resident Certificate The TARC is issued to national without household registration who reside in Taiwan. These people are qualified as nationals () under Taiwanese nationality law, but do not have valid household registration in Taiwan. Establishing household registration in Taiwan is required for a national over 14 years of age to possess a National Identification Card. In Taiwanese laws, household registration has close ties to exercise civil and political rights like a citizen (). The Taiwanese laws makes a distinction between \\"registered nationals\\" () and \\"unregistered nationals\\" (), with the former having the right of abode, right to vote, and other benefits of citizenship, while the latter are subject to deportation from Taiwan and need an entry permit to visit Taiwan. While \\"registered nationals\\" are entitled to hold the National Identification Card, \\"unregistered nationals\\" may only hold the TARC. Both groups are eligible to hold the Taiwan passport. For adult \\"unregistered nationals\\" to become \\"registered nationals\\", and thus eligible for an ID Card, they must reside in Taiwan for a certain period of time, during which they will hold a TARC instead of an ID Card. Currently, for \\"unregistered nationals\\" who have direct lineal relatives who are \\"registered nationals\\" (e.g. overseas-born Taiwanese) and foreigners who have naturalized as ROC nationals, this period is (1) continuously for one year, (2) 270 days per year for two years, or (3) 183 days per year for five years. Academic and Business Travel Card With the stated aim of attracting exceptional foreign professionals to Taiwan, the government established an Academic and Business Travel Card () in 2009. The card is valid for three years and entitles the bearer to stay in the country for 30 days at a time, with multiple entry permission and priority queueing at immigration when entering and leaving the country. While in Taiwan, the holder can conduct academic or business affairs.

They are the highest salaried staffs among the group C staffs in Indian Railways and get many more benefits. Classification of Loco Pilots and Train Managers  Loco Pilots are Loco Running staffs. How vigorous is the job profile can be noted from this very fact that the Railway recruits persons as 'Assistant Loco Pilot' . They work on freight trains for as long as 10‚Äì12 years. During this tenure they are supposed to work with experienced Loco Pilots and perform only assisting work during the run of a locomotive i.e. a train. An Assistant Loco Pilot thus learns the tactics and dos and don'ts required for train operation. Thereafter they are promoted as 'Loco Pilot Shunter', after proper courses and practical trainings, wherein they are supposed to drive locomotives in sheds/yards at not more than 15 km/h speeds. After experiencing for not less than two years, they are promoted as 'Loco Pilot/Freight', who are always monitored by their respective 'Loco Inspectors'. A train has typical an Assistant Loco Pilot and a Loco Pilot on the Locomotive. The Assistants are normally common but Loco Pilots fall in various categories like Freight Loco Pilots for running Freight trains, Passenger Loco Pilots for running slow moving Passenger Trains, Mail Express Loco Pilot for running high speed Passenger Trains and Rajdhani Loco Pilots for running very high speed passenger trains. There is yet another category of crew called 'Shunters' who operate only in yards, for moving trains within a particular station yard. Normally Shunters work alone without an Assistant. A Loco Pilot works on a particular train under the guidance of the Train Manager of the train, like train route, limited train speed, prediction of signalling error, sufficient brake power, safety etc. The train at the rear end has Train Manager as its crew, he is the head of the running train. Train Managers are Traffic Running Staffs. They work on freight trains (goods and parcel trains) for 5‚Äì6 years, after that they are promoted to passenger trains, then mail & express trains, Rajdhani & Shatabdi trains. Earlier working scenario The job of a Loco Pilot consists of irregular rest and working hours, eating disorders, and sleep disorders. That is why the Railway spends a lot on their trainings and resting time. They are booked from a crew changing point, informed well in advance, after ensuring that they have taken sufficient rest and completed all required trainings and requirements, those are mandatory for train operation. At the end of the journey, they are sent to well maintained rest rooms, given meals (home cooked) and rebooked back to their headquarters after giving minimum stipulated rest. Latest developments Centre for Railway Information Systems New Delhi, an IT development unit for Indian Railways, has developed a software named 'Crew Management System', wherein bookings of this sensitive category of people, which was done manually till now and monitored at various levels by Inspectors and Officers, is arranged through software. Crew Management System(CMS) is a unique system in which accuracy and monitoring is automatically maintained. The software system was rolled out in December 2007 and already installed at about 2200 data entry nodes at over 290 crew booking points. These are spread over entire Indian Railways. CMS at present has a database covering 89,000 crew members and over 30000 crew members are being booked daily through the system. The work has been completed and provided with Thin clients connected to a server cluster at CRIS, wherein all the functions like crew bookings, call served to crews, their signing on duties are done through computers after ensuring their rest,training and medical particulars. The job which was done manually till a few years back is now monitored automatically. Not only it has a single data base of all the running staff of Indian Railways, but also have an all around reports(more than 500 reports of these crews are visible to the monitoring authorities of the Railways). All the officers sitting in their offices can monitor performance reports of the train operating staff.

It was the ancestral seat of the Counts of Tyrol and gave the whole Tyrol region its name.  History  The castle hill has been inhabited since ancient times. Several artefacts and one field of graves from the early Middle Ages have been identified. Archeologists have excavated a church with three apses dating from the early Christian period. The first castle was built before 1100. The second construction phase including the keep dates to 1139/40. A third phase of construction took place in the second half of the 13th century under Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol. In 1347 Meinhard's granddaughter Countess Margaret of Tyrol was besieged here by the forces of the Luxembourg king Charles IV. The castle remained the seat of Tyrol's sovereigns until 1420, when the Habsburg archduke Frederick IV moved the administrative seat to Innsbruck north of the Brenner Pass. In modern times parts of the castle fell into the so-called \\"K√∂stengraben\\", a steep gorge. It was even sold in order to be used as a quarry. In the 19th century the castle was restored; the keep was rebuilt in 1904. Regarding art history, the frescos of the castle's chapel are of special interest as well as two Romanesque portals with opulent marble sculptures showing legendary creatures, religious themes, and geometric ornaments.Gerhard Seebach (1995). \\"Die romanischen Portale auf Burg Tirol.

It is designed to be sailed by two people and can achieve speeds of up to 20 knots. This is reflected in its Portsmouth Yardstick of 805 and D-PN of 76.3 History The Dart 18 was designed in 1975 as a One Design Class by Rodney March, who was also responsible for the design of the Olympic Tornado class catamaran. The very first Dart 18, designed and built in Falmouth, Cornwall, is now owned by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. Up to the present, a number of improvements have been made, but the original concept was preserved though strict class rules. More than 8350 boats have been built up to 2016, which are sailed in more than 16 nations on 4 continents. Since 2012, Windsport International holds the worldwide licence to build the Dart 18. The boats are manufactured since 2005 at Collins Fibreglass Plastics in South Africa and in Europe. The World Championship results can be found here. Design The hulls of the Dart 18 are similar to most sailing catamarans, but without centreboards. Instead, the lower part of the hulls have skegs typical for a beach catamaran. The hull material is glassfibre. Both hulls are filled with flotation inserts to preserve buoyancy in case of damage. The inside of each hull can be reached through a hatch cover located at the rear of each hull. The boat is assembled by attaching the main and rear beams to the hulls with spring-loaded retaining clips, and lacing the trampoline to the beams and hulls. The two rudders are removable without tools, retract on impact with the beach, and can be locked in the up position. The rigging consists of a rotating mast held by a forestay and two shroud wires. The shrouds can be adjusted by simply moving the bolts in the chainplates. The Dart 18 mast does not have spreaders. There is a trapeze for the crew. The mainsail does not have a boom, has nine full battens, and is controlled by a main sheet with a 7:1 mechanical advantage. The jib sail has two short battens, and is controlled by a jib sheet with a 2:1 mechanical advantage. The main sheet block and both jib sheet blocks have a ratchet and a cleat. A gennaker sail can be added, but is not legal for racing. This is usually combined with a jib furling system. The boat can also be sailed by one person, without a foresail, with a D-PN of 78.7. 300px See also * List of multihulls ReferencesExternal links *UK Dart 18 Catamaran Association *SA Dart 18 Catamaran Association *ISAF 2016 class report for the Dart 18 *National Maritime Museum Cornwall *Windsport, supplier of Dart18 boats and parts Classes of World Sailing Catamarans Dinghies 1970s sailboat type designs ","title":"Dart 18"},{"id":"18629488","text":"Kamal Kumar Majumdar () (17 November 1914 ‚Äì 9 February 1979) was a major fiction-writer of the Bengali language.

Prafullachandra used to serve in the police department. Renukamoyee had keen literary interest and thus Kamalkumar was exposed to modern literary thoughts and trends from his childhood. His parents were originally from Taki, a town in the 24 Parganas district (now in North 24 Parganas district), but the family shifted to Rikhia. Kamalkumar spent his childhood and adolescence in Kolkata, India. He started his studies in a school called \\"Shiksha Sangha\\" in Bishnupur but dropped formal studies before completing high school. For sometime, he studied Sanskrit in a Tol and learned sitar from a local maestro. In 1937 he established a magazine called \\"Ushnish\\" where he used to write under his real name as well as a number of pen names. But during 1944‚Äì45 he devoted himself mostly to painting. During 1937‚Äì38 he got numerous offers for going abroad which he refused. Kamal Kumar was married to Dayamayee Majumdar and his younger brother was a renowned painter, Nirode Mazumdar. Their younger sister Shanu Lahiri (1928 ‚Äì 2013) was also a noted painter and art educator.

A user-interface may also provide context sensitive feedback, such as changing the appearance of the mouse pointer or cursor, changing the menu color, or with auditory or tactile feedback. Reasoning and advantages of context sensitivity The primary reason for introducing context sensitivity is to simplify the user interface. Advantages include: * Reduced number of commands required to be known to the user for a given level of productivity. * Reduced number of clicks or keystrokes required to carry out a given operation. * Allows consistent behaviour to be pre-programmed or altered by the user. * Reduces the number of options needed on screen at one time. =Disadvantages= Context sensitive actions may be perceived as dumbing down of the user interface - leaving the operator at a loss as to what to do when the computer decides to perform an unwanted action. Additionally non-automatic procedures may be hidden or obscured by the context sensitive interface causing an increase in user workload for operations the designers did not foresee. A poor implementation can be more annoying than helpful ‚Äì a classic example of this is Office Assistant. Implementation At the simplest level each possible action is reduced to a single most likely action ‚Äì the action performed is based on a single variable (such as file extension). In more complicated implementations multiple factors can be assessed such as the user's previous actions, the size of the file, the programs in current use, metadata etc. The method is not only limited to the response to imperative button presses and mouse clicks - pop-up menus can be pruned and/or altered, or a web search can focus results based on previous searches. At higher levels of implementation context sensitive actions require either larger amounts of meta-data, extensive case analysis based programming, or other artificial intelligence algorithms. =In computer and video games= Context sensitivity is important in video games ‚Äì especially those controlled by a gamepad, joystick or computer mouse in which the number of buttons available is limited. It is primarily applied when the player is in a certain place and is used to interact with a person or object. For example, if the player is standing next to a non-player character, an option may come up allowing the player to talk with him/her. Implementations range from the embryonic 'Quick Time Event' to context sensitive sword combat in which the attack used depends on the position and orientation of both the player and opponent, as well as the virtual surroundings. A similar range of use is found in the 'action button' which, depending upon the in-game position of the player's character, may cause it to pick something up, open a door, grab a rope, punch a monster or opponent, or smash an object. The response does not have to be player activated - an on-screen device may only be shown in certain circumstances, e.g. 'targeting' cross hairs in a flight combat game may indicate the player should fire. An alternative implementation is to monitor the input from the player (e.g. level of button pressing activity) and use that to control the pace of the game in an attempt to maximize enjoyment or to control the excitement or ambience.Next Generation User Interfaces (A MIT Computer Science Masters Thesis by Eitan Glinert) The method has become increasingly important as more complex games are designed for machines with few buttons (keyboard- less consoles). Bennet Ring commented (in 2006) that \\"Context-sensitive is the new lens flare\\".Gears of War review - Now this is what next-gen gaming is all about =Context-sensitive help= Context sensitive help is a common implementation of context sensitivity, a single help button is actioned and the help page or menu will open a specific page or related topic.Webopedia : Help See also * Context awareness * Autocomplete * Autofill * Autotype * Combo box * DWIM \\"Do What I Mean\\" * Principle of least astonishment (PLA/POLA) * Quick time event (QTE) References=CitationsSources=  Human‚Äìcomputer interaction Ergonomics Video game design Artificial intelligence applications ","title":"Context-sensitive user interface"},{"id":"18629511","text":"Runova X Handover is the second mini album released by Nico Touches the Walls in October 18, 2006.

During the 17th to 19th centuries the term was widely applied to lines of entrenchment that are usually formed in a saw-tooth pattern, known as indented lines, particularly during sieges.pp.68-71, Mahan, Hart & Prud'homm These lines are usually employed on banks of rivers, or on ground which is more elevated than, or which commands, that of the enemy. The defense of these lines is sometimes strengthened by double redans, and flat bastions constructed at intervals, along their front.For.

Its shape has been described as a \\"string of beads\\" connected by a very fine thread. It is considered one of the oldest known eukaryotes. Horodyskia apparently re- arranged itself into fewer but larger main masses as the sediment grew deeper round its base. left  Biology  Comparisons of different fossils in the same locations suggest that it rearranged itself into fewer but larger main masses as the sediment grew deeper round its base. It may also have had a series of holdfasts along the bottom of the thread. Dimple marks in offshore sandstone have been found in the same deposits as Horodyskia, suggesting that they may be remnants of older holdfasts. Thin sections of Horodyskia have revealed a system of tubes within the beads, including connecting strings, and other tubes radiating outward from each bead. Partial burial and branching of these tubes suggest that it may have had a benthic sessile lifestyle. Members of the genus are distinguished by bead size and spacing, with the beads of H. moniliformis being larger and more spaced than H. williamsii.  Distribution  Species of Horodyskia has been found in Western Australia, Southern China, and in parts of North America, They are found in siliciclastic rocks such as sandstone, often as casts or molds.  Classification  Like many Precambrian organisms, the biology of Horodyskia is still poorly understood. As a result, it is difficult to classify what type of organism it may have been.

This is a violation against the Instrument of Government, the main part of the constitution of Sweden. Swedish public administration is dualistic, meaning governmental departments are under the direct control of a minister, but the administrative authorities (or government agencies in other words) under these departments are ostensibly autonomous. The agencies work according to laws and rules decided on by the Riksdag, but apply them on their own accord. So while the agencies are formally associated with some department, a minister cannot exert control over these agencies on individual matters, and they do not have the authority to direct daily operations. Ministers are thus expressly prohibited to intervene in matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of an agency's authority, quite unlike the situation in many other countries. If the government believes that an agency has not applied the law correctly, its only remedy is to change the relevant legislation. The reasoning behind this is to prevent government corruption and to ensure that laws and regulations are applied equally. It also incentivises the Government and Riksdag to get rid of hard-to-interpret or problematic laws and regulations. There are rare exceptions to this distinction, such as when a natural disaster or war occurs and there is a need for a shorter chain of command. Government-owned commercial companies are not formally covered by the rule of Ministerstyre. However, the government still generally instructs them to maintain themselves in a commercial way and turn a profit. This can create conflicts. How government agencies are governed The agencies do not have complete freedom to interpret the law and the government has a right to influence the agencies, but only through strictly general policy instruments which are described in the constitution. These instruments are: * Acts of Law and Other Provisions ‚Äì This includes laws adopted by the Riksdag and ordinances issued by the Government (). They are interpreted by courts of law. * Financial Power ‚Äì The Government Offices issues a letter of appropriation () once a year, based on the budget set by the Riksdag, which regulates the general activities and overall objectives for an agency. * Power of Appointment ‚Äì The Government decides on the employment of agency heads, deputy directors-general and county directors. Special rules apply for the appointment and dismissal of permanent salaried judges and other positions, where independence is of vital importance. * Parliamentary Control ‚Äì This is done by the Swedish National Audit Office, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chancellor of Justice and the administrative courts.

Previous MP  Ernest Evans The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Ernest Evans (1885‚Äì1965) had been appointed a county court Judge in 1942. Evans was admitted to the bar in 1910 and became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1937. After serving as private secretary to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George, he was elected as Coalition Liberal MP for Cardiganshire at a by- election in 1921. He held the seat at the 1922 general election as a National Liberal candidate, but was defeated standing as a Liberal at the 1923 general election by the Independent Liberal Rhys Hopkin Morris. Evans did not stand again in Cardiganshire, but at the 1924 general election he defeated the Christian pacifist George Maitland Lloyd Davies to win the University of Wales constituency as a Liberal.  Candidates  The election took place during the Second World War. Under an agreement between the Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties, who were participating in a wartime coalition, the party holding a seat would not be opposed by the other two at a by-election. Accordingly, the Liberal Party nominated a candidate, but no Labour or Conservative representative was put forward. Plaid Cymru, which was not a party to the electoral agreement, selected a candidate and three independent candidates also stood; so a contested poll took place. The list of candidates below is set out in descending order of the number of votes received at the by-election. = Liberal Party = The Liberal Party candidate was Professor William John Gruffydd (1881‚Äì1954), who was Professor of Celtic at University College, Cardiff from 1918 until 1946 and then an emeritus professor. He was editor of Y Llenor (\\"The Literary Man\\") from 1922 until 1951. Gruffydd came from a nonconformist, radical family, and took an interest in Welsh politics and social questions. He was at one time a member of Plaid Cymru and served as its deputy vice-president in 1937. Gruffydd had voiced doubts about Plaid Cymru party president Saunders Lewis' ideas since 1933,A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 610 and by 1943 he had joined the Liberal party. The \\"brilliant but wayward\\" Gruffydd was a favourite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals.A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 610 Gruffydd was elected to Parliament as a Liberal MP for the University of Wales seat on 29 January 1943. He and Saunders Lewis had effectively split the Welsh-speaking community.A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 610 He was comfortably re- elected in the 1945 general election and sat until the abolition of University seats in 1950. He did not stand again for Parliament. = Plaid Cymru = Representing Plaid Cymru in the by-election was its President, (John) Saunders Lewis, who had previously contested the University seat at the 1931 general election. Lewis (15 October 1893 ‚Äì 1 September 1985) was a Welsh poet, dramatist, historian, literary critic and political activist. He was a prominent Welsh nationalist and founder of the Welsh National Party (Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru, later known as Plaid Cymru). Lewis is usually acknowledged as among the most prominent figures of 20th century Welsh-language literature. Lewis was a 1970 Nobel nominee for literature, and in 2005 came 10th in a BBC Wales poll for Wales' \\"greatest-ever person\\". The election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, and he retired from direct political involvement.A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 611 However, the experience proved invaluable for Plaid Cymru, as they began to refer to themselves, as \\"for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force.A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 611\\" The by-election campaign led directly to \\"considerable growth\\" in the party's membership.A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 611 = Others = * Alun Talfan Davies (22 July 1913 ‚Äì 11 November 2000) was a Welsh lawyer, writer and publisher, the brother of Aneirin Talfan Davies. A former member of Plaid Cymru, he stood as an Independent candidate in the by-election. He subsequently contested Carmarthen in the 1959 and 1964 general elections, as well as Denbigh in 1966. In all of these other contests he stood as a Liberal candidate.F.W.S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949 and 1950-1973. The index to candidates in the latter volume confirms A.T. Davies was the same man as the Alun T. Davies who contested the by-election. * The more successful of the two Independent Labour candidates contesting the by- election was Evan Davies, who did not contest any other Parliamentary elections. * The second placed Independent Labour candidate, who finished bottom of the poll at the by-election, was N.L.

Agon Sh≈´ and Hinayana  Agon Sh≈´ believes that it takes its principles directly from the Buddha's teachings, which in the original Sanskrit language are called the Agamas or the Agama Sutras, literally meaning \\"the teaching of the Buddha\\". According to Agon Sh≈´, these sutras are the true records of the teachings of Gautama Buddha, whereas Mahayana Buddhism is a deviation from the original teachings of the Buddha. The word Hinayana, meaning \\"Lesser Vehicle\\" is rejected as a derogatory term. In particular, members of Agon Sh≈´ trace their practices to the Agon Sutras, in which the Buddha is reported to have taught his disciples a method known as the \\"Seven Systems and 37 practices for attaining Supreme Wisdom.\\" Seiy≈´ Kiriyama The founder of Agon Sh≈´, Masao Tsutsumi, was born in 1921 in Yokohama. His poor health prevented him from serving in the army, and he survived through several odd jobs. In 1953, he was accused of producing alcohol illegally and arrested. He prepared to commit suicide in jail but changed his mind at the last minute, later attributing this to an intervention of the bodhisattva of compassion Juntei-Kannon, who entrusted him with a religious mission. Claiming he was guided and directed by Kannon, he changed his name to Seiy≈´ Kiriyama in 1955 and founded the Kannon Jikei-kai (Society of the Mercy of Kannon Bosatsu). He developed friendly relations with the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Y≈çgen-in temple in Kyoto, and established the headquarters of its society near the temple. In 1970, he claimed he had received a new revelation from Juntei-Kannon, who told him that he should institute goma fire rituals to pacify the spirits of the dead and liberate the living from their bad karma. In 1978, Kiriyama announced the \\"discovery\\" that the Agamas are the keys to Buddha's teachings, and that Buddhist groups that do not recognize this mislead their followers. In 1980, Kiriyama visited the holy Buddhist site of Sahet Mahet and reported that the Buddha has appeared to him and passed to him the mantle of leader of universal Buddhism. These events led Kiriyama to establish and promote Agon Sh≈´, founded in 1978, as a new global Buddhist movement and build a \\"new Sahel Mahet\\" in Yamashina-ku, Kyoto. In 1986, Kiriyama received from the president of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayewardene, what he believed was a true relic of Buddha. He claimed that most of the other relics of Buddha venerated in Japan were false, and that devotees should pray in their homes before a miniature version of the relic's casket venerated at Agon Sh≈´'s headquarters in Kyoto. The fame of the relic and of the fire rituals attracted many new devotees, and membership of Agon Sh≈´ grew to 500,000, thanks also to the fact that Kiriyama was one of the first religious leaders in Japan to hire a public relations company, Dentsu, to help him spreading his message. Meanwhile, Kiriyama devoted himself to the study of divination, the Lotus Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism, and to writing several books. Agon Sh≈´ was among the first religious movements in Japan incorporating in its teachings the prophecies of Nostradamus. In 1989, Agon Sh≈´ had 1,358 priests, serving about 580,000 believers, some of them attending the movement's services via the Internet.World Christian Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2001, vol 2, page 11 In 1995, the Tokyo subway sarin attack perpetrated by Aum Shinrikyo led to a hostile attitude in Japan towards new religious movements in general, and particularly affected Agon Sh≈´ when it became known that Aum Shinrikyo's founder, Shoko Asahara, had been for a short time a member of Kiriyama's movement. Scholars Ian Reader and Erica Baffelli suggested that to distantiate himself from Asahara, Kiriyama in his later years emphasized Japanese nationalism and devoted several rituals to pacify the souls of Japanese soldiers who died during World War II. After Kiriyama's death The same scholars, Reader and Baffelli, have studied what they believe is a transformation of Agon Sh≈´ after the death of Kiriyama in 2016 by his successors, senior priest Fukada Seia and chief female disciple Wada Naoko, into a cult of its founder, with Kiriyama's relics becoming increasingly more important than those of the Buddha, and with his messages from the spirit world received by some of the movement's leaders becoming normative sacred texts.

Description Crossing-the-bridge noodles has over 100-year history and it was listed as an intangible cultural heritage of Kunming city in 2008 to promote Yunnan food culture. The dish is served with a large bowl of boiling hot broth and soup. The soup is made with chicken, pork bone and seasoning, such as Chinese star anise and ginger. Also, using a layer of chicken fat to insulate the soup and keep it warm for longer. These ingredients are separated. The soup ingredients are served on a cutting board or plate and include raw vegetables and lightly cooked meats. Common ingredients include thin slices of turkey, chunks of chicken, chicken skin, strips of bean curd sheets, chives, sprouts and rice noodles. Once added into the broth, it cooks quickly with a layer of melted chicken fat and oil glistening on top. The soup takes a few minutes to cook, and it is then spooned out into small bowls. Jim Thurman of LA Weekly writes that \\"with the rice noodles and fresh chicken, it's reminiscent of an extremely subtle version of Vietnamese pho ga [chicken pho]. Which shouldn't surprise anyone, as Yunnan shares a border with Vietnam.\\" Claims of name origin \\"Crossing the bridge\\" sometimes refers to transferring rice noodles into the soup bowl One story that has gained traction begins with a scholar who was studying hard for his imperial exams on a small island. His wife, who would bring him food, found that by the time she had crossed the bridge to the island the soup would be cold and the noodles were soggy. She then decided to load a large earthen pot with boiling broth with a layer of oil on top that would act as insulation and keep the broth warm. The noodles and other ingredients were kept in a separate container, and when she arrived, she mixed the two containers together for a warm soup. Another claim regarding the origin of the name comes from the way the ingredients are transferred between containers. The process is similar to crossing a bridge between bowls, and hence it is called \\"crossing-the-bridge\\" noodles. There are reportedly many other variations on the origin of the name. Varieties The main ingredient of the noodles is rice. Rice vermicelli production differs in different regions. In Kunming and Yunnan, there are two varieties: \\"dry paste\\" and \\"sour paste\\". The production process differs depending on individual preferences and tastes. \\"Sour paste\\", as the name suggests, tastes a little sour, but is characterized by a relatively thick and soft rice noodle. The \\"dry paste\\" does not have the sourness of the sour paste, and the noodle is relatively thin and more rigid. Older people in Kunming think the \\"sour paste\\" noodles are more authentic. Most people in Yunnan think the Kunming noodle does not satisfy their taste buds, and generally believe Mengzi County and Jianshui County makes better noodles. Now, as people's tastes change, all kinds of noodle varieties are flooding onto the market. Kunming people now do not necessarily pick a \\"dry paste\\" or \\"sour paste.\\" At present, people prefer the more efficient, slippery \\"water-washed rice noodle\\" and \\"purple rice noodle\\", one that is mixed with purple rice. Status The development of crossing-the- bridge noodles has changed people's eating habits over the years, especially breakfasts. Generally in street markets, the hot fresh rice noodle is put into a bowl of boiling water for about half a minute and then colored sauce is added to the bowl. This is known as the \\"hat\\" of the sauce. Crossing-the- bridge noodles served in markets in the morning are usually completed in one minute. There are a few franchised restaurants which serve more intricate or elaborate crossing-the-bridge noodle dishes. Ingredients The general ingredients of guoqiao mixian include: raw quail eggs, turkey slices, chicken slices, and colored vegetables. Crossing-the-bridge noodles are generally served first with a bowl of boiling hot soup. The attendants will then be on the other side of the bowl and put the ingredients into the bowl, generally in order from raw to cooked: meat first, then quail eggs, and then vegetables. Finally, they perform the noodle \\"crossing\\" with chopsticks and the dish is ready to be consumed. The amount of oil, chili, vinegar, and soy sauce one puts in the bowl varies according to personal taste.

Once believed to be a member of the Local Group of galaxies, it is now known to belong to a separate group, the IC 342/Maffei Group. It was named after Paolo Maffei, who discovered it and the neighboring Maffei 2 in 1967 via their infrared emissions. Maffei 1 is a slightly flattened core type elliptical galaxy. It has a boxy shape and is made mainly of old metal-rich stars. It has a tiny blue nucleus in which stars continue to form. Like all large ellipticals it contains a significant population of globular clusters. Maffei 1 is situated at an estimated distance of 3‚Äì4 Mpc from the Milky Way. It may be the closest giant elliptical galaxy. Maffei 1 lies in the Zone of Avoidance and is heavily obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust. If it were not obscured, it would be one of the largest (about 3/4 the size of the full moon), brightest, and best-known galaxies in the sky. It can be observed visually, using a 30‚Äì35 cm or bigger telescope under a very dark sky. Discovery The Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei was one of the pioneers of infrared astronomy. In the 1950s and 60s, in order to obtain high quality images of celestial objects in the very near infrared part of the spectrum (the I-band, 680‚Äì880 nm), he used chemically hyper-sensitized standard Eastman emulsions I-N. To achieve the hyper-sensitization he immersed them in 5% ammonia solution for 3‚Äì5 minutes. This procedure increased their sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Between 1957 and 1967 Maffei observed many different objects using this technique, including globular clusters and planetary nebulae. Some of those objects were not visible at all on blue light (250‚Äì500 nm) sensitive plates. The galaxy Maffei 1 was discovered on a hyper-sensitized I-N photographic plate exposed on 29 September 1967 with the Schmidt telescope at Asiago Observatory. Maffei found Maffei 1, together with its companion spiral galaxy Maffei 2, while searching for diffuse nebulae and T Tauri stars. The object had an apparent size up to 50‚Ä≥ in the near infrared but was not visible on the corresponding blue light sensitive plate. Its spectrum lacked any emission or absorption lines. Later it was shown to be radio-quiet as well. In 1970 Hyron Spinrad suggested that Maffei 1 is a nearby heavily obscured giant elliptical galaxy. Maffei 1 would be among the ten brightest galaxies in the northern sky if not situated behind the Milky Way. Distance Maffei 1 is located only 0.55¬∞ from the galactic plane in the middle of the zone of avoidance and suffers from about 4.7 magnitudes of extinction (a factor of about 1/70) in visible light. In addition to extinction, observation of Maffei 1 is further hindered by the fact that it is covered by myriads of faint Milky Way stars, which can easily be confused with its own. As a result, determining its distance has been particularly difficult. In 1971, soon after its discovery, Hyron Spinrad estimated the distance to Maffei 1 at about 1 Mpc, which would place it within the Local Group of galaxies. In 1983 this estimate was revised up to 2.1 Mpc by Ronald Buta and Marshall McCall using the general relation between the luminosity and velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. That distance puts Maffei 1 well outside the Local Group, but close enough to have influenced it in the past. In 1993 Gerard Luppino and John Tonry used surface brightness fluctuations to derive a new distance estimate to Maffei 1 of . Later in 2001, Tim Davidge and Sidney van den Bergh used adaptive optics to observe the brightest asymptotic giant branch stars in Maffei 1 and concluded that it is located at the distance 4.4 Mpc from the Sun. The latest determination of the distance to Maffei 1, which is based on the re-calibrated luminosity/velocity dispersion relation for the elliptical galaxies and the updated extinction, is . The larger (‚â•3 Mpc) distances reported in the past 20 years would imply that Maffei 1 has never been close enough to the Local Group to significantly influence its dynamics. Maffei 1 moves away from the Sun at the speed of about 66 km/s. Its velocity relative to the Local Group's center of mass is, however, 297 km/s away. That means that Maffei 1 participates in the general expansion of the Universe. Physical properties=Size and shape= The surface brightness profile of Maffei 1 in the blue (B-band) and near infrared (I-band) light Maffei 1 is a massive elliptical galaxy classified as type E3 in the Hubble classification scheme. This means that it is slightly flattened, its semi-minor axis being 70% of its semi-major axis. Maffei 1 has also a boxy shape (E(b)3 type), while its central region (radius ‚âà 34 pc) is deficient in light emission as compared to the r1/4 law, meaning that Maffei 1 is a core type elliptical. Both the boxy shape and the presence of an underluminous core are typical of intermediate to massive ellipticals. The apparent dimensions of Maffei 1 depend strongly on the wavelength of light because of the heavy obscuration by the Milky Way. In blue light it is 1‚Äì2‚Ä≤ across while in the near infrared its major axis reaches 23‚Ä≤‚Äîmore than 3/4 of the Moon's diameter. At a distance of 3 Mpc this corresponds to approximately 23 kpc. The total visible absolute magnitude of Maffei 1, MV=‚àí20.8, is comparable to that of the Milky Way. Maffei 1 is the bluish elliptical object near the bottom-right corner. =Nucleus= Maffei 1 possesses a tiny blue nucleus at its center approximately 1.2 pc across. It contains about 29 solar masses of ionized hydrogen. This implies that it has undergone recent star formation. There are no signs of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the center of Maffei 1. The X-ray emission from the center is extended and likely comes from a number of stellar sources. =Stars and stellar clusters= Maffei 1 is mainly made of old metal-rich stars more than 10 billion years in age. As a large elliptical galaxy, Maffei 1 is expected to host a significant population of globular clusters (about 1100). However, due to heavy intervening absorption, ground- based observations for a long time failed to identify any of them. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2000 revealed about 20 globular cluster candidates in the central region of the galaxy. Later infrared observations from telescopes on the ground also found a population of bright globular cluster candidates. Group membership Maffei 1 is a principal member of a nearby group of galaxies. The group's other members are the giant spiral galaxies IC 342 and Maffei 2. Maffei 1 has also a small satellite spiral galaxy Dwingeloo 1 as well as a number of dwarf satellites like MB1. The Group is one of the closest galaxy groups to the Milky Way galaxy.

Biography On April 24, 1646, 63 Ruthenian priests (under Parfenii's and eparch Vasyl Tarasovych leadership) solicited and performed a union with the Catholic Church. However, they required the preservation of the Byzantine Rite, Canon law and the ecclesiastical authority, based on the principles of Orthodox governance (an independent choice of the bishops).atravellerincarpathia.com Parfenii after the Union of Uzhhorod of the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo became its first eparch (1651 - 1665). Ok January 15, 1652, Petro Parfenii personally handed over to Rome the protocol on the conclusion of Union oh Uzhhorod of 1646. The Catholic Church recognized Parfenii as bishop in 1655 (due to Parfenii's ordination by an Orthodox metropolitan in 1651). In 1664, Parfenii established himself in Mukacheve. Parfenii died in 1665. Historical facts On May 14, 1648 Archbishop of Esztergom Gy√∂rgy Lippay assured the Ukrainian clergy of the Shariish, Zemplinsky and Uzhansky Committees connected with the Roman Church that it would have church immunity (protection). The bishopric's custody of the higher Catholic circles of Hungary dates back to 1651 when the Transylvanian Orthodox Archbishop of Dulofegirvar (now Alba Julia in Romania) Stefan Shimonovich (1643-1654), together with Moldavian Gregory and Bystrytsky Savva, was ordained to the Mukachevo eparch of the united monk of Petro Parfenii (Petrovich), as explained. E.-Kr. Suttner, in order \\"to save the union, and thereby guarantee to the Eastern Church local the support of the Catholics to counter calvinists.\\" =Confirmation of the chirotony= The then primate of the Catholic Church of Hungary, the Archbishop of Esztergom Gy√∂rgy Lippai, considered the ordination of a Uniate priest to be a non-Russian metropolitan in the given circumstances, and on September 5 of that year appointed bishop Partenii as the visiting agent for all Greek Catholics residing in Hungary. Lippai stood up for the newly-ordained ruler in Rome with a petition to be released from all church punishments, and assured that the hierarch, who committed the consecration, knew about the Uniate origin of the candidate. Archbishop Shimonovich himself, having given the consecration, testified in the letter of the proclamation issued by Peter Partenius on the ordination, that the basis for the ordination was the candidate's document confirming that the Hungarian primate had entrusted him a pastoral service among the Rusyns in Upper Hungary. Pope Alexander VII on June 8, 1655 instructed Lippay to endorse Parfenii in the bishopric and frees him from punishment. The order of Pope was fulfilled by Lippai on July 22 of the same year. The King of Hungary and the Austrian emperor Leopold I, on the basis of his right to patronage on October 23, 1659, assigned Parfenii as eparch of Mukachevo bishop. Among the 24 documents published in the work of the researcher A. Godinka about the activities of Petro Parfenii was the meeting of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on October 2, 1651, in what Cardinal Trivulzio reported that the Archbishop of Estergom had requested the founding of a bishopric for the Hungarian Rusyns. After that, the Cardinal decided to turn to the pope. On seven issues of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on July 2, 1654, the Archbishop of Esztergom Gy√∂rgy Lippai sent a detailed report to Rome, which became the first, albeit the general, official written document on the then Church position of the Rusyns. In its content it is worthwhile to stay in more detail. It follows from this that \\"nobody was worried, nobody protected the interests of the Rusyns as schismatics\\", which there are more than 200 thousand souls of the Greek rite in the territory of Spizh to Maramorosh (along 70 miles). For them, religious practices are conducted by about 600 priests who do not speak the Latin language. In addition to them, 24 more are on the territory of the Eger and its bishopric, and 45 on the territory of the Spassky Committee, which belongs to the Metropolitan of Esztergom. All of these unconnected priests, from time immemorial, had their bishop in Mukachevo. The work of converting these schismatics to the Catholic Church through the adoption of the union was begun by the Egerian bishops Gy√∂rgy Lippai and Gy√∂rgy Yakushech who, with the help of the already united Basilian monks, Peter Partenius and Gavril Kosovich (Kosovitsky), first turned 63 into the Union, and shortly thereafter 400 altar brothers. Mukachevo eparchy is composed by Humenna, Uzhhorod and Makovitsa, that is, composed by the priests of the Spishsky, Shariish, Zemplinsky and Uzhansky Comitates. =Issues of jurisdiction= During the presentation of information to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith of the Catholic Church's hometown in Hungary, the issue of the jurisdiction of the Mukachevo eparch and the episcopate also applies. In his view, recent schismatics had their episcopate of the Greek rite, which was not dependent on either the Bishop of Eger, or the Archbishop of Estergom. The Bishop of Mukachevo of the Greek rite can not be subordinated to the Eparchian Latin Bishop, since one bishop is independent of the other. Therefore, the Archbishop of Esztergom tried to ensure that all the schismatics of Hungary, Rusyns and Volks, who have their priests of the Greek rite on the territory of the Estergom and Yavrinskaya (apparently Egersky - VF) dioceses subordinated themselves to the bishop Parfenii's authority, \\"and the bishop himself was subordinated, as if his Metropolitan or Primate, to ter Archbishop of Esztergom\\". After Perro Parfenii returned to unity with the Catholic Church, he became the first Uniate bishop, who in 1659 Emperor Leopold I, using his royal right of patronage (iuris patronatus), officially called eparch of Mukachevo. In opposition to the intentions of the primate of Lippai, the owner of the Mukachevo castle, Sofia Batory, became the owner of the Catholic Church after the death of her husband, the Protestant prince Dordoi II of Rakhodia in 1660. For protection, the envelope appealed to the Metropolitan of Kiev, through his Jesuit confessor about. At the end of 1662, the Princess asked Stefan Milly for the Kyivan Uniate Metropolitan Gabriel Kolenda (1655-1674) to ordain and send a bishop to Mukachevo. At the synod of the Metropolitanate of Kyiv in Zhivortsy in 1663, it was decided to ordain an eparch to the eparch of Mukachevo, but with the condition that the given diocese would be subordinated to the metropolitan. When Sofia Batory found out that with the official appeal to Rome about subordination of the Mukachevo diocese to the Kyivan Metropolitanate, the Synod sent Bishop of Kholm to Yakov Sushu (1652-1687), she changed her mind. Considering that the Mukachevo's eparch should belong to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Esztergom, and the subordination to Kiev was not raised, in the summer of 1664 Sofia Bator called for the Uniate Bishop of Parfenii establish himself in Mukachevo. Meanwhile, three-year effort to persuade the Holy See to subordinate the eparchy of Mukachevo to the jurisdiction of the Kyiv Metropolitanate was not successful. =Changes after the death of the bishop= After the Parfenii's death, an eparch who enjoyed the respect of the masses, the time has come to weaken the episcopal authorities. During the 60's and 80's of the XVII Ventura, bishops were eight people - immigrants from Galicia, Serbia and Subcarpathian Rus. Often there were disputes over religious and economic issues, and nobody was interested in the life of the clergy and the position of the faithful. The cause of the union fell. The center of the confrontation was Maramoroshchyna. Clergy and laymen of the eastern regions of Transcarpathia have long been victims of this struggle for power.

Fifth child of an impoverished country nobleman, Ang√©lique de Sanc√© de Monteloup grows up in the Poitou marshlands. Her logical destiny would be to marry a poor country nobleman, have children and spend her life fighting for a meagre subsistence. Destiny has other plans in store for her. At 17, on returning from her education in a convent, she finds herself betrothed to the rich count Jeoffrey de Peyrac (Jeoffrey Comte de Peyrac de Morens, Lord of Toulouse), 12 years her senior, lame, scarred and reputed to be a wizard. For the sake of her family, Ang√©lique reluctantly agrees to the match but refuses the advances of her husband. Peyrac respects her decision and does not pursue his claim to conjugal rights, wishing rather to seduce than use force. With the passing of months, Ang√©lique discovers the talents and virtues of her remarkable husband: scientist, musician, philosopher; and to her surprise falls passionately in love with him. But Jeoffrey's unusual way of life is threatened by the ambitions of the Archbishop of Toulouse, and soon arouses the jealousy of the young king himself, Louis XIV. Joffrey is arrested and charged with sorcery. Ang√©lique will single-handedly take on the might of the royal court and, survive murder and poison attempts on herself in a supreme effort to save Joffrey from the stake, to no avail. Instinctively, her whole being intent on revenge and her determination to survive, Ang√©lique, alone and desperate, plunges into the darkness of the Paris underworld.

Originally developed as a way to combat stage fright, independent practitioners now also report successful applications to treating stuttering, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other social challenges. History Speaking Circles were developed in the late 1970s by former stand-up comedian Lee Glickstein, who codified the methods he found successful in addressing his own experience of stage fright. Subsequently, Glickstein registered the name Speaking Circles as a trademark and incorporated a business, Speaking Circles International, to deliver training using his methods through a network of licensed facilitators. The Speaking Circles website now lists over 50 facilitators who have paid for initial training and ongoing certification and who now operate their own practices across the United States, Belgium, Canada, England, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Mexico and Japan. Relational Presence The core of Glickstein's method is a state of mind he calls Relational Presence, something he describes as \\"a state of receptivity to another without agenda or effort.\\" Traditional oratory and rhetorical approaches to public speaking highlight performance as a key to engaging and holding an audience. Metaphorically, speakers are seen as connecting with their audiences by 'reaching out' to them through compelling words, gestures and arguments. In contrast, speakers applying Relational Presence techniques invite connection by establishing a sense of intimate safety. The speaker and each audience member understand that it's OK to simply be themselves and no performance is required. The most usual method of a speaker establishing Relational Presence with an audience is through non-threatening eye contact made by the speaker with individual members of the audience, and held for longer than usual periods of time (usually a minimum of few seconds for each audience member engaged in this way). There is research to suggest that this sort of eye contact releases the social bonding hormone Oxytocin, which may well explain the increased sense of safety and trust that speakers and audiences report feeling when a speaker is connecting using Relational Presence. Other research by Dr Stephen Porges suggests that extended non-threatening eye-contact activates what he calls the Social Engagement System, which acts as a brake on the normal fight or flight response, slows the heart rate and thereby creates a sense of safety. More details of the relationship between Dr Porges work and Relational Presence can be found in this article. Training methods Licensed facilitators teach Relational Presence through an approach sharing elements in common with group psychotherapy. It aims to gradually repair the damage left behind from any earlier public traumas in life. The licensed facilitator directory can be found at https://relationalpresence.com/relational-presence-facilitator- directory/. =Methods used= The following description describes a typical evening 2-3 hour Speaking Circle meeting, although many facilitators run Speaking Circle workshops lasting 1 or more days: * In a brief introduction, the facilitator reminds participants of the groundrules described below, then every person present stands up in front of the group for a 3-minute \\"check in\\" turn, though there is no requirement to speak at all.. * Each group member takes it in turn to talk for five minutes \\"on stage\\", again with no requirement to speak, cued to finish in 30 seconds when the facilitator raises his or her finger. * Other group members forming the audience provide unconditional support and positive acceptance, both by remaining still and by paying full attention during the speaker's turn and by making only positive comments afterwards in feedback. * Listeners give positive brief appreciations of the essential qualities they experienced in the person. They refrain from mentioning the person's content; evaluating or comparing the turn with previous turns; or coaching, analysing or advising. Speakers do not comment on feedback beyond acknowledging it. * Between turns, group members do not talk amongst themselves or comment on other turns. * Group members respect the confidentiality of what is said, and do not repeat the contents of turns outside the Circle without specific permission. * Facilitators offer the option to videotape each person's turn, using a tape that each participant brings for that purpose and which they can take away to review their turn in private. * When everyone has had their turn up front, the facilitator ends the formal meeting with a few words and there is an opportunity for social interaction.

It is the sub urban region of business city of Kumbakonam. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th to 9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 divyadesams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Srinivasa Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Nachiyar. The temple is the place where god Vishnu is believed to have initiated Pancha Samskara (religious initiation) to Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple follows the Thenkalai mode of worship. The temple is believed to have been built by Kochengat Cholan of the late 3rd century AD, with later contributions from Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar kings. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, while it has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Vishnu is believed to have appeared to the sage Medhavi and married his daughter at this temple, witnessed by Brahma and other gods. Six daily rituals and four yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam, celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary), is the most prominent. The Kal Garuda image in the temple used during the festive occasions is believed to increase in weight seeking 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 people in succession when the procession comes out of various gates from the sanctum to the main entrance of the temple. Nachiyarkovil is famous for Nachiarkoil lamp brass lamp. The lamps are made by resident artisans called Pathers (Kammalar) who are living in large numbers at Kammalar street, Natchiyarkovil. Legend The temple tank adjacent to the temple As per Hindu legend, the sage Medhavi was doing penance at this place. While taking a bath in the river, he found an image of Chakrathazhwar entwined with Yoga Narasimha. A divine voice asked him to install the image in his hermitage and worship it. The goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu chose to grow in the hermitage and appeared to the sage in the form of a small girl and requested him to take care of her. Vishnu traveled in search of Lakshmi on his vehicle Garuda, the eagle. Garuda found the presence of Lakshmi in the hermitage. Vishnu appeared to Medhavi, pleased by the latter's devotion and asked his daughter to be married to him. The sage happily married Lakshmi to Vishnu and requested him to stay in his place, which Vishnu accepted. There is another local legend that king Kochengat Cholan was once defeated and he was advocated to seek the blessings of Vishnu, which he obliged. Architecture The temple is believed to have been built by King Kochengat Cholan. He is believed to have built 70 temples dedicated to Shiva and Thirunaraiyur is the only Vishnu temple constructed by him. The temple has a 5-tiered rajagopuram on the eastern side, raising up to a height of . The entrance through the eastern gateway leads to a hall of 16 pillars, called Neenila Mutram. The centre of the hall is occupied by Dwajasthamba (the flag pole) and Balipeeda (the place of sacrifice), one behind the other. The front portion of the flag pole has a small shrine for Garuda. The flag pole, place of sacrifice and Garuda's shrine are in axial position from the entrance to the main sanctum. The shrine of Thirumangai Azhwar is located on the northern side. The central hall of the temple, the Goratha Mandapam, houses the images of Ramanuja, Koorathazhwar and idols of eleven azhwars, leaving that of Andal. The southern side of the temple has a garden where the Magizha tree, the Sthala Vriksha (temple tree) is present. The Vasantha Mandapa or the spring hall is located next to it, which hosts the Vasanthothsavam or spring festival during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune). The temple also has a 100-pillared hall where the wedding festival is held during the Tamil month of Aavani (September‚ÄìOctober). There is a separate shrine in the north that houses images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita and another shrine in the south that houses the image of Hanuman. There is a shrine for Chakrathazhwar and Yoga Narasimha, believed to have been installed and worshipped by Sage Medhavi. The first precinct has separate shrines for Manavala Mamunigal and Vedanta Desika and idols of the utsava deities (festive images) of the 108 divyadesams. The temple has an elevated structure approached through a flight of 21 steps. The presiding deity of the temple is Vishnu in the form of Narayur Nambi and his consort Lakshmi as Vanchulavalli Thaayaar (also called Neela Devi Nachiyar), both of whom are housed in the main sanctum. Unlike other Vishnu temples where Vishnu is given importance, in this temple Nachiyar (Thayar) is prominent. The sanctum also houses the images of Brahma, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Sankarshana and Purushothaman (Vishnu) and a set of gods, who are depicted attending the wedding. The festive idols of Srinivasa (Vishnu), Sridevi (Lakshmi), Vanjulavalli (Lakshmi) and Bhudevi are housed in the same shrine. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Kal Garuda thumb Kal Garuda, an image of Vishnu's mount - Garuda, is the most prominent feature of the temple. As per local legend, the sculptor who sculpted the idol of Garuda got frustrated as the bird flew away each time, a new image was prepared. In frustration, he threw a stone at Garuda, who got injured and decided to stay at the temple as Kal Garuda. The image of Kal Garuda is made of saligrama and is housed in the shrine outside the main sanctum. During festive procession during the Tamil months of Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) and Panguni (March - April), the festive images are carried out in procession in Kal Garudar. While only four people are needed to carry the idol of Garuda out of the shrine, it multiples to 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 people when the image is taken outside the temple. The weight of the idol remains the same when carried by 4 people and stays the same when carried outside by 128. Only supernatural force is acting on that idol when 4 people carry, if we replicate the same idol somewhere else, 128 people are required to lift. On the way back only 4 people are required to carry the float in the decreasing order 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4. The aspect is treated magical as drops of sweat are also observed on the image of Kal Garuda during the six-hour-long procession. During the festive occasion, Garuda receives honors from Srinivasa Perumal (presiding deity) in the form of dress and ornaments. Jewels and dress are also presented to Garuda by Ranganatha, the presiding Vishnu form of Srirangam Ranganthaswamy Temple. Festivals and religious practices The shrines of the temple as viewed from the temple tank The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Srinivasa and Nachiyar. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the sacred texts Vedas are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The prime festival or Brahmmotsavam is a 10-day festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary). Garuda Sevai is celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March‚ÄìApril). During both these festivals, the festive images of Kal Garuda are taken out around the streets of the temple. Vasanthothsavam or spring festival is celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune). The Thirukalyana Utsavam or the wedding festival is celebrated in the 100-pillared hall during the Tamil month of Aavani (September‚ÄìOctober). Religious significance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in hundred hymns. It is the second temple revered by Thirumangai having more than hundred verses, the first one being the Neelamegha Perumal Temple at Thirukannapuram. Thirumangai compares Srinivasa Perumal of the temple with Venkateshwara (form of Vishnu) at Tirupathi and believes that he found the same beauty in both of them. It is also believed that when Thirumangai was asked to present a madal (ballad) by Ranganatha of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, Thirumangai replied that he built the walls in Srirangam, while he built the verses for Thirunaraiyur. It is believed that the Azhwar had his initiation to Vaishnavism in this temple. The temple is classified as a divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is the place where Vishnu is believed to have initiated Pancha Samskara (religious initiation) to Thirmangai. The temple is also quoted as a Siddhi Kshetra, a sacred place where sages attain earthly liberation. The place is considered sacred on account of being the hermitage of Sage Medhavi. In Vaishanava theology, Varadaraja Perumal Temple at Kanchipuram is referred as Athigiri and Tirumala Venkateswara Temple at Tirupathi as Seshagiri and the temple at Thirunaraiyur is referred as Suganthagiri. Nachiyar Koil is one of the few divyadesams where the goddess has prominence over Vishnu. Some of the other temples where such female dominance is observed are Andal Temple at Srivilliputhur, Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Temple at Woraiyur and Pundarikakshan Perumal Temple in Thiruvellarai. While Srivilliputhur is called Nachiyar Thiru Maaligai, Thirunaraiyur is called Nachiyar Koil.R. 2001, pp. 511-12 Vishnu was of the view that during Kali Yuga, men would have to listen to women. Hence he decided that he would first set an example and listen to the goddess here. During all festive occasions, the first rights are reserved for Nachiyar, who moves ahead, while Srinivasa follows her. Even the food is first served to Nachiyar and then to Srinivasa. Being a temple where goddess has prominence, Vishnu is located slightly by the side and goddess has the prominent position inside the sanctum. The place is the birthplace of Vaishnava saint Nambiyandar Nambi. Though he was named Nambi after the presiding deity of the Vishnu temple, he followed Saivism. He was an eleventh- century Shaiva scholar of Tamil Nadu in South India who compiled the hymns of Sampantar, Appar and Sundarar and was himself one of the authors of the eleventh volume of the canon of the Tamil liturgical poetry of Shiva, the Tirumurai.

SWEAT stands for southwestern United States and East Antarctica, which theorizes that the Southwestern United States was at one time connected to East Antarctica. A hypothesis for a late Precambrian fit of western North America with the Australia-Antarctic shield region permits the extension of many features through Antarctica and into other parts of Gondwana, specifically, the Grenville orogen may extend around the coast of East Antarctica into India and Australia. The ophiolitic belt of the latter may extend into East Antarctica. The Wopmay orogen of northwest Canada may extend through eastern Australia into Antarctica and thence beneath the ice to connect with the Yavapai-Mazatzal orogens of the southwestern United States. Counterparts of the Precambrian-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the U.S. Cordilleran miogeocline may be present in the Transantarctic Mountains. Orogenic belt boundaries provide useful piercing points for Precambrian continental reconstructions. The model implies that Gondwana and Laurentia drifted away from each other on one margin and collided some 300 million years later on their opposite margins to form the Appalachians.https://www.geosociety.org/news/pr/01-10.htm Evidence A paper published by an international team led by John Goodge, an NSF-funded researcher with the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, gives significant support to the theory. Writing in the July 11, 2008, edition of the journal Science, this international team of U.S. and Australian investigators describe their findings, which were made in the Transantarctic Mountains, and their significance to the problem of piecing together what an ancient supercontinent, called Rodinia, looked like. The U.S. investigators were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Previous lines of scientific evidence led researchers to theorize that about 600-800 million years ago a portion of Rodinia broke away from what is now the southwestern United States and eventually drifted southward to become eastern Antarctica and Australia. They argue that the team's find provides physical evidence that confirms the southwestern United States and East Antarctica (SWEAT) hypothesis. John Goodge's team was searching in Antarctica's Transantarctic Mountains for rocks carried along by ice rivers that could provide clues to the composition of the underlying crust of Antarctica, which in most places is buried under 2 miles of ice. One rock, found atop the so- called Nimrod Glacier, was later determined to be a very specific form of granite which has a particular type of coarse-grained texture. Chemical tests run on the rock revealed that it has a chemistry very similar to a unique belt of igneous rocks in North America that stretch from California through New Mexico to Kansas, Illinois in the United States, and eventually New Brunswick and Newfoundland in Canada. This belt of rock was a part of what is called Laurentia, thought by some geologists to be the core of Rodinia.This belt stops suddenly at its western margin, leading geologists to suspect that some piece of crust had rifted away from what is now the West Coast of the United States. East Antarctica‚ÄìLaurentia Juxtaposition The positions of Laurentia and other landmasses in the Precambrian super continent of Rodinia are controversial. Although geological and isotopic data support an East Antarctic fit with western Laurentia, alternative reconstructions favor the juxtaposition of Australia, Siberia, or South China. New geologic, age, and isotopic data provide a positive test of the juxtaposition with East Antarctica: Neodymium isotopes of Neoproterozoic rift-margin strata are similar; hafnium isotopes of about 1.4 billion year old Antarctic-margin detrital zircons match those in Laurentian granites of similar age; and a glacial clast of A-type granite has a uranium-lead zircon age of ~1440 million years, an epsilon-hafnium initial value of +7, and an epsilon-neodymium initial value of +4. These tracers indicate the presence of granites in East Antarctica having the same age, geochemical properties, and isotopic signatures as the distinctive granites in Laurentia.

Staniforth has been described as \\"...the most important visual commentator on Welsh affairs ever to work in the country.\\"Lord, Peter The Visual Culture of Wales: Industrial Society University of Wales Press; Cardiff (1998) p.198 Life history Staniforth was born in Gloucester in 1863, the son of a Sheffield tool repairer named Joseph Staniforth. His family moved to Cardiff in South Wales in 1870, and after leaving school at 15, Staniforth trained as a lithographic printer for the Western Mail before becoming an art reviewer.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) p.833 A promising young artist, he studied at the Cardiff School of Art, which was run from rooms above the Royal Arcade in the town centre. Among his classmates was the sculptor Goscombe John. Staniforth originally worked primarily in paint, but slowly moved from brush work to inks where he found a talent for cartoons and caricature. He started publishing cartoons in 1889 after being spotted by the Western Mail's editor Henry Lascelles Carr. Usually published in the Western Mail, Staniforth's drawings and cartoons covered political and social unrest in Wales from 1890 through to the First World War. Although his cartoons followed editorial lines, with editor Carr appearing in several stating his own opinion, Staniforth himself veered more towards the more tolerant Liberal- Labour movement and would attack both capitalist coal owners and the socialist unions. In 1911 Staniforth was commissioned, by then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George to produce a piece of artwork to commemorate the investiture of Prince Edward as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle. The artwork, in pencil and watercolour, was kept by Lloyd George who hung it in his study. He was replaced at the Western Mail by Leslie Illingworth upon his death in 1921. =Samples of political cartoons= File:Sir EJ Reed as a Poet - JM Staniforth.pngSir Edward James Reed as a poet, 1891 File:William Brace Cartoon.jpgWestern Mail Cartoon by Staniforth from 8 June 1898 during the Welsh coal strike File:Breathing Time - JM Staniforth.pngCommentating on the events leading to the Second Boer War, 1899 Dame Wales One of Staniforth's more famous creations was \\"Dame Wales\\" (or Mam Cymru), a middle-aged woman dressed in the Welsh national costume, along with Welsh hat, who would embody Wales in a similar way that other cartoonists would use Britannia to symbolise Britain or the British Empire. Staniforth stated in a 1906 interview that he felt that Wales needed a counterpart to John Bull who was used in cartoons to represent England, and after discussions with a colleague, Staniforth created what he believed would be a characteristic Welsh dame. Dame Wales was normally the voice of reason in Staniforth's cartoons and is often pictured attempting to discourage others from making decisions that would damage the country. When a spoken caption was required, Dame Wales would often be depicted talking in a working class valleys vernacular, which stands out against the language used by the more educated figures of authority she challenges. Other cartoonists would later take up the figure of Dame Wales, and would keep the same image in their work. =Cartoons depicting Dame Wales= File:Dame Wales's Lament - Death of Arthur Linton by J.M.

In 1928, ten examples were delivered by the firm of Hanomag that matched the Class 80 locomotives in many details. The axles were all fixed rigidly to the frame, but the middle one had thinner wheel flanges. In contrast to the Class 80s, the Class 81 engines had a larger heating area and carried more coal and water. The delivery of 60 more vehicles was cancelled in 1940 due to the Second World War. The locomotives were mainly employed on heavy shunting duties. After their collection, the ten engines were allocated to the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerken or Bw) of Goslar (81 001‚Äì005) and Oldenburg (81 006‚Äì010). In 1945 all the engines were in the Oldenburg area and went over to the Deutsche Bundesbahn. The last engine was taken out of service in October 1963.

While there are stanzas with as many as five syllables rhyming, generally shairi uses either feminine or dactylic rhyme. It is worth noticing that despite the feminine and dactylic forms of rhyme, in Georgian shairi stress is very weak due to the nature of the Georgian language, which is characterized by dynamic and very weak stress placed on antepenultimate syllable in words longer than two syllables and on penultimate in two syllable words.

It is now supposed that his name has become attached to works of Bonifacius Antelmi, somewhat earlier, and others. These attributions came with the era of printing. Life After completing his law studies at Padua he returned to his native city and took up the practice of criminal law. He suddenly gave up the law, entered the priesthood, and left Padua with the intention of never returning. In 1350, however, he came back as rector of the Church of San Martinio de' Tribesii and vicar of the bishop. Two years after he went to Avignon, where he received a professorship. He was given the privilege of granting the doctorate, was made prothonotary Apostolic, advocate of the Consistory, fiscal of the Roman Curia, and finally auditor of the sacred palace.

He was actively involved in a wide variety of racketeering and other organized crime related activities such as prostitution, theft, numbers, etc., from the days of Prohibition until his demise. Biography=Early life= Alex Birns was born Alexander Birnstein in 1907, in the town of Lemes, in a section of Austria-Hungary that went to Czechoslovakia under the Versailles treaty. His parents were Herman and Illon Birnstein. The second youngest of four children, he was brought to New York City at the age of one month. From there, the family moved to Cleveland and settled in the lower Woodland Avenue district. Like many immigrant families, the Birnsteins Americanized their surname, in their case to Birns. Alexander's name was abbreviated to an English translation of Zander, but Italian and Jewish neighbors took to calling the boy \\"Shondor\\" (as the Hungarian equivalent of \\"Alexander\\" is \\"S√°ndor\\", pronounced roughly as most Americans would pronounce \\"Shondor\\") and the name stuck. Like many families, the Birns family struggled to earn a living in the New World, and like many immigrants during Prohibition, they turned to bootlegging, taking in a small still from Cleveland Mafia boss Joe Lonardo to supplement their income and better provide for their children. In November 1920, Birns' mother was tending to the 10-gallon still in their apartment, when a faulty gas connection caused an explosion. Her clothing caught fire and was engulfed in flames. She ran outside screaming, where a passing motorist helped extinguish the flames and drove her to the hospital. Horribly burned over 75 percent of her body, she died the next morning. 13-year-old Birns was sheltered for a time in the old Jewish orphanage. He grew up quickly, and took a job as a newspaper boy during the tough circulation wars. Later on, he lived with his grandmother. As a student, Birns excelled at athletics, especially baseball and swimming. He dropped out of school after 10th grade in 1922 and enlisted in the United States Navy in 1923, but was discharged six months later because he was underage. =Criminal career= On the streets, Birns developed a reputation as a fierce fighter, proving himself quick with his fists in many fights with street thugs. It was at roughly this time that he changed his surname to Birns, to save his family from the embarrassment of his involvement with criminals. Then his major brushes with the law began. Birns was convicted of car theft in 1925, for which he served 18 months in the Mansfield Reformatory. He soon acquired an assault conviction in which Birns broke the jaw of a motorist who had taken too long to make his turn in front of Birns. With 18 arrests in a 12-year period, Birns was on his way to notoriety in northeast Ohio. During this period, he gloried in his fame and enjoyed the attention which he received from local law enforcement as well as fellow gangsters. He soon developed a knack for beating legal charges. During this period, he was successfully prosecuted only twice. At the age of 19, Birns was convicted of auto theft and served two years in prison. In 1933, he was convicted of bribery, served 60 days and paid a $500 fine. After six appearances in court, a prosecutor remarked, \\"It is time the court put away this man whose reputation is one of rampant criminality.\\" Birns was only in his twenties. =Association with the Maxie Diamond gang= Birns was soon recruited by Maxie Diamond, leader of the E. 55th street and Woodland Mob. Diamond was an associate of Teamster leader William Presser and was once referred to by the local newspapers as \\"Cleveland's Number One Racketeer\\". Birns became a ranking member of Diamond's gang during the battles for control of the city's dry cleaners and launderers. In 1933, shortly after he hooked up with the Maxie Diamond gang, Diamond narrowly escaped death from gunfire by rival gangsters in what was called by the police, \\"a continuation of the city's dry cleaning racket war\\". Birns was among those picked up for questioning. He was released, but only after paying $2 for two overdue traffic tickets. Later in the year, Birns was once again arrested by the police. In separate incidents in quick succession, two men were shot from the same passing car. Police called it \\"continuation of guerrilla warfare among policy game racketeers. They picked up Birns for interrogation along with five of his fellow henchmen.\\" Birns and three others were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted. Four days later, Birns, along with co-defendant Yale Cohen and attorney Max Lesnick, were convicted of bribing a witness. It was, The Plain Dealer said, \\"one of the few cases on record in which men identified by police as 'gangsters' were convicted of anything.\\" The judge sentenced them to 60 days in the Warrensville Workhouse.\\"Shondor the Apprentice Hood\\" While serving his sentence at the Warrensville Workhouse after being convicted for the bribery charges, Birns granted his first newspaper interview. Birns told the reporter that he was serving his time happily and enjoying the hard work. In the years to come, he became close to many of the city's newspaper reporters and could sometimes be found chatting with one over a cocktail. To them, he was an excellent source of news tips. He was soon labeled as \\"Cleveland's Public Enemy No. 1\\" by the local press. =The Rudy Duncan hit= One of Birns's most serious arrests was for the 1934 murder of Rudy Duncan, a 36-year-old night club bouncer at Euclid Avenue's Keystone Club. Birns was sitting at Keystone with two of his fellow gang members when he rose to retrieve some cigars from his overcoat which he had checked in the coat room. Birns had misplaced his cheque and could not produce it when asked for it by the coatroom girl. The coatroom girl subsequently refused to give Birns access to his coat. Over her objections, Birns entered the coatroom, shoving her aside in the process, and retrieved some cigars from his coat. He then returned to the table, had two more drinks, and smoked one cigar. The coatroom girl ran outside and summoned Rudy Duncan, the bouncer who also happened to be her live-in boyfriend. She told him about the incident with Birns. Duncan was a former boxer with arrests in Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Cleveland, and had experienced previous run-ins with Birns and his gang. Duncan came up behind him and in a menacing manner, demanded an explanation as to Birns's presence in the Club. Birns muttered something and the two lunged at each other. In the ensuing ruckus, two shots were fired. One hit Birns in the shoulder and the other hit one of Birns's friends in the leg. Duncan ordered Birns's crew out of the bar at gunpoint. When the police arrived, they found Birns in his car ready to pull away, while holding a bloody handkerchief to his shoulder. They searched his car and confiscated a revolver which he had placed in his glove box. He denied ownership of the gun and would not reveal who shot him. The police drove him to the hospital. After two days, Birns checked himself out of the hospital and was well on his way to a full recovery when he was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon. During the trial, Birns testified that he did not see his assailant and that whoever came up behind him in the cloakroom had the gun. He refused to identify Duncan as the man who shot him. He denied even knowing Duncan at all. Likewise, Duncan's recollection of the incident was so vague that he wasn't even called to testify as a witness. Two months later, Rudy Duncan took his 11-year-old foster son, Stanley to a movie show at the Uptown theater outside E. 105th Street and Saint Clair Avenue. Afterwards, they walked to a confectionery for ice cream. When they got into their car back in the theater parking lot, two men wearing white cotton gloves walked up alongside, one on each side. With a terrified Stanley crouching in the seat, they fired five bullets into Duncan. Police immediately began a search for Birns. They found him, but they couldn't find evidence to tie him to the murder. He was released. Duncan's murder went officially unsolved. =Rise to power= Birns' reputation as a brutal, ruthless enforcer made it easy for him to establish lucrative \\"protection\\" services. Legal businesses who wished to be allowed to operate undisturbed had to pay him as a labor consultant. Those who refused to pay would usually find their store windows broken or their cars blown up. In any event, those who initially refused would soon pay up.Shondor the Genial Host During the late 1930s, Birns became heavily involved in protecting whorehouses or \\"vice resorts\\" as they were dubbed by the media. With the backing of the Cleveland crime family, Birns operated freely and was well liked by all the prostitutes of his whore houses. Many of Birns's clients were judges, politicians and police officers of high rank. They would serve as important contacts for him in the future and vice versa. In 1938, Birns visited Canada for a vacation. Upon his re-entry to the United States, he was questioned briefly about his criminal history and answered honestly. At the time, Birns was unaware of the Immigration Act of 1917 which required any alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude to gain permission prior to entering or leaving the country. It would take a couple of years of paperwork to catch up. In 1942, at the height of World War II, Birns was arrested on a deportation warrant based on the auto theft and bribery convictions. During his incarceration, Birns tried to enlist in the United States Army. However, this was to no avail. Two years later, his attorney was successful in getting him released on bond. However, officials were determined to keep Birns locked up. A wartime presidential order was issued charging Birns as an enemy alien and he was interned at McAllester, Oklahoma. This greatly offended Birns. Although he had never applied for American citizenship, Birns always considered himself a patriotic American. Upon his release in 1944, Birns returned to Cleveland and was well known by the police, judges and the public. He was regarded as a celebrity gangster and had many public sympathizers in what was generally seen as a vendetta. =Restaurateur= During this time, Birns was building a profitable legitimate business as a restaurateur. He opened his Ten-Eleven Club at 1011 Chester Avenue in Downtown Cleveland. It was a popular nightspot which had a reputation for serving excellent food. The restaurant was usually frequented by local and out-of-town big shots. Police and newspaper reporters ate and drank on the house. When the tragic Cleveland East Ohio Gas Explosion that killed 134 persons and left thousands homeless occurred in 1944, Birns kept the club open, 24 hours a day, feeding policemen, firemen and rescue workers for free. His Alhambra Tavern on the East Side was another popular restaurant. By law, convicted felons weren't supposed to be legally able to get liquor licenses. Birns managed to bypass that by disguising his connections to the Alhambra. At one point, he was simply its \\"public relations director\\". The Cleveland safety director denounced the deal in which the state okayed Birns's license as \\"stinking to high heaven of politics\\".\\"Above the Law\\" =Muscling in the numbers operations and policy games= During the 1940s, Birns made a longstanding alliance and had become closely involved with the local Cleveland family mobsters such as Angelo Lonardo. Lonardo had already taken over the black lottery and numbers operations. Birns was determined to firmly keep this traditionally black racket under his control. One of the best known of the black numbers operators was Donald \\"The Kid\\" King, the future boxing promoter. According to a 1988 Plains Dealer series by Christopher Evans, \\"King was flamboyant ‚Äî always seen with a .38 in his belt and a big cigar in his mouth\\". In the mid-1960s, King and his partner, a Cleveland prize-fighter named Victor Ogletree were reportedly grossing $15,000 a day on policy. King gained prominence among the other operators in 1954, after he thwarted a robbery of one of his gambling houses, killing one of the stick-up men. The shooting was deemed a justifiable homicide. In October 1956, Birns sent an emissary to King and his colleagues demanding that they pay up to $200 a week to make sure that none of their competitors paid odds of more than 500 to 1, or pay the consequences. They initially agreed but by December deemed the price too high. King eventually began holding out on the protection money being paid on a regular basis to Birns, Lonardo and their associates. At 3:45 a.m. on the morning of May 23, 1957, an explosion ripped apart the front porch of King's house. Uninjured, he went to the police and accused Birns of ordering the bombing. King also informed police of his decision to get out of the racket. Largely on King's testimony, Birns and the others were indicted. A few weeks later, Birns attempted to dissuade King from testifying by sending some of his men to kill him at his home. King was ambushed outside his house. Several pellets of shot hit him in the back of his head, but King survived. He was then taken to the hospital and refused to cooperate any further with police. At the trial, however, King told jurors that Birns's emissary had offered him $10,000 not to testify: \\"He said if I didn't testify, he would guarantee there would be no more shooting at me or bombing my house and I'd have no reason to be scared no more.\\" The prosecution even produced a surprise witness, Dollree Mapp, who was a former employee of the rackets. On the stand, the Press reported, \\"she burst into tears again and again and refused to answer questions as Birns and the other defendants glared at her. Her attorney told the judge she was told that she and her 12-year-old daughter would be killed if she testified.\\" Elijah Abercrombie, a co-defendant, told the jury that police had offered to let him run an unhampered gambling game if he gave them information against Birns. Defense lawyer Fred Garmone called King \\"a scheming, lying, witness-fixing extortionist himself\\".The King & Shondor When the trial began, King was cast as the star witness in the trial. The judge and jury had difficulty understanding King and his rapid, inarticulate speech led the local newspapers to dub him \\"The Talker\\". The jury deliberated 11 hours and the trial resulted in Birns and the other defendants acquittal. =Relationship with law enforcement= Throughout his lifetime, Alex Birns craved respectability and sought to obtain it through his popular Alhambra Restaurant, where many judges and politicians dined. During the early morning hours, Birns would often send food over to the nearby Fifth District police station for the police officers working the late shift. In spite of being diligently pursued by law enforcement for most of his life, Birns eventually came to respect and admire the city's police officers. Once, when he was under a 24-hour surveillance, Birns was leaving a Cleveland Indians baseball game. He happened to notice the two detectives assigned to follow him and flagged them over. The officers agreed to drive him to his next destination. When the officers were reprimanded by a superior, Birns intervened on their behalf. In 1959, Birns physically assaulted a police officer. He was convicted of assault and battery and was once again sent to the Warrensville Workhouse for nine months. He practically ran the place. The superintendent was later fired for the liberties he allowed Birns. While in prison, Alex Birns was accused of masterminding the car bombing of numbers operator, Joe Allen, in an attempt to shake him down for 25 percent of his operation. The state tried Birns twice for the crime. A workhouse guard admitted to having acted as a go-between in trying to arrange a deal with Allen. The outcome of the first trial was a hung jury. The second acquitted him. Upon his acquittal, Birns blew kisses to the jury. In a Page One editorial, a newspaper thundered, \\"Who runs this town ‚Äî Birns or the Law?\\". The relentless prosecutors, however, didn't give up and accused Birns of trying to contact a juror in the second case. He said he had merely asked an Alhambra waitress to see if the juror would be fair to him. Ten of the jurors signed a statement protesting the charge that they had been unduly influenced. =Assassination attempt= In 1959, Birns was shot at by an unknown assailant as he arrived home. The gunman missed, whereupon Birns cruised the neighborhood on the lookout for him. Upon investigation, Cleveland police picked up a small-time hood named Clarence \\"Sonny\\" Coleman, who owed money to Birns for interrogation. He was released soon after questioning. A short time afterward, Coleman was shot on a neighborhood street shortly after midnight. Three bullets hit him, but he managed to run up to the front porch of a house yelling, \\"Let me in, baby, let me in!\\" In the hospital, he told police the shooter was a man in the back seat of a car driven by Shondor Birns. Birns was arrested and brought to the booking window at Central Station.Sonny Changes His Story A month later, Coleman changed his mind and told police that he had only speculated that it was Birns in the car. However, the police arrested Coleman as a material witness. He changed his mind again and reluctantly agreed to testify. At the trial, a neighbor backed Birns's alibi. He said he saw Birns arrive home at 12:07 a.m., about the time of the shooting several miles away. It took the jurors four hours to reach a verdict, which resulted in Birns's acquittal. They expressed their refusal to believe the changing testimony of Coleman, who had been a dope peddler and police informant. Police predicted what the press called \\"a fresh outbreak of shootings and violence in Cleveland's multi-million-dollar numbers racket\\". =Mervin Gold murder= Birns had been suspected of two murders, including that of a financier named Mervin Gold. In the 1960s, Gold was being investigated for using stolen Canadian bonds for using a bank loan. On July 8, 1963, he was found murdered and stuck in the trunk of his car. He had been beaten, strangled with a clothesline and shot in the chest. A blanket was wrapped around his head. He was shot three more times in the skull. The coroner, Samuel Gerber, estimated his time of death as shortly before midnight Friday. Anticipating an untimely demise, Gold left behind an affidavit claiming that Birns had given him the bonds. His wife told police that Gold was on his way to meet with Birns the night he was murdered. Police also found a tape made by Gold of a phone call between himself and Birns. A pickup order was sent out for Birns. On Monday his car turned up outside a motel in Toledo. The motel owner said he had checked in Saturday and sought treatment for an injured right hand. He told the doctor a firecracker caused the injury. On Wednesday morning, Birns called John Kocevar, chief deputy Cuyahoga County sheriff. He arranged to surrender at a meeting spot in suburban Garfield Heights. He told Kocevar, \\"I would have surrendered yesterday, but it was a Jewish holiday.\\" Somebody also tipped off the press. A reporter and photograph were waiting when he arrived. Birns told them, \\"Thanks for coming, fellows.\\"Bonds and Bullets Birns was taken to Central Station for questioning by the head of the Homicide Unit, Lieutenant Carl Delau. Amid aggressive interrogation by Delau, Birns insisted he had been dining on frog legs in a Garfield Heights steakhouse at the night of Gold's murder. Birns claimed that he was at home with a woman of fine character. He did not name her, but said she was willing to testify for him. His bail was set at $50,000, which he posted with ease. Then, the Plain Dealer reported, \\"Birns cocked his summer straw hat, waved goodbye to reporters, walked out of the building and down the front steps to where his attorney, James R. Willis, was waiting.\\" All concerned was shocked when two days later, Birns produced Allene Leonards, a shy, 24-year-old teacher in the Garfield Heights school system who confirmed his alibi claiming that she had been with Birns the whole night. This was also confirmed by the owner. Birns would later divorce his first wife, Jane, and marry Leonards a year later. He had married Jane in 1952, and had one son, Michael (died 1978), with her.Encyclopedia of Cleveland History: Alex \\"Shondor\\" Birns =Self-appointed peacemaker and mediator of disputes= In the 1960s, Birns was having trouble with some black numbers operators. It was during this time, that he came into contact with a brash ambitious young Irish-American upstart named Danny Greene. Impressed with his fearless attitude and abilities, Birns hired Greene to be an enforcer for his various numbers operators. It was a decision which Birns would eventually regret. For a relatively small cut of their profits, $1,000 weekly, Birns had been serving as a peacemaker and mediator of disputes among the blacks. He also laid off or distributed big bets to other cities like Pittsburgh, so no single operator lost too much if a number came up. In 1968, after a massive investigation into his assets by the Internal Revenue Service, Birns was convicted and sent to federal prison for lying about his assets. =The 1970s= By the 1970s, Alex Birns had mellowed significantly, playing handball daily and spending several hours on lunch and a cocktail or two. He didn't want any more trouble. He promised his parole officer, \\"Kid, I don't break any provisions of parole. I'll tell you why. If I go back to jail, I'll die there.\\" More often, Birns chose to lunch at the Theatrical, where he always sat at the end of the bar. Birns once told a reporter, \\"If I'm the city's biggest crook, why do they all want to be my friend? I'll tell you why. Most of them are worse than I am, and they all know that I know....\\" After lunch, he would head out to the Silver Quill or Christie's Lounge to chat with the owner and the barmaid and sometimes buy drinks for the regulars. By this time, he was planning to retire and live out his twilight years in Florida. However, when longtime Cleveland family boss, John Scalish died, Birns teamed up with the faction backing James T. Licavoli as the new boss. =Opposition from Black racketeers= Birns was always dealing with heavy opposition from a few black gangsters who wanted independence from him and the more powerful and politically connected Mafiosi of the Cleveland family. Several close murder attempts led Birns to buy a Doberman Pinscher to protect his home. In February, Birns and his girlfriend were walking downtown when a car with several black men drove by. Two shots were fired, but neither Birns nor his girlfriend were hit. Several months later, Birns walked into an east side bar in response to a meeting requested by several black numbers racketeers. This time, Birns brought his heavily armed black bodyguard along in anticipation of trouble. Upon arrival, Birns and his bodyguard were immediately accosted by several of the numbers men. One of the gangsters shouted, \\"We want you out of the business or you're dead\\", while pulling back his coat to reveal a pistol in his waistband. The bodyguard reacted quickly, leveling a small sub-machine gun from under his overcoat. Some customers scurried towards the exits. The group continued shouting at Birns as he and his bodyguard cautiously backed out of the bar and left. =Conflict with Danny Greene= The relationship between Danny Greene and Alex Birns also began to sour. Greene envied Birns's control of the rackets and looked forward to the day when it would be his. He was also jealous of Birns's immense wealth and popularity with the Cleveland media and public. The death of boss John Scalish had put Birns and Greene on opposite sides of a Mafia dispute with Greene supporting challenger John Nardi and Birns supporting the heir apparent gangster James T. Licavoli. Greene was soon willing to take on Birns. Greene had requested from Birns a loan of $75,000. Greene wanted the money to set up a \\"cheat spot\\", a speakeasy and gambling house. Therefore, Birns had arranged a loan for Greene through the Gambino family. Somehow the money wound up in the hands of Billy Cox, a numbers operator, who used it to purchase narcotics. The police raided his house, arrested him, seized the narcotics and what was left of the $75,000. The Gambino family, from whom Birns had borrowed the loan, wanted their money. Birns pressed Greene but Greene flatly refused to return the money; instead asserting that it wasn't his fault that it got lost. In retaliation, Birns gave $25,000 with an associate to hire a hit man for Greene to be murdered, especially in the event of any harm befalling him. This contract was soon taken by several minor underworld characters who were burglars by trade. This contract would result in numerous failed assassination attempts on Greene. Not long after, Greene found an unexploded bomb in his car when he pulled into a Collinwood service station for gas. The explosive was wired improperly and failed to detonate. Greene disassembled the bomb himself, removed the dynamite, and brought the rest of the package to the Cleveland police lieutenant, Edward Kovacic. Kovacic offered him police protection, but he refused. He also refused to hand over the bomb, telling him, \\"I'm going to send this back to the old bastard that sent it to me.\\" Suspecting that Birns was behind it, Greene decided to retaliate. =Assassination= In March 1975, Holy Saturday, the eve of Easter, Birns was blown up via a bomb containing C-4, a potent military explosive, in the lot behind Christy's Lounge, the former Jack & Jill West Lounge, a go-go spot at 2516 Detroit Ave. Birns was blown several feet through the roof of the car and his torso landed near the passenger door. A man who walked Birns to his car braved flames and smoke and located him near the car. Apparently, Birns was still alive, though barely. The man only managed to drag away Birns's upper torso. His face, arms and chest were bloodied and blackened. Birns' nose was broken when his body landed on the street after being blown out the top of his car. His hair was scorched off from the heat of the blast. Birns had been blown in half. His severed legs landed fifty feet away and other smaller parts of him were scattered all over the place. Towards his death, the upper part of his body was convulsing violently. A chain link fence between Christy's and St. Malachi Church caught many of the smaller fragments of flesh and bone. At first glance, they resembled steaming pieces of meat. Though Birns's Lincoln was demolished and smoking heavily, his state-of-the-art burglar system survived. A leather gym bag and gym shoes had been blown from the trunk. Amazingly, a paper bag of clothing from inside his car survived. It read: \\"Diamond's of Ohio - Fashions for men which women love\\". Police said the blast was among the most powerful they had ever investigated. Police and bomb squad members worked an entire day examining the bombing scene. Coroners workers spent hours collecting as many pieces of skin and bones that they could find. A total of $843 in cash was found on or around Birns's body. The Internal Revenue Service promptly claimed the money to be put toward back taxes that Birns owed. =The aftermath= In the following weeks, investigators wrongly concentrated on several black numbers operators as suspects rather than Danny Greene. On Birns and the supposed involvement of black people in his murder, one black numbers operator said: \\"It's dumb to talk about blacks doing Shondor. Shon wasn't no bad fella. He was white but it didn't make no difference. Shon had a black soul. He was black through and through. Shit, there wasn't no racial prejudice in that goddamn Shondor Birns at all. He was a helluva guy.... No, No. There ain't gonna be no more Shondors....\\" Kevin McTaggert, a henchman for Danny Greene, later told the FBI that Greene had contracted Hells Angels member Enis \\"Eagle\\" Crnic to kill Birns for a fee of $7,500.American Justice: A True Crime Collection James Neff (2017) Crnic was later killed while attempting to attach a car bomb to a vehicle belonging to mafia associate John \\"Johnny Del\\" Delzoppo on April 5, 1977.Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs: Organized Crime on Wheels Phillip C. McGuire (1987) In the Cleveland Press, Dick McLaughlin summed up his career: \\"A muscleman whose specialty was controlling numbers gambling on the East Side, keeping the peace among rival operators and getting a cut from each of them, Birns was a feared man because of his violent reaction to any adversary. Yet he was popular, had an engaging personality, was known by many newsmen because he was good copy and was ever ready to buy them a drink. He was a feared man, but a genial and generous man, holding court almost daily at the Theatrical Lounge where he lunched.\\"Cleveland's Killer Celebrities, Part 1 Birns's widow was oblivious to his conflict with Danny Greene, since Birns had largely sheltered her from his underworld activities. Aware that Greene was also a pet lover, she gave his Doberman Pinscher to him. His remains are held at Hillcrest Cemetery in Bedford Heights, Ohio.Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols & Stories. Cleveland: Gray & Company. . Greene himself survived a little while longer (although the Birns- allied Licavoli faction continued to try to kill him due to his partnership with their enemy Nardi) but like Nardi was killed by getting blown to pieces in a car bombing.

It belongs to the large geometer moth subfamily Ennominae, and therein to the tribe Baptini. It is - under its junior synonym - the type species of its genus Lomographa. It is also (under its original name Phalaena bimaculata) the type species of Bapta, a junior objective synonym of Lomographa and the namesake of the Baptini.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004ab) The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius ion 1775. Two subspecies have been named, as well as several forms (e.g. bipunctata):Kolar (1942), and see references in Savela (2009) * Lomographa bimaculata bimaculata (Fabricius, 1775) * Lomographa bimaculata subnotata (Warren, 1895) Ecology and description The rather common species inhabits mainly woodland areas and can be found all over central and eastern Europe. However, it seems to be absent in the Balkans, between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece. It is also not found in Iceland and is rare at the periphery of its range; for example, north of the English Midlands and on Ireland it is found only locally.FE (2009), Kimber [2010] To the east it extends into the Caucasus, Russia, the Russian Far East, Siberia, Central Asia and Japan. The adults appear in the British Isles usually in early summer. But in exceptional cases it is found later in the year; it was recorded in Germany in early August 1938, for example. It is a mainly a nocturnal species which can be attracted to light. The adult's wingspan is 22‚Äì26 mm. The wings are a very pale silvery grey, with two dark grey spots on each forewing's leading edge, from which the two bands typical of Ennominae (but in this species consisting only of very small and weak grey speckles) run over the forewings and hindwings to form a semicircle. The body is also whitish.Kolar (1942), Kimber [2010] This moth has a single generation per year (though late sightings suggest that this might not always be so).

She is referred to as the Goddess of Beauty, Wealth, and Prosperity.  History  The original temple was located in Calangute near Mapusa City Taluka Bardez. In the 17th century, due to forceful conversion of Hindus by Portuguese invaders, the temple was shifted to Nanora in Bicholim Taluka, where most such temples shifted. Nanora is situated between city Assonora and Mulgaon in South. Mulgaon is famous for temples which were moved from Salcette (Shri Dev ShantaDurga Rawalnath Panchaytan Devasthan & Shri Shatadurga Ravalnath Maydekar Devashtan) and Kansarpal in North which is famous for Mahamaya Kalika Devasthan Kasarpal, where as west of Nanora is Advalpal, which is famous for Kuldevta of Goud Saraswat Brahmins Sharvani Devastan and east of Nanora is the village of Ladfe and the city of Bicholim. The main priest is from the Bhuskute family (Kokanstha Brahmins).  Iconography  The main idol in the sanctum sanctorum is more than 800 years old and is in the form of lingam.  Architecture  The modern temple was constructed in the 17th century. It was repaired in the 1990s when the temple was made into a marble masterpiece. The temple has a Dipa Stambha and agrashalas (guest houses).  Devotees  The deity is believed to be patron deity of 96 Kulee Maratha, Kalavants, Bhandari, and Rajapur Saraswat Brahmins community spread all over India. Familiar surnames of the devotees are Sawant, Gad Desai, Naik, Kalangutkar, Kangutkar, Kalgutkar, Karangutkar, Desai, Gawas, Vernekar, etc. The Sawant family are spread in Assagao, Virnoda, and Mapusa; while Gad Desai are spread in Camurlim, Assagao, Keri, Morjim. The Desai are settled in a small village called Pirna of Desai Wada, Pirna Bardez, Goa.  Festivals  * The main festival of the temple is called as Shishirotsav (popularly known as Shigmo).

He is also Docent of digital culture theory at the University of Turku in Finland. Until May 2011 Parikka was the Director of the Cultures of the Digital Economy (CoDE) research institute at Anglia Ruskin University and the founding Co-Director of the Anglia Research Centre for Digital Culture.  Biography  Parikka was awarded a Ph.D. in Cultural History from the University of Turku in 2007. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Fibreculture-journal and a member of the Leonardo Journal Digital Reviews Panel. In 1995, Parikka deferred his national service and spent 18 months as an assistant fisheries inspector in Oulu. Parikka has published extensively on digital art, digital culture and cultural theory in Finnish and English in journals such as Ctheory, Theory, Culture & Society, Fibreculture, Media History, Postmodern Culture and Game Studies. His texts have been translated into Hungarian, French, Turkish, Polish, Portuguese and Indonesian. He has published five single authored books; in Finnish on media theory in the age of cybernetics (Koneoppi. Ihmisen, teknologian ja median kytkenn√§t, (2004)) and in English, Digital Contagions: A Media Archaeology of Computer Viruses (2007), the award-winning Insect Media (2010), What is Media Archaeology? (2012) and A Geology of Media (2015). Digital Contagions is the first book to offer a comprehensive and critical analysis of the culture and history of the computer virus phenomenon. The book maps the anomalies of network culture from the angles of security concerns, the biopolitics of digital systems, and the aspirations for artificial life in software. The genealogy of network culture is approached from the standpoint of accidents that are endemic to the digital media ecology. Viruses, worms, and other software objects are not, then, seen merely from the perspective of anti-virus research or practical security concerns, but as cultural and historical expressions that traverse a non- linear field from fiction to technical media, from net art to politics of software. His work on Insect Media combines themes from media archaeology, posthumanism and animal studies to put forth a new history of how insects and technology frame critical, scientific and technological thought. It won the Society for Cinema and Media Studies 2012 Anne Friedberg Award for Innovative Scholarship. He has also discussed this work in dialogue with historian Etienne Benson and media theorist Bernard Dionsius Geoghegan on the Cultural Technologies podcast. Most recently, Parikka has written on media archaeology as a theory and methodology in various publications, including Media Archaeology (co-edited with Erkki Huhtamo) and What is Media Archaeology? With Garnet Hertz, Parikka co-authored a paper entitled \\"Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method,\\" which was nominated for the 2011 Transmediale Vilem Flusser media theory award. Research activity Dr. Parikka's research activities include continental philosophy, media theory, the politics and history of new media, media archaeology, new materialist cultural analysis and various other topics relating to anomalies, media and the body.

The elephants were Asian elephants, and were recruited from southern provinces of Iran, and Pakistan but also possibly Western Asiatic elephants from Syria and western-most Iran. The men (excluding the driver) sat in a large tower from which troops would fight. The elephant itself would normally be armed with thin plate armour (the Sassanids used chain mail as well as thin plate armour) and would bear a large crenelated wooden howdah on its back. Persian war elephants were trained by their rider, called a mahout, who would also ride the elephant into battle. Training elephants was a difficult task and they would be hard to maintain because they ate so much food and water. On the march, huge paths needed to be cut for the elephants. History=Under the Achaemenids= Persians used war elephants at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. The battle raged between king Alexander the Great of Macedon and king Darius III of Persia. The Persians had 15 Indian-trained war elephants, which were placed at the centre of the Persian line, and they made such an impression on the Macedonian troops that Alexander felt the need to sacrifice to the God of Fear the night before the battle. Despite this the Persians lost the battle, relinquishing the Achaemenid empire to Alexander. Some claim that they had been used previously in the Greek campaign of King Xerxes I of Persia, and even further back at the time of Darius the Great at the Indus, the Danube and against the Scythians in 512 BC. Neither Xenophon nor Herodotus mention war elephants in their accounts of these earlier campaigns. =Under the Parthians= Since the early 1st century AD, elephants were also used as a symbol of kingship in Iran. This notion was adopted from the Greco-Bactrians. =Under the Sasanians= King Khosrow I on top of an elephant fighting the Mazdakite Revolt. Persian miniature In the early Sasanian period, the war elephants were used in battles as a psychological weapon for its terrorizing effects. Later this role evolved into a logistical one, and in late Sasanian period they were used by army commanders to survey the battle scene. Sasanian elephants were under a special chief, known as the Zend‚àíhapet, or \\"Commander of the Indians\\", as they were from India. War elephant with turret. Statuette from Pompeii in National Archaeological Museum, Naples Shapur I may have used war elephants against Valerian. But the beasts were most notably used in Shapur II's forces. Emperor Julian mentions their use in the wars of 337‚Äì361, which he described them to be Indian elephants and carried \\"iron towers full of archers\\"Julian, Oration 2: \\"\\" (possibly hyperbole; he was not an eye- witness to the particular battle he described). The elephants were later used by the Sasanians against Julian during his campaign in 363, including at Ctesiphon, Samarra, and later in a surprise attack on Jovian's forces. The eye-witness Ammianus Marcellinus describes the beasts as \\"gleaming elephants with ... cruel gaping jaws, pungent smell, and strange appearance\\"; at Ctesiphon, they were placed behind the Sasanian ranks, looking like \\"walking hills\\" that \\"by the movements of their enormous bodies, ... threatened destruction to all who came near them, dreaded as they were from past experience\\". But these instances were all results of \\"dire necessity rather than normal deployment\\", as they usually had little tactical impact, especially in pitched battles. When they were used in pitched battles, the elephants were usually positioned in the rear, in contrast to the classical Carthaginian and Hellenistic practices. The Sasanian elephants were most effective in siege warfare against fortified cities, where they probably carried turrets or howdahs and were used as shooting platforms. According to Procopius, emperor Justinian I had raised Dara's city walls by to hinder attacks by the Sasanian elephants. Procopius has mentioned wooden turrets that allowed the Sasanians to tower over the walls of a besieged city and shoot arrows. During the Lazic War, Mihr-Mihroe's eight elephants proved effective in the sieges of Archaeopolis and other Lazic fortifications. Miscellaneous applications of the elephants by the Sasanians are also reported; Agathias mentions their use to blockade a river in one occasion. In the Battle of the Bridge near the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the Sasanians under Bahman Jaduyah used their elite Zhayedan forces, which included war elephants, against the invading Arab Muslims under Abu Ubaid al-Thaqafi. A white elephant tore the latter from his horse with its trunk, and trampled him underfoot. The Arab Muslims suffered heavy casualties in the battle.Richard Nelson Frye, The Cambridge History of Iran: The period from the Arab invasion to the Saljuqs, (Cambridge University Press, 1975), 8-9. The elephants was also used in the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah, but was unsuccessful. =Later dynasties= The war elephants were also used by Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Buyids to a lesser extent, and also by Khwarezmids in the Samarkand area.Kistler, John M.

History  The academy is the oldest of all the Latin American Spanish language academies, the first official academy founded outside Spain. It was founded in 1871 by a group of writers and philology specialists, including Manuel Mar√≠a Mallarino; Rufino Jos√© Cuervo, the father of Hispanic-American philology; and Miguel Antonio Caro. Its first headquarters occupied the site of the house of Caro, a founder and ex-president of the group. It was constructed between 1916 and 1918, designed by Carlos Camargo Qui√±ones with the support of Pietro Cantini. The building was demolished to make way for the intersection of 19th Street with 7th Avenue, as was the nearby Church of the Conception. The academy's current site, at the intersection of 3rd Avenue and 18th Street, was constructed in the late 1950s. The neoclassical-style building was designed by the Spanish architect Alfredo Rodr√≠guez Ordaz. In 1960, the Colombian academy hosted the third Congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, in which the Bogot√° Agreement was presented and signed. The new Rodr√≠guez Orgaz building was inaugurated on that occasion. Since 1960, the institution has officially advised the Colombian government on linguistic matters. Its current and former members include Manuel Mar√≠a Mallarino, Germ√°n Arciniegas, Jaime San√≠n Echeverri, Diego Uribe Vargas, Otto Morales Ben√≠tez, Juan Gustavo Cobo Borda, Maruja Vieira, Marco Fidel Su√°rez, and Fernando Hinestrosa Forero. Its current director is Juan Carlos Vergara. The academy has two dozen members, as well as several honorary members, including Diego Uribe Vargas, Dora Castellanos, and Carlos Rodado Noriega.  Library  The academy's library was organized by the academic Manuel Jos√© Forero. It is divided into collections based on the donor who contributed the materials or to whom they originally belonged.

The type site Rom√¢ne≈üti is in the Rom√¢ne≈üti-Tome≈üti locality, Timi»ô County, Romania. Most of the information about the Tiszapolg√°r culture comes from cemeteries; over 150 individual graves have been being excavated at Tiszapolg√°r-Basatanya. The pottery is unpainted, but often polished and frequently decorated. Genetics In a 2017 genetic study published in Nature, the remains of five individuals ascribed to the Tiszapolg√°r culture was analyzed. Of the five samples of Y-DNA extracted, three belonged to G2a2b and a subclade of it, and two belonged to I2a and a subclade of it.

Life His father was a manufacturer of sewing thread; his mother, Sophie Aubineau, was a Parisian. He attended the municipal college of Lille. His teacher, a pupil of Victor Cousin, inspired him with an enthusiasm for philosophy. He gave up the practice of his Catholic religion for four years. During this time he was active in a purely philanthropic society for the aged poor. After his conversion in 1854 he turned this into a religious society. Philibert then had to retrieve heavy financial losses of the family firm. With his brother-in-law, the physician Dr. Camille F√©ron-Vrau (1831‚Äì1908), he established religious and beneficial societies for the working people, planned model dwellings for them, and also organized a society of employers and employees. They insisted on the right of the labourer to a living wage. F√©ron-Vrau was arrested in 1892 for allowing a religious element in the association of employers and employees of which he was president, and it was dissolved by law, but was soon revived under another name. Philibert Vrau was sentenced to a month's imprisonment and a fine for allowing some Sisters of Providence, in secular dress, to continue their superintendence of the women in his factory, a charge which they had begun in 1876. Nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament was introduced into Lille by Philibert Vrau in 1857. He was largely instrumental in establishing Eucharistic Congresses; the first congress was held at Lille. His nephew, Paul F√©ron-Vrau, took over in 1900 the Assumptionist imprint \\"la Bonne Presse\\", for Catholic works.

However, it has been through several incarnations: the wooden Mark I, GRP Mark III, GRP Gull Spirit and GRP Gull Calypso. Today it is popular with sailing schools, especially in the UK. The original prototype Gull (the \\"Jolly Roger\\") was built by Ian Proctor to teach his own children the skills of dinghy sailing. This became a production boat, often built from a kit, and produced by Smallcraft of Blockley. A GRP version was produced from 1966 but, being a near-exact copy of the wooden boat, was not well suited to GRP manufacture. A Mark II was introduced as a cheaper GRP version without a permanent fore-deck, but did not prove very popular. The original boats became known as Mark 1 and wooden boats, probably mainly from kits, continued to be built to this specification. In the late 1970s a Mark 3 was produced, starting with no 1800. This was a radical redesign featuring a round bilge hull, greater beam and side decks. The design was optimised for and only available in GRP. Few wooden boats are believed to have been built after the Mk3 came out. The Gull Spirit, introduced in the late 1990s by Anglo Marine Services, was a major redesign in GRP: principally a return to a double-chine hull similar to those used on the original wooden boats.Margaret Dye, Dinghy Cruising: the enjoyment of wandering afloat, 3rd ed. (2006), pages 172-174. The Spirit's interior was in many respects cloned from the larger Wanderer sailing dinghy (another Ian Proctor design). It was later followed by the Gull Calypso, a simplified design by Hartley Laminates with no wooden parts. The Gull has a reputation as a safe and stable boat but, particularly with the addition of a spinnaker, it is raced competitively. It is classed as a two-person boat but can easily be launched, sailed and recovered single- handed, making it a suitable cruising boat for the solo sailor. It can easily be rowed (with the addition of rowlocks) and can be fitted with an outboard engine. Hence, it is a very versatile boat. As of August 2013 there is now a new Gull available. The Mark 6 Gull has been redesigned and modernized and is now available from the builders, Hartley Laminates UK.

Hindwing whitish with moderate ochreous-grey dusting, a rust-coloured costal patch distally to the postmedian line of the forewing and a dark line round the distal marginal excision; the dark marks distally to the middle of the postmedian line are usually very well developed, but variable. The combination of the black spot in the form of a paw print in the middle of the whitish grey brown speckled forewing, the well defined cut in the front half of the rear edge of the forewing and the strongly pointed rear wing, distinguishes notata from other Macaria with the exception of Macaria alternata. Certain identification requires examination of the genitalia. The moth flies from May to June . The caterpillars mainly feed on birch. Notes #The flight season refers to the British Isles.

History  Cochabamba is to serve as the South American Parliament's seat. The 2004 Cusco Declaration, announcing the USAN's formation, called for the establishment of a USAN parliament. The 2008 UNASUR Constitutive Treaty (effective since 2011) confirmed its intended establishment, but does not list it with the other bodies, and does not give any details on its composition. Article 17 states that the Parliament would be located in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and its creation would be subjected to an additional protocol. A transitory article of the Treaty states how this protocol would be created: members will appoint a \\"Special Commission\\" composed of national and regional Members of Parliament who would meet in Cochabamba to draft the protocol, pending to be considered at the Fourth Summit of Unasur leaders. The protocol would lay out composition of the Parliament and how it functions. During these summits the presidents would hold meetings on energy, infrastructure, education and social policies, in addition to defining a transitional formula until the full force of the treaty, which must still be approved by legislatures, comes into effect. Foreign ministers are to meet every six months.  Functioning  The Parliament will have ninety-nine parliamentarians. Each country will delegate up to five parliamentarians, more than the Andean Parliament's members, of the Mercosur Parliament and of the parliaments of Guyana and Suriname. The presidents of the legislative bodies of each member country of the Unasur will also integrate it. It will have a routine of consistent operation in two annual meetings: the first in June and the second in November, although extraordinary meetings could also be convened. The Parliament of the Unasur will have commissions and sub-committees, presidencies and vice-presidencies, secretaries and sub-secretaries. All the pronouncements of the Parliament of the Unasur will be published in an official newspaper that will be created specifically for such purpose. Powers are to be delegated to the Parliament, in order for it to consolidate the democracy in the region, to establish cooperative relationships among the member countries, to issue declarations and make recommendations, to foster the development of the representative democracy and to be in charge of the sub-organisations and institutions of Unasur. The South American Parliament also has the task of leading the development and implementation, in coordination with the Bank of the South, of a new single South American currency that is to be in circulation throughout the region. Thus the Bank of the South, based in Venezuela and sub-offices in Buenos Aires and La Paz, in conjunction with the General Secretariat, based in Quito, and now with the South American Parliament, based in Cochabamba, is to seek economic and social well being throughout the continent and to advance the goal of establishing a future \\"Ciudadano Americano\\" (American Citizen). Other agreements would also enable the citizens of the twelve countries to move freely within the UNASUR area with only the National Identity Document of each country.  Construction  The Bolivian government has launched the start of construction of the Parliament building with an area of 200 hectares in the Valle Alto area. A specialized military academy located in the same area is to preserve the security of Parliament.

History  The poet and linguist V√≠ctor Manuel Ramos validating the Diccionario de las Lenguas de Honduras with members of the Tolupan ethnic group. The academy is the successor of Honduras' 19th-century Scientific- Literary Academy. It had a dozen founding members, with Esteban Guardiola serving as founding director. The opening session was attended by Manuel Aznar Zubigaray, a Spanish diplomat who was in the country to attend the inauguration of President Juan Manuel G√°lvez a few days later. The Academia Hondure√±a de la Lengua has been recognized for its dynamism in the face of difficult circumstances, including the destruction of the organization's building and its treasured library during Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Efforts are ongoing to rebuild the organization's library collection, whose maintenance is part of its stated mission. The Royal Spanish Academy's 400th-anniversary commemorative edition of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, which was jointly produced by 22 Spanish-language academies around the world, was initially proposed by the Honduran academy. As the organization's president at the time, √ìscar Acosta, wrote, \\"I proposed printing Quixote in a dignified format and in a wallet-friendly edition accessible to all, including those in Latin American nations with devalued currencies, an idea that was approved by unanimous consent.\\" In the 22nd edition of the Royal Spanish Academy's dictionary, published in 2001, the Academia Hondure√±a de la Lengua made a significant contribution to the world of the Spanish language: 1,950 Honduran words were added to the reference book. In the previous edition, in 1992, only 302 had been registered. The over 2,000 total Honduran words, including 400 Honduran demonyms, made Honduran Spanish one of the most significant contributors of new lexical elements to this new edition of the dictionary. In 1957, with the signing of the Treaty of Cultural Exchange between Spain and Honduras, both governments swore to \\"offer each other support ... especially to their respective Academies of Language.\\" And since 1960, with the ratification in Colombia of the Multilateral Convention on the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language, the organization has the full backing of the Honduran government, as the convention states: \\"Each of the signatory governments swears to lend moral and economic support to its respective national Academy of the Spanish Language.\\" At the end of 2011, amid the situation of threats and attacks on Honduran media outlets and \\"the irrational escalation of violence that has ended the lives of journalists and brave Hondurans,\\" the academy issued a public pronouncement \\"in favor of freedom of expression and tolerance.\\" To achieve the organization's mission of defending and enriching the Spanish language, they wrote, \\"the free circulation and expression of ideas is essential.\\"  Academy members  The academy has included many important Honduran literary and academic figures, including Eufemiano Claros, Augusto Monterroso, Eliseo P√©rez Cadalso, Jorge Fidel Dur√≥n, Manuel Salinas Paguada and Leticia de Oyuela.

In it had a population of . The kibbutz lies north to Zalafa and Salem and Highway 66 runs near it. Etymology Giv'at Oz (lit. Hill of Strength) was named after the Battle of Mishmar HaEmek which occurred during the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. History The territory on which Giv'at Oz was built was transferred from Transjordan to Israel as part of the Israeli‚ÄìJordanian Armistice Agreement of 1949. In 1948, Holocaust survivors from Hungary, members of Hashomer Hatzair, established a gar'in named \\"Yas'ur\\". The members received training in Hungary and in some kibbutzim in Israel. On 20 September 1949 the gar'in members established the kibbutz near the Arab village of Zalafa. In the early years the kibbutz suffered from lack of water, which was brought in tankers from Afula. In 1953 the water company Mekorot connected the kibbutz to a water system, allowing the agriculture sector to develop. In later years, Jewish immigrants from Brazil and members of various youth movements joined the kibbutz. In the kibbutz's first year, Jordanian forces stole a flock of five hundred sheep from the kibbutz after a brief fight. Most of the sheep were brought back thanks the UN intervention. Until 1967 Giv'at Oz had the legal status of a border settlement, which gave it the right to have war reparations as it was built near the West Bank which was then controlled by Jordan. In the late 1950s, Giv'at Oz established good relations with the nearby Arab villages Zalafa and Salem when a Kupat Holim health clinic was built in the kibbutz and also served the nearby villages. Later the kibbutz provided water and transportation services to the villages and social contact was built up between both communities as the Arab villagers started learning Hebrew. Towards the Six-Day War in 1967, trucks and tractors as well as many of the residents were conscripted to the army in May of that year. Youth from cities volunteered to help the kibbutzim that lay near the border in bringing the harvest and villagers from Zalafa and Salem also helped the kibbutz when many of its men were conscripted. In the first hours of the war, the Jordanian army shelled the kibbutz, which suffered from minor damage, as well as other kibbutzim near the Jordanian border. Israeli forces later passed through the kibbutz and entered the Jordanian-controlled West Bank to capture Jenin. Three Jordanian hunter jets attacked an Israeli convoy in the kibbutz; the workshop was damaged and an Israeli lieutenant was injured. The kibbutz remains cooperative in nature and offers welfare services to the residents. Economy In the early 1980s, the \\"Aromor\\" fragrance factory was established in order to reduce the kibbutz's dependency on agriculture. By 2011 the factory provided 40% of the local budget. In 2014 it was sold to the American Company International Flavors & Fragrances.

It is a Grade II* listed building. Clopton House The Manor of Clopton was granted to the eponymous family in the 13th century and in 1492 was owned by Hugh Clopton then Lord Mayor of London. In the late 16th century Joyce Clopton daughter of William Clopton (1538-1592), (a recusant Catholic), and heiress to the estate, married Sir George Carew (later Baron Carew and Earl of Totnes). They had no issue, and the estate fell to their nephew, Sir John Clopton. Thereafter the manor passed by marriage through the female line to the Partheriche, Boothby and Ingram families; the latter two changed their name to Clopton. A manor house existing on the site in 1450 was owned by John Clopton, Alderman of the Trinity Guild of Coventry, and was rebuilt in the 16th century. The present house is a 17th-century creation by Sir John Clopton around the core of the 16th-century manor, with 19th-century extensions and improvements. The earliest part of the house on the north was substantially rebuilt in the 1840s. The south and east wings date from 1665-70 in the Restoration style. The south front is two storied with attics and dormers. It has seven bays, the projecting central three being pedimented. The pediment over the entrance carries the Clopton family crest. The east wing is a similar but unpedimented seven bay range. The entrance porch bears an inscription FHH 1904. Clopton Tower The Cloptons sold the estate in 1824 to the Meynells, who sold it again in 1870 to George Lloyd of Welcombe House. His nephew Charles Thomas Warde (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1846) carried out the significant extensions of the 1840s and also built the Grade II listed coachhouse and Clopton Tower, a Grade II listed belvedere in the grounds. In 1872 the estate was acquired by Sir Arthur Hodgson, High Sheriff in 1881. On the death of his son Rev Francis H Hodgson (FHH) in 1930 the estate was broken up. In 1605 Ambrose Rookwood, a Gunpowder Plot conspirator, lived in the house.

The party launched with 9,200 members and was intended to unify the fractured movements of the French radical Left, and attract new activists drawing on the combined strength of far-left parties in presidential elections in 2002, where they achieved 10.44% of the vote. (Being 7% in 2007 and 13% in 2012). The party is closely associated with postal worker Olivier Besancenot, the main spokesman of the former strongest far left party, the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR). In March 2011, and were elected the main spokespersons of the NPA. In May 2012, Myriam Martin supported the candidate of the Left Front, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon in the 2012 presidential election against the candidate of the NPA, a worker and union activist at Ford's car plant in Bordeaux Philippe Poutou, who came eighth in the first round with 411,160 votes, 1.15% of the total votes. She left the NPA in July 2012.  Founding conference  At the founding conference (6 to 8 February 2009), 630 delegates voted on a series of documents, which had gone through a long process of amendment and re-amendment in local and regional assemblies. * The first document \\"Founding principles\\" detailed the party's analysis of the impasse of capitalism and the need for both mass mobilization, and, in the long term, the overthrowing of existing institutions. * The second document was the provisional rulebook, which will remain in effect until the next conference. * The third document was the Perspectives document, which attempted to set out priorities for the year ahead, and key demands to be pushed for in the immediate future. * Finally, a document on the European elections expressed the attitude of the party towards the June European elections. However, a number of contentious issues within the party ‚Äì especially those relating to secularism, religion and islamophobia ‚Äì were left open for further debate, leading to a number of difficulties and a tendency to devote considerable time and energy on internal debates, rather than activity. The party's name was originally intended to be temporary; a vote on the name was held at the founding congress, where NPA won over \\"Revolutionary Anticapitalist Party\\" (Parti anticapitaliste r√©volutionnaire) with 53% of the vote.Le Monde (Paris), 9 November 2008  Structure  Besancenot has stated that it has no single leader and is instead run collectively, being represented by elected spokespersons. The basic structure of the party is the local committee, which organises local activities. A National Political Council decides on general policy. Delegates to the Council are elected at the congress on a proportional basis, ensuring the representation of different tendencies or 'platforms'.  Ideology  During a demonstration against pension reform in October 2010 in Paris. The party's stated aim is to \\"build a new socialist, democratic perspective for the twenty-first century\\". Olivier Besancenot has said that the party will be \\"the left that fights anticapitalist, internationalist, antiracist, ecologist, feminist struggles, opposing all forms of discrimination\\". The LCR's distinctive identification with Trotskyism will not be continued by the NPA. Unlike in previous LCR documents, although feminism is very present, patriarchy theory is not mentioned. Such issues as the withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan, a rise in the minimum wage and public services, however, are accepted by all members of the NPA.  Alliances and splits  Debate continues within the NPA about what sort of alliances with other groups are acceptable. The majority of militants emphasize the dangers of allying with forces which are likely to end up in joint local or national governments with the Socialist Party (PS). A minority believes there is work to be done in wide alliances with antiliberal parties of the left, such as the Party of the Left (PG). In January 2009, the NPA signed a joint declaration with several other parties of the left, calling for the building of the January 29 national strike. A minority (16%) claimed that such unity in the strike movements means sufficient basis can be found for joint slates at the European elections, while the majority made a sharp distinction between alliances for social movements and electoral alliances. The party received 4.98% of the vote in the European election. Discussions were held in the course of 2009 with other parties to the left of the PS, concerning the possibility of joint slates for the regional elections in 2010. Finally, the NPA presented independent lists in a majority of regions, but joined the Left Front in three regions, and the Left Party in two others. Since its foundation, the NPA has suffered a number of breakaways, and by the beginning of 2015 total membership had declined to 2,100, compared with 9,200 at the time of its Founding Conference in February 2009. In addition to the loss of individual members, three organised groups have left the party in order to join the Left Front: Gauche Unitaire in 2009, Convergences et Alternative in 2011 and the largest of the three, Anticapitalist left (Gauche Anticapitaliste) in July 2012. In addition, failure to reach the required level of support in the presidential and parliamentary elections has deprived the party of state funding, leading to a financial crisis. As a result of these setbacks, the NPA is engaged in an internal debate with the aim of refounding the party and reforming its internal structures. However, the NPA continues to be active in various social movements. It produces a weekly newspaper, Tout est √† nous ! (originating as a slogan to be chanted on demonstrations, the name roughly translates as 'Everything belongs to us !') and a monthly magazine of the same name. In December 2013, the Revolutionary Marxists faction in the Fourth International declared the Anticapitalism and Revolution current in the NPA and criticized the reformist orientation of the party.  Controversy  The party became the target of criticism after Ilham Moussa√Ød, a Muslim woman wearing a hijab, became a candidate for 2010 regional elections. Supporters of the party were noted to chant slogans against Islamophobia\\"Le NPA pr√©sente une candidate voil√©e\\", Le Figaro, 2 February 2010. and the party's move was considered by some as \\"radical pragmatism\\".\\"Far-left party reveals ‚Äòveiled‚Äô female candidate\\", France 24, 3 February 2010.

First square shows his ordering the translation; second square, the translation being made. Third and fourth squares show the finished translation being brought to, and then presented to, the King. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source language text by means of an equivalent target language text.The Oxford Companion to the English Language, Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051‚Äì54. The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community. A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source language words, grammar, or syntax into the target language rendering. On the other hand, such \\"spill-overs\\" have sometimes imported useful source language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Translators, including early translators of sacred texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.Christopher Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", The Polish Review, vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87. Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator.W.J. Hutchins, Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers, Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000. More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated \\"language localization\\".M. Snell-Hornby, The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?, Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133. Etymology Rosetta Stone, a secular icon for the art of translation\\"Rosetta Stone\\", The Columbia Encyclopedia, 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361. The English word \\"translation\\" derives from the Latin word translatio, which comes from trans, \\"across\\" + ferre, \\"to carry\\" or \\"to bring\\" (-latio in turn coming from latus, the past participle of ferre). Thus translatio is \\"a carrying across\\" or \\"a bringing across\\": in this case, of a text from one language to another.Christopher Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", p. 83. Some Slavic languages and the Germanic languages (other than Dutch and Afrikaans) have calqued their words for the concept of \\"translation\\" on translatio.The Dutch for \\"translation\\" is vertaling, from the verb vertalen, itself derived from taal, \\"language\\", plus prefix ver-. The Afrikaans for \\"translation\\", derived from the Dutch, is vertaling.\\"overzetting\\" in Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal, IvdNT The Romance languages and the remaining Slavic languages have derived their words for the concept of \\"translation\\" from an alternative Latin word, traductio, itself derived from traducere (\\"to lead across\\" or \\"to bring across\\", from trans, \\"across\\" + ducere, \\"to lead\\" or \\"to bring\\"). The Ancient Greek term for \\"translation\\", (metaphrasis, \\"a speaking across\\"), has supplied English with \\"metaphrase\\" (a \\"literal\\", or \\"word-for- word\\", translation)‚Äîas contrasted with \\"paraphrase\\" (\\"a saying in other words\\", from , paraphrasis). \\"Metaphrase\\" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to \\"formal equivalence\\"; and \\"paraphrase\\", to \\"dynamic equivalence\\".Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", p. 84. Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase‚Äîof \\"word-for-word translation\\"‚Äîis an imperfect concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word. Nevertheless, \\"metaphrase\\" and \\"paraphrase\\" may be useful as ideal concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation. Theories=Western theory= John Dryden Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into antiquity and show remarkable continuities. The ancient Greeks distinguished between metaphrase (literal translation) and paraphrase. This distinction was adopted by English poet and translator John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, \\"counterparts,\\" or equivalents, for the expressions used in the source language: Cicero Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of \\"imitation\\", i.e., of adapted translation: \\"When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments...\\" This general formulation of the central concept of translation‚Äîequivalence‚Äîis as adequate as any that has been proposed since Cicero and Horace, who, in 1st-century-BCE Rome, famously and literally cautioned against translating \\"word for word\\" (). Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual practice of translation has hardly changed since antiquity. Except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early Christian period and the Middle Ages, and adapters in various periods (especially pre- Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents‚Äî\\"literal\\" where possible, paraphrastic where necessary‚Äîfor the original meaning and other crucial \\"values\\" (e.g., style, verse form, concordance with musical accompaniment or, in films, with speech articulatory movements) as determined from context. Samuel Johnson In general, translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes, and hence word order‚Äîwhen necessary, reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure, for example, by shifting from active to passive voice, or vice versa. The grammatical differences between \\"fixed-word-order\\" languagesTypically, analytic languages. (e.g. English, French, German) and \\"free-word-order\\" languagesTypically, synthetic languages. (e.g., Greek, Latin, Polish, Russian) have been no impediment in this regard. The particular syntax (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. Martin Luther When a target language has lacked terms that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of calques and loanwords between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few concepts that are \\"untranslatable\\" among the modern European languages. A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.Some examples of this are described in the article, \\"Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories\\", retrieved 15 April 2010. For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a gloss. Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in ecological niches of words, a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English actual should not be confused with the cognate French (\\"present\\", \\"current\\"), the Polish (\\"present\\", \\"current,\\" \\"topical\\", \\"timely\\", \\"feasible\\"),Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", p. 85. the Swedish aktuell (\\"topical\\", \\"presently of importance\\"), the Russian (\\"urgent\\", \\"topical\\") or the Dutch actueel (\\"current\\"). The translator's role as a bridge for \\"carrying across\\" values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence, the 2nd-century- BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an artist. The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero. Dryden observed that \\"Translation is a type of drawing after life...\\" Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson's remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet, while Homer himself used a bassoon. Johann Gottfried Herder If translation be an art, it is no easy one. In the 13th century, Roger Bacon wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both languages, as well as the science that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", pp. 85-86. Ignacy Krasicki The translator of the Bible into German, Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since Johann Gottfried Herder in the 18th century, \\"it has been axiomatic\\" that one translates only toward his own language.L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", p. 86. Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no dictionary or thesaurus can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian Alexander Tytler, in his Essay on the Principles of Translation (1790), emphasized that assiduous reading is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including listening to the spoken language, had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and grammarian Onufry Kopczy≈Ñski.Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", p. 86. The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by \\"Poland's La Fontaine\\", the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland, poet, encyclopedist, author of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, Ignacy Krasicki: =Other traditions= Due to Western colonialism and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations. Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre- Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.  Near East  Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Assyria (Syriac language), Anatolia, and Israel (Hebrew language) go back several millennia. There exist partial translations of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 2000 BCE) into Southwest Asian languages of the second millennium BCE.J.M. Cohen, \\"Translation\\", Encyclopedia Americana, 1986, vol. 27, p. 12. An early example of a bilingual document is the 1274 BCE Treaty of Kadesh between the ancient Egyptian and Hittie empires. Asia Buddhist Diamond Sutra, translated into Chinese by KumƒÅrajƒ´va: world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE) There is a separate tradition of translation in South, Southeast and East Asia (primarily of texts from the Indian and Chinese civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly Buddhist, texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and Chinese translation theory identifies various criteria and limitations in translation. In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation per se has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial borrowings of Chinese vocabulary and writing system. Notable is the Japanese kanbun, a system for glossing Chinese texts for Japanese speakers. Though Indianized states in Southeast Asia often translated Sanskrit material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government. Perry Link Some special aspects of translating from Chinese are illustrated in Perry Link's discussion of translating the work of the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Wei (699‚Äì759 CE).Perry Link, \\"A Magician of Chinese Poetry\\" (review of Eliot Weinberger, with an afterword by Octavio Paz, 19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei (with More Ways), New Directions; and Eliot Weinberger, The Ghosts of Birds, New Directions), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIII, no. 18 (24 November 2016), pp. 49‚Äì50. Once the untranslatables have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two: What does the translator think the poetic line says? And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the target language? Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, \\"where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate.\\" Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit dilemma. At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem. \\"The dissection, though,\\" writes Link, \\"normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the scalpel of an anatomy instructor does to the life of a frog.\\" Chinese characters, in avoiding grammatical specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of subject, number, and tense.Perry Link, \\"A Magician of Chinese Poetry\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIII, no. 18 (24 November 2016), p. 50. It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit subjects; the reader or listener infers a subject. The grammars of some Western languages, however, require that a subject be stated (although this is often avoided by using a passive or impersonal construction). Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's 19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei supply a subject. Weinberger points out, however, that when an \\"I\\" as a subject is inserted, a \\"controlling individual mind of the poet\\" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line. Without a subject, he writes, \\"the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader.\\" Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's passive voice; but this again particularizes the experience too much. Nouns have no number in Chinese. \\"If,\\" writes Link, \\"you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a \\"measure word\\" to say \\"one blossom-of roseness.\\" Chinese verbs are tense-less: there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but verb tense is not one of them. For poets, this creates the great advantage of ambiguity. According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness‚Äîthat it produces an effect \\"both universal and immediate\\"‚Äîapplies to timelessness as well. Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation: Islamic world Translation of material into Arabic expanded after the creation of Arabic script in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of Islam and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the Al-Karaouine (Fes, Morocco), Al-Azhar (Cairo, Egypt), and the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions. Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges. Especially after the Renaissance, Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins. Arabic, and to a lesser degree Persian, became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions. In the 19th century, after the Middle East's Islamic clerics and copyists A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801‚Äì73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students. After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of Muhammad Ali (1769‚Äì1849), the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, al‚ÄìTahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to Voltaire's biography of Peter the Great, along with the Marseillaise and the entire Code Napol√©on. This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since Abbasid times (750‚Äì1258).Malise Ruthven, \\"The Islamic Road to the Modern World\\" (review of Christopher de Bellaigue, The Islamic Enlightenment: The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times, Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, Freedom in the Arab World: Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century, Cambridge University Press), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22. Muhammad Abduh The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and Ottoman Turkish languages, and new words, simplified syntax, and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions. Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized civil service expressed skepticism, writes Christopher de Bellaigue, \\"with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today ... No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness. It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world.\\" One of the neologisms that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was \\"darwiniya\\", or \\"Darwinism\\". One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was Muhammad Abduh (1849‚Äì1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority‚Äîits chief mufti‚Äîat the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of Darwin who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent Herbert Spencer at his home in Brighton. Spencer's view of society as an organism with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.Christopher de Bellaigue, \\"Dreams of Islamic Liberalism\\" (review of Marwa Elshakry, Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860‚Äì1950), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 10 (4 June 2015), p. 77‚Äì78. After World War I, when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the Sykes-Picot agreement‚Äîin violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy‚Äîthere came an immediate reaction: the Muslim Brotherhood emerged in Egypt, the House of Saud took over the Hijaz, and regimes led by army officers came to power in Iran and Turkey. \\"[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East,\\" writes de Bellaigue, \\"Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western empire-builders.\\" As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.Christopher de Bellaigue, \\"Dreams of Islamic Liberalism\\" (review of Marwa Elshakry, Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860‚Äì1950), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 10 (4 June 2015), p. 78. Fidelity and transparency Dryden Fidelity (or \\"faithfulness\\") and felicityMarina Warner, \\"The Politics of Translation\\" (a review of Kate Briggs, This Little Art, 2017; Mireille Gansel, translated by Ros Schwartz, 2017; Mark Polizzotti, Sympathy for the Traitor: A Translation Manifesto, 2018; Boyd Tonkin, ed., The 100 Best Novels in Translation, 2018; Clive Scott, The Work of Literary Translation, 2018), London Review of Books, vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22. (or transparency), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase \\"\\" to suggest that translations can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both. Fidelity is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the source text, without distortion. Transparency is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology Sylvae: A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be \\"faithful\\"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, \\"idiomatic\\". Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive. The criteria for judging the fidelity of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc. The criteria for judging the transparency of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation \\"sounds wrong\\"; and, in the extreme case of word-for-word translations generated by many machine-translation systems, often results in patent nonsense. Schleiermacher Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a literal translation. Translators of literary, religious, or historic texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text. Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide \\"local color\\". Venuti While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of \\"fidelity\\" and \\"transparency\\", this has not always been the case. There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of adaptation. Adapted translation retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The Indian epic, the Ramayana, appears in many versions in the various Indian languages, and the stories are different in each. Similar examples are to be found in medieval Christian literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores. Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from German Romanticism, the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher. In his seminal lecture \\"On the Different Methods of Translation\\" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move \\"the writer toward [the reader]\\", i.e., transparency, and those that move the \\"reader toward [the author]\\", i.e., an extreme fidelity to the foreignness of the source text. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote German literature. In recent decades, prominent advocates of such \\"non-transparent\\" translation have included the French scholar Antoine Berman, who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,Antoine Berman, L'√©preuve de l'√©tranger, 1984. and the American theorist Lawrence Venuti, who has called on translators to apply \\"foreignizing\\" rather than domesticating translation strategies.Lawrence Venuti, \\"Call to Action\\", in The Translator's Invisibility, 1994. =Equivalence= The question of fidelity vs. transparency has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, \\"formal equivalence\\" and \\"dynamic [or functional] equivalence\\" ‚Äì expressions associated with the translator Eugene Nida and originally coined to describe ways of translating the Bible; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation. \\"Formal equivalence\\" corresponds to \\"metaphrase\\", and \\"dynamic equivalence\\" to \\"paraphrase\\". \\"Formal equivalence\\" (sought via \\"literal\\" translation) attempts to render the text literally, or \\"word for word\\" (the latter expression being itself a word- for-word rendering of the classical Latin ) ‚Äì if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language. By contrast, \\"dynamic equivalence\\" (or \\"functional equivalence\\") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text‚Äîif necessary, at the expense of literality, original sememe and word order, the source text's active vs. passive voice, etc. There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text ‚Äì sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional equivalents.Christopher Kasparek, \\"The Translator's Endless Toil\\", pp. 83-87. Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as \\"false friends\\" and false cognates. =Back-translation= A \\"back-translation\\" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation. But the results of such reverse- translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable. Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because linguistic symbols (words) are often ambiguous, whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal. In the context of machine translation, a back-translation is also called a \\"round-trip translation.\\" When translations are produced of material used in medical clinical trials, such as informed-consent forms, a back-translation is often required by the ethics committee or institutional review board. Mark Twain back-translated his own story, \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\". Mark Twain provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his short story, \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\". He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a \\"Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story\\". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's Greek Prose Composition (p. 116) under the title, \\"The Athenian and the Frog\\"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent ancient Greek precursor to Twain's \\"Jumping Frog\\" story.

Strothman, New York and London, Harper & Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903. When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel The Saragossa Manuscript by the Polish aristocrat Jan Potocki (1761‚Äì1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813‚Äì14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation, made by Edmund Chojecki in 1847 from a complete French copy that has since been lost. French-language versions of the complete Saragossa Manuscript have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, The History of Polish Literature, pp. 193‚Äì94. Many works by the influential Classical physician Galen survive only in medieval Arabic translation. Some survive only in Renaissance Latin translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original Greek. When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as idioms, puns, peculiar grammatical structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language. For example, the known text of the Till Eulenspiegel folk tales is in High German but contains puns that work only when back-translated to Low German. This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator. Supporters of Aramaic primacy‚Äîthe view that the Christian New Testament or its sources were originally written in the Aramaic language‚Äîseek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing Greek text of the New Testament make much more sense when back-translated to Aramaic: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek. Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic Gospel of Judas, which survives only in Coptic, was originally written in Greek. John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles. Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in prepositions because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.Gilman, E. Ward (ed.). 1989. \\"A Brief History of English Usage\\", Webster's Dictionary of English Usage. Springfield (Mass.): Merriam-Webster, pp. 7a-11a, Dryden created the proscription against \\"preposition stranding\\" in 1672 when he objected to Ben Jonson's 1611 phrase, \\"the bodies that those souls were frighted from\\", though he did not provide the rationale for his preference.Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f. Dryden often translated his writing into Latin, to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long- lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers. = Source and target languages = In the practice of translation, the source language is the language being translated from, while the target language, also called the receptor language,Willis Barnstone, The Poetics of Translation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), p. 228. is the language being translated into.Basil Hatim and Jeremy Munday, Translation: An Advanced Resource Book, Introduction, pg. 10. Milton Park: Routledge, 2004. Difficulties in translating can arise from lexical and syntactical differences between the source language and the target language, which differences tend to be greater between two languages belonging to different language families.Bai Liping, \\"Similarity and difference in Translation.\\" Taken from Similarity and Difference in Translation: Proceedings of the International Conference on Similarity and Translation, pg. 339. Eds. Stefano Arduini and Robert Hodgson. 2nd ed. Rome: Edizioni di storia e letteratura, 2007. Often the source language is the translator's second language, while the target language is the translator's first language.Carline F√©Railleur-Dumoulin, A Career in Language Translation: Insightful Information to Guide You in Your Journey as a Professional Translator, pgs. 1-2. Bloomington: AuthorHouse, 2009. In some geographical settings, however, the source language is the translator's first language because not enough people speak the source language as a second language. For instance, a 2005 survey found that 89% of professional Slovene translators translate into their second language, usually English. In cases where the source language is the translator's first language, the translation process has been referred to by various terms, including \\"translating into a non- mother tongue\\", \\"translating into a second language\\", \\"inverse translation\\", \\"reverse translation\\", \\"service translation\\", and \\"translation from A to B\\". Translation for specialized or professional fields requires a working knowledge, as well, of the pertinent terminology in the field. For example, translation of a legal text requires not only fluency in the respective languages but also familiarity with the terminology specific to the legal field in each language.Gerard-Rene de Groot, \\"Translating legal information.\\" Taken from Translation in Law, vol. 5 of the Journal of Legal Hermeneutics, pg. 132. Ed. Giuseppe Zaccaria. Hamburg: LIT Verlag Munster, 2000. While the form and style of the source language often cannot be reproduced in the target language, the meaning and content can. Linguist Roman Jakobson went so far as to assert that all cognitive experience can be classified and expressed in any living language. Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann suggests that the limits are not of translation per se but rather of elegant translation.  Source and target texts  In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given source language which is to be, or has been, translated into another language, while a target text (TT) is a translated text written in the intended target language, which is the result of a translation from a given source text. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, \\"the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)\\". The terms 'source text' and 'target text' are preferred over 'original' and 'translation' because they do not have the same positive vs. negative value judgment. Translation scholars including Eugene Nida and Peter Newmark have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.  Translators  Competent translators show the following attributes: *a very good knowledge of the language, written and spoken, from which they are translating (the source language); *an excellent command of the language into which they are translating (the target language); *familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated; *a profound understanding of the etymological and idiomatic correlates between the two languages, including sociolinguistic register when appropriate; and *a finely tuned sense of when to metaphrase (\\"translate literally\\") and when to paraphrase, so as to assure true rather than spurious equivalents between the source and target language texts.*Christopher Kasparek, \\"Prus' Pharaoh and Curtin's Translation,\\" The Polish Review, vol. XXXI, nos. 2‚Äì3 (1986), p. 135. A competent translator is not only bilingual but bicultural. A language is not merely a collection of words and of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences, but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations and cultural references whose mastery, writes linguist Mario Pei, \\"comes close to being a lifetime job.\\"Mario Pei, The Story of Language, p. 424. The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator‚Äîafter having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures‚Äîmay require a minimum of ten years' experience. Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them. The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art. Translation, like other human activities,Stephen Greenblatt, \\"Can We Ever Master King Lear?\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIV, no. 3 (23 February 2017), p. 36. entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation. Mark Polizzotti writes: \\"A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re- representation, just as the performance of a play or a sonata is a representation of the script or the score, one among many possible representations.\\"Mark Polizzotti, quoted in Marina Warner, \\"The Politics of Translation\\" (a review of Kate Briggs, This Little Art, 2017; Mireille Gansel, Translation as Transhumance, translated by Ros Schwartz, 2017; Mark Polizzotti, Sympathy for the Traitor: A Translation Manifesto, 2018; Boyd Tonkin, ed., The 100 Best Novels in Translation, 2018; Clive Scott, The Work of Literary Translation, 2018), London Review of Books, vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 21. The English-language novelist Joseph Conrad, whose writings Zdzis≈Çaw Najder has described as verging on \\"auto-translation\\" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae,Zdzis≈Çaw Najder, Joseph Conrad: A Life, 2007, p. IX. advised his niece and Polish translator Aniela Zag√≥rska: \\"[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous ... I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion il vaut mieux interpr√©ter que traduire [it is better to interpret than to translate] ...Il s'agit donc de trouver les √©quivalents. Et l√†, ma ch√®re, je vous prie laissez vous guider plut√¥t par votre temp√©rament que par une conscience s√©v√®re ... [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions. And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]\\"Zdzis≈Çaw Najder, Joseph Conrad: A Life, 2007, p. 524. Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be \\"idiomatic\\". \\"For in the idiom is the clearness of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness‚Äîby which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words.\\"Zdzis≈Çaw Najder, Joseph Conrad: A Life, 2007, p. 332. Conrad thought C.K. Scott Moncrieff's English translation of Marcel Proust's √Ä la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time‚Äîor, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, Remembrance of Things Past) to be preferable to the French original.Walter Kaiser, \\"A Hero of Translation\\" (a review of Jean Findlay, Chasing Lost Time: The Life of C.K. Scott Moncrieff: Soldier, Spy, and Translator), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 10 (4 June 2015), p. 55. The necessity of making choices, and therefore of interpretation, in translating (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the ambiguity that subjectively pervades the universe. Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human language. Psychologist and neural scientist Gary Marcus notes that \\"virtually every sentence [that people generate] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways. Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice.\\"Gary Marcus, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63. An example of linguistic ambiguity is the \\"pronoun disambiguation problem\\" (\\"PDP\\"): a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence‚Äîsuch as \\"he\\", \\"she\\" or \\"it\\"‚Äîrefers.Gary Marcus, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61. Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either. Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic William Empson have demonstrated, to literary critics. Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in poetry and diplomacy; it can be more problematic in ordinary prose.David Bromwich, \\"In Praise of Ambiguity\\" (a review of Michael Wood, On Empson, Princeton University Press, 2017), The New York Review of Books), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50‚Äì52. A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks: when translating, to strive for omniscience; when reviewing the resulting translation, to assume (the naive reader's) ignorance. Translators may render only parts of the original text, provided that they inform readers of that action. But a translator should not assume the role of censor and surreptitiously delete or bowdlerize passages merely to please a political or moral interest.Billiani, Francesca (2001) Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of painting has schooled many a novice painter.Anka Muhlstein, \\"Painters and Writers: When Something New Happens\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIV, no. 1 (19 January 2017), p. 35. A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own. Translating (like analytic philosophy) compels precise analysis of language elements and of their usage. In 1946 the poet Ezra Pound, then at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, in Washington, D.C., advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet W.S. Merwin: \\"The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have.\\"W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree: one-hour documentary shown on PBS. Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an \\"impossible, unfinishable\\" art.Merwin's introduction to his 2013 Selected Translations, quoted by Ange Mlinko, \\"Whole Earth Troubador\\" (review of The Essential W.S. Merlin, edited by Michael Wiegers, Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45. Translators, including monks who spread Buddhist texts in East Asia, and the early modern European translators of the Bible, in the course of their work have shaped the very languages into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between cultures; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, loanwords and calques of grammatical structures, idioms, and vocabulary. =Interpreting= Hern√°n Cort√©s and La Malinche meet Moctezuma II in Tenochtitlan, 8 November 1519. Lewis and Clark and their Native American interpreter, Sacagawea Interpreting is the facilitation of oral or sign- language communication, either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language. The term \\"interpreting,\\" rather than \\"interpretation,\\" is preferentially used for this activity by Anglophone translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word \\"interpretation.\\" Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of written and live-communication (oral or sign-language) translators. Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using \\"translating\\" as a synonym for \\"interpreting.\\" Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in history. A prime example is La Malinche, also known as Malintzin, Malinalli and Do√±a Marina, an early-16th-century Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast. As a child she had been sold or given to Maya slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the Spanish conquest of Mexico, acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to Hern√°n Cort√©s.Hugh Thomas, Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72. Nearly three centuries later, in the United States, a comparable role as interpreter was played for the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804‚Äì6 by Sacagawea. As a child, the Lemhi Shoshone woman had been kidnapped by Hidatsa Indians and thus had become bilingual. Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the North American continent to the Pacific Ocean.\\"Sacagawea\\", The Encyclopedia Americana, 1986, volume 24, p. 72. =Sworn translation= Sworn translation, also called \\"certified translation,\\" aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations, which vary widely from country to country. Some countries recognize self-declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, certain government institutions require that translators be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations. =Telephone= Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone. There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages. =Internet= Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available. With the recent emergence of translation crowdsourcing, translation memory techniques, and internet applications, translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to businesses, individuals, and enterprises. While not instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as Google Translate and Babel Fish (now defunct), web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast, accurate translation of business communications, legal documents, medical records, and software localization. Web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers. Contents of websites are translatable but urls of websites are not translatable into other languages. Language tools on the internet provide help in understanding text. =Computer assist= Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called \\"computer-aided translation,\\" \\"machine-aided human translation\\" (MAHT) and \\"interactive translation,\\" is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a target text with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator. Computer-assisted translation can include standard dictionary and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including translation memory, terminology-management, concordance, and alignment programs. These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation. The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation. Machine translation Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a source text and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and post-editing.See the annually performed NIST tests since 2001 and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy With proper terminology work, with preparation of the source text for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a translation memory or translation management system. Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the Internet such as Google Translate, Babel Fish (now defunct), Babylon, and StarDict. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, \\"give the gist\\" of the source text. With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening. Interactive translations with pop-up windows are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation. Also, companies such as Ectaco produce pocket devices that provide machine translations. Claude Piron Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in human language is context-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human. Claude Piron writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.Claude Piron, Le d√©fi des langues (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994. Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be meaningless. The weaknesses of pure machine translation, unaided by human expertise, are those of artificial intelligence itself.Gary Marcus, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58‚Äì63. As of 2018, professional translator Mark Polizzotti held that machine translation, by Google Translate and the like, was unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines would never grasp nuance and connotation.Wilson, Emily, \\"The Pleasures of Translation\\" (review of Mark Polizzotti, Sympathy for the Traitor: A Translation Manifesto, MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47. Literary translation A 1998 nonfiction book by Robert Wechsler on literary translation as a performative, rather than creative, art Translation of literary works (novels, short stories, plays, poems, etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in Canadian literature specifically as translators are figures such as Sheila Fischman, Robert Dickson, and Linda Gaboriau; and the Canadian Governor General's Awards annually present prizes for the best English-to- French and French-to-English literary translations. Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include Vasily Zhukovsky, Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Robert Stiller, Lydia Davis, Haruki Murakami, Achy Obejas, and Jhumpa Lahiri. In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English, with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the Women in Translation campaign to address this. =History= The first important translation in the West was that of the Septuagint, a collection of Jewish Scriptures translated into early Koine Greek in Alexandria between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed Jews had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.J.M. Cohen, p. 12. Throughout the Middle Ages, Latin was the lingua franca of the western learned world. The 9th- century Alfred the Great, king of Wessex in England, was far ahead of his time in commissioning vernacular Anglo-Saxon translations of Bede's Ecclesiastical History and Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. Meanwhile, the Christian Church frowned on even partial adaptations of St. Jerome's Vulgate of c. 384 CE,J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13. the standard Latin Bible. In Asia, the spread of Buddhism led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The Tangut Empire was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented block printing, and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the Chinese centuries to render. The Arabs undertook large-scale efforts at translation. Having conquered the Greek world, they made Arabic versions of its philosophical and scientific works. During the Middle Ages, translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at C√≥rdoba in Spain.J.M. Cohen, p. 13. King Alfonso X the Wise of Castile in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a Schola Traductorum (School of Translation) in Toledo. There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions. Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture. The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the English language. Geoffrey Chaucer The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer, who adapted from the Italian of Giovanni Boccaccio in his own Knight's Tale and Troilus and Criseyde; began a translation of the French- language Roman de la Rose; and completed a translation of Boethius from the Latin. Chaucer founded an English poetic tradition on adaptations and translations from those earlier-established literary languages. The first great English translation was the Wycliffe Bible (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English prose. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with Thomas Malory's Le Morte Darthur‚Äîan adaptation of Arthurian romances so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great Tudor translations are, accordingly, the Tyndale New Testament (1525), which influenced the Authorized Version (1611), and Lord Berners' version of Jean Froissart's Chronicles (1523‚Äì25). Marsilio Ficino Meanwhile, in Renaissance Italy, a new period in the history of translation had opened in Florence with the arrival, at the court of Cosimo de' Medici, of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of Plato's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino. This and Erasmus' Latin edition of the New Testament led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of Plato, Aristotle and Jesus. Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on adaptation. France's Pl√©iade, England's Tudor poets, and the Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid, Petrarch and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a middle class and the development of printing, with works such as the original authors would have written, had they been writing in England in that day. The Elizabethan period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere paraphrase toward an ideal of stylistic equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for verbal accuracy.J.M. Cohen, p. 14. In the second half of the 17th century, the poet John Dryden sought to make Virgil speak \\"in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman\\". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, Homer arguably suffers from Alexander Pope's endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's \\"wild paradise\\" to order. Both works live on as worthy English epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek. Edward FitzGerald Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or‚Äîas in the case of James Macpherson's \\"translations\\" of Ossian‚Äîfrom texts that were actually of the \\"translator's\\" own composition. Benjamin Jowett The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became \\"the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text\\", except for any bawdy passages and the addition of copious explanatory footnotes. In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo- metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a foreign classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original. In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by Benjamin Jowett, who translated Plato into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion. =Modern translation= As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language‚Äîoriginal texts, or old translations‚Äîmay become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a \\"modern translation\\" (e.g., a \\"modern English translation\\" or \\"modernized translation\\"). Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as Latin or Greek, notably to the Bible (see \\"Modern English Bible translations\\"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of William Shakespeare (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with Geoffrey Chaucer's Middle-English Canterbury Tales (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes). In 2015 the Oregon Shakespeare Festival commissioned professional translation of the entire Shakespeare canon, including disputed works such as Edward III, into contemporary vernacular English; in 2019, off-off-Broadway, the canon was premiered in a month-long series of staged readings. Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history. For example, in Japanese the 11th-century Tale of Genji is generally read in modern translation (see \\"Genji: modern readership\\"). Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes. \\"Translating the long-dead language Homer used ‚Äî a variant of ancient Greek called Homeric Greek ‚Äî into contemporary English is no easy task, and translators bring their own skills, opinions, and stylistic sensibilities to the text. The result is that every translation is different, almost a new poem in itself.\\" A recent example is Emily Wilson's new translation of The Odyssey, where as a translator she makes the conscious choice to lay bare the morals of Homer's time and place, and invites us to consider how different they are from our own, and how similar. Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists. In English, some readers prefer the Authorized King James Version of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations. An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of extensive reading (for examples, see \\"List of Latin translations of modern literature\\"). =Poetry= Hofstadter Jakobson Nabokov Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.). Douglas Hofstadter, in his 1997 book, Le Ton beau de Marot, argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, \\"Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This,\\" Newsweek, 18 May 2009, p. 10. The Russian-born linguist and semiotician Roman Jakobson, however, had in his 1959 paper \\"On Linguistic Aspects of Translation\\", declared that \\"poetry by definition [is] untranslatable\\". Vladimir Nabokov, another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's. He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin in prose. Hofstadter, in Le Ton beau de Marot, criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation. In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of Eugene Onegin, in verse form. However, a host of more contemporary literary translators of poetry lean toward Alexander von Humboldt's notion of language as a \\"third universe\\" existing \\"midway between the phenomenal reality of the 'empirical world' and the internalized structures of consciousness.\\" Perhaps this is what poet Sholeh Wolp√©, translator of the 12th-century Iranian epic poem The Conference of the Birds, means when she writes: > Twelfth-century Persian and contemporary English are as different as sky and > sea. The best I can do as a poet is to reflect one into the other. The sea > can reflect the sky with its moving stars, shifting clouds, gestations of > the moon, and migrating birds‚Äîbut ultimately the sea is not the sky. By > nature, it is liquid. It ripples. There are waves. If you are a fish living > in the sea, you can only understand the sky if its reflection becomes part > of the water. Therefore, this translation of The Conference of the Birds, > while faithful to the original text, aims at its re-creation into a still > living and breathing work of literature. Poet Sherod Santos writes: \\"The task is not to reproduce the content, but with the flint and the steel of one's own language to spark what Robert Lowell has called 'the fire and finish of the original.'\\" According to Walter Benjamin: > While a poet's words endure in his own language, even the greatest > translation is destined to become part of the growth of its own language and > eventually to perish with its renewal. Translation is so far removed from > being the sterile equation of two dead languages that of all literary forms > it is the one charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing > process of the original language and the birth pangs of its own. Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing Roman adapted translations of ancient Greek literature, makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by David Bellos, an accomplished French-to- English translator. Hays writes: =Book titles= Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book. An example of a symbolic book title is Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, whose original Swedish title is M√§n som hatar kvinnor (Men Who Hate Women). Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work. When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.Ji≈ô√≠ Lev√Ω, The Art of Translation, Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122. =Plays= The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively. Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics of the auditorium, i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.Ji≈ô√≠ Lev√Ω, The Art of Translation, Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, pp. 129-39. Audiences in Shakespeare's time were more accustomed than modern playgoers to actors having longer stage time. Modern translators tend to simplify the sentence structures of earlier dramas, which included compound sentences with intricate hierarchies of subordinate clauses.Ji≈ô√≠ Lev√Ω, The Art of Translation, Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 129. =Chinese literature= In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the target language. In The Poem Behind the Poem, Barnstone argues that poetry \\"can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator\\".Frank Stewart, The Poem Behind the Poem, Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004. A notable piece of work translated into English is the Wen Xuan, an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the genres presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the Wen Xuan one of the most difficult literary works to translate.Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, Translating Chinese Literature, Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42‚Äì43. Translation generally, much as with Kurt G√∂del's conception of mathematics, requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated. =Sung texts= Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language‚Äîsometimes called \\"singing translation\\"‚Äîis closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music, at least in the Western tradition, is set to verse, especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church hymns, such as the German chorales translated into English by Catherine Winkworth. Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator. There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line. Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a contrafactum. Translations of sung texts‚Äîwhether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read‚Äîare also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing. =Religious texts= Jerome, patron saint of translators and encyclopedists An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, Buddhist monks who translated the Indian sutras into Chinese occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect China's distinct culture, emphasizing notions such as filial piety. One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the 3rd century BCE rendering of some books of the biblical Old Testament from Hebrew into Koine Greek. The translation is known as the \\"Septuagint\\", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the Bible at Alexandria, Egypt. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and, according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The Septuagint became the source text for later translations into many languages, including Latin, Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian. Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the Bible into Latin, is Jerome (347‚Äì420 CE), the patron saint of translators. For centuries the Roman Catholic Church used his translation (known as the Vulgate), though even this translation stirred controversy. By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430 CE), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning. Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of \\"overdetermination\\". For example, Isaiah's prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word 'almah, which is also used to describe the dancing girls at Solomon's court, and simply means young and nubile. Jerome, writes Marina Warner, translates it as virgo, \\"adding divine authority to the virulent cult of sexual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] Quran, free from this linguistic trap, does not connect Mariam/Mary's miraculous nature with moral horror of sex).\\" The apple that Eve offered to Adam, according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an apricot, orange, or banana; but Jerome liked the pun malus/malum (apple/evil). Pope Francis has suggested that the phrase \\"lead us not into temptation\\", in the Lord's Prayer found in the Gospels of Matthew (the first Gospel, written c. 80‚Äì90 CE) and Luke (the third Gospel, written c. 80‚Äì110 CE), should more properly be translated, \\"do not let us fall into temptation\\", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation‚ÄîSatan does. Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and Jerome's Latin Vulgate similarly to Pope Francis. A.J.B. HigginsA.J.B. Higgins, \\"'Lead Us Not into Temptation': Some Latin Variants\\", Journal of Theological Studies, 1943. in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes. These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like \\"do not let us fall\\" could be an acceptable English rendering. Higgins cited Tertullian, the earliest of the Latin Church Fathers (c. 155‚Äìc. 240 CE, \\"do not allow us to be led\\") and Cyprian (c. 200‚Äì258 CE, \\"do not allow us to be led into temptation\\"). A later author, Ambrose (C. 340‚Äì397 CE), followed Cyprian's interpretation. Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that \\"many people... say it this way: 'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'\\"Charles McNamara, \\"Lead Us Not into Temptation? Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer\\", Commonweal, 1 January 2018. In 863 CE the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius, the Byzantine Empire's \\"Apostles to the Slavs\\", began translating parts of the Bible into the Old Church Slavonic language, using the Glagolitic script that they had devised, based on the Greek alphabet. The periods preceding and contemporary with the Protestant Reformation saw translations of the Bible into vernacular (local) European languages‚Äîa development that contributed to Western Christianity's split into Roman Catholicism and Protestantism over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant- perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church). Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such Bible translations as Martin Luther's into German (the New Testament, 1522), Jakub Wujek's into Polish (1599, as revised by the Jesuits), and William Tyndale's (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the King James Version into English (1611). Mistranslation: Michelangelo's horned Moses Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their martyrs. William Tyndale (c. 1494‚Äì1536) was convicted of heresy at Antwerp, was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.. Earlier, John Wycliffe (c. mid-1320s ‚Äì 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the Council of Constance in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by Pope Martin V, was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the River Swift. Debate and religious schism over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the King James Only movement. A famous mistranslation of a Biblical text is the rendering of the Hebrew word (keren), which has several meanings, as \\"horn\\" in a context where it more plausibly means \\"beam of light\\": as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor Michelangelo, have rendered Moses the Lawgiver with horns growing from his forehead. Chinese translation, verses 33‚Äì34 of Quran's surah (chapter) 36 Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the Islamic world's ambivalence about translating the Quran (also spelled Koran) from the original Arabic, as received by the prophet Muhammad from Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel incrementally between 609 and 632 CE, the year of Muhammad's death. During prayers, the Quran, as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic. However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages. A fundamental difficulty in translating the Quran accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a Hebrew or Aramaic word, may have a range of meanings, depending on context. This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all Semitic languages, that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages. There is always an element of human judgment‚Äîof interpretation‚Äîinvolved in understanding and translating a text. Muslims regard any translation of the Quran as but one possible interpretation of the Quranic (Classical) Arabic text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original. Hence such a translation is often called an \\"interpretation\\" rather than a translation.Malise Ruthven, Islam in the World, Granta, 2006, p. 90, . To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed over time, between the Classical Arabic of the Quran, and modern Arabic. Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the Quran. Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community. Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of hadith and sirah, which are themselves vast and complex texts. Hence, analogously to the translating of Chinese literature, an attempt at an accurate translation of the Quran requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the target language, including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two cultures involved. =Science fiction= Science fiction being a genre with a recognizable set of conventions and literary genealogies, in which language often includes neologisms, neosemes, and invented languages, techno-scientific and pseudoscientific vocabulary, and fictional representation of the translation process, the translation of science-fiction texts involves specific concerns. The science-fiction translator tends to acquire specific competences and assume a distinctive publishing and cultural agency. As in the case of other mass-fiction genres, this professional specialization and role often is not recognized by publishers and scholars. Translation of science fiction accounts for the transnational nature of science fiction's repertoire of shared conventions and tropes. After World War II, many European countries were swept by a wave of translations from the English. Due to the prominence of English as a source language, the use of pseudonyms and pseudotranslations became common in countries such as Italy and Hungary, and English has often been used as a vehicular language to translate from languages such as Chinese and Japanese. More recently, the international market in science-fiction translations has seen an increasing presence of source languages other than English.  Technical translation  Technical translation renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited. Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use. Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.

Daredevil was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby. The character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964). Writer/artist Frank Miller's influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the Marvel Universe. Daredevil is commonly known by such epithets as the \\"Man Without Fear\\" and the \\"Devil of Hell's Kitchen\\". Daredevil's origins stem from a childhood accident that gave him special abilities. While growing up in the historically gritty or crime- ridden working class Irish-American neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City, Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an out-of-control truck after he pushes a man out of the path of the oncoming vehicle. While he can no longer see, his exposure to the radioactive material heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability, and gives him a \\"radar sense.\\" His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, is a single man raising his now blind son, who despite his rough upbringing, unconditionally loves his son and tries to teach him to form a better life for himself. Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to throw a fight, leaving Matt an orphan. In order to protect himself, Matt began training to hone his physical abilities and superhuman senses under the tutelage of a mysterious blind stranger named Stick, eventually becoming a highly skilled and expert martial artist. Some years later, after graduating from law school with high grades, Matt seeks out the criminal element in Hell's Kitchen and starts his crime- fighting activities. Matt targets the local gangsters who murdered his father and succeeds in bringing them to justice. Eventually, donning a costumed attire modeled after a devil, Matt took up a dual life of fighting against the criminal underworld in New York City as the masked vigilante Daredevil, which put him in conflict with many super-villains, including his arch-enemies Bullseye and the Kingpin. He also becomes a skilled and respected lawyer after graduating from Columbia Law School with his best friend and roommate, Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson, with whom he becomes law partners, forming the law firm Nelson & Murdock. Daredevil has since appeared in various forms of media, including several animated series, video games and merchandise. The character was first portrayed in live action by Rex Smith in the 1989 television movie The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, and then by Ben Affleck in the 2003 film Daredevil. Most recently Daredevil was portrayed by Charlie Cox in the Marvel Television productions Daredevil and The Defenders on Netflix. Publication history=1960s The character debuted in Marvel Comics' Daredevil #1 (cover date April 1964), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with character design input from Jack Kirby, who devised Daredevil's billy club. Writer and comics historian Mark Evanier has suggested without confirmation that Kirby also designed the basic image of Daredevil's initial costume, though Everett modified it. That original costume design was a combination of black, yellow, and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights. The first issue covered both the character's origins and his desire for justice on the man who had killed his father, boxer \\"Battling Jack\\" Murdock, who raised young Matthew Murdock in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. The radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human limits, and giving him a kind of ‚Äúradar‚Äù sense, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him. In order to support his son, Jack Murdock returns to boxing under the Fixer, a known gangster, and the only man willing to contract the aging boxer. When he refuses to throw a fight because his son is in the audience, he is killed by one of the Fixer's men. Having promised his father not to use violence to deal with his problems, Matt gets around that promise by adopting a new identity who can use physical force. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers as the superhero Daredevil, unintentionally causing the Fixer to have a fatal heart attack. Wally Wood introduced Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7,DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107 which depicts Daredevil's battle against the far more powerful Sub-Mariner, and has become one of the most iconic stories of the series. Daredevil would embark on a series of adventures involving such villains as the Owl, Stilt-Man, the Gladiator, and the Enforcers. In issue #16 (May 1966), he meets Spider-Man, a character who would grow to become one of Daredevil's closest friends. A letter from Spider-Man unintentionally exposed Daredevil's secret identity, compelling him to adopt a third identity as his twin brother Mike Murdock,DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 120: \\"Matt Murdock decided to introduce his legal partner and his secretary to his identical twin brother when they began to suspect he was Daredevil. Unfortunately, he didn't have one. So, Matt pretended to be his own twin, who was a glibber and more enthusiastic party boy. whose carefree, wisecracking personality much more closely resembled that of the Daredevil guise than the stern, studious, and emotionally-withdrawn Matt Murdock did. The \\"Mike Murdock\\" plotline was used to highlight the character's quasi-multiple personality disorder (he at one point wonders whether Matt or Mike/Daredevil \\"is the real me\\"), but it proved confusing to readers and was dropped in issues #41‚Äì42, with Daredevil faking Mike Murdock's death and claiming he had trained a replacement Daredevil. The series' 31-issue run by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciler Gene Colan (beginning with issue #20) includes Daredevil #47, in which Murdock defends a blind Vietnam veteran against a frameup; Lee has cited it as one of the favorite stories of his career. Matt discloses his secret identity to his girlfriend Karen Page in issue #57.DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 138 However, the revelation proves too much for her, and she is depicted as breaking off the relationship. This was the first of several long-term breakups between Matt and Karen, who would nevertheless prove the most enduring of his love interests. 1970s Gerry Conway took over as writer with issue #72, and turned the series in a pulp science fiction direction: a lengthy story arc centered on a robot from thousands of years in the future trying to change history. Even long-standing arch-villain the Owl was outfitted with futuristic weaponry and vehicles. Conway also moved Daredevil to San Francisco beginning with Daredevil #86, and simultaneously brought on the Black Widow as a co-star for the series.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: In May [1972], writer Gerry Conway transported Daredevil and his crime-fighting partner, the Black Widow, into a mansion in San Francisco. The Black Widow served as Daredevil's crime-fighting ally as well as his love interest from issue #81‚Äì124 (Nov. 1971‚ÄìAug. 1975), of which #93-108 were titled Daredevil and the Black Widow. Jann Wenner, the co-founder and publisher of the Rolling Stone music magazine appeared in Daredevil #100 (June 1973) by Gerber and Colan. The writing and editing jobs went to Marv Wolfman with issue #124, which wrote the Black Widow out of the series and returned Daredevil to Hell's Kitchen. Wolfman promptly introduced the lively but emotionally fragile Heather Glenn to replace the Black Widow as Daredevil's love interest. Wolfman's 20-issue run included the introduction of one of Daredevil's most popular villains, Bullseye,Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: In March [1976], writer Marv Wolfman and artist Bob Brown co-created one of the Man Without Fear's greatest nemeses, Bullseye. and a story arc in which the Jester uses computer-generated images to manipulate the mass media. With issue #144, Jim Shooter became the writer and introduced Paladin in issue #150 (Jan. 1978).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 184 Shooter had difficulty keeping up with the schedule, and the writing chores were shortly turned over to Roger McKenzie. McKenzie's work on Daredevil reflected his background in horror comics, and the stories and even the character himself took on a much darker tone: Daredevil battled a personification of death, one of his archenemies was bifurcated by a tombstone, and a re-envisioning of Daredevil's origin showed him using stalker tactics to drive the Fixer to his fatal heart attack. McKenzie created chain- smoking Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich, who deduces Daredevil's secret identity over the course of issues #153‚Äì163,Manning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 102: \\"The Daily Bugle gained one of its finest writers when Ben Urich was introduced, thanks to writer Roger McKenzie and penciler Gene Colan.\\" and had Daredevil using the criminal underworld of Hell's Kitchen as an information network, adding several small-time crooks to the supporting cast. Halfway through his run, McKenzie was joined by penciler Frank Miller with issue #158 (May 1979).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189: In this issue, the great longtime Daredevil artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciler who would become a star himself: Frank Miller. In a story arc overlapping Wolfman, Shooter, and McKenzie's runs on the series, Daredevil reveals his identity to Glenn and becomes partially responsible for the suicide of her father; their relationship would persist but would prove increasingly harmful to both of them. Though the Black Widow returned for a dozen issues (#155‚Äì166) and attempted to rekindle her romance with Daredevil, he ultimately rejects her in favor of Glenn. 1980s Miller disliked Roger McKenzie's scripts, so new editor Denny O'Neil fired McKenzie so that Miller could write the series. Cover of Daredevil #184 (July 1982). Art by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson. Miller continued the title in a similar vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Most prominently, dedicated and loving father Jack Murdock was reimagined as a drunkard who physically abused his son Matt, entirely revising Daredevil's reasons for becoming a lawyer. Spider-Man villain Kingpin was introduced as Daredevil's new primary nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into something of an antihero. In issue #181 (April 1982), he attempts to murder Bullseye by throwing him off a tall building; when the villain survives as a quadriplegic, he breaks into his hospital room and tries to scare him to death by playing a two-man variation on Russian roulette with a secretly unloaded gun. Following up a suggestion from O'Neill that he give Daredevil a realistic fighting style, Miller introduced ninjas into the Daredevil canon, bringing a martial- arts aspect to Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing previously-unseen characters who had played a major part in his youth: Stick, leader of the ninja clan the Chaste, who had been Murdock's sensei after he was blinded;DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 202: \\"Possibly modeled after Nantembo, a Zen master who reputedly disciplined his students by striking them with his nantin staff, Stick first appeared in this issue [#176] by Frank Miller.\\" a rival organization of assassins called the Hand;DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 202: The Hand was a league of ninja assassins who employed dark magic...Introduced in Daredevil #174 by writer/artist Frank Miller, this group of deadly warriors had been hired by the Kingpin of Crime to exterminate Matt Murdock.\\" and Elektra, an ex-girlfriend and sometime member of the Hand.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 201: \\"Matt Murdock's college sweetheart first appeared in this issue [#168] by writer/artist Frank Miller.\\" This was a drastic change for a character once called \\"the sightless swashbuckler.\\" Elektra was killed by Bullseye in issue #181 (April 1982).DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207: \\"Frank Miller did the unthinkable when he killed off the popular Elektra in Daredevil #181...[This issue] immediately sold out in comic book stores and sent fans and retailers to raid mass-market newsstands for all the remaining copies.\\" Artist John Romita Jr., signing a copy of issue 254 of the series at Midtown Comics in Manhattan After #191 Miller left the series. O'Neil switched from editor to writer. He continued McKenzie and Miller's noir take on the series, but backed away from the antihero depiction of the character by having him not only spare Bullseye's life but express guilt over his two previous attempts to kill him. Miller returned as the title's regular writer, co-writing #226 with O'Neil. Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli crafted the acclaimed \\"Daredevil: Born Again\\" storyline in #227‚Äì233.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: \\"'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in Daredevil from issue #227 to #233 (Feb. ‚Äì Aug. 1986).\\" In the Born Again storyline, Karen Page returns as a heroin-addicted porn star, and sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money. The Kingpin acquires the information and, in an act of revenge, orchestrates a frameup that costs Murdock his attorney's license. Miller ended the arc on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with both Karen Page and Maggie, the mother he thought dead, now a nun. Ann Nocenti later became the series's longest-running regular writer, with a four-and-a-quarter-year run from #238‚Äì291 (Jan. 1987 ‚Äì April 1991). The team returned Murdock to law by co-founding with Page a nonprofit drug and legal clinic, while Nocenti crafted stories confronting feminism, drug abuse, nuclear proliferation, and animal rights-inspired terrorism. She introduced the antagonist Typhoid Mary,DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 237: \\"Mary was first introduced in Daredevil #254 by [writer] Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr.\\" and in issues #262‚Äì265 used the Inferno event as a backdrop for the collapse of Daredevil's life: the clinic is destroyed, Page goes missing after learning that Matt has had an affair with Mary Walker, and Walker reveals herself as the alter ego of Typhoid Mary. Murdock subsequently becomes a drifter in upstate New York, an especially controversial move in Nocenti's run, as it marked the first time the character had been taken outside of an urban environment. She ended her run with a positive turn in Murdock's fortunes: he returns to Hell's Kitchen, regains his sense of self, reconciles with Foggy Nelson, and resolves to seek out Karen Page. 1990s New writer D. G. Chichester continued from where Nocenti left off, with Murdock resuming his friendship with Foggy Nelson, struggling to re-win the heart of Karen Page, appealing the revocation of his attorney's license, and bonding more deeply than ever with Hell's Kitchen. Chichester's focus on Daredevil's relationship with New York City went so far as to have two issues devoted entirely to Daredevil defending New Yorkers from ordinary criminals and even simple accidents. The critically acclaimed \\"Last Rites\\" arc from #297‚Äì300 saw Daredevil regaining his attorney's license and finally bringing the Kingpin to justice.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 258: \\"Culminating in the anniversary 300th issue, Daredevil would finally gain the upper hand against longtime foe Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin) in this moody tale by writer D. G. Chichester and penciller Lee Weeks.\\" Frank Miller returned to the character and his origins with the 1993 five-issue Daredevil: The Man Without Fear miniseries.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 264: \\"Comic legends Frank Miller and John Romita Jr. united to tell a new version of Daredevil's origin in this carefully crafted five-issue miniseries.\\" With artist John Romita Jr., Miller expanded his retcon of the life and death of Murdock's father, \\"Battling Jack\\" Murdock, and Murdock's first encounters with the Kingpin and Foggy Nelson. The role of Stick in the genesis of Daredevil was expanded, as was Murdock's doomed love affair with Elektra. The creative team of Chichester and penciler Scott McDaniel changed the status quo with their \\"Fall From Grace\\" storyline in issues #319‚Äì325 (Aug. 1993 ‚Äì Feb. 1994).Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 263 Elektra, who was resurrected in #190 but had not been seen since, finally returned. An injured Daredevil creates a more protective costume from biomimetic materials: red and gray with white armor on the shoulders and knee pads. Revamped billy clubs could attach to form nunchucks or a bo staff. His secret identity becomes public knowledge, leading to him fake his own death and assuming the new identity of \\"Jack Batlin\\". This new identity and costume last for several story arcs, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a double). A short stint by J. M. DeMatteis returned Daredevil to his traditional red costume and Matt Murdock's identity. Under writers Karl Kesel and later Joe Kelly, the title gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and Foggy (who now know of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe. In 1998, Daredevils numbering was rebooted, with the title \\"canceled\\" with issue #380 and revived a month later as part of the Marvel Knights imprint. Joe Quesada drew the new series, written by filmmaker Kevin Smith.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 290: \\"It was a dream come true for many comic fans. Kevin Smith, the writer/director of such cult films as Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy...had been hired by Marvel to write Daredevil, a character whose title many thought could use a major facelift.\\" Its first story arc, \\"Guardian Devil\\", depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the Messiah or the Anti-Christ. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has AIDS (later revealed to be a hoax) and her subsequent death at Bullseye's hands. When he discovers that the true party responsible for the scheme is Mysterio, who is currently dying of cancer, he leaves Mysterio to commit suicide, deciding to use the money Karen left him in her will to re-open Nelson & Murdock. Smith was succeeded by writer-artist David Mack, who contributed the seven-issue \\"Parts of a Hole\\" (vol. 2, #9‚Äì15). The arc introduced Maya Lopez, also known as Echo, a deaf martial artist. 2000s David Mack brought colleague Brian Michael Bendis to Marvel to co-write the following arc, \\"Wake Up\\" in vol. 2, #16‚Äì19 (May 2001 ‚Äì August 2001),Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 305: \\"Writer Brian Michael Bendis began his impressive run on the Daredevil title with a small character-driven four-part story, teaming with his old friend David Mack.\\" which follows reporter Ben Urich as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and the new Leap-Frog. The 2001 Daredevil: Yellow miniseries presented another take on Daredevil's origins using letters written to Karen Page after her death. The series depicts the early rivalry between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson for Page's affection, and incorporates many events depicted in the earliest issues of Daredevil. The supervillains the Owl and the Purple Man appear as antagonists. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase \\"The Man Without Fear\\", and she suggests to Daredevil he wears all maroon instead of dark red and yellow. Issue #26 (December 2001) brought back Brian Michael Bendis. Developments in this run included the introduction of romantic interest and future wife Milla Donovan, the outing once again of Murdock's secret identity, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI. The impact of his exposure as Daredevil continued to be used as a plot point by both Bendis and writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark, who became the new creative team with Daredevil vol. 2, #82 (Feb. 2006).Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 331: \\"Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark had quite a challenge ahead of them when they took over the reins of Daredevil from the popular team of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev.\\" Brubaker's first story arc had a new character masquerading as Daredevil in Hell's Kitchen. Murdock later discovered the ersatz Daredevil is his friend Danny Rand, the superhero Iron Fist. The series returned to its original numbering with issue #500 (Oct. 2009), which followed vol. 2, #119 (Aug. 2009). New writer Andy Diggle revised the status quo, with Daredevil assuming leadership of the ninja army the Hand. Daredevil later appeared in the one-shot Dark Reign: The List ‚Äì Daredevil. 2010s Following this came the crossover story arc \\"Shadowland\\", in which it is revealed that Daredevil's recent actions after taking control of the Hand are the result of him being possessed by a demon. Purged of the demon by his allies, Murdock departs New York, leaving his territory in the hands of the Black Panther in the briefly retitled series' Black Panther: Man Without Fear #513. Murdock finds himself renewed in the miniseries Daredevil: Reborn #1‚Äì4 (March‚ÄìJuly 2011), where he confronts a drug dealer with the power to make his opponents live their darkest fears, Murdock reaffirming his role as the man without fear as he confronts his enemy's taunts and resolves to return to New York. In July 2011, Daredevil relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2011), with writer Mark Waid. Waid focused on emphasizing the character's powers and perception of the physical world. In the premiere issue, Murdock finds he can no longer serve as a trial lawyer due to past allegations of his being Daredevil causing a case he represents in court to turn into a media circus. Two issues later, Nelson and Murdock have developed a new business strategy of serving as consulting counselors, by teaching clients how to represent themselves in court. Daredevil joins the New Avengers in a story written by former Daredevil series writer Brian Michael Bendis. Daredevil appeared as a regular character in the 2010‚Äì2013 New Avengers series in issues #16‚Äì34 (November 2011 ‚Äì January 2013). At one point, Foggy begins to question Matt's sanity, ultimately leading to a fallout between the two. They reconcile once the truth is discovered. Daredevil vol. 3 ended at issue #36 in February 2014, in which Matt is forced to publicly reveal his Daredevil identity, resulting in his being disbarred by New York and prompting him to again relocate to San Francisco. Waid and Chris Samnee followed this up with Infinite Comics' Daredevil: Road Warrior weekly digital miniseries, which focused on an adventure during Matt's trip to San Francisco. It was reprinted as issue 0.1 in Daredevil volume 4, which launched under Waid and Samnee with a new issue #1 (March 2014) as part of the All-New Marvel NOW! storyline centered on Matt's new life in San Francisco. Daredevil volume 4 ended with issue #18 in September 2015. A new volume began as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, written by Charles Soule with art by Ron Garney with the first two issues released in December 2015. In this series, Matt returns to New York, where he now works as an Assistant District Attorney. He will have a redesigned costume and a new apprentice in Samuel Chung, an undocumented immigrant who has been living in New York's Chinatown since he was a child, who has taken up the codename Blindspot. Flashbacks in a later story arc reveal how Matt regained his secret identity; when the Purple Children acquired a machine designed by their father to enhance his powers after Matt had saved them from a mob, they used the machine to erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil, Matt only allowing Foggy to know his secret identity afterward,Daredevil Vol. 5 #20 enabling him to be re- instated as a New York Attorney. Using his restored secret identity, Murdock is able to take advantage of a subsequent court case to establish a precedent for superheroes testifying in court without the need to expose their secret identities.Daredevil (vol.5) #21-22 Despite interference from the Kingpin, Murdock succeeds in taking this precedent to the Supreme Court so that all superheroes will have the same rights in future cases, and afterward returns to his traditional red costume.Daredevil (vol.5) #25 Following the release of Issue 28, much like with other Marvel series as part of the Marvel Legacy event, the Daredevil series official numbering was rebooted back to the original numbering which started with Issue 595 which was released on November 8, 2017, where Daredevil's longtime nemesis the Kingpin became the Mayor of New York City and begins a campaign to make costumed vigilantes officially criminals. Although Murdock's attempt to set up a sting operation results in his allies being arrested when the Kingpin turns this trap against him, Fisk's legal manipulations work against him when he is attacked by the Hand, leaving Fisk in a coma and Murdock legally mayor of New York from his position as deputy mayor due to a loophole added by a prior administration that had not been amended,Daredevil #600 allowing Matt to take control of the city and release his fellow heroes to help him stop the Hand.Daredevil #601 Charles Soule released his final Daredevil storyline \\"Death of Daredevil\\" during the October and November 2018 releases, in a 4-part bimonthly release which ended the series.DEATH OF DAREDEVIL Starts This October -Newsarama Afterwards the series went on hiatus for two months and resumed distribution in February 2019, with a brand-new volume with the first two issues released during that month which were written by Chip Zdarsky. Powers and abilities Frank Miller, seen here signing a copy of issue 181 at Midtown Comics, revamped the character's radar sense to make it more believable. Although the character is blind, his remaining four senses function with superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person. Few characters know that the hero cannot see. Daredevil developed a radar sense, which is similar to echolocation. Writer/co-creator Stan Lee said that he was worried that blind people would be offended at how far he exaggerated the way a blind person's remaining senses are enhanced, but that his fears were assuaged by letters from organizations such as The Lighthouse for the Blind which said that blind people greatly enjoyed having Daredevil comics read to them. The Beyonder once restored Daredevil's eyesight, but, suspecting a trick on Beyonder's part, Daredevil immediately insisted that his blindness be restored. Beyonder agreed.Daredevil #223 (October 1985) When Frank Miller expanded most of Daredevil's abilities, he attempted to make them \\"extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman\\", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, the first thing he did to the character was \\"revamp\\" his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the \\"proximity\\" sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a page though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker. Just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, they are also sensitive; his main weakness is his vulnerability to powerful sounds or odors that can temporarily weaken his radar sense. This weakness is often used to immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a hallucinogenic drug designed so that Daredevil could not tell he was drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears. People with superhuman speed, such as Spider- Man, are too fast to be detected and targeted by his radar sense. While his radar sense mostly compensates for his blindness, it has certain limitations. He cannot perceive color without touch, and he can only read printed matter if the ink is raised enough for his sense of touch. Most photographs, televisions, and computer screens are blank to him. However, the radar sense has shown on numerous occasions the ability to ‚Äúsee‚Äù through walls and fabrics. The radar sense also grants him an omnidirectional field of vision. These two latter abilities are the most notable advantages the radar has over normal vision. Though he has no superhuman physical attributes beyond an enhanced sense of balance, Daredevil is a master of martial arts. Having been trained by Stick, Daredevil is a master hand-to-hand combatant. His typical moves are unique blends of the martial arts of Ninjutsu, Aiki J≈´jutsu,Daredevil: Road Warrior #3 Aikido, Judo, Karate,Daredevil (vol. 1) #287 (December 1990) Jujitsu, Kung Fu, Silat, Capoeira, Wrestling, and Stick Fighting combined with American-style Boxing while making full use of his gymnastic capabilities. Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially designed baton, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a multi-purpose weapon and tool that contains 30 feet of aircraft-control cable connected to a case-hardened steel grappling hook. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook. In his civilian identity, Murdock is a skilled and respected New York attorney. He is a skilled detective, tracker, and interrogation expert, as well as being an expert marksman. After his identity was publicly exposed and he was forced to relocate to San Francisco, Matt Murdock's secret identity as Daredevil was restored by the Purple Children, the children of his old foe the Purple Man. From the description given by the Purple Children, their influence renders it impossible for anyone to determine Daredevil's secret identity through deductive research unless he actually tells them who he is under the mask,Daredevil vol.5 #20Defenders vol. 5 #8 or someone unmasks him.Daredevil vol.5 #27 Other versions=1602 In Neil Gaiman's Marvel 1602, set in Earth-311, Matthew Murdoch (known as The Bard) is introduced as a blind balladeer. Secretly he is an adventurer for hire, who charges excessive prices to anyone who has the money, for any job. Matthew, as a child, was a fearless boy who would explore anywhere. One day he discovered a dark cave that glowed inside from a green substance. As a boy Matthew thought nothing of tasting it, and so he did to know what it was. He soon walked back the way he came. His mother later found him with a fever and discovered that her son is completely blind. Though he lost his sight, the rest of Matthew's senses became enhanced with superhuman sharpness. Matthew traveled as a blind beggar and poet, singing songs of heroes, and appearing weak and helpless. His true nature would be revealed when he was either on a job for a client or attacked. The Queen of England's head spymaster, Nicholas Fury, had hired him to hunt down and protect Donal, the Templar keeper of Thor‚Äôs staff. On the way to meet Donal he encountered a woman named Natasha (aka the Black Widow), whom he referred to as the most dangerous woman in Europe. His analysis of Natasha proved to be very accurate when she betrayed him by smashing a bottle over his head and pushing Matthew off a bridge into a canyon below. Murdoch survived, and appeared again in a dark cave just in time to save Donal from being attacked by Natasha's men. Matthew attempts to rescue Donal from her by taking him as far away as he could. But Natasha had the cave entrance surrounded with a garrison of men, sent by Count Otto von Doom of Latveria to capture the old man's treasure, Donal, and Matthew Murdoch. Doom imprisons them in one of his castle's cells and works to uncover the secrets of the golden bauble that Donal gave to him to distract him from the true treasure: the staff. Donal is also in contact with Doctor Strange, the former Queen's court magician and physician, who informs them that a group of heroes are on their way to the castle. When the imprisoned Captain of the Fantastic Four rails against his stone prison, it shakes the castle from its foundations and frees Murdoch and Donal. Murdoch uses his abilities to carry the old man and leap from wall to wall to the courtyard many feet below. When Doom's men corner them, after Donal demands to find his staff, the old man uses it to transform himself into the Thunder God, Thor. Thor uses his immortal powers to stop Doom's men and assist Carlos Javier‚Äôs witchbreed in their attack on Doom's castle, finally allowing Doom to use Thor's electricity to explode the golden sphere that Donal had given him, scarring Doom and bringing him to the brink of death. While Donal-as Thor-joins the group aboard their ship, headed to the New World to fix the tear in their universe, Murdoch uses his own means to leave Latveria. Murdoch later appears to King James, in the dark, threatening to cut his throat if he ever attacked the late Queen's spymaster, Fury. He then disappears through the window, promising to return again if James is untrue to his word, and with a final warning not to touch his home land of Ireland. 2099 * Marvel Knights Daredevil 2099 is Samuel Fisk, a grandson of Wilson Fisk, who feels some remorse over his grandfather's actions, and carries on the legacy of Daredevil, as well as the Kingpin legacy he inherited. * The one-shot 2099 A.D. Genesis (Jan. 1996) introduced a Marvel 2099 version of Daredevil, opposing the corporate criminals of Alchemax in a futuristic New York. His real identity is Eric Nelson, grandson of Matt Murdock's longtime associate Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson. Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline (Earth-295), Keeper Murdock serves Mikhail Rasputin, one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen. Exposure to toxic waste during his time in one of Apocalypse's labor camps for humans caused Murdock's blindness and powers, though he believed his powers were granted by an implant given to him by Rasputin. When he accidentally touched the incapacitated Empath, he realized the error of his ways, he then put Empath out of his misery by beating him to death with his Billy Club. Renouncing Mikhail, Murdock ripped off his visor and realized that his enhanced senses were not the result of his cybernetic augmentation. Murdock broke down upon realizing how many years Mikhail had been manipulating him. Ten years later, Murdock is seen working for Weapon Omega, Apocalypse's replacement. He serves as the keeper of New Apocalypse city, using his sense to monitor humans who try to enter the city. He's seen hunting for Harper Simmons and fights with Prophet hand to hand but was defeated with a poison gas that allowed Prophet escape with the X-Terminators. Amalgam In the Amalgam Comics universe, Slade Murdock is a blind mercenary in New Gotham City acting under the name of \\"Dare the Terminator\\", because of the dares she takes, and that few dare to challenge her. Dare is a female combination of Daredevil and DC Comics' Deathstroke the Terminator.Assassins #1 (April 1996) Another Daredevil amalgam is mentioned, called Deaddevil, the Man Without Life and is apparently Daredevil merged with Deadman.The Exciting X-Patrol (June 1997) House of M In the House of M crossover, Matt Murdock/Daredevil is romantically involved with She-Hulk. The origins and the extent of his powers are never explained, but is very much similar to his mainstream counterpart. It is also unknown if he gained the fighting skills from his radioactive senses, or if they were gained when Layla Miller \\"awakened\\" him. Earth X In the Earth X series, there are at least three different alternative \\"Daredevils\\". First, in an interesting visual pun, Kurt Wagner eventually goes back in time to become the red-skinned demon Belasco. But ultimately, when he becomes a hero again, he goes to Hell's Kitchen (the original Daredevil's old stomping grounds), to become the neighborhood protector. Secondly, in the afterlife, Matthew Murdock is shown as part of the Avenging Host. Thirdly (and most prominently) an invulnerable stunt man, thought by the Thing to be Deadpool, goes by the name of Daredevil, as well as donning a costume that looks somewhere between that of Daredevil and Evel Knievel. This version craves his own death. Ben Grimm repeatedly tries to guess at Daredevil's identity, guessing Deadpool at first and then a string of other obscure Marvel characters, but Daredevil denies being any one of them. Eventually Machine Man confronts Daredevil and reveals that he was never any previously known Marvel character - he is an original character from the Earth X universe. End of Days Daredevil: End of Days is a 2013 eight-issue comic book miniseries that chronicled Daredevil's final days. During his final battle with Bullseye, Daredevil whispers the single word ‚ÄúMapone‚Äù to Bullseye before being killed by a blow to the head by his own billy-club. Several years before his death, Daredevil had confronted the Kingpin when he returned to Hell's Kitchen. Fisk had made a deal with the government and Daredevil, seeing no other options to stop Fisk, killed him in front of many people on the streets.Daredevil: End of Days #1 After killing Fisk, Daredevil disappeared many years until his final battle with Bullseye, having either alienated from or shunned by his friends and fellow superheroes. Matt had been training Tim Urich, the adopted son of longtime friend Ben Urich, to become the new Daredevil.Daredevil: End of Days #4 After finishing Tim's training and becoming aware of Bullseye's return to Hell's Kitchen, Daredevil returned to prevent any more of his past enemies to affect his successor. His actions during his final battle drove Bullseye mad with curiosity over the word ‚ÄúMapone‚Äù, leading him to commit suicide.Daredevil: End of Days #8 It is revealed that Matt had fathered a daughter named Mapone Romanova with the Black Widow. After Natasha's death, Matt and Mapone seemingly became estranged.Daredevil: End of Days #2 Matt was also allegedly the father of four other children with several of his past lovers: Elektra Natchios has a son also named Matthew, Milla Donovan has a son named Franklin, and Mary Walker is the mother of two twin boys.Daredevil: End of Days #3 Exiles The Daredevil from Earth-181 is an assassin working for his reality's Kingpin.Exiles #12 =Earth-13584= On Earth-13584, Daredevil appears as a member of Spider-Man's gang.Dark Avengers #187.

Marvel Mangaverse The Marvel Mangaverse features a version of Daredevil called the Devil Hunter. His costume is patterned after an oni, or Japanese demon. Marvel Zombies universe Daredevil appears in the limited series Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness. While still un- zombified, he is seen fighting the villain Thunderball. Ash, misunderstanding, unexpectedly helps Thunderball win the fight. Daredevil also appears in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days. He shows up on the scene in order to save a terrified Nova from the zombified Spider-Man, saying that they have to kill Spider-Man immediately. Ironically, he becomes a zombie when Spider-Man bites him on the back because Nova is too scared to assist him. In the limited Marvel Zombies series, Daredevil is among those who chase and eventually eat Magneto, but not before Magneto hurls an I-beam completely through his torso. It is assumed that he is eventually destroyed after several zombies gain the Power Cosmic and incinerate all the other zombies. MC2 In the alternative timeline published under the MC2 imprint, Daredevil is murdered by the Kingpin while saving the life of Kaine. Kaine attempts to revive Daredevil by sorcery, but inadvertently bonds both Daredevil's soul and the demon Zarathos to Reilly Tyne, who becomes the superhero Darkdevil. Mutant X The alternative universe version of Daredevil in the Mutant X series wears a similar costume to the character of the same name published by Lev Gleason Publications during the 1940s as an homage. Old Man Logan In the storyline Old Man Logan in an alternative future, fifty years after the superheroes lost a great battle, two young men dressed as Daredevil and the Punisher are found chained together on a pole by a new Kingpin, who has killed Magneto in the past, after an attempted mission to free the town from him.

Marvel Comics. In the prequel story Old Man Hawkeye, Matt is revealed to be one of the few heroes left alive having somehow survived Enchantress' attack. After the villains conquered most of the planet, Matt escaped to the Himalayas and formed his own dojo while taking on his master's alias, \\"Stick.\\" When Clint Barton loses his vision, he seeks out Stick's help to learn how to cope with his blindness so he continue the fight against Red Skull, Matt agrees to help him.Old Man Hawkeye #12. Marvel Comics. Noir In the Marvel Noir imprint, Matt Murdock was blinded by his father's assassin who brutally slammed his head into a brick wall, leaving him blind. Though he did wish to become a lawyer, his impoverished lifestyle denied it, leaving him to be a performer instead, under the name Daredevil. Later he took to the streets as a vigilante, killing criminals to avenge those they killed. Runaways In a Runaways alternative future, Daredevil is a member of Heroine's team of Avengers. Ruins In the two issue Warren Ellis limited series Ruins, a newspaper headline reveals that Matthew Murdock was fatally injured when an atom truck crashed spilling a radioactive substance in his face. Thus he never became Daredevil. Spider-Ham The funny animal comic book Spider-Ham from the Marvel children's-comics imprint Star Comics included versions of Daredevil named \\"Deerdevil\\" and \\"Deviled Ham\\". Spider-Gwen Matt Murdock serves as the main antagonist for most of Spider-Gwen. His ninja training, law background, and powers are the same as his mainstream counterpart. However, he eventually becomes this world's version of the Kingpin and constantly antagonizes Gwen Stacy, who is the Spider-Woman of this dimension.Spider-Gwen #2 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios) The story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the original comics is that they were four newborn pet turtles owned by a young boy who were splashed by a mutagenic compound and dropped in the sewers when their owner was involved in an accident involving a truck carrying said compound. The circumstances of their creation was intentionally designed to resemble Daredevil's origin, with the scenes even being drawn similarly. The creators of the comic later confirmed that the boy was intended to be a young Matt Murdock, explaining Daredevil's own abilities as the result of exposure to the mutagen. Ultimate Marvel : See also: Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra for information on the two starring miniseries. The Ultimate Marvel version of Daredevil (Matt Murdock) has appeared in two different limited series, Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra written by Greg Rucka, and Ultimate Elektra, a team to take down the Kingpin. It is revealed in Ultimate Spider- Man #109 that his father Jack was a boxer killed by the Kingpin (a.k.a. Wilson Fisk) when Jack wouldn't throw a match. Later, after the Kingpin burns down Murdock's law offices, a crazed Daredevil breaks into Fisk's apartments and threatens to murder the comatose Vanessa Fisk, but is convinced not to by Spider-Man. During Magneto's flooding of New York during Ultimatum, in which millions of people are killed, Daredevil's corpse is found by Spider-Man and the Hulk.Ultimate Spider-Man #131 (Apr. 2009) A new exclusive iteration of Daredevil (Ray Connor) appears in Ultimate Comics: Avengers. He is discovered and trained by Stick after experiencing an accident similar to the one that gave his predecessor powers. On a somewhat related note, Conner is a fan of Spider-Man. Sometime after being publicly known as the new Daredevil, he and Stick are attacked by Vampire X's vampires.Ultimate Comics Avengers 3 #1 (Sept. 2010) Daredevil turns into a vampire and bites Captain America.Ultimate Comics Avengers 3 #2 (Nov. 2010) Just when Daredevil was about to kill Blade, Captain America teleports the Triskelion to the desert of Iran, leaving Ray's fate unknown.Ultimate Comics Avengers 3 #6 (March 2011) What If In What If Everyone Knew Daredevil Was Blind?, Electro realized Daredevil's secret when he assisted Spider-Man in a fight, Electro noticing that Daredevil was not bothered when he triggered a particularly intense flash of light. Although Matt tried to continue as normal, when the Owl attacked Daredevil with weapons designed specifically to exploit Matt's heightened senses, Matt decides to undergo a risky operation to restore his sight. When exposure to another dose of radioactive waste deprived Matt of his enhanced senses while leaving him with his sight, after defeating the Owl's attempt to stage a mock trial, Matt decided to retire from his costumed career and run for district attorney. In What If Karen Page had Lived?, when Karen survives Bullseye's attempt to kill her as part of Mysterio's last scheme, the fear of losing her drove Matt to beat the Kingpin to death for his role in the scheme. Despite his friends' defense, Matt was sentenced to 44 years in prison for Fisk's murder, but was left alone in prison due to the other prisoners' fear, and was often consulted by Nick Fury on legal matters. He was eventually released after 15 years for good behavior. Reception Daredevil was named Empire's 37th Greatest Comic Book Character, citing him as \\"a compelling, layered and visually striking character\\". Wizard magazine ranked Daredevil 21st among their list of the 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time, and comic book readers polled through the website Comic Book Resources voted the character the third best of the Marvel Comics stable. IGN in 2011 ranked Daredevil as #10 on their list of \\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\\". Supporting characters Throughout the core Daredevil series, many characters have had an influence in Matt Murdock's life. His father, \\"Battlin' Jack\\" Murdock instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. He always encouraged Matt to study, rather than fight like him. Jack forbade his son from undertaking any kind of physical training. It is his father's murder that prompts the super-powered character to become a superhero, fighting gangsters. He was trained by an old blind ninja master named Stick following his childhood accident. Matt Murdock's closest friend is Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson, his college roommate, sidekick, and law partner. Their relationship in the early years of the series was fraught with tension due to Nelson's sense of inferiority to Murdock as a lawyer and as a target for the affections of their secretary, Karen Page. They frequently argued over Murdock's preference for defending supervillains, as Nelson's enthusiasm is for corporate law. The pudgy and fallible Nelson has often been used by writers for lightheartedness and even comic relief. As a superhero, one of Daredevil's best friends is the hero Spider-Man; with his enhanced senses, Murdock was able to physically identify Spider-Man on their first meeting, and Spider-Man in turn learned his secret identity some time after. Due to the events of the \\"One More Day\\" storyline, and later the Purple story arc,Daredevil (vol. 5) 17-20 neither of them knows the other's secret identity any longer. Iron Fist would later become one of his greatest friends, and at one point took on the role of Daredevil himself. Jessica Jones, a former superhero turned private investigator acts as a bodyguard for Matt Murdock in his civilian life. Her husband, Luke Cage, is a friend of Daredevil as well. Maya Lopez, a deaf woman and skilled martial artist, is a friend of Daredevil after he fought her and convinced her that he did not murder her father because she was being manipulated by the Kingpin, who was responsible. Ben Urich, a reporter for the Daily Bugle discovered Daredevil's identity and eventually becomes his friend as well, though during his identity dispute Daredevil decided to end his \\"secret professional relationship\\" with Urich to avoid getting Urich mixed up in his problems and being used against him. The Punisher, anti-hero Frank Castle, is one of Daredevil's reluctant allies, as well as his antagonist due to their different philosophies in crime-fighting. Daredevil has a convoluted and often tortured love life. One of Daredevil's more notable love interests is Elektra, an assassin who would later be killed. In the 2000s, Murdock marries a woman named Milla Donovan, although one of Daredevil's enemies drives her to insanity. Enemies In his early years, Daredevil fought a number of costumed supervillains, the first of these being Electro, a prominent Spider-Man foe, in Daredevil #2. A number of recurring villains would be introduced over the years, such as the Owl, the Purple Man, Mr. Fear, Stilt-Man, Gladiator, the Jester, the Man-Bull, and Death-Stalker. The supervillain duo of the Cobra and Mr. Hyde have frequently clashed with Daredevil, and Hyde has fought Daredevil alone on several occasions. The psychotic assassin Bullseye was introduced by Marv Wolfman in issue #131, and was a frequent antagonist over the next six years of the series. Beginning with Frank Miller's run on Daredevil, his traditional rogues' gallery was used less often, and The Kingpin became Daredevil's arch-enemy. Like the Purple Man, Death-Stalker, Assassin, and several others, the Kingpin has long known Daredevil's secret identity. His run as the series's central villain ended with issue #300, but he continues to menace Daredevil on occasion. Elektra made her debut as a bounty hunter, and though her time as part of Daredevil's rogues' gallery was brief (spanning barely a year of the series), her romantic past with him is an important part of the mythos. In Daredevil #254, Ann Nocenti introduced Typhoid Mary, an assassin for the Kingpin with dissociative identity disorder (the diagnostic term for multiple personalities), who would become a prominent Daredevil foe. In other media=Television Live action = * In 1975, Angela Bowie secured the TV rights to Daredevil and the Black Widow for a duration of one year and planned a TV series based on the two characters. Bowie had photographer Terry O'Neill take a series of pictures of herself as Black Widow and actor Ben Carruthers as Daredevil (with wardrobe by Natasha Kornilkoff) to shop the project around to producers, but the project never came to fruition. * In 1983, ABC planned a live-action Daredevil pilot. Academy Award-winning writer Stirling Silliphant completed the draft of the program, but it was not aired. * Daredevil, portrayed by Rex Smith, appears in NBC's 1989 live-action television film The Trial of the Incredible Hulk. When David Banner (Bill Bixby) gets arrested, Matt Murdock helps to prove Banner's innocence. Daredevil tells his origins to Banner, which in this version involves Murdock being inspired by a police officer to become a hero. Later, with the help of Hulk, he battles the Kingpin (John Rhys-Davies), called only Wilson Fisk here. While remaining fairly true to the source material of the Daredevil comic books, the largest change was that Daredevil's traditional costume, including his horns, was replaced with a black ninja-like outfit. Daredevil would later wear a similar black outfit in Frank Miller and John Romita Jr's 1993's Daredevil: The Man Without Fear miniseries, as well as the Marvel Television series. * On November 6, 2013, Disney and Marvel announced that a new Daredevil television series based on the character would be released on Netflix. In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Drew Goddard would be the executive producer and showrunner for the series, and would write and direct the first episode. By May 24, 2014, Goddard had departed as showrunner, being replaced by Steven S. DeKnight. Goddard was to remain with the show as a consultant. On May 27, Charlie Cox was cast to star. Filming began in July 2014. The first season was released in April 2015, the second season was released on March 18, 2016, and the third season was released on October 19, 2018. Cox also reprises the role in The Defenders, a crossover miniseries. =Animation= * Matt Murdock appears in the Spider- Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"Attack of the Arachnoid\\", voiced by Frank Welker.

It is likely that, as with other poison frog alkaloids, histrionicotoxins are not manufactured by the amphibians, but absorbed from insects in their diet and stored in glands in their skin. They are notably less toxic than other alkaloids found in poison frogs, yet their distinct structure acts as a neurotoxin by non-competitive inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. History The first record of histrionicotoxins dates to 1823 by Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane. Cochrane was exploring the tropical rainforests around Colombia and Panama. His reports mention tribes of Indians who used poison tipped arrows and blowgun darts for hunting and war. Upon further exploration, Cochrane found that these Indians extracted the poison from the skins of the poison dart frog, then known as Dendrobates histrionicus. An account from his diary reads: > \\"[...] called rana de veneno by the Spanish, about three inches long, yellow > on the back, with very large black eyes... those who use poison catch the > frogs in the woods and confine them in a hollow cane where they regularly > feed them until they want the poison, when they take the unfortunate reptile > and pass a pointed piece of wood down his throat and out of one of his legs. > This torture makes the poor frog perspire very much, especially on the back, > which becomes covered in a white froth; this is the most powerful poison > that he yields, and in this they dip or roll the tips of their arrows, which > will preserve their destructive power for a year. Afterwards, below this > white substance, appears a yellow oil, which is carefully scraped off, and > retains its deadly influence for four to six months, according to the > goodness (as they say) of the frog. By this means, from one frog sufficient > poison is obtained for about fifty arrows.\\" Chemical properties Histrionicotoxins are a class rather than a specific poison and this broad spectrum poses synthetic challenges. Structures of histrionicotoxins were characterized in 1971. Since then, several synthetic studies and total syntheses have been carried out. Table 1 describes some of the many variations in histrionicotoxin alkaloids from the parent molecule (283A). A table describing a few variants of the arrow poison, histrionicotoxin. Synthesis Since characterization, the development of synthetic pathways to histrionicotoxin has been of interest to research groups due to its unusual functionality. The Kishi group proposed the first total synthesis of the parent 283A in 1985 using 89, a previously synthesized lactam used for the synthesis of other variants. Treatment with acetic anhydride yielded 133 in quantitative yield. The cyclic enol ether 134 was formed through oxidative cleavage promoting intramolecular addition followed by a basic deprotection and dehydration. Bromination followed by dehydrobromination in methanol was then found to give an epimeric mixture of unsaturated 135. Hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation yielded 136. Formation of a thiolactam followed by condensation with ethyl bromoacetate gave 137. Selective deprotection of the allylic alcohol followed by oxidation gave 138. A Wittig reaction then generated a chloroalkene, which, upon base-promoted elimination of HCl, gave a terminal alkyne, which was subsequently protected to form 139. The olefinic function of 139 was first reduced using cyanoborohydride before further reduction of 140 to an epimeric mixture of alcohols. A retro-Michael addition was then performed under basic conditions at low temperature, successfully epimerising this compound to give the desired epimer 141. A reaction with triphenylphosphine then generated the phosphonium salt 142, and a Wittig reaction could then be performed to attach the silyl-protected cis- ene-yne function, which was then deprotected to yield the target (¬±)-HTX 283A. 25 Step Synthesis of HTX presented by the Kishi group in 1985. Mechanism of action HTX acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are implicated in neural signaling. As a non-competitive antagonist, HTX binds to a subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.3 This actually increases the affinity for the agonist acetylcholine and stabilizes the desensitized receptor. This blocks action potentials and slows neural function. Histrionicotoxin has been shown to bind competitively with many local anesthetics, such as tetracaine, as well as other aromatic amine non-competitive antagonists of the receptors, indicating the compounds likely share a binding site; this site of interaction is located outside the transmembrane domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, though the exact interaction remains uncharacterized. While histrionicotoxin does share a binding location with other non-competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, it has been proven to have relatively higher affinity for desensitized receptors than phencyclidine, indicating further yet uncharacterized subtlety in the nature of its binding. Additionally, studies of the effects of histrionicotoxin on end-plate potential have shown that the compound hinders membrane potential propagation, but has emergent characteristics with membrane hyperpolarizations. The binding of histrionicotoxin is rapidly reversible, and so it can be readily removed from affected regions with repeated washing, or, in vivo, with natural bodily diffusion. High concentrations of HTX have been demonstrated to have antagonistic effects on batrachotoxin. Toxicity Histrionicotoxin is relatively not as toxic as other alkaloids from poison dart frogs. Preliminary tests showed that mice could survive a 5 mg/kg dose of histrionicotoxin 283a and recover within 3 hours with no lasting effects.

Synopsis The film is composed of stock footage from the original Ultraman television series with additional newly filmed content, and it served as an \\"epilogue\\" as Ultraman returns to Earth for one final battle. The plot unfolds when Ultraman was defeated by Zetton but not killed. Zetton is destroyed by the Patrol. Zoffy rescues Ultraman and then recombines forces with Hayata. Ultraman and Hayata, as a result of the loss, suffer from the lack of confidence since Ultraman needs the help of others to overcome various combatants. The Patrol realizes they cannot count on Ultraman at this time and Hayata feels weaker. Arashi suggests that Hayata use a stamina drink. Ide gets an idea and heads to his lab to build a new device. Hayata's Ultra-Senses divine the approach of a second Zetton attack fleet but before he can warn the Captain, Ide warns them of the fleet as he, too, somehow knows that it is coming. The Patrol attacks the new fleet to minimal effect and another Zetton is defeated at their headquarters, but this triggers the revival of a previously defeated monster, along with Pigmon. Pigmon warns them what is coming and now Ide can understand Pigmon perfectly, somehow. Pigmon is again mortally wounded and this angers Hayata, who triggers the Beta Capsule and becomes Ultraman. Ultraman wins, but now there is a simultaneous attack by several revived monsters. Ultraman then reveals a new power called Ultra Separation. He absorbs extra energies and creates replicas of himself, who scatter to defeat the monsters. After this, he reverts to Hayata. Hayata is then alerted that Zetton II is attacking headquarters and transforms again. The fight goes bad for Ultraman due to his weakened condition and he hesitates to fire his Specium Ray. Ide reveals the new device that he has built, which Arashi shoots into Ultraman's Color Timer. The device is a solar energy booster, which fully recharges Ultraman. Ultraman then demolishes Zetton II with his Rainbow Spectrum Colored Specium Ray and completes his mission for good.

Upon completion in 2024, the two tall towers with 86 and 85 floors will be the tallest buildings in the European Union.Hermitage Plaza Complex ‚Äì The Skyscraper Center. Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Retrieved 20 February 2016  Concept  Hermitage Plaza is a mixed-use project at the entrance of Europe's biggest central business district -- La D√©fense in Paris -- and is situated across the Seine River from the residential district of Neuilly-Paris. It will bring together programs of luxury serviced apartments, a 5-Star palace hotel, class-A offices, high-end retail, and the public and entertainment space. Placed along Paris' historical axis, linking the Louvre Palace, and its crystal pyramid, to the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche of La D√©fense, Hermitage Plaza would have been visible from every corner of the capital. The shape of the Hermitage Plaza is divided into two distinct volumes. The genesis of this design is the will to create optimum permeability of the site at ground level whilst maximizing the views from each of the two towers, as well as preserving views from the neighboring buildings. The design incorporates a number of distinguishing features such as: * The principal load-bearing columns are up to 8 meters apart, as opposed to the more conventional 6 meters found in contemporary tower structures. * An entirely automated pantograph system will be used to open the windows, allowing direct natural air circulation in the rooms, which is a real innovation for skyscrapers. * The technical rooms, usually placed on the roof, have been inserted in strategic floors (so that the pool's underlying structure would not diminish ceiling heights on any inhabitable floors) in order to provide breath-taking terraces and views to the top-floor luxury penthouses. * The triple-glazed fa√ßade grid framework is 1.75m wide, thus replacing commonly used 1.35m. The project inscribes itself within the Paris-La D√©fense renewal plan, initiated and driven by the EPADESA (local planning authorities).  History of the project  The project is managed by Emin Iskenderov, a Russian property developer. The project was revealed by Norman Foster, on 11 March 2009 at the MIPIM (real estate show for professionals) which took place in Cannes, France. Hermitage Group had originally proposed a different design, by Jacques Ferrier, which was running for the Tour Signal contest. The Tour Signal contest was won by Jean Nouvel's project but Hermitage Group tried to have its towers built anyway. This was possible because Tour Signal's location was free and Ferrier's project was not planned to be at the same location as Nouvel's from the beginning. However Hermitage Group and Ferrier were soon at odds over undisclosed points and Ferrier left the project; Hermitage then announced it would order a new design from Norman Foster, which became the currently known one. The Hermitage Plaza is sited over the riverfront end of Les Damiers, a residential estate of four Brutalist towers constructed in 1976; three sections closest to the riverfront, the Anjou and Bretagne towers and Infra lowrise, are slated to be demolished to make way for the project. Construction is scheduled to start by 2021. Hermitage SAS claims to have secured the financing of the project.

It was introduced in March 1934 as a direct replacement for the manufacturer's Standard 6 . Less directly the six-cylinder Diplomat also replaced the Adler Standard 8 since Adler's large eight-cylinder car was discontinued in 1934 without a direct replacement of its own. The decision had been taken to abandon the ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù name because it carried mundane undertones, in German as in English, which the company felt were increasingly out of keeping with the advancing automobile technology and the growing optimism of the age now that, finally, the economic backwash from the 1929 crash was beginning to recede and growth was returning both to the German auto-market Oswald, p. 531 and to the economy more generally. The body The Diplomat initially, in 1934, took over the body from the previous year's Adler Standard 6. However, the Standard Six had received an all new body for its final year of production, and for keen eyed observers the final year's Standard Six was differentiated from the first year's Diplomat by redesigned fender aprons. The chassis which had been a defining feature of the 1933 Standard 6 had been of an underslung design whereby the axles emerged directly above the principal chassis members: this allowed for a lower centre of gravity and a lower-bodied car than the overslung chassis, with axles mounted directly below the chassis, which had left the earlier Standard Six looking unfashionably high-bodied in the early 1930s. The four-door ‚ÄúLimousine‚Äù (sedan/Saloon) came with an all-steel body from Ambi-Budd, the country's largest specialist steel body producer, based in the Spandau district of Berlin. A longer wheel base six light ‚ÄúPullman-Limousine‚Äù with six seats was also offered, its body probably also from Ambi-Budd.Oswald, p. 33 \\"...Karosserie vermutlich Ambi-Budd...\\" There were in addition two cabriolet- bodied cars offered. For 1935 the Diplomat received new bodywork which now featured a bulging (and more streamlined) front grill and more shapely wings over the wheels. The six-light limousine still had a relatively vertical rear, but the other cars now had a far more streamlined tail section than the 1934 Diplomats.Oswald, pp. 33 & 34 By 1938 the ‚ÄúLimousine‚Äù and ‚ÄúCabriolet‚Äù-bodied Diplomats could also be purchased with bodies from Karmann of Osnabr√ºck: these closely resembled the style and character of the Ambi-Budd-bodied cars.Oswald, p. 33 The 1935 upgrade left the car with longer overhangs, notably at the back, which increased the car's length by . However, the and wheelbase, respectively for four-seater and six-seater cars, was not changed in 1935.Oswald, p. 35 The engine The Diplomat's six-cylinder engine was a 2916 cc straight-six side-valve unit for which a maximum power output of was claimed. That description also applies to the engine fitted in the earlier Standard Six. However, the unit used in the Diplomat featured a slightly higher compression ratio, and maximum power was achieved at 3,000 rpm rather than at 3,300 rpm. The gear ratios were also very slightly modified. In terms of the engine's architecture, the unit fitted in the Diplomat came with seven camshaft bearings in place of the four that had been used in the Standard Six.Oswald, pp. 33 & 35 The new-bodied cars for 1935 retained the engines fitted in the 1934 models. However, from 1937 the engine was significantly reworked, now with a light-metal cylinder head, a further modest increase in the compression ratio and claimed maximum power increased to . Commercial When introduced in 1934 the least expensive of the Diplomats, the four-door ‚ÄúLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon), was priced at 6,750 Marks. A comparably sized Mercedes-Benz 290 (W18) was priced in 1931 at 7,950 Marks for the least expensive ‚ÄúLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon)-bodied car.Oswald, pp. 35 & 245 The price difference between the two indicates that the Adler Diplomat was competitively priced. A production volume of 3,205 cars over four years Oswald, p. 8 suggests that the Adler Diplomat held its own in the market place, although the Mercedes-Benz 290 (W18), which appears to have been the top-selling six- cylinder car in Germany at the time, achieved a production total of more than 8,000 in a comparable period. The Adler Diplomat was no longer offered for sale in 1939, although records show that a few cars were built on 1939 and in 1940, presumably for military use or export.

In 1928 Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood visited St Ives where they were impressed by the work of local artist Alfred Wallis. This started another strand in the development of the Cornish fishing port as an artists' colony. The St Ives School of Painting was established in the historic Porthmeor studios at the centre of St Ives' artists' quarter in 1938 by Borlase Smart and Leonard Fuller. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Ben Nicholson and his then wife the sculptor Barbara Hepworth settled in St Ives, establishing an outpost for the abstract avant-garde movement in west Cornwall. They were soon joined by the prominent Russian Constructivist sculptor Naum Gabo. After the war ended, a new and younger generation of artists emerged, led by Hepworth and Nicholson (Gabo departed in 1946). From about 1950 a group of younger artists gathered in St Ives who included Peter Lanyon, John Wells, Roger Hilton, Bryan Wynter, Patrick Heron, Terry Frost, Alexander Mackenzie, Harry Ousey, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, Stass Paraskos, Paul Feiler, and Karl Weschke together with the pioneer modern potter, Bernard Leach (Nicholson departed in 1958), and including, for a while, Sven Berlin.

He was born in the capital city of Santa Fe, and grew up in Bernal, and in the mostly German populated Belgrano neighborhood in the capital city of Buenos Aires. His parents lived in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos, an experience that would later become the inspiration for his Rebellion in Patagonia, a historical reconstruction of a massacre of striking rural workers. After having worked for an insurance firm and on the merchant marine as an apprentice helmsman, he studied history in the University of Hamburg, Germany, from 1952 to 1956, and became a member of the Socialist Students‚Äô League. After his return to Argentina, he dedicated himself to journalism and research into the history of Argentina, as well as writing film scripts. He studied medicine for a year, then philosophy at Buenos Aires. According to him, Disgusted by local socialist policies, he turned towards the Federaci√≥n Libertaria Argentina (FLA), having already been acquainted to anarchist literature during his time in the German Socialist Students' League. He also founded the Department of Human Rights in the School of Philosophy and Humanities of the University of Buenos Aires. He worked at the newspapers Noticias Gr√°ficas, Clarin and Esquel, a local newspaper in the Patagonian town of Esquel. In 1958 he founded La Chispa (\\"The Spark\\"), considered to be the first independent newspaper in the history of Patagonia. A year later, he was accused by Pedro Aramburu's military regime of disseminating sensitive information and forced by the National Gendarmerie to leave Esquel. Thereafter, Bayer was from 1959 to 1962 general secretary of the Press Syndicate. Immediately after being expelled from Esquel, he was hired by the national daily Diario Clar√≠n, where he became Chief of Politics' section. He had, under his direction, the journalist F√©lix Luna, who founded in 1963 the history magazine Todo es Historia, to which Bayer collaborated. In 1963, he was arrested for 63 days by General Juan Enrique Rauch, then Minister of Interior under Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido's government, appointed by the military and the son of Colonel Federico Rauch, for having unsuccessfully proposed a plebiscite to rename the town of Rauch (Buenos Aires Province) to Arbolito, the nickname of the Ranquel man who had allegedly killed the German officer in battle in 1829. Bayer considered Rauch to be guilty of genocide. During Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n's regime, Bayer's life was threatened several times due to the content of his work, particularly his book Rebellion in Patagonia, which dealt with the massacre of striking farmhands in Patagonia during the early 1920s, under Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen's rule. In 1974, H√©ctor Olivera's adaptation of Rebellion in Patagonia, which won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, was banned in Argentina and the lives of individuals involved in the film's production were threatened by the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance. He was then forced into exile in West Germany in 1975, when the Dirty War was just beginning. In response to a dismissive comment by Ernesto Sabato that Argentina's exiled intellectuals were \\"the ones who escaped,\\" Bayer attempted to organize a charter flight to Argentina in 1981 that would include a group of prominent Latin American and European intellectuals, including Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Osvaldo Soriano, Julio Cort√°zar, Juan Rulfo and Gunter Grass, as a protest against the dictatorship; either they would be imprisoned, which would create an international scandal, or their celebrity would protect them, which would give them the opportunity to open a free school giving classes on literature, democracy and human rights. Cort√°zar backed out, however, saying \\"I don't want to go just to get shot in the head,\\" and the plan fell apart soon afterwards. Bayer only returned to Argentina after Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's 1983 election and the transition to democracy. In 1984, he collaborated with the poet Juan Gelman on a book on exile. Bayer's best-selling book on the Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, was banned by President Ra√∫l Alberto Lastiri (1973), as was La Patagonia Rebelde, his second work, by Isabel Per√≥n; others were burnt by the military after they took power in 1976. Francesco Rosi, who directed Christ Stopped at Eboli, planned to make a film adaptation of his book on Di Giovanni, but renounced the project after the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing, saying it was not the time to make a film about a terrorist. Bayer died on 24 December 2018 in Buenos Aires, at the age of 91.  Transition to democracy  He was nominated Doctor Honoris Causa on 20 April 2003 by the Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires for his work in the fields of human rights, literature and journalism. On this day, he alluded to his forced exile, stating that: Bayer was involved in the struggle for Indigenous rights. Fifteen days after having been declared \\"Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires\\" by the mayor An√≠bal Ibarra, he was declared persona non grata by the Senate (an initiative of Eduardo Menem) for having proposed the unification of the Argentinian and Chilean Patagonia, as the \\"first step for a common Latin- American market\\".Osvaldo Bayer, Despu√©s de anoche, s√≥lo me queda Marlene, P√°gina 12, 4 June 2007 As of 2008, he collaborated with the newspaper P√°gina 12, founded Jorge Lanata. He was the author of the scenario of the film La Patagonia Rebelde, adapted from his book and realized by H√©ctor Olivera, which won the Silver Bear Award in the 1974 Berlin International Film Festival. He also wrote the screenplay of the 1988 film La Amiga, a drama on the dictatorship.

The event occurred off the coast of southern Sumatra, Indonesia near Enggano Island. There were more than 100 fatalities and up to 2,585 injuries. Over 730 aftershocks shocked the area afterwards, one just eleven minutes after the mainshock. This was the first and southernmost in a series of very large to great Sumatran earthquakes in the 2000s to rupture almost the entire western part of the Sunda megathrust, most notably including the 9.1‚Äì9.3 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, but also the 8.7 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake, and the 7.9‚Äì8.4 September 2007 Sumatra earthquakes. Background and tectonics Indonesia is well known for strong earthquakes: the 2000 Enggano event marked the beginning of an ongoing period of seismic activity in the area, highlighted by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The 2000 Enggano earthquake took place at the southeastern end of the fault segment that ruptured during the 1833 Sumatra earthquake. This group of earthquakes, in addition to the 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake, all ruptured along the megathrust that forms the interface between the Australian and Sunda Plates. This event was the only one not to cause a tsunami. Earthquake The earthquake involved the rupture of two different faults with different mechanisms. The first subevent ruptured a north‚Äìsouth striking fault within the Australian Plate with a left lateral strike-slip mechanism. The earthquake rupture propagated northwards until it reached the megathrust, triggering the second subevent along the Sunda megathrust itself. The strike-slip rupture probably represents slip on a pre- existing fracture zone, similar to the likely cause of the M 7.9 earthquake that struck about 1,000 km to the south on 18 June 2000 with a similar mechanism. Damage and casualties Extensive damage and landslides populated the Bengkulu area, with minor injuries and damage on Enggano Island. In the village worst struck, several hundred structures were reported in ruins. \\" An aftershock measuring 6.2 struck on June 7. Aftermath and response International relief teams arrived in the region within several days. Relief efforts were impeded by fallen telephone poles, which blocked the supplies. The main problem found in the affected areas was a lack of water supply and electricity, these facilities having been cut off by oscillation. Pope John Paul II expressed his \\"sincere sympathy\\" for those families stricken by the earthquake. He called for a rapid international response to the quake, and said he would keep its victims in his prayers. A Taiwanese rescue team was sent to help victims of the tremor, the first from the country to take part in rescue efforts aside from Asia. The United States donated US$ 25,000 instantly to relief organizations, Japan offering a grant of US$140,000 and Australia US$143,000 in addition to a two-person team of emergency relief examiners. Wharton Basin event Two weeks later on June 18, another magnitude 7.9 event occurred about to the southwest in the Wharton Basin. At the time, it was the largest intraplate earthquake in the Indian Ocean.

He was a guitarist and a songwriter in several notable Finnish bands in the 1970s and 1980s, and has also recorded solo albums. He is best known in Finland as a member of comedy group Kummeli, which started a television show in 1991.Sihvonen, Lauri (12 December 2012). Kummeli: ‚ÄùItkett√§ji√§ on t√§ss√§ maassa ihan tarpeeksi‚Äù, Seura (in Finnish) Silvennoinen owns a production company named Pirkka-H√§meen Apina & Gorilla Oy (\\"Ape and gorilla of Pirkka-H√§me Inc.\\"). With his fellow comedian Timo Kahilainen he owns Porkkana Ryhm√§ Oy (\\"Carrot Group Inc.\\"), which produces Kummeli's output. Life and career=Tabula Rasa As young boy Silvennoinen fell in love with music of Eric Clapton, especially Cream and Jimi Hendrix. He learned to play the guitar and formed a rock band called Tabula Rasa, one of the most important 1970s progressive rock bands in Finland. When the group released their debut album, Silvennoinen started to realize that music was likely to be his primary occupation. His later career has not been associated with progressive rock, but during the Tabula Rasa years he composed almost all the songs that the group recorded. After Tabula Rasa came to an end, Silvennoinen joined Juice Leskinen's band. 1980s In the 1980s, Silvennoinen became a professional producer and collaborated with many significant bands. He played guitar in bands called Frendz and Catwalk, and in 1987 he formed a group called Q.Stone with singer Mikko Kuustonen. This band was English singing blues-rock group that released four relatively well-received albums. Kuustonen decided to leave the group and concentrate on his solo career. Silvennoinen continued to play the guitar on his albums. Solo albums In the beginning of the 1990s Silvennoinen released his first solo album, Mature And Cool. It included his own songs and a cover of Blind Willie Reynolds song \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" (popularized by Cream). His second solo album, Bobcat, was released in 1997. It includes Silvennoinen's own song \\"Sun Don't You Shine\\" and a cover of \\"Fire\\" by Jimi Hendrix. On the sleeve notes of the album he thanks his idols, not just Hendrix and Clapton, but also Peter Green and Stevie Ray Vaughan (he has personally met Vaughan and Clapton). His next album, Sweet Surrender, was released two years later. In 2000 Silvennoinen founded his own label and released the album Blues Blue Sky, which contains mostly old blues songs. The album Miehet kaatuu was released in 2003, and is his only album containing lyrics in Finnish. Kummeli In the beginning of the 1990s Silvennoinen became more popular in Finland due to the television show Kummeli. Of the four member group, Silvennoinen had the largest number of different roles (including reporter Mauno Ahonen, summer cottage neighbour Martti Mielik√§inen, Matti N√§s√§ who complains about everything, and officer Jaakko Parantainen who is concerned about environmental questions). The show and group had phenomenal success in Finland in 1994, when they also made their first stage appearances and toured all of Finland. After that Kummeli has continued its existence in various forms. Silvennoinen has stated that their best gag was the one about Lada summit, since it gave an inspiration for the real Lada summit event that still takes place yearly in Finland. The most lucrative song ‚Äì from the point of view of royalties ‚Äì Silvennoinen ever wrote was \\"Jumankauta juu n√§√§s p√§iv√§√§\\" that he claims to have done in 20 minutes. It features the Kummeli character Matti N√§s√§ singing about his car, a Toyota Mark II. Despite of the popularity of Kummeli, Silvennoinen also worked as a janitor in the late 1990s. 2000s In 2002 Silvennoinen formed the group SF-Blues with well-known Finnish musicians Pepe Ahlqvist (harp, vocal) and Dave Lindholm (guitar, vocal), with all members sharing songwriting duties on their first album. In the following year, singer Erja Lyytinen replaced Lindholm for next album. In 2005 guitarist Jukka Tolonen and singer Mikko Kuustonen joined the group in order to make their second album, Joutomailla. Other musicians that have been involved with the band include singer Eero Raittinen and keyboardist Jukka Gustavson. In the 2000s Silvennoinen did voice acting work for some children movie characters needing Finnish overdubs.

He attended the Versailles Conference as an advocate for a Jewish state in Palestine.Julian William Mack . History of the Sixth Circuit. Retrieved March 13, 2010. Geography Ramat HaShofet is located in the region of Ramot Menashe in northern Israel. The Shofet River flows near the kibbutz and in one of its rivulets, Omlosim Stream, there is a small park. About 400 meters northeast to the kibbutz there is a spring. History Ramat HaShofet 1945 In 1934 two gar'ins of Hashomer Hatzair movement, Mitzpe HaSharon from Lithuania and LaShihrur from Poland arrived to Mandatory Palestine and sent to Mishmar HaEmek for qualifications. Mitzpe HaSharon was sent to work in Ra'anana while LaShihrur was sent to Rehovot.Hareuveni, Immanuel; Eretz Yisrael Lexicon; Ministry of Education p.880 The Gar'in of Mitzpe HaSharon (lit. \\"Sharon lookout\\") was settled on a 20 duman hill owned by the Jewish National Fund some 4 kilometers from Ra'anana. The small kibbutz, which has 80 members in 1937 operated a vegetable farm, but it could not provide work for all of the members, so they also worked in Ra'anana and Kfar Nahman (today part of Ra'anana). The small kibbutz had no road connection and was surrounded by land owned by Arabs. In 1940, 60 members of the kibbutz worked in Ra'anana. The gar'in of LaShihrur (lit. \\"To Liberation\\") settled on a hill near Rehovot's railway station. The kibbutz had poor transportation and the residents received complaints due to their work close to the railway. The elders of the small kibbutz worked in Rehovot and their children studied in there as well. In 1943, before the departure of all the members to Ramat HaShofet, the kibbutz had 186 members, including 46 children. The two groups united and established the kibbutz on 2 November 1941 with support from Keren Hayesod, on land owned by the Jewish National Fund. Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Argentina later joined the kibbutz. The kibbutz was established first by a group of 20 members who arrived and started working the land. In the early years the members worked to clear and prepare the ground for agriculture. They developed good relations with the Arab village of al-Rihaniyya. In 1942 the first permanent structures were built and in 1943 a carpentry workshop was built. In that same year, the rest of LaShihrur came from Rehovot and settled in the new kibbutz. After al-Rihaniyya became depopulated in the 1948 Palestine war, Ramat HaShofet and Ein HaEmek have used its lands. In 1954 the kibbutz was connected to the national water supply system run by Mekorot. In 2003 the kibbutz was privatized and in 2005 new families moved in. In September 2010 the first section of a new neighborhood called HaSadeh (The Field) was completed. The second and third sections were completed between 2012 and 2013. The neighborhood has 61 houses with per each house.HaSadeh A.B.

The firm supplied stores such as Maple & Co., mainly producing bedroom and dining furniture.Following the Edwardian period the company became successful in the mass production of furniture affordable to a wider range of customers. The history of the ‚Äòlargest furniture factory in the world‚Äô has been published in a book. [3] The author has compiled the complete narrative utilising a broad range of sources including the personal archives of Oliver Lebus, Harris‚Äôs grandson along with memories from those who were there. Lebus was a key player in the furniture trade for many years with a successful business model. Harris Lebus: A Romance with the Furniture Trade by Paul Collier https://www.libripublishing.co.uk/Products/ProdID=218 Harris Lebus: A Romance with the Furniture Trade by Paul Collier  History  During the period of its finest output in the early 1900s, the style of furniture is closely associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, identified by overhanging cornices, inset door panels and square to turned legs with pad feet in the manner of William Birch of High Wycombe. The off the peg hardware is unfussy and stylistically well designed. These pieces are highly sought after. Also at this time, small numbers of high quality mahogany, satinwood or walnut bedroom suites in the Sheraton style were made As with many larger firms their designers are kept anonymous. This prolific manufacturer had more to do with bringing the Arts and Crafts style to the masses than any other. The drawers of Harris Lebus furniture such as chests, wardrobes and roll-top desks made during this period,can be identified by the H.L.L (stands for Harris Lebus, London) on the face plates of the brass locks. More obviously, some desks had 'The Lebus Desk' stamped on the escutcheon plate of the roll-top lock. In addition, the firm took out a 1904 patent relating to the construction of drawer sides (a framed panel, rather than solid wood), to reduce warping and subsequent sticking.. This provides a further identification aid for Lebus furniture of the Edwardian period. During the First World War the company supplied the government with a large volume of war supplies. These ranged from ammunition boxes to aircraft frames. . After the war the firm's manufacturing policy was changed. It was decided to increase mechanisation to enable the production of high volumes of well-constructed furniture affordable to a wider range of people.. This was hugely successful and Harris Lebus became a household name and the largest furniture manufacturer in the world. During the Second World War the firm produced the Airspeed Horsa glider,The Assault Glider Trust the Mosquito multi role aircraft. The firm also undertook Top- secret operations, such as building replica Sherman tanks out of wood. Following the war the firm became part of the government scheme to produce utility furniture bearing the CC41 mark and were central in providing cheaper manufacturing techniques to provide the country with lower cost furniture with which they could rebuild their homes, and in fact their design team invented and patented the technique of facing man-made boards with other woods.The Company also devised and perfected the means of assembling Furniture from preformed sections and completing the construction by curing resin glue lines, utilising 'Radio Frequency' electricity, or 'R.F.' There was no metal fixing required in the assembly at all. In addition, in the mid 1960s, the company patented an improved veneering procedure. Harris Lebus ceased being a family partnership in 1947 when it was floated as a public company. Initially family members were on the main board with Sir Herman Lebus becoming Chairman and Managing Director; LS Lebus Assistant Managing Director and Anthony and Oliver Lebus members of the Board. Louis H Lebus and SH (Bob) Lebus retired.. After financial difficulty, caused by a period of poor management which was not family, the firm finally closed in 1969.

Plot The US military is running a test for a special type of radio transmitter, to be used to communicate with submarines, in a deep system of caves in Central America. When the signal from one of the transmitters suddenly disappears, a team of soldiers led by Major Elbert Stevens (Bottoms) and cave specialists led by Rupert 'Wolf' Wolfsen (Powell) including scientist Leslie Peterson (Blount) are sent in to find out what happened. Exploring deep underground, they stumble upon a tribe of albino cave-dwellers who have apparently been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years.

It was developed by the German engineers, Ewald Klien and Heinrich Lindner, of the Royal Saxon State Railways (K√∂niglich S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen). Design features The Klien- Lindner axle uses a double, or hollow, axle, one inside the other. It has a hollow axle (Hohlachse) on the outside, connected at its centre by a Cardan joint to a fixed driving axle running through it. The Cardan joint comprises two spherical elements that are interlinked - a solid one on the fixed axle and a hollow one on the outer hollow axle, each oriented at 90¬∞ to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts as a sort of link motion. In this way the hollow axle can be turned by the fixed axle. In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the hollow axle can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the fixed axle and the internal diameter of the hollow one. This system is used on steam locomotives with fixed outer frames and coupled axles. Typically the conventionally driven wheels are in the centre and there are outer Klien-Lindner axles, front and rear. In this way the wheels, which are fixed to the hollow axles, are 'steered' by shafts that pivot on the frame when the locomotive is curve running. Coupling rods from the conventional driving wheels in the centre act on drive cranks on the inner axles fixed to the frame. In spite of their relatively simple design Klien-Lindner axles were not widely used. Derailments were common when they were used as leading axles. The axles often caused uneven, jerky running as a result of the resistance forces that arise from this type of Cardan joint, and they were expensive to maintain, something which was not offset by the reduced wear and tear on wheel flanges and rails.  Examples  O&K; Locomotive No. 740 seen here on shed at Pages Park station of the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway Deutsches Dampflokomotiv-Museum. Several locomotives of this type were ordered for the Matheran Hill Railway in India, which has curves as sharp as , traversed at a speed of .

This Weld line is itself a cadet line originating from John Weld of Eaton, Cheshire and descends from his youngest son, Sir Humphrey Weld, Lord Mayor of London (1608), a protestant, whose grandson of the same name, having reverted to Catholicism, purchased Lulworth Castle in Dorset, England, in 1641. They were a notable recusant family prior to Catholic Emancipation in the 19th century. The distantly related Catholic Blundell family died out at the start of the 19th century and passed on their Ince Blundell estate to Thomas Weld (1808-1887), the second son of the then owner of Lulworth Castle, Joseph, on condition that he and his issue adopted the \\"Blundell\\" name. The branch in England had died out by 1924, since Herbert Weld Blundell, last of the line, dropped the suffix, \\"Blundell\\". The Weld History After Humphrey Weld, governor of Portland Castle and grandson of Sir Humphrey Weld, Lord Mayor of London, had bought the Lulworth estates from the Howards and become \\"Humphrey of Lulworth\\", his only issue was his daughter, Mary. When he died in 1685, his successor was his nephew, William Weld, son of Humphrey's younger brother, Sir John Weld of Compton Bassett, Knight banneret. William had married Elizabeth Shireburn in 1672 the daughter of the squire of Stonyhurst. William died in 1698 and was succeeded by his surviving younger son, Humphrey. Humphrey married Margaret Simeons and had surviving issue, one of whom, Thomas, changed his surname to Weld-Simeons and married into the Fitzherbert family and went to live in Bruges. Meanwhile, the older surviving son, Edward (1705-1761), became his heir when Humphrey III died in 1722.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, Volume 2. H. Colburn, 1847. pp. 1545-6 view on line Edward Weld and his wife Dame Maria n√©e Vaughan, of the Welsh Bicknor exclave in Herefordshire had four sons and a daughter. The latter became a Poor Clare religious. The eldest of the sons, also Edward (1740 - 1775), became his heir in 1761 aged just 21. He was widowed after his first marriage in 1763 to Juliana Petre, daughter of Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre, who died in 1772. In 1775 he married the impecunious Maria Smythe, a cousin by marriage, later Mrs Fitzherbert and the morganatic wife of the Prince of Wales. Three months after the wedding he fell off his horse and died of his injuries, before having time to sign his new will. There was no issue from either marriage, the estate therefore passed to his surviving younger brother, Thomas (1750-1810). Thomas had married Mary Stanley-Massey-Stanley daughter of Sir John Stanley-Massey-Stanley, 6th Baronet (1711‚Äì1794). They had six daughters and nine sons, the eldest of whom was also Thomas, who after being widowed and left with a daughter, entered the church and rose to the status of cardinal.Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Weld.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 January 2019 As a result, the Lulworth and other estates were ceded to the third and next surviving son of Thomas and Mary, who was Joseph Weld (1777-1863). He is remembered as one of the earliest Englishmen to build and handle fast-sailing yachts. His best known boat was The Arrow, which took part in the first America's Cup race in 1851 under the ownership of Thomas Chamberlayne. Joseph was also founder of the Isle of Wight based Royal Yacht Squadron. Joseph Weld's heir was his son, Thomas Weld (1808-1883), who would subsequently start the Weld-Blundell line as a result of an inheritance on Merseyside in 1837. The Blundell history The first documentation of the name of Blundell on the Ince Blindell site on Merseyside is that of Richard Blundell in 1212. Following the Reformation the Blundells became recusants and kept their Catholic faith and were subjected to the consequent hardships and hazards. They should not be confused with the Anglican merchant Blundells, one of whom, Bryan (c. 1675-1756), was a prominent mariner and slave trader. Despite the penal restrictions placed on Catholics, the Blundell family acquired more assets either by legal transactions or dowries from advantageous marriages. By the end of the 18th century they held 15 manors together with other property, some of it in Liverpool and Preston. One of the noted family members was Nicholas Blundell (1669‚Äì1737), of Little Crosby and seated at Crosby Hall, Lancashire, probably best known for his diaries which provide a first-hand insight into the life of 18th-century English gentry.Lady Antonia FraserThe Weaker Vessel Phoenix Press, London, 2002 The extant Ince Blundell Hall was built by Robert Blundell (1700‚Äì73) who inherited the estate in 1711. The house was designed by Henry Sephton, who was the \\"leading mason-architect in the area\\" at that time. In 1761 Robert Blundell moved from the house to Liverpool, and the estate passed to his eldest son, Henry (1724‚Äì1810). Henry extended the house \\"without the help of a Wyat (sic) or any architect\\". He made other improvements to the grounds, including a lake and a ha-ha. Henry Blundell was a collector, of paintings, statues and antiquities. () The collection amounted to over 500 items. In order to house them at Ince Blundell, he constructed various buildings in the grounds of the hall to house his pieces. In 1790‚Äì92 he built the Garden Temple, a building in Classical style. This was followed in about 1802‚Äì05 by the Pantheon, based on the Pantheon in Rome. When Henry died in 1810, the hall passed to his son, Charles. After his death, most of the paintings were sold, and the collection of antiquities given to the National Museums Liverpool and put on show in the Walker Art Gallery. Charles died childless in 1837, and the estate passed to Thomas Weld, a cousin. Thomas \\"Weld-Blundell\\" As a condition of the inheritance, Thomas took the name of Thomas Weld Blundell, and restored, refurnished and redecorated the Blundell Hall. On 11 March 1843 Queen Victoria granted Thomas Weld (1808-1887), second son of Joseph, her royal licence and authority for him and his issue to use and bear the surname of Blundell in addition to Weld.The London Gazette, 20 March 1843, Page 949 His cadet Weld line thus became Weld-Blundell upon inheriting the Lancashire estates, previously seated at Ince Blundell Hall and had been a cadet branch of the ancient Blundells of Crosby. The English Catholic Who's Who (1912) mentioned three Weld-Blundells and six Welds. The Lulworth branch died out by the 1920s, after two sons of Charles Joseph Weld-Blundell died young. Lulworth Castle devolved in 1924 upon Herbert Weld Blundell.Lulworth Castle @ www.destinations-uk.com His father was Thomas Weld-Blundell of Ince Blundell. Reversion of Lulworth to the Welds After the death of the childless Herbert Weld-Blundell in 1935, the Lulworth estates in Dorset reverted to another Weld family member, Col. Sir Joseph William Weld. Meanwhile, the Grade II* listed Ince Blundell Hall in Lancashire, still owned by a branch of the Welds, was sold in 1959 partly to the local council for housing and the hall to an order of nuns, the Canonesses of Saint Augustine, to run it as a nursing home.

He is a part of the artistic movement \\"Ecole de Nice\\". Moya has been at the forefront since the 1970s of straddling the latest forms of media and technology to benefit art rather than rendering it extinct. He is an early pioneer of video art. Early life and career Moya arrived in Nice at the age of fifteen. He studied Fine Arts at the Villa Arson for three years. Inspired by the theory of Marshall McLuhan, he invented a \\"TV show\\" called Bonzour Bonzourhttp://www.studiomoya.com/biofilm.htm where he is a \\"TV artist\\" (the message is the medium, the medium is the artist, I am the medium). It was his first experimentation in \\"video art\\". For ten years, he is hired like a \\"nude model\\" for the art students. In the 80's, he begin working with the letters of his name, MOYA, saying that ¬´the art is the signature¬ª. This spawned the practice of using the letters of his name in his art which he has put on as many surfaces as possible, often in the background of his paintings or in sculpture, in a celebratory way which has become his trademark.http://www.lepost.fr/article/2009/02/03/1410109_zoom-sur-patrick- moya.html Being a model meanwhile taught him to objectify himself so he could later insert himself as the medium in his own work after realizing that \\"with the ubiquity of broadcast media, the creator had to invent himself as a creature\\" to ride out and embrace New Media. In 1991, he participates at a Sculptures Symposium in Asia (Taiwan), making a big sculpture with the letter of his name (Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Ta√Øwan) in 1996, he invented an alter ego, \\"moya\\", a self-portrait inspired by Pinocchio, in order to \\"become part of his art work\\". His personal universe emerges gradually, a bestiary almost human standing in front of the spectator. In 1999 appears a character named \\"Dolly\\", a little sheep inspired by the famous cloned sheep (Dolly).Today, Dolly is a central figure of the \\"Moya Land\\". In June 2007, was inaugurated by Christian Estrosi (then Minister for Overseas), interior fresco of a chapel in the village of Clans : this painting, made from self-portraits of the artist, tells the story of St John the Baptist. Since 1985, he began making digital using a Thomson MO5.http://www.studiomoya.com/presse.htm He also used celluloid as medium on which to scratch his name and play it back as film art/art film. He never stop to use computer in his art, making 3D images, then 3D videos, until 2007, where he discover the \\"Second Life\\" environment : there, he built his Moya Landhttp://www.lepost.fr/article/2009/02/03/1410109_zoom-sur-patrick-moya.html and by extension, has spread the Moya label to the virtual frontier. In his subversive global art work, he regularly includes live and interactive performances between him and the public, using the virtual environment and has done collaborations with Thierry Mugler. In 2009, he participates to the first major exhibition about \\"Art in Second Life\\", under the title \\"Rinascimento Virtuale ¬ª. It was in the museum of Anthropology of Florence, the City of the Renaissance, where an entire room was devoted to the \\"Moya civilization\\". In summer 2011, the Moya Universe is arrived to maturity, as demonstrated by the big mural-installation of 90 meters long, a fresco who told the story of Moya civilization, on the walls of the art center La Malmaison, in Cannes. This exhibition, built also in SL, allowed to visitors to meet the artist from a distance, to ask questions and to visit with him his virtual Moya Land. In May 2015, a new biography is published, \\"Le cas Moya\\" (¬´ Moya case ¬ª), who proved the coherence of his work : Moya write his name (1979/1989) - Moya tags anonymous images with his name (1990 /1996) - Little \\"moya\\" appears alone in his work (1996 /1999) - Moya create his 2D universe (1999 /2007) - Moya Master of his 3D universe (2007/2015). The dream of Moya is coming true : \\"to be Tintin rather Herg√©, The Joconde rather Leonardo da Vinci ‚Ä¶ To be a Creature living in his art work, living a second life of a Creature playing to be an Artist\\".  Artworks  Moya is a prolific artist touching on everything from art films, billboard art, ceramics, computer, conceptual art, drawings, fashion art, muralism, painting, projection art, sculpture and video art - up to now. His body of work has been inventoried in a catalogue raisonn√© that comprises over 4500 pieces in the span of 40 years between 1971 and 2011. His work has been plastered on the city of Cannes's public transport system's mini-buses,http://www.moyapatrick.com/mode.htm on cars (Porsche, Fiat 500, Deux-chevaux, Smart, Gordini‚Ä¶), on cows from \\"Cow Parades\\" and cowbells, on designer clotheshttp://www.moyapatrick.com/mode.htm and promotional USB cards issued by Cannes's Hotel Martinez, as well as France's famous Guide Michelin. He has also designed dolls for UNICEF. Moya is one of the very few modern artists to be commissioned to paint a Catholic church,http://fcanarelli.free.fr/CLANS/index.html dedicated to Saint Jean Baptiste in Clans. His frescos can be found in public buildings in Monaco (namely the Princess Grace hospital), in a college (\\"La Bourgade\\" in La Trinit√©), recently in Pasteur 2 Hospital (2015). Moya become a digital artist since his early work on computer in the mid-80s : now, since 2007, he is the owner of a virtual Moya Land in the 3D web of Second Life. Today, Moya is living between real and virtual Worlds, and, with the name of \\"Moya Janus\\" (the name of his avatar), he answers to journalist (Radio Canada, 2013), to students (school of Fine Arts of Venice, Quebec, Zurich or Milan ...), participates or organize many exhibitions, real or virtual, reproduces Art Fairs or Museums (Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Ceramics Museum in Vallauris ‚Ä¶), works with a chief (Christian Sinicropi of Restaurant \\"La Palme d'Or\\" in Cannes) ...

Published posthumously, The Book of Disquiet is a fragmentary lifetime project, left unedited by the author, who introduced it as a \\"factless autobiography.\\" The publication was credited to Bernardo Soares, one of the author's alternate writing names, which he called semi-heteronyms, and had a preface attributed to Fernando Pessoa, another alternate writing name or orthonym.  Editions  Much studied by \\"Pessoan\\" critics, who have different interpretations regarding the book's proper organization, The Book of Disquiet was first published in Portuguese in 1982, 47 years after Pessoa's death (the author died at age 47 in 1935). The book has seen publication in Spanish (1984), German (1985), Italian (1986), French (1988), English (1991), and Dutch (1990 (selection) and 1998 (full)). The Book in 1991 had four English editions by different translators: Richard Zenith (editor and translator), Iain Watson, Alfred MacAdam and Margaret Jull Costa. The Book is a bestseller, especially in German (16 editions, from different translators and publishers). The book was listed on the Norwegian Book Clubs list of the 100 best works of fiction of all time, based on the responses of 100 authors from 54 countries. Interpretations Teresa Sobral Cunha considers there to be two versions of The Book of Disquiet. According to Cunha, who edited the first version with Jacinto do Prado Coelho and Maria Aliete Galhoz in 1982, there are two authors of the book: Vicente Guedes in a first phase (in the 1910s and 20s), and the aforementioned Bernardo Soares (late 1920s and 30s). Fernando Pessoa drinking a glass of wine in a Lisbon tavern in 1929. However, Ant√≥nio Quadros considers the first phase of the book to belongs to Pessoa himself. The second phase, more personal and diary-like, is the one credited to Bernardo Soares. Richard Zenith, editor of a new Portuguese edition in 1998, took the option of presenting a single volume, as in his English translation of 1991. In his introduction, he writes that \\"if Bernardo Soares does not measure up to the full Pessoa, neither are his diary writings the sum total of Disquietude, to which he was after all a johnny- come-lately. The Book of Disquietude was various books (yet ultimately one book), with various authors (yet ultimately one author), and even the word disquietude changes meaning as time passes.\\"PESSOA, Fernando, The Book of Disquietude, tr.

It replaced the remains of the church of Burton Abbey which was used by the town after the dissolution of the abbey. St Modwen's New Church The current church building, which dominates Burton's market square, was begun in 1719, first used for services in 1723, and finally completed by 1728. It is built in red sandstone and comprises an aisled five- bay nave with galleries on the north, west, and south, an apse, and a western narthex with central tower, north and south gallery stairs, and internal porch. Designed in a Classical style by the brothers Richard and William Smith of Tettenhall, it is similar to St Alkmund's Church at Whitchurch, Shropshire, built by William to the designs of John Barker. William died in 1724 and Richard in 1726, and the church was completed by their younger brother Francis Smith of Warwick. In the 1730s Richard Wilkes, a Staffordshire antiquary, described the church as 'elegant and beautiful', giving 'pleasure to all that behold or enter it'. The west tower is of three stages and has a balustrade with urns and round windows with radial glazing bars. The apse has wide Doric pilasters at the opening and between the windows. The nave arcades have tall Doric piers without an entablature, the flat ceiling has a deep cove, and the nave galleries cut across the high, arched windows of the aisles.British History Online Burton-upon-Trent: Established church.

Career The son of a Surgeon-General occupying Ardfinnan Castle in Ireland, Prendergast entered the Royal Navy as a Cadet in 1877. He served in the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 as a Midshipman aboard the broadside ironclad HMS Achilles. In 1885 he transferred to the gunboat HMS Grappler at Gibraltar. He was promoted Lieutenant in June 1887 and joined the corvette HMS Volage in the Training Squadron in 1888. In 1889 he went to HMS Excellent to train as a gunnery officer and was then posted to the battleship HMS Collingwood and then to the frigate HMS Raleigh, flagship of the Training Squadron. In 1899 he was promoted Commander and posted to HMS Northampton, a seagoing training ships for boys. In December 1901 he was posted to HMS Excellent, where he was promoted Captain. In 1904 he went to the Naval Ordnance Department at the Admiralty, and then commanded in succession the cruisers HMS Essex and HMS Carnarvon and the battleship HMS Implacable. In 1911 he was appointed Captain-Superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard. In November 1914 he was promoted Rear-Admiral, but remained at Sheerness. In May 1916 he was appointed Rear-Admiral Commanding Scapa Flow, hoisting his flag in the depot ship HMS Imperieuse and then the dockyard repair ship HMS Victorious.

Death Following retirement, Prendergast moved to Eastbourne, where he lived at Meads House and his Irish home at Ardfinnan Castle was sold out of the family. By 1946 he was senile and developed a bladder infection, for which he was treated by society doctor and suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams.

Development In early 1930 a contest was called by the ARR for a new fighter type to equip its squadrons. During July and October, seven foreign types were tested at an airfield near Bucharest. No decision was made, however, since none of the contenders reached the minimal speed limit set by the requirements at . Despite the inconclusive results, the favourite plane seemed to be the chunky- looking Polish P.Z.L. P.1/II prototype, registered SP-ADO. During the same period, the air force commission was informed that a new fighter prototype had been completed at I.A.R., and it had reached an impressive top speed during initial test flights. Built according to the plans of Dipl.-Eng. Dr. Elie Carafoli and Lucien Virmoux, the I.A.R. fighter was an advanced construction. Named the C.V. 11 after its designers, it had a mixed metal-wood structure and cantilever, low-wing configuration, modern features soon to be adopted by all major aircraft manufacturers. The front fuselage structure was made of duraluminum tubes, while the rear part was of pinewood. The engine nacelle and the fuselage up to the cockpit were covered by duraluminum sheets, the aft part by plywood. The rear part of the fuselage merged with the tail without a substantial cross-sectional change, giving the aircraft a rather unusual arrow-like look. Due to its unconventional fuselage configuration the overall length came to less than 7 m, while the height was only . The span wing was made up by three sections of combined duraluminum/pinewood construction,reinforced by steel cables. The centre part housed the main wing fuel tank. The unbalanced control surfaces, which proved to be too small during trials, were made entirely of wood covered by fabric. The powerplant chosen was a Lorraine-Dietrich 12Fa Courlis with 12 cylinders arranged in a W configuration. Its maximum output was an impressive but it proved to be too heavy for the small and light fuselage, which weighted only , and caused a dangerous tendency to go into a spin at low speed. This shortcoming could not be eliminated, so the prototype, officially designated I.A.R. C.V. 11/W.8, had finally to be abandoned. In the meantime, a second prototype was completed at I.A.R. This time a less powerful but sensibly lighter Hispano-Suiza 12Mc engine, with 12-cylinders in V, had been fitted to essentially the same fuselage. Although weaker than its predecessor, this engine gave a superior maximum speed of 328 km/h at sea level and 295 km/h at 5,000 m. The armament of two Vickers machine guns firing through the propeller arc had been retained from the first prototype. An O.P.L. type gunsight helped the pilot to aim its guns. After initial test flights, the second prototype, designated in French style I.A.R. C.V. 11 C1 (Chasseur monoplace), had been shipped to Istres, in France, where it arrived in January 1931. During the following two months further trials were conducted involving French specialists as well. The French specialists report, however, did not have any significant effect on ARR commission members. After the initial failure in reaching a verdict, this prompted the ARR leaders to set up a new, five member committee to decide the choice of fighter type to be introduced into Romanian service. After several months of inquiries and test flights, the commission finally decided four to one in favour of the P.Z.L. P.1 and against the faster but less manoeuvrable, spin-prone I.A.R. C.V. 11. Therefore, once the prototype returned to Romania, as a last measure, the I.A.R. team decided to make an attempt to break the speed record on a closed circuit. The record of in effect at that time for this category had been set up by the Frenchman Joseph Sadi-Lecointe, with a Nieuport-Del√¢ge airplane. The record-breaking attempt was scheduled for the morning of 9 December 1931 on the Bucharest-Fetesti-Bucharest route. With the Capitan aviator Romeo Popescu at its controls, the C.V. 11 took off from Pipera-Bucharest military airfield at 11.30 a.m. The first 370 km were flown without any trouble at an encouraging average speed. Close to Lehliu railway station, however, the overheated Hispano-Suiza engine suddenly stalled, forcing the pilot to try an improvised forced landing with the now vicious airplane. Cpt. Popescu approached a nearby open field, but at contact with the thick snow cover one of the main wheels collapsed and the fighter turned over, crushing the pilot under the fuselage. Romeo Popescu, an experienced test pilot and holder of three Romanian national aviation records, died instantly. The investigation following the incident concluded that the lubrication of the overstressed engine, working at maximum power, was insufficient, causing seizure. Until that fatal moment, during an hour and thirty-four minutes of flight, an average speed of 319 km/h had been recorded by the onboard instruments, thus a good chance had existed of achieving the goal set by the temerarious pilot. However, by that time the dice had already been cast. Months before, in September 1931, General Constantin Lazarescu, the new inspector of DSA, decided not to consider the I.A.R. design any more, but to purchase the Polish P.Z.L.

In 1812 he quit the Spanish Army when his father was arrested and sent as a prisoner to Callao for participating in the preparations for the Chilean War of Independence. He decided to accompany his father to prison in Peru, and while there he joined a prisoner's revolt, was captured and tortured. Military career=Peru In 1820, Gana entered the service again in Peru, under the orders of General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. Gana with his battalion captured the City of Huaras with the whole garrison, and, as a consequence, the provinces of Trujillo, Lambayeque, and Piura pronounced for the insurrection, leading to the whole northern portion of Peru being wrestled from the rule of the viceroy. The viceroy, Jos√© de La Serna, was forced to evacuate his capital, Lima, on July 6, and on the 12th San Martin occupied the City. Independence was solemnly proclaimed on July 28. Meanwhile Gana took part in the assault of Callao, on August 14, and after the final surrender of September 21, he was promoted to major. Gana participated in General Sucre's expedition to the south, and commanded a column that attacked the Spanish forces at Quilca (August 14, 1823), and, notwithstanding the loss of one third of his troops, routed the enemy and pursued him toward Arequipa.

In December of the same year he was promoted to colonel, and his battalion formed part of General Ram√≥n Freire's expedition to Chilo√©, which archipelago was still held by the Spanish under General Antonio Quintanilla. He participated in the decisive Battle of Bellavista (January 14, 1826), and was commissioned by Freire to sign the capitulation of Pudeto on January 19 which surrendered the rest of Chilean territory to the independentist forces.

Their home ballpark is the Estadio Centenario 27 de Febrero. The Olmecas began playing in the Mexican League in 1975 and have had many nicknames; they've been the Cardenales de Tabasco (1975), the Plataneros de Tabasco (1977‚Äì85), and the Ganaderos de Tabasco (1985‚Äì89). They became the Olmecas in 1990. In 1998, they played as the Ganaderos for two seasons before returning to the Olmecas name for the 2000 season. The Olmecas won their only Mexican League championship in 1993 under manager Juan Navarrete. The Olmecas have long been known for their pitching, especially Emigdio Lopez, Tabasco Cecilio Ruiz, Juan Jesus Alvarez, Jesus \\"Chito\\" Rios, Ricardo Osuna, and Gaudencio Aguirre. Other well-known players who have played for the Olmecas include catcher Elisha Garz√≥n, first baseman Jay Gainer, second baseman Joel Serna, third baseman Manuel Ramirez, and shortstop Heber Gomez. Rusty Tillman, Oscar Zambrano, Rosario Zambrano, Arturo Bernal, and Tabasco Carlos Sievers have all been stars in the outfield in Villahermosa. History The Cardenales, the first team representing Villahermosa in the Mexican League, began play in 1975. Plagued with economic problems, they sat out the 1976 season before returning to the league in 1977. When the club returned for 1977, they were renamed the Plataneros (the Banana Planters), a name they kept until 1985. The Plataneros found their first success in 1979, when they qualified for the playoffs under manager Ra√∫l Cano. The team included Arturo Bernal, Rommel Canada, Joel Orquendo, and Nike Nagy. As the 1980s began, the Plataneros signed stars Luis Tiant and Jesus Sommers but did not find success on the field. In 1984, Julian Manzur, the club president, decided to sell the team. Humberto Tapia purchased the club and changed their name to the Ganaderos for 1985. In 1987, they signed Steve Howe, who was attempting a return to the major leagues after a drug suspension. He had great success and was signed by the Texas Rangers after 13 games. Mike Cole stole 100 bases in the 1989 season and there was hope of a playoff appearance, but poor road trips against Campeche and Yucat√°n to end the season left them out of the postseason picture. Everything changed for the better in 1993. Juan Navarrete took over as manager and the club signed many foreign players including Rafael de Lima, Alexis Infante, Rusty Tillman, and Todd Brown. The Olmecas ended a 14-year playoff drought and won the Mexican League title. Don Diego Rosillo was named Executive of the Year and Ricardo Osuna won Pitcher of the Year.

Background Only some two weeks after the last known recorded flight, on 18 January 1916, of the J 1 \\"technology demonstrator\\" design of 1915, the Junkers firm had impressed Hauptmann Felix Wagenf√ºhr, head of IdFlieg Pr√ºfanstalt und Werft der Fliegertruppe (\\"Test Establishment and Workshop of the Aviation Troops\\") department, enough for him to contract the Junkers firm to build six all-metal monoplanes, intended as fighter prototypes. Each was to be powered by the Mercedes D.II inline engine (as the J 1 had been), and armed with one 7.92 mm (.312 in) lMG 08 Spandau synchronized machine gun. The aircraft were allocated IdFlieg serial numbers E.250/16 to E.255/16. The specification was for an aircraft that had: * A top speed of . * A flight duration of 90 minutes. * The ability to climb to within 20 minutes. The contract also specified that \\"the greatest manoeuverability and nimbleness in flight must be achieved by the aircraft\\", expressing a possible concern of the German governmental agency concerning the use of the heavy electrical steel sheet that made up the earlier J 1's structure. Junkers began wind tunnel and design work promptly upon receipt of the contract, and, by the end of the spring of 1916, the first example was completed. Design The Junkers J 2's pioneering \\"unitized\\" forward fuselage structure, integrating the wing roots, engine mount and cockpit The J 2 differed from the J 1 in having a cowling that almost entirely enclosed the engine, a rounded upper and lower fuselage section instead of the rectangular section of the J 1., and a narrower and deeper ventral radiator enclosure, and had a horizontal stabilizer planform shape that would become familiar on later, all-duralumin Junkers monoplane designs to be built during 1917-18. The \\"all-moving\\" rudder still possessed no fixed fin, like the J 1. A faired-in headrest was provided for, as well as the possibly pioneering appearance of a \\"roll bar\\" for an open-cockpit aircraft, placed above the headrest for additional pilot protection in case of the aircraft overturning during landing. The landing gear was of the usual vee-type, but taller than that of the J 1's, and having the upper ends of the legs anchored not onto the lower longerons as on the J 1, but to the first wing rib bay beyond the wing root, with a long tailskid that emerged from the lower rear fuselage directly below the stabilizer's leading edge root. The wings had at least three different airfoil changes between root and tip, and had sections of them electrically roll-welded for stronger, more continuous bonding for greater strength. The resulting aircraft was intended to be smaller than the J 1 demonstrator, but with its steel structure, it almost equalled the J 1's completed weight. One feature pioneered in the J 2 that would also be used in later all-metal monoplanes designed and built by Junkers in World War I, was a \\"unitized\\" forward fuselage structure, combining the engine mount, wing roots and cockpit framing into a single structure. Operational history The first production example of the J.2, (serial number E.250/16) was delivered to Adlershof on 2 July 1916, and started its IdFlieg-mandated static load testing. Otto Mader, one of the J 2's designers, then promised IdFlieg that the following example, E.251/16, would have even greater structural strength than that of the E.250's airframe. Leutnant Theodor Mallinckrodt, the pilot who had first \\"hopped\\" the J 1 some seven months previously, flew E.251/16 for the type's maiden flight on 11 July 1916. Mallinckrodt gave the aircraft a good overall evaluation, judging it as \\"very manoeuverable\\", with good turning qualities and safe aerodynamic behaviour. A short time later, IdFlieg test pilots Unteroffiziers Wendeler and Max Schade, began performing full flight evaluation tests on the six examples of the J 2 as they arrived at Adlershof . Schade would eventually take one of the test aircraft on a flight from Berlin to Dessau later in the summer of 1916, achieving a speed of with the aircraft, which was some faster than the contemporary French Nieuport 11, but, as the J 2 test aircraft still seemed to come up short in climbing performance tests when evaluated against wood structure designs like the then new Albatros D.I, the steel structure of the J 2 made it just too heavy to be able to compete in air combat over the Front. At least one example (E.253/16) of the J 2 was fitted with slightly longer wings and matching longer ailerons, possibly in an effort to decrease the wing loading of the initial J 2 design, and at least one of the aircraft was fitted with the then-new Mercedes D.III engine, achieving at full throttle. Shortcomings of an \\"iron aircraft\\" Despite the attempts to improve the J 2's performance and handling, by late in the summer of 1916, Hugo Junkers had come to the realization that the continued use of sheet electrical steel was no longer practical for aircraft construction, writing in his diary that: \\"As a result of the first (J 1) and second (J 2) aircraft, one would ascertain that the aerodynamic efficiency was very good. We thought we [the Junkers designers] were over the hill. This, unfortunately, was not the case. We had to start again from the very beginning. The reason was that, in spite of the favorable horizontal speed, the aircraft could not meet the military climb specifications...we had to develop an aircraft that not only had low drag for ease of manoeuver in the horizontal plane, but that could climb well-an aircraft with a low weight to power ratio... ...This could not be achieved with iron, and we had to choose a new material...light-weight metal. But not only the choice of iron had resulted in high weight. We had built too heavy because we wanted a safe aircraft and partially because we had not extracted the optimum structural strength from the material\\". Unteroffizier Schade, after making the record Berlin-Dessau flight, would later lose his life in a crash, from entering a spin on 23 September 1916 in one of the J 2s, and this event, combined with the substandard climbing performance of the J 2 series of test aircraft, caused IdFlieg to withdraw any further governmental support (effectively ending the J 2's contract) for the Junkers firm's advanced monoplane designs until a lighter metal, such as duralumin, was selected for such designs. The first attempt to use duralumin for airframe construction by the Junkers firm was the never-completed J 3 mid-wing, rotary engine-powered, aluminum tubing fuselage single-seat monoplane design, of which only the corrugated sheet duralumin-covered wing structures and \\"bare\\" tubular fuselage framing, primarily as an engineering exercise, were finished shortly before the end of 1916. It is also thought that the contrasting promise of the advanced, low drag features of the Junkers monoplane aircraft designs, versus the Junkers firm's usage of experimental non-traditional sheet metal materials, and the firm's habit of almost constant experimentation obstructing any future hope of producing its advanced designs for the Luftstreitkr√§fte, compelled IdFlieg to create the Junkers-Fokker Aktiengesellschaft, abbreviated as Jfa and pronounced as if spelled \\"iefa\\" in German, on 20 October 1917, to allow Anthony Fokker, who even flew one of the J 2 aircraft in tests late in December 1916, to improve the future producibility of the advanced designs of the Junkers firm.

Her style continued to show his influence even when her subject matter changed from rustic to medieval romantic and biblical themes.While in France she met the Finnish painter Helene Schjerfbeck, in whose company she visited Pont-Aven in 1883.Victorian Art in Britain Stokes (in front), painted by Helene Schjerfbeck in 1881 Her first salon painting, Reflection, which had been painted in Brittany, was exhibited in 1885 at the Royal Academy. Her work was also shown at the Grosvenor Gallery, New Gallery, and the Society of British Artists and in 1885, a year after her marriage, she took to using the name 'Mrs. Adrian Stokes'. Together with her husband, she spent the summers of 1885 and 1886 at Skagen in the far north of Denmark where there was an artists' colony which became known as the Skagen Painters. There the couple struck up a close friendship with Michael and Anna Ancher.Magdalen Evans, \\"Stokes, (Charles) Adrian Scott\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 27 October 2013. In summer 1885 they also visited Ireland. Stokes exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Vilhelmine Bramsen, Beatrice Diderichsen and Marianne Stokes (front) in Skagen, by Peder Severin Kr√∏yer on 14 August 1886 She held a joint exhibition with her husband at the Fine Art Society in 1900.ArtMagick The Stokeses lived in St Ives where Marianne Stokes was a member of the Newlyn School. Having no children, they regularly travelled abroad, frequently to the Tyrol, and in 1905 to Hungary and the High Tatra. Here they spent about half a year sketching and painting in the villages of Va≈æec, Mengusovce and ≈Ωdiar. Adrian Stokes concentrated on landscapes, with images of hay-harvesting and picturesque cottages, while Marianne Stokes painted portraits showing the fine detail of the garments. These paintings provide a valuable record of the Slovak culture. After abandoning oils, and inspired by the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she painted flat compositions in tempera and gesso, her paintings giving the impression of being frescoes on plaster surfaces. She was an Associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. Stokes was included in the 2018 exhibit Women in Paris 1850-1900. Marianne Stokes died during 1927. Adrian Stokes died during 1935. Both were buried at Mortlake Roman Catholic Cemetery, London.

The BYC is a founding member of the Gulf Yachting Association, as well as the Mississippi Coast Yachting Association. Established in 1849, it is the fourth oldest yacht club in the United States. Club history While it was previously thought the Biloxi Yacht Club was established in 1888, additional research undertaken by the Club in 2000 revealed a much earlier date, at least 1849. From the Biloxi Yacht Club resolution: :The New Orleans papers discussed the Race of 1849 and subsequent races of the period, going into great detail about the Race of 1849, since the Biloxi Regatta Club, in a precursor to today's rivalry between Gulf of Mexico and Lake Pontchartrain racing circuits, was excluding from its regatta any boat that won two first place finishes, thus unfairly eliminating what the Lake folks thought were the leading boats of the time. :On August 8, 1849, the Race of 1849 was held by the Biloxi Regatta Club with Undine of Mobile, Alabama, owned by the Honorable J. W. Lescene, taking a first, and Mary Ann, owned by James & Co., taking a second, and Biloxi's own Flirt, owned by A. B. Cammack coming in third, so that by that date it is certain that what has become known in modern times as the Biloxi Yacht Club, was already in existence. The mid-19th century was remembered also as the organizational time for Gulf sailing activities. With many families along the coast owning yachts‚Äîa vessel with sails, emphasized a Down South magazine story in its May‚ÄìJune, 1976, issue ‚Äî a group of men met in Pass Christian in 1849 and formed the Southern Yacht Club Association. A clubhouse was erected that same year at West End on Lake Pontchartrain. Southern Yacht Club at once gave sailing the impetus it needed. Soon, members were sailing their yachts from New Orleans to Point Clear, Alabama, Eastern Shore Yacht Club, and also organized races between these points. As Biloxi was a thriving city midway between Mobile and New Orleans, its importance in yachting history was assured. The seafood cannery owners saw in the visitors' regattas a means of using their large fleets of schooners during the off season. Their fasted boats were finely tuned and raced, leading to a regular weekend schedule of races through the months of July and August. The following description of the clubhouse is from an early account found in a booklet given to the Biloxi Library by the late Jacinto Baltar, a prominent businessman, banker and civic leader.Baltar, Jacinto, booklet found in the Biloxi Library :The clubhouse is built on a foundation set in 10 feet of water directly opposite the Montross Hotel. A long pier connects the clubhouse with the shore. The building consists of four stories. On a level with the pier are the bathhouses and on either side of them are galleries with stairways leading down into the water. The second floor is reached by a stairway on the outside of the building, leading up directly from the end of the pier. Entering the hall, facing South, the reading room is on the left and the handsome ladies' parlors on the right. Directly behind these rooms and extending the full with of the building is the lounging room. The furniture is handsome in design and finish and lends an air of attractiveness to the apartment. The ladies' parlors are cozy laces, and are provided with every convenience. Behind the lounging room is a broad, long gallery, which accommodates 500 observers. From it one has a full view of the club's 15-mile course in the Mississippi Sound. The 3rd floor (when finished) will be devoted to billiard rooms and the 4th story, reached by a winding stair, is the observation tower. From it the Judges with the aid of glasses have a full sweep of the Sound and can easily follow the movements of the yachts. Biloxi Yacht Club, built 1916, destroyed by Hurricane Camille in 1969At last, there were serene years ahead for BYC. But it was only the calm before the storm. The eye of a hurricane passed over the club in 1915, leaving only splintered pilings and a reminder of the once-lavish yachting showplace. Again, in July 1916, a hurricane brushed the club, but the new edifice, built just east of the old clubhouse with similar lines, stood tall. Saved, for the most part, was BYC's $3,500 clubhouse investment! \\"The only loss,\\" Quave reported, \\"was loose lumber and tools amounting to $250\\". A charter member of the Southern Gulf Coast Yachting Association on April 28, 1901, along with Bay Waveland, Mobile, Southern and Pass Christian, BYC found itself cast in that role again in 1920. As competition increased first among neighboring and then more distant clubs, pressure built to organize for the purpose of scheduling regattas the breadth of the Gulf Coast. In 1920 the Gulf Yachting Association was born. It also was proposed that a boat be designed and adopted by each club for club competition in order for all to compete evenly. A gaff-rigged keel sloop was the result, designed by Commodore J. Rathbone deBuys of Southern Yacht Club and to be known as a \\"Fish Boat\\". The popular sloop remained the official competitive boat of the GYA until 1967 when high maintenance and replacement costs nudged member clubs into retiring the \\"Fish Class\\" in favor of a fiberglass equivalent. Eventually, after much heated debate between Fish Class sentimentalists and those proffering what they claimed was a more practical solution, the Flying Scot was accepted as the new GYA standard bearer. It was not until 1969, however, that Biloxians would fully appreciate a hurricane. That was the year the BYC elected to renovate the now aging facility. The story could not be told more eloquently that by the historian Murfee in her Lee Sheet column: :This is the picture of the Biloxi Yacht Club that was indelibly etched in the minds of most of the members of the old yacht club -- this building, indestructible, standing tall and undaunted after the hurricane of 1947, surrounded on all sides by the rubble of buildings that once were neighbors. It had stood the test of time, having been rebuilt after the storm of 1915 and having weathered all that Nature had flung her way since that time. It is small wonder that a group of energetic members were continuing their work remodeling the upper floor of the clubhouse for a gala opening that would feature and art exhibit and a fashion show in a large room suitable for meetings and other events while a storm, named Camille, was flirting along a path to the coast but until the last minute seemed to be headed for Panama City, Florida, that fateful day in August, 1969. A different picture awaited the members on that grim morning after. The old familiar landmark was now gone forever. But the Biloxi Yacht Club would come back to life. Biloxi Yacht Club, acquired 1972, destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005All the while the club stalwarts were considering their options, looking into all possibilities, and in time the El Capitan Lounge, swimming pool and marina of the Trade Winds Hotel became available. With some trepidation and much discussion, pro and con, the Biloxi Yacht Club, with an SBA 3% loan of $239,000 had a new home. Biloxi Yacht Club, designed by Architect Walter \\"Buzzy\\" Bolton In its colorful 100-odd year history BYC has had to make many decisions. None, however, caught the community more by surprise that the action taken by the board the year of Franklin Roosevelt's visit. In their pictorial history of \\"Biloxi and the Mississippi Gulf Coast,\\" Colleen and Joe Scholtes report that after due deliberations the board, \\"banned the turkey trot and other newfangled dances in favor of the two-step and waltz.\\"Shaughnessy, Jr., Clark D. - 1988, Compiled from periodicals, personal records and recollections In August, 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the organizations clubhouse. A prominent local architect and long time club member Walter \\"Buzzy\\" Bolton, started the design of the new Biloxi Yacht Club and construction began in 2007.

Perhaps that was because of their fiercely independent nature. \\"Biloxi fishermen neither know nor care anything about rules,\\" Gerald Taylor White, famous for his America's Cup coverage, wrote in the 1926 The Rudder. \\"If a boat is in your way, you sail over her or through her at your own discretion.\\" However, he added quickly, \\"For seamanship and snappy sail handling, we enter the Biloxi fishermen for world honors.\\" For 17 years BYC participated in what must have seemed an exercise in futility. Through 1936, seven clubs had figured in the win column, Pensacola, captor of the inaugural in 1920, sailing off with six Sir Thomas Jr. Lipton Interclub Challenge Series Victories. Other champions were Sarasota in 1930, 1931 and 1932, Eastern Shore, 1921, Southern Yacht Club, 1925, Mobile, 1928, and Buccaneer, 1934. In 1922 and again in 1927, Southern and Pensacola tied, and Eastern Shore and St. Petersburg wound up all even in 1926. BYC's Junior Program, meanwhile enjoyed only brief period in the sun. After Southern's victories in the first two Junior Lipton Interclub Challenge Regattas, and a World War II-imposed four-year Series lapse, BYC's youngsters stormed back to capture the Lipton Cup in 1947, 1948 and 1949. BYC's most notable team sailing achievement, it could be argued, came in an event to encourage the sport among women. In 1938, Commodore Bernie Knost of Pass Christian Yacht Club offered an elaborate trophy to the winner of an all-girl three-race interclub series hosted by his organization. The event was an immediate hit and has remained a highlight among Gulf sailing activities. With its large number of Skipperettes to draw from, most notable Joyce Fountain Wiltz, Janet Ferson Green, Beatrice Kennedy and Emily Joullian Dale, BYC over the years has compiled the second best record, winning the Knost nine times. Only Pass, with 11 victories, has done better. In addition to her Knost heroics, Joyce in 1949 became the first girl in the history of BYC to earn a skipper's position on the club's Lipton team. The BYC also hosted several PHRF (Performance Handicapped Racing Fleet) events. The BYC was host to the GYA's Gulf Ocean Racing Series during the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the GCYA (Gulf Coast Yachting Association) Round the Sound Series, which started at the Singing River Yacht Club (Pascagoula, MS) traveled to the Gulfport Yacht Club, and ended at the Biloxi Yacht Club. This series was transformed into the Biloxi Summer Series. The club also hosted a Leukemia Cup and the GYA Offshore Race in 2002.Robbie Schmidt Off the race course, BYC also has an impressive record.

It features the Tenth Doctor without a companion and was released on 2 April 2009, alongside Judgement of the Judoon and The Slitheen Excursion. Plot The TARDIS arrives on the planet Hurala. Whilst investigating the deserted site the Doctor makes his way to the base's computer data core room, where he is locked inside by the computer along with the corpse of another person previously trapped inside. Five days later, the bounty hunter ship Wayfarer lands on the planet, its crew hoping to use the fuel stores to refuel the ship. They soon come across the TARDIS, and then hear a repeating tapping noise. One of them, called Scrum, realises that it's a Morse code SOS message. They quickly trace it to the computer data core room where they find and free the Doctor, who has been sending it out with a spoon. On the insistence of the Doctor and another of the bounty hunters, Stella, the group investigate the computer's systems. They discover an override which, when activated, took control of the base and trapped the Doctor. Someone had used the computer to set a trap. Who did is soon answered when the group are attacked by a Dalek patrol. The Doctor and the bounty hunters, who now reveal that they kill Daleks for a living, race back to the Wayfarer, escape to the TARDIS being blocked by Daleks. They manage to take off but the Daleks blow up a refuelling pump, sending debris flying into the ship through the open landing ramp, badly wounding Stella. As the crew attempt to put her into cryo- freeze a Dalek manages to get into the ship through an air-lock, and exterminates Stella. Before it can kill anyone else the Doctor freezes it using the emergency cryo-charge intended for Stella. With the Dalek immobilised Stella's body is also frozen and the crew make a course for Auros, Stella's home world. On the way, the Dalek's eye stalk is removed so that the crew can claim the prize-money for killing it, and it is placed in the cargo hold. Whilst talking with the crew the Doctor realises that he's travelled back along the time line to before the Time War. At this point in history the Daleks are locked in a huge galactic war with Earth's first empire, at a moment when victory can go either way. The Doctor also learns more about the crew. Commanding the ship is Bowman, a former Earth trooper who has been fighting the Daleks for years and is a veteran of the Draconian Wars. Scrum is the crew's technician, Cuttin' Edge is a former Space Marine who was dishonorably discharged and Stella was the ship's Medic. The other crew member, Koral, is a humanoid alien whose planet and people of Red Sky Lost were destroyed by the Daleks. Upon arriving at Auros the Doctor and the crew discover that the planet's population are abandoning the planet as the Daleks are preparing to invade. Using the Osterhagen Principle, they detonate a series of nuclear bombs and destroy the planet to prevent it falling to the Daleks. The Doctor and Bowman realise that the Daleks will now ambush the retreating convoy. They try to warn them but before they can the Daleks arrive, forcing the convoy to surrender and destroying its flagship as a warning to the other ships. Furious at the loss of Stella and her home world, the crew of the Wayfarer decide to interrogate the captured Dalek. With the Doctor's reluctant help they disarm it, and then Koral uses its claws to open the casing. They then remove the creature inside and torture it, despite the Doctor's protests. Eventually they give up when the Dalek tells them nothing. After they've left the cargo hold, however, the Doctor returns and reveals to the dying Dalek who he is. The Dalek, amongst its predictable ranting, lets slip that the Daleks plan to 'eliminate all humanity from its very beginnings!' Eventually the Dalek dies, and the Doctor works out what it meant. He reveals to the crew that the Daleks must be looking for the Arkheon Threshold, a schism in time and space which, if opened, will give the Daleks access to the Time Vortex. Deciding that the Doctor is telling the truth, Bowman orders the crew to head for the remains of the planet Arkheon, which had been destroyed at the start of the war. When they arrive they find that the planet has been split in two, with the surviving half still retaining a breathable atmosphere. The Wayfarer lands and the Doctor and the crew disembark. Whilst looking round the devastated landscape they encounter dozens of mutated Arkheonites, devolved by the radiation fallout. They chase the crew to the very edge of the planet, where they are captured by Daleks. After destroying their weapons the Daleks force the Doctor and the crew onto a lift, which descends down the side of the planet towards they core. Here the Doctor discovers that the Daleks, far from searching for Arkheon, have been on the planet for years. They have constructed a huge underground base where thousands of human prisoners from Auros are mining the core, looking for the Threshold. The base also contains experimentation labs, and the largest Dalek Prison outside of Skaro. The Doctor and the crew are taken into the base where they are scanned for 'suitability'. Scrum is found to be of marginal use. Cuttin' Edge and Koral are both sentenced to work in the mines. When Bowman is scanned it is discovered that he is in fact 'Space Major Jon Bowman', the designer of Earth's defence system and high on the Dalek's list of wanted people, causing the commander to be alerted. Upon being told by the Command Dalek that Bowman will be taken for brain excoriation, which will kill him, Koral, who is secretly in love with Bowman, lashes out at the nearest Dalek. In retaliation the Daleks kill Scrum, the weakest member of the group. As the Daleks prepare to take Bowman away the Doctor stops them and whispers something to the Command Dalek. The Command Dalek, suddenly terrified, orders two of its minions to scan the Doctor. They immediately identity him and prepare to exterminate him. The Doctor persuades them to interrogate him first, however. News of the Doctor's capture is sent to the Supreme Dalek on Skaro, who sends the Primary Intelligence Unit, led by the Dalek Inquisitor General, to interrogate the Doctor. Cuttin' Edge and Koral are sent to work in the mines, replacing a group that is exterminated for being too slow. The Doctor is placed in the same cell as Bowman, who reveals to him that the Dalek Inquisitor General, called 'Dalek X' by the Earth authorities, is second in command to the Supreme Dalek and is described as being 'the Devil in Dalek form'. Dalek X accepts his Earth designation to cause fear. Dalek X arrives at Arkeon aboard the Exterminator, the Dalek Empire's most advanced ship, containing 500 Daleks and accompanied by a small fleet of Dalek saucers. Upon arrival Dalek X takes over command of the base, and exterminates one of its mining Daleks for failing to meet its target. He then orders that every hour the weakest group of workers will be exterminated. Soon after the Doctor is brought to the interrogation room, where Dalek X measures the Doctor's capacity for physical pain using a mind probe, simply out of curiosity. Dalek X reveals he gave the order to destroy the Auros Ship. After an unknown length of time in pain the Doctor is released from the mind probe, and shown around the base by Dalek X. Meanwhile, the Wayfarer is destroyed, and Bowman is taken to have his brain removed. Dalek X reveals to the Doctor that once the planetary core has been extracted, the Daleks will locate the Threshold using a Large Chronon Collider. They will then open it, access the time vortex and defeat the Time Lords. There is a chance that the collider won't work properly, however. To ensure success the Daleks need a control element; the Doctor's TARDIS. The Doctor refuse to co-operate, but the Daleks threaten to exterminate a woman and her daughter from Cuttin' Edge's and Koral's work force if he doesn't comply. Eventually, the Doctor agrees to help, but under the condition that Cuttin' Edge, Koral and Bowman come with them to help him operate the TARDIS. The Daleks agree and Bowman is released, just before he is about to be killed. The Doctor tries to have the Woman and her daughter taken as well, but the Daleks refuse. The Exterminator and its escort fleet head for Hurala, with the Doctor, the surviving Wayfarer crew members and the Dalek Temporal Research Team on board. When they reach the TARDIS the Doctor claims to have lost the Key, saying it is in the room he was locked up in at the Dalek Base. As they head for it, Cuttin' Edge recognises the identification symbol on one of the Daleks. It is the same one that killed Scrum. He lashes out at it, knocking it down the steps, and is exterminated by Dalek X, though he pulls another Dalek into the ray, destroying it. The Doctor, Koral and Bowman use the distraction to escape into a maintenance duct. After escaping the Doctor reveals his plan. There is still enough astronic energy fuel on the planet to cause a huge explosion. If they can detonate it they can destroy Dalek X, the Temporal Research Team and the orbiting Dalek fleet. They make their way to a silo that still contains fuel, and the Doctor starts to rig it to explode. Dalek X, enraged by the Doctor's escape, catches up with them and prepares to exterminate the Doctor. Dalek X is attacked by Koral and Bowman, who eventually disable it and push it over the edge of the gantry they are standing on. The Doctor is nearly finished, but realises that he can't stop the safety override by remote control. Someone will have to stay behind and hold the manual override lever down until the silo reaches critical. Bowman volunteers to stay behind, refusing to leave despite protests from Koral. Eventually he knocks out the protesting Koral so that the Doctor can take her back to the TARDIS and safety. The Doctor and Koral make it into the TARDIS just as the Daleks arrive. In the silo Bowman holds the lever down as the Daleks approach, and as the whole base beings to shake the Daleks retreat. Finally the silo reaches critical mass and Bowman prepares to face death. He is saved at the last second by the Doctor, however, who materialises the TARDIS on the gantry. Bowman leaps into the TARDIS just as the Command Dalek tries to exterminate him. A second later the silo explodes, killing every Dalek on Hurala, as well as destroying the Exterminator and its escort fleet. Back on Earth Bowman and Koral report to the Earth authorities. They learn that the Dalek fleet is in complete disarray thanks to them, and a task force is preparing to attack the Dalek base on Arkheon and release the prisoners. The Doctor leaves as Bowman and Koral prepare to go and meet Bowman's parents. The Doctor travels to Hurala, which has been sealed off for 5,000 years due to radiation fallout. There he finds Dalek X, badly damaged but still alive at the bottom of a pit. The Doctor informs it that Arkeon has been taken by the Earth forces, the Daleks are in full retreat on all fronts and that he has sealed off the Threshold. The radiation will help Dalek X keep alive, but by the time the Quarantine is over Dalek X will be dead. Regardless of the Doctor's revelations, Dalek X rants that the Daleks are never defeated. The Doctor replies that the Daleks are always defeated, because they can never accept that every other form of life in the Universe is better than the Daleks. To prove this the Doctor points out that there is no form of life in the Universe that would volunteer to be a Dalek. As the Doctor prepares to leave Dalek X vows to hunt him down. The Doctor responds by simply stating that he'll be waiting. The Doctor then finally departs Hurala, leaving Dalek X trapped on the planet, alone.

He first established it as a private school for religious training in 1910 but adapted it as a school for teachers. He had a network of private supporters, including northern white philanthropists such as Olivia Slocum Sage of New York. He was the school's first president and remained its leader for nearly 40 years. By 1923, he secured state funding for it as a normal school, to continue the training of black teachers. After programs and classes were added to create a four-year curriculum, in 1925 it was renamed North Carolina College for Negroes, becoming the first liberal arts college in the nation for black students to be state-funded. Note: The state-supported Virginia State College, which had a 4-year curriculum by 1923, was founded as a land-grant school, rather than a liberal arts college. Personal life and family Shepard was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, the son of Rev. Augustus and Harriet Whitted Shepard. He received undergraduate and professional training at Shaw University, graduating in 1894. The following year, he married Annie Day Robinson. They had three daughters: Marjorie A. Shepard (1896-1992) of Durham and Annie Day Shepard Smith (1899-1977) of New Bern, North Carolina and Marion (1902-1903). Smith had two daughters, Annie Day Smith Donaldson and Carolyn Marie Smith Green; both daughters had children, and Green has grandchildren. Career Shepard settled in the Hayti District, becoming one of the founders of development. He worked as a pharmacist in the community, and later as a civil servant, and religious educator. He became president of the school he founded, one originally intended to train clergy. North Carolina Central University Shepard in the early twentieth century Shepard founded the private National Religious Training School and Chautauqua in the Hayti District in 1910. Originally, this institution was conceived as a center for religious training. Later, he renamed it the National Training School; it was supported by the philanthropy of Shepard's numerous black and white friends in both the North and the South. These included Olivia Slocum Sage of New York. The school provided professional development for black teachers of the Jim Crow era; education was considered a high calling in the black community in the drive for everyone to become literate. Teachers from the school taught in rural Durham County., North Carolina Collection, Durham County Library - \\"The Women Who Ran the Schools.\\" Shepard faced great difficulties in securing sufficient funding to keep the private school operating. He dealt with some of the issues of the Jim Crow era in his own way. At Christmas, white Durham merchants would bring selections of products to Shepard's office so that he could avoid \\"the possibility of dealing with rudeness downtown.\\" He continued to lobby the North Carolina General Assembly for support of the \\"North Carolina College for Negroes.\\" When going to the legislature, Shepard traveled by car in order to avoid the train, which had segregated seating according to the Jim Crow rules. When the North Carolina legislature approved state funding in 1923, the institution's name was changed to Durham State Normal School. In 1925, the program was expanded to a four-year curriculum, and the institution became North Carolina College for Negroes, the first state-supported liberal arts college for black people in North Carolina and in the United States. Its first four-year college class graduated in 1929. In 1947, the name became North Carolina College at Durham. The 1969 General Assembly established the institution as one of the State's regional universities, and the name was changed to North Carolina Central University.

History The diocese of Tuticorin comprises the major part of the Tuticorin district, nearly half of the Nellai district and a small portion of the Kanyakumari district. The Catholics of this area trace their origin to the time of St. Francis Xavier who spent most of his missionary life in this area. Separated from the diocese of Tiruchirapalli, Tuticorin was created as a diocese and entrusted to the diocesan clergy in 1923 by the Apostolic Brief \\"Quae Catholico Nomini\\" of Pope Pius XI. It was entrusted to the indigenous clergy with Rt. Rev. Francis Tiburtius Roche s.j., as its first Bishop. He was also the first Indian Bishop of the Latin Rite. The partons of our diocese are St. Francis Xavier and St. Teresa of Child Jesus. Early Ages of Faith Thoothukudi, also called Tuticorin in English, is a Port City in South India and a metropolitan city in Tamil Nadu. It had once been a beautiful pearl-fishery town. The Portuguese conquests in India commenced after the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. In accordance with the padroado granted to the Portuguese kings in 1455 by Pope Nicholas V, missionaries of the different orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuit, Augustinians, etc.) came with the conquerors, from the year 1500, and began to build churches along the western coastal districts in India . Padroado is a combination of the rights, privileges and duties, granted by the Papacy to the Crown of Portugal, as patron of the Roman Catholic missions and ecclesiastical establishments in the regions of Africa and East Indies . In the first quarter of the 16 th century the pearl fishery coast (where Tuticorin is situated) stretching between Kanyakumari and Mannar (Rameswaram) was controlled by two powers. The king of Travancore controlled the southern half of the territory and the northern half was possessed by the Nayaks of Madurai. However, in 1516 a Muslim virtually became the master of the coast. The misery and humiliation of the people escalated beyond remedy, when one of his men tore the ring off the ear of a member of the community, tearing the earlobe at the same time. In their struggle (known as the war of the ear) against the armed forces that burnt their villages, the people asked for Portuguese protection. The fleet of the Portuguese came with some priests, and about 20000 people were baptized. As the priests left, the newly baptized were left without any spiritual guidance. St. Francis Xavier in Pearl City St. Francis Xavier landed at Goa in the month of May, in 1542. After about six months he with two young ecclesiastics who knew Tamil, came to the pearl fishery coast. In his letter to St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1543, St. Francis Xavier himself describes his activities in this area. ‚Äúthey only replied that they were Christians, but that as they are ignorant of Portuguese, they know nothing of the precepts and mysteries of our holy religion. We could not understand one another, as I spoke Castilian and they Malabar; so I picked out the most intelligent and well-read of them ... translated the Catechism into the Malabar tongue. This I learnt by heart, and then I began to go through all the villages of the coast, calling around me by the sound of a bell as many as I could, children and men ... taught them the Christian doctrine ... I kept telling them to go on teaching in their turn whatever they had learnt to their parents, family, and neighbors. ...it often happens to me to be hardly able to use my hands from the fatigue of baptizing: often in a single day I have baptized whole villages. Sometimes I have lost my voice and strength altogether with repeating again and again the Credo and the other forms. ... Fifteen months later, toward the close of the year 1543, Francis was obliged to return to Goa to procure assistants. The seminary of the faith which had been founded there for the education of young Indians, was committed to his care and put into the hands of the Society of Jesus. The following year he returned with a supply of evangelical laborers, Indians as well as Europeans, whom he stationed in different towns. In 1544 St. Stephen church was built in Kombuthurai. It is surprising to know that in the same year two seminarians from Tuticorin were ordained to priesthood by the Bishop of Goa. Xavier himself visited kanakankudiyiruppu (Manal Matha Koil), Sankanankulam near Anaikarai, Rammathaupuram and pazhaiyakayal. Conversion took place in these places and later other Jesuit missionaries served them. Francis left the Fishery Coast in 1545 for Malacca. In March 1546 he ordered Fr. Antony Criminal!i to go to the Fishery Coast . Fr. Criminalli was the first missionary who learned to read and write Tamil. One year later he was joined by Fr.Anrrique Anrriquez and others. In January - February 1548, Francis was back again on the Fishery Coast for a visit. He appointed Fr. Criminalli as superior of the mission. When Fr. Criminalli was killed towards the middle of 1549 in a military entanglement between the Badaga troops and the Portuguese at Vedalai, the missionaries elected Fr. Anrrique Anrriquez as their superior. Francis confirmed their choice by letter. Areas of Camp *In Punnaikayal: The Jesuit headquarters was set up in Punnaikayal. Anriquez as he describes in his letter to St. Ignatius Loyola, learned Tamil and even brought out a sort of Grammar which he called as ‚ÄúArte‚Äù. He, with the help of native converts and ‚Äútrained catechists‚Äú translated the important prayers into Tamil. For the first time, the converts made the sacrament of penance only in 1549, as the priests could not understand Tamil earlier. As was the case with Francis Xavier, Anriquez too laid special stress on the Christian training of the young. He taught the prayers to the girls in the mornings and to the boys in the evenings. It seems that till his arrival on the coast the girls were not attending the catechism classes. The boys used to go twice a day. But now that system was changed. The girls were asked to go in the mornings and the boys in the evenings. In every Christian village on the coast there was now a teacher of catechism and a person to gather the children every day. In 1550 a hospital and Catechetical Training Center were built for the first time in Punnaikayal. He converted a certain Peter Louis who had been a famous Hindu Sanyasin. He would shortly become the professor of the Tamil college at Punnaikayal in 1557. After his conversion, peter Louis began to convert many people in and around that area. By 1551, there are references to the existence of 30 churches made of clay and wood, and covered with palm leaves. In 1553, the churches were destroyed by the king of Travancore and eventually the rebuilding took place. In 1557 Cochin was established into a diocese. The pearl fishery coast became part of this new diocese. When a non-Jesuit became the Bishop of Cochin, priests from his own order were sent to this area, challenging the monopoly enjoyed by the Jesuits missionary thus for. This problem can be seen in a more detailed manner under the topic ‚ÄúGoa Mission and French Mission‚Äù. The first parishes in the costal region according to the report of 1644 were Perumanal, Periathalai, Manapad, Alanthalai, Veerapandian Patnam, Punnaikayal, Pazhaiyakayal, Tuticorin, Vaipar, Vembar and Periapatnam. Christian population was 50000 and 7 hospitals were there. Fr. Anriquez died at Punnaikayaland and buried in Tuticorin. In the costal region Perumanal, Idindakarai, Uvari, Thalampuli, Kombuthurai, Punnaikayal, Tuticorin, Vaipar, Vembar, Mukkur, and periapatnam. By 1567, the first Tamil College was instituted in Punnaikayal. The convert Peter Louis began to teach in the college. In 1568 Fr. Anriquez wrote a letter to St. Ignatius of Loyola from Punnaikayal. He mentions about 7 priests, 2 deacons and one Tamil Brother in his team. Through this letter we come to know the ancient custom of allowing religious brothers and even devout native converts to perform marriage rite. It was abolished by the council of Trend. He also discusses the burden of the converts to pay tithes to the rulers, although they themselves took care of the priests financially well. The first Tamil Printing press was set up at Punnaikayal in 1579. The Tamil Types had been made by Fr. Joam de Faria. Fr. Anriquez himself composed the following books in Tamil: Thampiramr vaNakkarn, Kiriiciththiyaani valvakkam, Confessionario (in Tamil: Kompeciyoonaayaru), and the Flos Sanctorum in Tamil, whose title has not come down to us, though we have the whole book. *In Marichukkatti: The fruits of the missionary work by the team headed by Fr. Anriquez were the growing Catholic community and the churches built by them. Fr. Anriquez with other Jesuits, baptized people of Azhagappapuram or Marichukkatti in 1561. According to the Jesuit report in 1571 there were churches in Azhagappapuram or Marichukkatti, Srivaikundam, Thirukalur, Kalakadu, Vadakangulam, Azhagapapuram, Auaikarai (Isalapuram), Kallikulam (Theraikulam) and in the vicinity of Sathankulam. The church of St. James at Srivaikundam and that of St. Matthew the Apostle at Thirukalur were erected in 1600. As Thirukalur was then the biggest Christian village in the interior, naturally it became the first parish in the interior of the present Diocese of Tuticorin and Srivaikundam and other villages were all attached to Thirukalur as its substations. *In Tuticorin: Facing continuous threats from Madurai Nayaks, the headquarters of the Jesuits were transferred from Punnaikayal to Tuticorin in 1579. A small church of our Lady of Mercy was built adjacent to their dwelling place. This church would in time become the present shrine of our Lady of Snows. In fact, even before St. Xavier came to India, in Tuticorin, there had been St. Peter's Church built in 1538. This is the very first church of the whole of the pearl fishery coast. In 1558 the first Latin rite seminary was built in Tuticorin where seminarians were trained in morals, pastoral activities, Portuguese and music. In 1593 the first Catechumen Center was instituted in Tuticorin, managed by a Jesuit priest. Training was given to the catechumens for one full year. *Other Important Places In 1600 there were churches in Palayam (Tirunelveli), kaliavoor, Srivaikundam and Thirukalur. St. Matthew's church in Thirukalur with 500 members was made into a parish in 1644. The substations were Alvarthirunagari, Saravamangalam, Marichukkatti, Srivaigundam, Manakarai (Seevalaperi) Vayapuram (Kaliavoor), Palayam (Palayamkottai) Kayatharu, Pattamadai, Veeravanallur, Sattuppatur (Kartharpillayur), Mannarkoil, Ayanarpatti (Aranapatti), Singanallur, Alari, Chrisvanallur (Krishnapuram), Meenkulam, Maravanakurichi (Maravakurichi), Kalakadu, Athur, Kurumbur, Perur. In 1601 Holy Cross church was built in Vember followed by Bartholomew's church in Manakadu near Srivaikundam in 1602. In 1603 kings of the areas destroyed most of these churches including the church of Our Lady of Mercy in Tuticorin. There is indication about a Jesuit professor from Goa, who worked in about 20 villages in and around Thirukalur in 1621. He converted a lot of people to the faith. In 1685 Arulanandar built a church in Vadakankulam. Lot of conversion took place in this area in the late 1600s. Priests like Bernard de Souza, Gregory Antoin, Martin, Moses, Putheri, Denis Couchan, Nicholas and Causanal brought about conversion in places like Vadakankulam, Satankulam, Anaikarai and Azhagappapuram. In 1752 Fr. Putheri built the church of the Holy Family in Vadakankulam. It was in Vadakankulam that martyr Devasagayampillai was baptised in 1745. The first seminary of the diocese was in Vadakankulam as early as 1938. In 1778 Kooduthalai parish had six substations. One of them was Uvari. Possibly the shrine of St. Antony was built by the Franciscans who served in Kooduthalai. In 1861 Satankulam parish was instituted. In 1846, 45 Protestant families from Atikadu became Catholics. The same event occurred in 1846 at Mudalur. 400 Protestants from Kadachapuram became Catholics in 1887. Protestants from Pudur, Kulasekaranpatnam, Kadachapuram and Arumuganeri became Catholics as well. In 1896 at Satankulam, church of the immaculate heart of our lady was consecrated by the Bishop of Tiruchirapalli. Conversion in koodankulam occurred in 1866. Church of St. Anne was built in 1887. Between 1700 and 1740 people of Azhagappapuram embraced the Catholic faith. In 1908 Fr. Causanal renewed St. Antony‚Äôs church. In 1798 there was a thatched church in Kallikulam. It was renewed in 1838. In 1884 the new church of Our Lady of Snows was consecrated. In the 1900s thanks to the tireless missionary work of the Jesuit priests people of Kannankulam, Rajakrishnapuram, Kavalkinrau, Panagudi, Chokankudiyiruppu, Pragasapuram became Christians. Goa Mission and French Mission In the middle of the 16 th century, with the pardurao, the Portuguese established missions along the west and the southern coast of India . They established four dioceses namely Goa, Cochin, Cranganore and Mylapore. In 1557 when Cochin became a diocese, the pearl fishery coast came under its authority. Whenever Bishops other than the Jesuits took charge of the diocese, they used to send their own priests to the Pearl Fishery Coast. In 1603 the madurai Nayak and Kayatar king imposed an unbearable tax on the people of the pearl fishery coast. The people could not pay the tax and hence they rebelled. The army destroyed the dwellings as well as the headquarters in Tuticorin. Seeking a safe haven, the people and the priests took shelter in Raja Theevu (Muyal theevu). The Bishop of Cochin misunderstood the whole event and sent the Portuguese to violently force the 10,000 people out of the island. Broken hearted the Jesuits gave the parishes to the Bishop and left Tuticorin. The Bishop sent the Cyrian priests to Tuticorin, Vembar, Vaipar, and Palaiyakayal. The rest of the parishes were left without any spiritual help. In 1621 King Philip of Portugal ordered the Bishop of Cochin to give back the parishes to the Jesuits. But, in protest the Bishop resigned. The Jesuits once again took charge. In 1759 the King of Portugal banned the Jesuits from working in the areas of his governance. Some Jesuits were exiled and others went underground. The Bishop of Cochin sent some Franciscan and Cyrian priests. With the worldwide suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the Jesuit priests left the parishes. Meanwhile, the pearl fishery coast was captured and dominated by the Dutch. Hence, the Portugal King could not exercise the Padroado in the Pearl Fishery Coast. To solve this problem, the propaganda of Rome entrusted the mission to the Propagation of Paris. As they had not enough priests, Goan and Cyrian priests from Goa, Cochin, Cranganore and Mylapore diocesan priests served in the parishes. In 1814 the Society of Jesus was reestablished. In 1838 Pope Gregory XVI suppressed the Bishoprics of Cranganore, Cochin and Mylapore and put them under the control of the Propaganda of France. It deprived the Padroado clergy of all jurisdiction held by them so far. Hence, four Jesuit priests from Toulouse diocese in France were sent to work in the Pearl Fishery Coast. This came to be called as the French Mission. The four Jesuit priests tried to get back the parishes from the Goan and Cyrian priests which caused riots and confusion in spiritual governance. Two factions namely ‚ÄúGoa Mission‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrench Mission‚Äù came about. Based on this division, small churches, and chapels were established in various parishes. For instance, Holy Spirit church in Manapad, St. Michael church in Punnaikayal, St. Ignatius church in Tuticorin found in support of the ‚ÄúGoa Mission‚Äù. St. Joseph church in Koothenkuli and Our Lady of Sorrows in KeelaVaipar were set up in support of the ‚ÄúFrench Mission‚Äù. In view of solving this problem, pope Leo XIII in 1886, made a concordat with the Portugal government, and put the dioceses of Goa and Mylapore under Padroado. The Pearl Fishery Coast came under the jurisdiction of the newly established diocese of Tiruchirapalli. But, five parishes had to be given to the Padroado Mylapore diocese. They were Our Lady of Snows in Tuticorin, St. Michael church at Punnaikayal, Assumption church at Vaipar, Holy Spirit church in Manapad, and St. Mary church in Kooduthalai. Priests from Goa Mission were appointed as parish priests. Even after the establishment of Tuticorin diocese these parishes were under Mylapore diocese until 1930. Origin of Tuticorin Diocese Separated from the diocese of Tiruchirapalli, Tuticorin was created as a diocese and entrusted to the diocesan clergy in 1923 by the Apostolic Brief \\"Quae CatholicoNomini\\" of Pope Pius XI. It was entrusted to the indigenous clergy with Rt. Rev. Francis Tiburtius Roche, sj, as its first Bishop. He was also the first Indian Bishop of the Latin Rite.. Saint Francis Xavier and Saint Theresa of Child Jesus were held as the patron saints of the diocese. On April 4, 1930 the five parishes of Kooduthalai, Manapad, (Holy Ghost Church), Punnaikayal, Tuticorin (Our Lady of Snows Church) and Vaippar which were till then under the Padroado, were amalgamated into the diocese by virtue of the Papal Bull \\"Quae ad Spirituale\\" of Pope Pius XI. The diocese had 18 parishes, 23 priests and 70000 faithful. The Cathedral was built by a Jesuit named Piccinelli. In 1849 it was consecrated by the then Bishop of the Madurai Apostolic diocese. Bishop Thomas Fernando was consecrated as the Second Bishop of Tuticorin on 7 October 1950. In January 1971, Bishop Thomas Fernando was transferred to the Diocese of Tiruchy. On 9th December1971 Bishop M. Ambrose was consecrated as the third Bishop and he also was transferred to the Diocese of Coimbatore. On 4 February 1981 Bishop S.T. Amalnather was consecrated as the fourth Bishop of Tuticorin. After his retirement on 8 December 1999, Bishop Peter Fernando who was consecrated as the Co-adjutor on 29 May 1996 took charge of the diocese, as the fifth Bishop of Tuticorin. Then due to his promotion as the Archbishop of Madurai on 22 March 2003, the See was vacant for about two years during which period Archbishop Peter Fernando remained the Apostolic Administrator of the diocese. On 18 May 2005 Bishop Yvon Ambroise, the present Bishop, was consecrated as the sixth Bishop of Tuticorin and has been guiding his flock. There are 110 parishes and about 4,18,000 Catholics in this Diocese.

The Welsh coal strike of 1898 was an industrial dispute involving the colliers of South Wales and Monmouthshire. The strike began as an attempt by the colliers to remove the sliding scale, which determined their wage based on the price of coal. The strike quickly turned into a disastrous lockout which would last for six months and result in a failure for the colliers as the sliding scale stayed in place.Davies (2008), pg 827. The strike is seen as an important landmark in Welsh history as it saw the true adoption of trade unionism in the southern coalfield which had been slow to take hold before then. The South Wales Miners' Federation was the largest trade union to have originated from this dispute. Reasons for the action Towards the end of 1897 relations between south Wales colliers, led by Liberal MP William 'Mabon' Abraham and the coalowners had become strained. Apart from the obvious wealth of the coalowners, the miners were also unhappy about a system used to determine wages called the sliding scale. The sliding scale was a system whereby the collier's salary was based not only on how much coal they could mine but on the price the coal fetched at market. The miners argued that the scale could be abused by traders and did not prevent cut-throat competition; also there was no minimum to the scale. This led to many miners facing financial difficulties and in September 1897 the miners gave six months' notice to terminate the scale. The coalowners retaliated with what they described as, precautionary measures, to terminate contracts which would come into effect at the same time as the colliers' ultimatum.Western Mail (1898), pg 3. Attempts to resolve the strike Sir Edward Fry, who acted as arbitrator. Before the deadline for both actions passed in March 1898, negotiations began to prevent any action. The negotiations were still underway with the deadline of March 31 looming, so both parties agreed to extend talks until April 9. The discussions broke down before the deadline as the colliers refused the options being presented to them, and they walked out of the pits en masse. The miners' demands had been a minimum price per coal of 10 shillings a ton, a sliding scale of 10% not the 8.75% in operation, plus an immediate advance of 10%. The coalowners' compromise had been below those requested on all three demands. In course of time, the miners shifted their position to the removal of the sliding scale completely but still demanded the 10% advance. The Board of Trade appointed Sir Edward Fry to act as a conciliator, much to the approval of the colliers, but the employers refused to meet with him. Through the endeavours of Sir Edward, the colliers eventually agreed to a reduction on demands in return for the creation of a neutral Concilliation Board to fix wages if coal prices fell below a specified level. The coalowners showed interest in these options but before options were discussed, the colliers' representatives re-introduced demands and negotiations were broken. After a second failed attempt, Sir Edward returned to the Board of Trade describing the owners as obstinate and the workers as leaderless.Western Mail (1898), pg 4. Outcome of the action By August the colliers had decided to push on the single issue of retaining the sliding scale, but with a minimum level. In the end the colliers accepted an immediate advance of 5 percent and a guarantee from the coalowners that if wages fell below 12¬Ω percent above the 1879 standard, then the men could give 6 months notice to terminate the scale. It also saw the end of Mabon's day, the first Monday of the month holiday previously awarded to the miners. The strike officially ended on 1 September 1898. The lack of organisation and vision apparent form the colliers' leaders was addressed by the foundation of the South Wales Miners' Federation, or 'the Fed'.Davies (2008), pg 561. Abraham would take the presidency of the organisation and William Brace the vice president. After such a long strike without pay, the levels of militancy within the south Wales coalfields rose and men began joining trade unions on a level not before seen in the area.

It is known for its view of Porongorup and the Stirling ranges. It is south east of Perth and north of Mount Barker. The Great Southern Railway (established 1889) passes through the town, being one of the original stations on the line. At the 2006 census, Kendenup had a population of 1,290. The town was once the centre of a vast sheep station, and was, in the early years of the Western Australian colony, one of the largest farming enterprises so far established. At the time of the first European discovery, the area was known to local Aboriginals as \\"Moor-ilup\\". \\"Kendenup\\" is another local indigenous word which was used to describe the area. The upper reach of the Kalgan River runs nearby.  History = Early European settlement  Dr. Alexander Collie led an expedition from King George's Sound (Albany) in April and May 1831 accompanied by the Noongar man Mokare. The expedition commenced by journeying up the Kalgan River and overland to the base of the Porongorups. Collie was granted in the Kendenup area having been satisfied with its agricultural potential. Other early land grants in the district were made to: * John Lawrence Morley, ; * Lieutenant William Preston, ; * George Cheyne, at 'Location 27' * and in June 1830, Captain Thomas Banister, The History of Kendenup Albany Gateway In 1838, Captain John Hassell sailed from England en route to Van Diemen's Land in the Dawson, intending to settle on a grant on the Tamar River. Running low on water, he stopped at King George Sound in Albany where he met with the Government Resident, Sir Richard Spencer who persuaded him to consider acquiring land in the vicinity. Hassell ultimately purchased George Cheyne's Location 27 and after returning to Hobart and New South Wales, arrived back at Albany on 6 March 1840 in the China which he had chartered for the purpose. His stock included 800 sheep, 12 cattle and 10 horses from New South Wales which he walked overland to establish a homestead and farm which he called \\"Kendenup\\". Hassell, who was known widely as Captain Hassell, acquired further properties and by 1850 had expanded the operation to freehold and leased. Albert Young Hassell (1841-1918), second of five sons of Captain John Hassell. Hassell's partner and brother-in-law was Frederick Boucher who had established the British and Australian Bank in London in 1838. The bank failed in 1841 and as Boucher's assets were tied in with the collapse, Hassell found himself having to work closely with the bank's trustees as partners. Lieutenant Peter Belches was appointed as the bank's trustees agent to realise on Boucher's assets. After establishing the farm, Hassell lived mainly in Albany using managers to run the day-to-day operations on the station. In Albany he ran an import/export business which included managing the farm's wool sales to England. He travelled to Kendenup regularly to oversee the business. The Kendenup wool won many awards. In 1856 the family settled at Kendenup. Captain Hassell's two eldest sons, John Frederick Tasman Hassell and Albert Young Hassell, took control of operations and later married and settled there with their own families. Several homesteads and buildings were built to accommodate the families, some of which still stand and are listed and protected for their heritage value. In the early 1870s the station boasted 30,000 sheep. J.F.T. Hassell left the property to live in Albany in about 1871/72 followed by Albert who ran the farm until 1886. Captain Hassell died on 15 August 1883, survived by his wife, five sons and a daughter. The property stagnated for the next 30 or so years, with J.F.T. Hassell attempting to sell it 1909. He died in 1919.  Gold  Report of discovery and disappointment, from The Western Australian Times, 21 September 1875 Remains of the old gold mine on Jellicoe Road, south of the townsite Battery nearby, used for crushing the ore On 20 July 1869, the Government of Western Australia offered a payment of ‚Ç§5,000 in the Government Gazette for the discovery of payable gold. Hassell submitted stone samples from Kendenup in 1872 and was told that they were gold bearing. A five-ton consignment was sent to Victoria for crushing and returned four ounces of gold.Glover, R. Plantagenet: Rich and Beautiful UWA Press, Nedlands, for the Shire of Plantagenet, 1979. pp. 119-124. Encouraged by the prospects, the Standard Gold Mining Company was registered on 15 December 1874, with a capital of ‚Ç§3,000. A mine about south of the town with a nearby five-stamp battery were built. The operation became the first to start mining in the state. However, recoveries failed to live up to expectations and the battery crushed only ten tons of ore before being closed when the company went into voluntary liquidation on 5 June 1876. The mine and battery are still visible, although in poor condition.  1920 De Garis settlement  While in Adelaide in July 1920, rural entrepreneur Jack De Garis had heard that the Kendenup property was for sale by the Hassell family executors for ¬£47,325, or ¬£1 per acre. He offered ¬£45,000 with a ¬£1,000 deposit which was accepted, the offer being made prior to his inspection of the property. After having satisfied himself with an inspection De Garis proceeded with his plan of subdividing it into approximately lots, selling the lots through the sale of debentures to settlers to the value of ¬£150,000 using a closer settlement model. He also purchased Kendenup East, a property which included a homestead and a orchard, for another ‚Ç§1,000. The \\"DeGaris Kendenup W.A. Development Company\\" was set up as the debenture issuer.De Garis Kendenup (W.A.) Development Co. Ltd (1920 - ) Guide to Australian Business Records. De Garis planned for subdivision of the estate with a townsite which would include an administrative and civic centre, public parks, recreation areas, factory areas, a school and church sites. A dehydrating factory under the name of Kendenup Fruit Packing Company was established to pack farm produce for the community at a cost of ‚Ç§4,000.Victories of Failure p. 426. He promoted the scheme around Australia, and from late 1920 settlers started to arrive and were granted farm blocks of between on the purchase of ten-year interest-free debenture notes to grow fruit, vegetables and other farm produce. However, the project was under capitalised and lot sizes were considered to be too small to be fully viable and after a peak of about 350 families settling, debenture sales dried up. In August 1922 De Garis travelled to the United States to raise urgently needed capital. The following classified advertisement was published in the New York Times on 13 August 1922. $250,000 was promised but never materialised. By 1923, the scheme had effectively collapsed with the company going into voluntary liquidation. About 30 families stayed on. In order to remain on their selections the Kendenup Settlers Association (Inc.) took up the fight. The government established a Royal Commission 'to inquire into and report upon the establishment of the settlement at Kendenup', headed by Commissioner William Grogan. Fraud by De Garis had been alleged prior to the Royal Commission but he was exonerated in the findings. A second Royal Commission headed by barrister Ross McDonald was held to look into the difficulties faced by the settlers and possible assistance which could be offered. Changes to the Act which governed the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia were made as a result. McDonald later worked pro bono on the settlers' behalf to negotiate with creditors and the banks to enable them to purchase additional land and transfer the debentures to conventional mortgages. Despite the setbacks, the settlement had provided much of the infrastructure for the current Kendenup township. Internment camp During World War II the town was the site of an internment camp housing 200 Italian prisoners of war. The camp operated from 4 November 1943 to 23 May 1946. Internees were assigned as labourers to farms in the area.  Facilities  The town has the Kendenup Primary School (established 1921). Businesses nearby and within the town include Ridge Brothers store (liquor store, bakery, gifts and general goods), the local Kendenup post office, scattered wineries and accommodation options such as a lodge and several bed and breakfast establishments. The early homestead buildings are intact but on private property and therefore unavailable for inspection. The old mine and its battery are about 2 km south of the townsite on Jellicoe Road off Albany Highway.

Foothold of Strength) is an agricultural moshav in northern Israel. Located in the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In it had a population of , both religious and secular Jews. Etymology \\"Midrakh Oz\\" inspired by a passage in the Song of Deborah (Book of Judges 5:21). > The brook Kishon swept them away, that ancient brook, the brook Kishon. O my > soul, tread them down with strength. Geography Midrakh Oz in historical context The moshav is located in a valley called \\"Mansi Valley\\",Repelling the Arab Liberation Army from Mishmar HaEmek, Dr. Elhanan Oren part of the larger Jezreel Valley, near Manasseh Park and is surrounded by green hills of the Plain of Manasseh. It is at an attitude of 128 meters above sea level, 7 km south-east of Yokneam Illit. The moshav lies on Highway 66, which is connected to Highway 65 through nearby Megiddo Junction, connecting the moshav to Haifa and Afula. History In 1951, a Ma'abara was built named \\"Ma'abarat Mansi\\" and was populated by Jewish immigrants from Yemen. The origins of the families who arrived can be traced in twelve villages and towns in Yemen's central and southwestern regions, with the large majority from five villages south of Yemen's capital Sana'a. Midrakh Oz was built on the lands of depopulated Palestinian villages of Al- MansiKhalidi, 1992, p. 177 and Al-Ghubayya al-Tahta.Khalidi, 1992, p. 161 A year later the Ma'abara was dismantled and on 12 December 1952 Moshav was established, first named \\"Mansi\\" and later renamed to \\"Midrakh Oz\\". Between 2000 and 2008 Israel had its milk reform and 13,000,000 NIS were invested in the moshav (around 5,000 NIS per cow), about half was provided by the locals. An expansion of the moshav was built on one of the nearby hills called Khirbat el Khishash, at the foot of the Menashe Heights overlooking the Jezreel Valley and the first stage was completed in 2008 with 83 residential units. Economy All of Midrakh Oz's food productions are members of a local agricultural association called \\"Oz Dganim\\". All members pay member's fee and take full responsibility for running the foods center. Midrakh Oz's dairy farming is considered one of the prominent in Israel, with an annual production of 13.5 million litres of milk. Until the 90s there were 48 milk producers in 46 dairies and after Israel's milk reform, 31 milk producers were left in 26 dairies. Prior to the reform, the dairy farming caused pollution inside the moshav and each cow received on average only 5 m2. The reform improved the environmental condition and each cow received 18 m2 on average. Today most of the work is done by foreign workers.

During World War II, the 54th Troop Carrier Wing was a United States Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force transport wing that exercised command and control over five combat cargo and troop carrier groups in the South West Pacific theatre. In the early postwar years, the 54th Fighter Wing commanded 56 units of the Air National Guard throughout the Southeastern United States. History=World War II The 54th Troop Carrier Wing commenced air transport and medical air evacuation operations in support of Fifth Air Force on 26 May 1943. advancing as battle lines permitted. The wing employed C-47s almost exclusively, but during late 1943 and much of 1944 also used 13 converted B-17Es for armed transport missions in enemy-held territory. The 54th supported every major advance made by the allies in the Southwest Pacific Theater, operating from primitive airstrips carved from jungles and air- dropping cargo where airstrips unavailable. The unit took part in the airborne invasion of Nadzab, New Guinea, in September 1943 by dropping paratroopers of the 503d Parachute Infantry Regiment as well as Australian engineers and heavy equipment. In July 1944, the wing dropped 1,418 paratroopers on Noemfoor Island to aid the allied invasion forces. Then assumed the task of handling all freight and personnel moving in troop carrier aircraft in the Southwest Pacific, in addition to scheduled and unscheduled air movement of cargo and troops, and air evacuation of wounded personnel. Some C-46s began operating within the wing in late 1944, and during 1945 large numbers of C-46s were used in addition to C-47s. By late 1944 and during the early months of 1945, most wing missions were flown to the Philippines. In February 1945, the wing flew three more airborne operations, all in the Philippines, to help encircle Japanese concentrations. Wing C-47s dropped napalm on Carabao Island, in Manila Bay, in March 1945. When hostilities ended, the wing moved the entire 11th Airborne Division (11,300 personnel) from the Philippines to Okinawa on short notice, and then began transporting occupation forces into Japan. During September 1945, the wing also evacuated over 17,000 former prisoners of war from Japan to the Philippines. The wing served as part of the occupation forces in Japan from 25 September 1945 to about 26 January 1946, while continuing routine air transport operations and a scheduled courier service. Beginning in December 1945 and continuing into mid-1946, most of the wing's components were reassigned to other units or inactivated, and on 15 January 1946 the wing became a component of the Far East (soon, Pacific) Air Service Command. Moving to the Philippines, the wing gained new components and flew scheduled routes between Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and the Hawaiian Islands. Replaced by the 403d Troop Carrier Group on 31 May 1946 and was inactivated. Air National Guard Allocated to the Georgia Air National Guard for command and control origination for units in the Southeastern region of the United States. Extended federal recognition and activated on 2 October 1946. At the end of October 1950, the Air National Guard converted to the wing-base (Hobson Plan) organization. As a result, the wing was withdrawn from the Georgia ANG and was inactivated on 31 October 1950. The 116th Fighter Wing was established by the National Guard Bureau, allocated to the state of Georgia, recognized and activated 1 November 1950; assuming the personnel, equipment and mission of the inactivated 54th Fighter Wing. United States Air Force In June 1970, as the 54th Tactical Fighter Wing, was activated and replaced the 354th TFW at Kunsan AB, South Korea, assuming control of personnel and attached F-4C Phantom II squadrons. Was inactivated on 31 October 1970 when the deployed F-4 squadrons returned to the United States and the base was placed in a non-flying status. Base operations personnel were absorbed by the 6175th Air Base Group.

A.10-1985 Thuner is an imposing limestone figure carved by John Michael Rysbrack (1693-1770). Thuner, the god of thunder, is one of the seven Saxon gods, each representing a day of the week. It was carved circa 1730 for Sir Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham (1675-1749) for his garden in Stowe, Buckinghamshire. On the base of the sculpture, Thuner's name is carved in runes beneath a thunderbolt. Originally the statues were set around an altar in an open grove, known as the Saxon Temple at Stowe; later they were placed in Stowe's Gothic Temple of Liberty. They formed part of an important group of buildings and statuary erected by Lord Cobham during the 1730s, which embodied a political programme championing Whig beliefs in historic British liberty. Rysbrack was one of the most important sculptors working Britain at this time. A native of the Netherlands, he came over to England in about 1720, and soon established himself as a sculptor of monuments, portraits and busts.

The team's history dates back to the early 1990s, but in its current form it has been in existence since 2000. The club has sent three players to professional contracts in Europe, including Ryan Richards, the youngest player ever to play in the Nike Hoop Summit. The club runs an elite 6th form academy based at Canterbury High School, launched in 2007, and stronger links being formed with the juniors in 2008 as the club expanded to include men‚Äôs, under-18, under-16 and under-14 National League teams. Club history=Origins The roots of the Kent Crusaders began in the early 1990s when Kevin and Christine Paice, Dave Hooper and Hilli Lingham began developing junior basketball at Canterbury College. Through their work, the Canterbury Jazz and CK Heat were born. As the club gathered momentum, the College became the place to be for basketball in East Kent. Trevor Acres and Kevin Maloney joined the coaching staff and numerous boys were given the opportunity to play National League and the club won numerous Kent cups. In 2000, ex-player and young coach Jay Gifford took over the club. He was joined a year later by Canadian Jesse Sazant. Coach Sazant took the team to new heights, including a National Under 16 quarterfinal in his first season. At this point the club was relaunched as the East Kent Crusaders. National League  After losing older players to the London clubs for years, the club decided to launch a men‚Äôs EBL Division 3 team in 2004. In their first season the club finished third in Division 3 South East. The initial season saw a number of the club‚Äôs former junior players return to the Crusaders to be joined by a number of local players. In their second season the team quickly progressed, winning the 2005/06 EBL Division 3 South East and making the finals of the National Shield. The club also signed their first foreign player, 6'10 Canadian Walter Moyse and foreign coach assistant, Dane Mads Olesen. The 2005/06 team was led by Walter Moyse, Paul Jessop and Robbie Parker, and featured 14-year-old Ryan Richards, a 2007 Nike Hoop Summit World Team Player and a 2008 Euroleague Final Four: Nike International Junior Tournament player with Real Madrid.http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Ryan- Richards-1272 Ryan Richards The Crusaders got promoted to EBL Division 2 and were renamed the Kent Crusaders in summer 2006. While the club signed a number of new players it also lost Moyse, Parker and Richards to contracts in Europe. Initially the remaining players and new signings London Towers players Sam Betts and James Acres, Reading Rockets guard Damion Lyons, former Crusaders junior Angelo Irving and East London's Gary Davison and JP Dontoni, fared well, winning the first three league games, before fading down the stretch and only being assured another season in Division 2 in the last round of games. On 2 April 2007, Jesse Sazant stepped down as head coach to concentrate on a role as chairman and director of basketball, passing the coaching reins to Mads Olesen.kentnews.co.uk The 2007 offseason season saw the Crusaders lose team leaders captain Paul Jessop, leading scorer and starting point guard Gary Davidson, big man Angelo Irving, guard James Parker, forward JP Dontoni, and forward James Acres, but in his new role as Director of Basketball Jesse Sazant managed to recruit young talented players to make up for the losses. Two young Barking Abbey Basketball Academy players, 6'0 18-year-old guard Rikki Broadmore (Under 18's Reading Rockets National League and Cup champion) and 6'6 forward, 18-year-old former England Under 16's player Dan Garrad. Additionally 20-year-old JP Dimandja, a 6‚Äô6 forward with untapped potential and athleticism joined from Eastside Eagles. The team struggled early in the season as the young players adjusted to the physicality of men's basketball while the returning players adjusted to their new roles as team leaders, crashing out of the Patrons Cup and losing twelve of the first sixteen league games. The team was able to secure another season in Division 3 with three games to go with a key away win at Team Northumbria.http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Relief-as-Crusaders-escape- drop-early-newsinkent11172.aspx?news=local The 2007/08 season also saw the start of the Kent Crusaders and Canterbury High School Basketball Sixth Form Academy. The academy accepted 12 players in its first year and was coached by Damian Lyons and Sam Bets. The academy focuses on developing player fundamentals and academy player Adam Brown managed to play in two games for the Crusaders men's team. Current club The 2008 off season saw the Crusaders management focus stability on the men's team as they secured that the key players from the previous season stayed on. Also in the summer of 2008 the Kent Crusaders men's Club and the East Kent Crusaders Junior Basketball Club merged into one club and added Under 18's, 16's and 14's EBL National League teams to the club. The Kent Crusaders Basketball Academy are based at Canterbury High School. Student athletes at the academies receive daily coaching in addition to dedicated time for strength and conditioning work.

The school competes in the Elite Academies Basketball League. Additionally, players are expected to play at the highest club level they can. Current academy members play for the Crusaders national league team, under 18 team and a number of local men‚Äôs teams.

They inhabit a vast territory between the Sankuru and Lubilash rivers west and the Lualaba River in the east, a vast group of villages can be found in present-day East Kasai province, parts of Katanga and Kivu Province. The people of Songye are divided into thirty-four conglomerate societies, each society is led by a single chief with Judiciary Council of elders and nobles (bilolo). Smaller kingdoms east of the Lomami River refer to themselves as Songye, other kingdoms in the west, refer to themselves as Kalebwe, Eki, Ilande, Bala, Chofwe, Sanga and Tempa. As a society, the people of Songye are mainly known as a farming community, they do, however, take part in hunting and trading with other neighboring communities.  Origins and ancestors  The origin of the Songye begins with its founding ancestors Chimbale and Kongolo and established the Kingdom of Luba. Chimbale and Kongolo played an important role in establishing the foundation of Luba's political empire. After suffering from political dissension, the ancestors of Songye migrated out of the Luba Empire. The Songye honor their ancestors and cultural heroes through a series of different practices and occasions. In Songye culture, it is believed that the chiefs are sacred heirs of their ancestors and of the founding cultural hero. Hunting was an occupation associated with cultural heroes, Chiefs would organize hunting of animals to showcase the power that was embued to him by the cultural hero he was honoring. Blacksmithing was another craft that was associated with their heroes. Their smiths were reputed for their production of arms; their axes were used by Luba, and some were found in the ruins of Khami in Rhodesia.  Religion  The people of Songye believe in a supreme being Ele-ife, however, he is not praised as much as ancestral spirits. Ancestral worship is very prevalent within Songye culture, it is believed that the spirit of their ancestors is more accessible to them due to their shared experience of being alive. As a result of this, these spirits have a connection to both the land of the living and the dead and are able to enact their will on the community.  Secret Society: Bwadi bra Kifwebe  This is an example of how the top of a typical masquerader would look. Bwadi bra Kifwebe is a secret society of mask men. In the community, these men were known for their use of magic (Buki or Buchi) and sorcery (Masende). Buki and Masende magic differs from witchcraft, these types of magic are inherited and or obtained either by will or unconsciously. Witchcraft, in contrast, can be obtained through initiation and at the appropriate use of magical ingredients. In order to become a member of the Bwadi bra Kifwebe, all applicants must under an initiation process. During this process, initiates must learn and identify a secret esoteric language. They must undergo a radical and violent experience in order to become less fearful of the unknown and learn their roles within the subject to Bwadi bra Kifwebe. Some of the responsible of the Bwadi bra Kifwebe are regulating and maintaining political order and balance between the chief and his communities. The Bwadi bra Kifwebe maintain balance within the community by conducting masquerades, rituals and rites such as initiation rituals, circumcisions and funerals.  Masquerades  The Bwadi bra Kifwebe maintain balance within the community by conducting masquerades.  Dancers  The overall appearance of a masquerader varies on the dancer, the type of ceremony they're performing in, and spirit being evoked. Normally Masqueraders have a wooden mask and are covered head to toe in flowing black raffia fibers made from the bark or roots of trees. Their arms, bodies and legs are covered with raffia netting, with goat skins fastened around their waist. The dancers are male and the complexity of their costume varies on their status within the community. When the dancer is wearing a male mask his movements are aggressive and unstable, however when a dancer wears a female mask his movements are gentle and controlled. The dances of the kifwebe dancers are meant to encourage social conformity within the community showing its people how one should behave in their society. A male kifwebe mask, Songye tribe  Mask = Cosmology of a mask  There are two different types of kifwebe masks. The kifwebe masks come in various designs and reference different aspects of nature, culture and cosmology. Kifwebe masks symbolized the spirits of the dead, the underworld and the struggle between good and evil (Community vs antisocial practices and witchcraft), each element of the mask symbolized these aspects in a certain way. the intertwining of the rhythmic colors of red, black and white was meant to symbolize the struggle between good (white) and evil (black and red), the combination of these colors embody the positive and dangerous force held with in the mask. The ruggedness of the mask itself symbolizes the underworld and the spirits escape from it. thumb  Male and Female kifwebe masks  Male Kifwebe masks were mainly used for initiation ceremonies, circumcision, and the enthronement and funerals of the supreme chief. The face of a typical Kifwebe masks is covered with linear incisions, a square protruding mouth and a linear nose set between globular pierced eyes. Male masks typical have a centered crest on the top of the masks and its size varies on the status of the dancer wearing it, elder dances within the Bwadi bra Kifwebe have larger centered crest compared to others. Female Kifwebe masks was typically used for public ceremonies and reproduction rituals. women within the songye community viewed woman as the bearer of children and good fortune. To them, women representation of continuation of life and cultural tradition. The features of the female kifwebe mask was meant to portray these ideas. Typically they share similar characteristics as the male mask however it facial features are more gentle and rounded evoking the tenderness of a mother as well as the power to protect and support her children. The structure of the face is longed, the mask itself is covered in white paint or Kaolin.  Mankishi and the spirits within  thumb Mankishi are spirits of the dead that can influence the world of men. These spirits can be malevolent spirits causing infertility, bad harvests and sickness or benevolent spirits bringing good health and prosperity in the hunt and field. The Songye believe that spirits can be reborn, Benevolent spirits are believed to be reborn by creating a mamkishi power figure, while malevolent spirits (bikudi) are not reborn and are forced to roam the earth for eternity. Not all spirits who are unable to be reborn as a Mankishi are wandering spirits, spirits who are not reborn yet are knowledgeable on their power and knowledge of patrilineage founders, heroic leaders, and lineage chiefs and dignitaries become guardians of the lineage and provide general protection. Mankishi conforms to a certain magico-social standard within the Songye community. Songye figures serves as a protectors of the community, encourages fertility and protects families from evil spirits and practitioners. Nganga or magical practitioners are responsible for commissioning these figures, they decide the dimensions of the figure, sex morphological aspects and type of wood used for the figure. These Sculptures comes various forms and serves different purposes, Usually Mankishi are depicted as a large stylized sculptures of a standing on a base. In profile, the repetition of strong diagonals in the coiffure, beard forearm and feet are forceful and aesthetically pleasing. The horizontal shoulders arm and legs helps gives the figure a sense of energy and movement 38. The Stance is meant to signify the mankishi's alertness and readiness to carry out his purpose whether it is protecting its owner from evil spirits or witches and sorcerers. Its head is usually elongated with sharp facial feature such as the eyes, chin, and rectangular nose. Its torso is also elongated yet the center of abdomen is hallowed along with the top of the head so that the Bijimba, a magical substance created by the Nganga, can house the sculpture and bring spiritual power to it. Female figures exist however they are not as common as male Mankishi. Female Mankishi are smaller and they are usually for personal usage. Like its male counterpart, the female Nkishi has a cavity in the abdomen and head to house the Bijimba. The figure itself usually shows signs of scarification on its face and above its face. The legs of the figure are posed in an unusual way and appears to be unfinished, this may suggests that it was covered by sacred objects and was not meant to be shown . When the Mankishi is being used the nganga places shells, horns, animal skins, nails or studs and other spiritual objects outside of the figure to enhance its power and influence 38.

Its ensemble cast ‚Äî an eclectic mix of international stars, Australian soap opera veterans and character actors ‚Äî is led by Steve Railsback, Olivia Hussey, Michael Craig, Noel Ferrier, Carmen Duncan, Roger Ward and Lynda Stoner. The film marks the first of three directorial collaborations between Trenchard-Smith and producer Antony I. Ginnane ‚Äî the others being The Siege of Firebase Gloria (1989) and Arctic Blast (2010) ‚Äî although the director had previously made promotional reels and trailers for Ginnane's earlier films. Described by the director as a cross- genre piece in which \\"1984 meets The Camp on Blood Island where they play 'The Most Dangerous Game'\\", the film depicts a concentration camp in a totalitarian society which allows rich adventurers to participate in human hunting games with its \\"deviant\\" convicts. Its story follows a political activist and an innocent prisoner as they work together to survive one such game and turn the tables on their oppressors. Filmed on location near Cairns, Turkey Shoot underwent a troubled production as a result of a budgetary shortfall that reduced the shooting schedule; this also necessitated multiple scenes being rewritten or cut entirely, extensive simultaneous second unit photography directed by executive producer David Hemmings, and use of stock footage during post-production. Widely considered to be a seminal example of the Ozploitation cycle, the film is notable for its extreme depictions of graphic violence and sadism; Time Out declared that the film \\"makes modern day grindhouse imitations such as Machete and Planet Terror seem like anaemic shadows in comparison\\". Despite receiving negative reviews from such Australian critics as David Stratton and Phillip Adams, Turkey Shoot is recognised as a cult film, has been championed by Quentin Tarantino, and was prominently featured in the documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! (2008). A remake, directed by Jon Hewitt, produced by Ginnane, executive produced by Trenchard-Smith, and starring Dominic Purcell and Viva Bianca, was released in 2014. Plot In a near-future totalitarian state, so-called \\"social deviants\\" are sent to mass prison camps for re-education and behaviour modification. The new arrivals at Camp 47 are Chris Walters, a shopkeeper accused of helping a rebel; Rita Daniels, a suspected prostitute; and Paul Anders, a political dissident who has escaped from several other camps. Camp Master Charles Thatcher subjects his wards to brutal, inhuman treatment; Chris barely avoids being raped by the sadistic guards, and Paul is tortured for intervening. Their cellmates Griffin and Dodge separately plot escapes, but their on-going attempts is unknowingly surveyed by the guards. Every year, Thatcher and his circle of VIPs; Secretary Mallory, Jennifer, Tito, and Tito's beastly accomplice Alph, select five prisoners to be human prey in a \\"turkey shoot\\"; a deadly 12-hour hunt in which defenceless quarries are released into the nearby wilderness to be stalked and killed by the armed hunters. Paul, Chris, Rita, and Dodge are chosen to be the prey, told that they will be freed should they survive the time limit. Griff is added to the group after starting a fight with Dodge in the dorms. With a three-hour head start, the prisoners are sent out at half-hour intervals and quickly become separated. Dodge is the first to be caught, Alph breaking off and eating his little toe under Tito's instructions before chasing him down and beating him to death. Thatcher toys with Paul by firing near-misses with a sniper rifle, forcing him to scale a difficult rock formation and preventing his scramble to find Chris. Paul manages to redirect Thatcher's pursuit by causing a rock slide, while Griff jumps Red and takes his assault rifle, placing him in a trap that later kills him. He tries to mount a counterattack, but is pinned down by Jennifer and Thatcher and incapacitated with arrows before being run over and killed. Jennifer proceeds to stalk Rita on horseback, trapping her before raping and killing her. Tito attempts to bisect Paul with the tractor shovel attached to the front of his buggy, Paul manages to get out of the way and Tito inadvertently kills Alph. Mallory and his guide, Chief Guard Ritter, track Chris through dense jungle into a sugarcane field. Ritter attempts to smoke her out by setting the field aflame, when Mallory stumbles into Chris. Before he can rape her, Paul jumps him and gets his gun, shooting him in the groin and escaping with Chris as he burns to death. The two run to what they think is the end of the wilderness, only to realize upon reaching coastline that they're on an island, and that there is no way out. Ritter catches up to them, but Chris manages to kill him with his own machete. The two resolve to fight back, killing Tito and stealing his buggy. Armed with a mounted machine gun, they storm the camp and free the other prisoners. The uprising leads to the RAAF scrambling a bomber to destroy the camp and quash the revolt. The prisoners raid an armory for arms, fending off the guards while Chris destroys the communications centre and kills Jennifer with an explosive arrow. Thatcher attempts to lead a counter-attack, but is killed by Paul, and the prisoners flee into the jungle just as the camp is destroyed by a napalm airstrike. Armed with supplies, the now-rebels led by Paul and Chris make their way into the mountains.

Production According to Brian Trenchard- Smith, the film was always meant to be a satire. > The original script was sort of like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang meets > \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", with 70 pages of Chain Gang and \\"Most Dangerous > Game\\" lasted about 35 pages. I didn't think that was good balance. Also it > was set in the depression era Deep South. We had tax based financing in > place on condition that it was supposed to be set in Australia. So I > suggested we set it in the future, and make it more universal. We wanted to > make a tongue in cheek but gutsy action movie with subtext about corporate > fascism at the beginning of the Reagan era. (He had Australia > frightened...Ronald Ray Gun cartoons were often spray painted on Sydney > walls in 1981) So we hired Neill & Jon to redo it. Then of course, there > were days when I was writing pages myself during the shooting.'Interview: > Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (Night of the Demons 2)', Joblo Aug. 5, 2011 > accessed 21 October 2012 Turkey Shoot was produced during the Australian film tax exemption scheme 10BA. Under 10BA film costs were subsidized by the Australian government, and directors tended to cast foreign leads in the hope of boosting success in Europe or the Americas. The movie was shot in Far North Queensland near Cairns. According to Trenchard-Smith, the schedule was slashed from 44 days to 28 just prior to filming.Brian Trenchard-Smith, 'No Film for Chickens', ACMI, 23 June 2009 accessed 28 September 2012 David Hemmings was one of the executive producers and shot some second unit scenes, which Trenchard-Smith says caused some tension: > He did not think much of me. He knew that a Completion Guarantor had me > waiting in the wings to take over an earlier film [Race for the Yankee > Zephyr] Hemmings was directing if he continued to remain behind schedule. He > was having an on again off again affair with a member of the cast. When he > made fun of me in front of my wife and new born son once in the production > office, I poured beer on his head. He was a little more careful with me > after that. Lynda Stoner had insisted on no nudity when accepted the role, but when she arrived on set she found out she was required to do some. She objected, pressure was put on her, so she compromised and did a back shot but says she always regretted it. Olivia Hussey had a miserable time during filming, hating coming to work and being terrified of the Australian bush.Turkey Shoot: Blood and Thunder Memories (Video 2003) Directed by Mark Hartley Release Turkey Shoot grossed $321,000 at the box office in Australia,Film Victoria ‚Äì Australian Films at the Australian Box Office which is equivalent to $984,110 in 2009 dollars. The film was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures as Escape 2000 in October 1983. The film was released in the UK under the opportunistic title Blood Camp Thatcher referring to the cold camp commandant Charles Thatcher, rather than the then British Prime Minister. The film was released on special edition DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment. 2008 Melbourne International Film Festival Turkey Shoot featured in a Focus on Ozploitation collection of 1970s and 1980s Australian exploitation films, including Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, Dead End Drive-In and Razorback. These over-the-top B grade films were characterized by lashings of gratuitous sex, violence and fuel-injected muscle car mayhem which pushed the boundaries of audience taste to new limits.  Reception  Joe Baltake, film critic for the Philadelphia Daily News, gave the film a negative review, describing it as a \\"vomitous offering\\" and \\"unfit for human consumption\\". Bill O'Connor from the Arkon Beacon Journal called the film \\"garbage\\" and highlighted the excessive use of gore and the \\"wooden acting\\". Australian film critic David Stratton also condemned the film as \\"a catalogue of sickening horrors\\", adding that \\"the actors involved should have been ashamed for appearing in such trash\\". Filmink magazine said \\"versions of the classic story Most Dangerous Game appear at least once a decade...This was Australia‚Äôs 10BA version directed with great pace by Brian Trenchard-Smith and featuring an excellent cast and perhaps Australian cinema‚Äôs most notable werewolf.\\" Legacy A remake of Turkey Shoot was released in 2014. It was directed by Jon Hewitt and also produced by Antony I.

They determined the composition of the 2010 Tongan Legislative Assembly. The early elections were announced by the new King George Tupou V in July 2008 shortly before being crowned on 1 August 2008, and were preceded by a programme of constitutional reform. For the first time, a majority of the seats (17 out of 26) in the Tongan parliament were elected by universal suffrage, with the remaining nine seats being reserved for members of Tonga's nobility. This marked a major progression away from the 165-year rule of the monarchy towards a fully representative democracy. The Taimi Media Network described it as \\"Tonga‚Äôs first democratically elected Parliament\\".\\"Absence of PM from opening of Parliament questioned\\" , Taimi Media Network, 9 June 2011 The Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, founded in September 2010 specifically to fight the election and led by veteran pro-democracy campaigner 'Akilisi Pohiva, secured the largest number of seats, with 12 out of the seventeen \\"people's representative\\" seats.  Background = Heading to political reforms  Prior to these elections, members of Tonga's Legislative Assembly (the Fale Alea) were primarily appointed by the monarch, who also selected the prime minister and the cabinet. Only nine of the 30 seats were popularly elected, and another nine were held by members of the aristocracy. In April 2010 the Legislative Assembly enacted a package of political reforms, increasing the number of people's representatives from nine to seventeen, with ten seats for Tongatapu, three for Vava ªu, two for Ha ªapai and one each for Niuas and  ªEua. All of the seats are single-seat constituencies, as opposed to the multi-member constituencies used before. These changes mean that now 17 of 26 representatives (65.4%) will be directly elected, up from 9 of 30 (30.0%). The noble aristocracy will still select its nine representatives, while all remaining seats, which were previously appointed by the monarch, will be abolished. While the cabinet and the prime minister were previously selected by the monarch, this time, the elected parliamentarians will vote for a prime minister. The changes come in the wake of violent pro-democracy demonstrations in November 2006, in which eight people were killed and much of the business district of Tongatapu destroyed as people protested against the slow movement toward political reform. The changes have been fully supported by the king. One of the candidates, Sione Fonua, said, \\"The king saw the signs that people wanted change and, to his credit, he has allowed that to happen\\".  Impact on the monarchy  Tonga is a very traditional society, and the role of the monarchy is extremely important. In response to the question of the impact the new legislation would have on his role, the King stated that while not officially reducing his powers, the reforms meant that he was now limited in his capacity to exercise these powers: Analysts, however, have said they are not yet certain what effective changes the political shift would bring. The king retains the power of veto over certain laws, as well as the power to dismiss the government.  Election =People's representatives Voter registration closed on 31 August, with approximately 42,000 voters registering. In November 2010, the Women's and Children's Crisis Centre expressed concern that up to 40% of eligible voters could have failed to register. Candidates were registered on 21 and 22 October, with 147 candidates contesting the 17 constituencies. The Tongatapu 6 and 9 constituencies were the most heavily contested, with 15 candidates each, while Ha'apai 13, 'Eua 11 and Niuas 17 had only three candidates each. Ten candidates were women. Only three of the incumbent Cabinet contested the elections. Candidates were required to pay a P400 (Tonga-pa'anga) registration fee (equivalent to $215 US or ‚Ç¨165) and present the signatures of 50 eligible voters in support of their candidacy. The suffering economy was seen as the most significant priority for the campaigners. According to the World Bank, up to 40% of Tongans live on or below the poverty line. In addition, the International Monetary Fund claims that Tonga's national debt is substantial and that the island nation is at high risk of not being able to pay them. In an address to the nation before polling stations opened, the King described the vote as \\"the greatest and most historic day for our kingdom\\". He went on to say, \\"You will choose your representative to the parliament and, thus, the first elected government in our country's long history.\\" Nobles' representatives Elections to the nobles' seats was reformed, through the Representatives Electoral Regulations Act 2010. Each member of the nobility was henceforth only allowed to cast a vote in the constituency containing lands to which his title of nobility was attached. The four constituencies were: * a joint constituency for Tongatapu &  ªEua, corresponding to fourteen hereditary titles (thirteen in Tongatapu and one, Lasike, in  ªEua), and electing four representatives; * the constituency of Vava ªu, corresponding to eight hereditary titles and electing two representatives; * the constituency of Ha ªapai, corresponding to seven hereditary titles and electing two representatives; * the constituency of the Niuas, corresponding to four hereditary titles and electing one representative. There were two nobles who held two titles each: Prince  ªAho ªeitu  ªUnuaki ªotonga Tuku ªaho held the titles of Tupouto ªa (in Ha ªapai) and Lavaka (in Tongatapu), while Lord Kalaniuvalu of Tongatapu was jointly Lord Fotofili of the Niuas. It is not clear whether this enabled these two men to cast two ballots. In addition, there were three unattributed titles: Ma ªatu in the Niuas, and  ªAhome ªe and Fohe in Tongatapu. Also, King Tupou V had, since 2008, instituted the unprecedented title of \\"Law Lords\\" for three men (Ramsay Robertson Dalgety, Tevita Poasi Tupou and Taniela Tufui), conferring upon them a non-hereditary life title which entitled them to vote in a nobles' constituency of their choosing, but not to be elected. Dalgety and Tupou chose to vote in Tongatapu, and Tufui in Ha ªapai. Consequently, there were twelve to fourteen potential voters in Tongatapu (depending on where Prince Tuku ªaho and Lord Kalaniuvalu chose to vote), eight in Vava ªu, seven or eight in Ha ªapai, and two or three in the Niuas.\\"Nobles prepare for Elections of district electoral representatives\\" , Tongan Ministry of Information, 17 November 2010\\"Nobles\\" , government of Tonga  Results  According to election officials, approximately 89% of the 42,000 registered voters cast ballots. A delegation of fourteen observers from Australia and New Zealand were in Tonga to observe the election. Reports said they were pleased at the way the election had been managed. The outcome of the election resulted in a plurality of seats for the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, who won 12 out of the 17 \\"people's representative\\" seats,. with only some 29% of the votes (because of the First Past the Post voting system being used). Once the results were finalised, the newly elected representatives selected a prime minister. Tongans, who have traditionally looked to the nobility for leadership, had widely expected it to be a nobleman. After their election, however, the nobles' representatives announced that they would support a commoner for prime minister but ultimately decided to support Lord Tu'ivakano.http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/parliament/20101221_tonga_new_prime_minister_designate.shtml People's representativesTongatapu= ªEua=Ha ªapai=Vava ªu=NiuasNoble representatives The nobles' representatives are: Government formation Following the election, the DPFI secured the support of one independent and was seeking the support of two others ‚Äì 'Aisake Valu Eke and Sunia Fili ‚Äì by offering them cabinet posts. Following concerns the noble representatives would support one of the independents for Prime Minister, the DPFI decided to hold a public rally to build public support. The formal process of electing a Prime Minister will begin after the final election results are formally notified, with the appointment of an interim Speaker and a call for nominations. MPs will then vote by secret ballot in one or more rounds, until a candidate is elected. On 3 December 2010 the King appointed Lord Tupou as interim Speaker. The three MPs from Vava'u are considered to be pro- monarchy.http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/201012/3092366.htm?desktop Sosefo Fe‚Äôaomoeata Vakata reportedly left the DPFI and became an independent, and was likely to support the nobles together with the five independent MPs, resulting in a noble-led government. He joined a bloc of 15 members, including all nine noble representatives and five other people's representatives, to jointly nominate a Prime Minister. The DPFI rejected these claims and stated it still expects to form the government. A vote was scheduled for 17 December, but then delayed to 20 December. On 15 December 2010, DPFI MP 'Isileli Pulu claimed that the DPFI had the support of 14 of the 17 popularly elected MPs and of a few nobles, 18 MPs in total. On 20 December 2010 Samuela 'Akilisi Pohiva and Siale'ataonga Tu'ivakano were nominated for Prime Minister. The election was postponed to 21 December 2010. Tu'ivakano was elected by 14 votes to 12. On 31 December Tu'ivakano named his cabinet, which included six people's representatives, three nobles, and two commoners appointed from outside Parliament.

Its southern terminus is at SR 39 in downtown Salineville, and its northern terminus is at its junction with U.S. Route 30(US 30) and SR 9 in the center of Kensington. The route connects mainly rural and a few unincorporated parts of southeastern Columbiana County. SR 644 only briefly passes into a corner of Carroll County for a journey. Route description The starting point of SR 644 is its junction with SR 39 in the Columbiana County village of Salineville, at the intersection of Main Street and Lincoln Street. SR 644 follows Main Street west from this intersection, and turns northerly after two blocks, as the road becomes known as Hanover Road. The route bends northwesterly, then passes by Woodlawn Cemetery, turns northerly again, and back to the northwest, as it heads out of the village limits of Salineville through a wooded setting. Entering into Washington Township, SR 644 intersects Walnut Ridge Road, turns west-northwesterly, then curves north-northwesterly, as it ducks just barely into Carroll County, and correspondingly, Fox Township. SR 644 has no intersections in the it covers in Carroll County, just passing by a blend of woods and fields. SR 644 re-enters Columbiana County, this time into Franklin Township. Trending northwesterly, SR 644 meets Dobson Road, then curves to the west-northwest. The rural setting the highway traverses is a blend of woods and fields, with a few homes dotting the landscape. SR 644 bends northwesterly, then follows a reverse curve northerly before resuming a northwesterly path. Next, it passes by intersections with Hull Road and Lewis Road, where the highway turns to the north. Further along, SR 644 bends to the northeast, then starts to curve to the northwest as it enters into Summitville. Once within the village, SR 644 follows Main Street, and has an intersection with Yellow Creek Church Road. The route turns north into the main portion of the village, then turns northeasterly to pass underneath the Norfolk Southern Railway. Resuming a northerly course, SR 644 passes by intersections with Fink Road and Summitville Road before departing Summitville, and re-entering Franklin Township. The route bends northeastly, then north again, as it passes by the hamlet of Millport, where it meets SR 518 at its western terminus. Continuing north of SR 518, SR 644 curves to the northwest, passes by a split intersection with Willard Road, then meets Bethesda Road. Next, the route bends to the west briefly, then resumes a northwesterly trek, and comes upon a split intersection with McKaig Road. SR 644 then passes just to the east of the northeasternmost point in Carroll County, while remaining in Columbiana County, crossing from Franklin Township into Hanover Township. SR 644 bends north, turns northwesterly, then begins to trend to the west as it approaches Mechanicstown Road. Beyond there, SR 644 turns to the west-northwest, closely paralleling the Norfolk Southern railway that exists to the south of the highway, as SR 644 enters the unincorporated community of Kensington. Passing by a number of homes, SR 644 comes to an end as it arrives at its junction with US 30 and SR 9. History In 1937, SR 644 was designated along the route that it currently occupies, and has not experienced any major changes in its routing since its inception.

The Bete together with many other tribes makeup the Kru ethnic group. There are 93 distinct groups within the B√©t√© polity.  Culture  They are only united in that they are subsistence farmers, but base most of their culture around hunting. Social control was exercised by the leading member of individual lineages (several in each village) who exercises judicial and financial power within the community. B√©t√© are known for their focus on individual rights. A male \\"chief\\" is chosen by the people based on the criterion of wisdom. This leader stays in power until his death or any wrongdoing. Men and women play equal roles in society as well, and Bete women are the most outspoken among the tribes.  Religion  Spiritual authority was wielded with an array of paraphernalia, notably including the ‚Äúgre‚Äù mask, a horned and decorated creation (originating with the We) designed to instill terror in the onlooker, to quell social unrest, and to be worn when meting out justice after conflict. Statuary is uncommon, and is based around feminine iconography that refers to a mythical mother figure. No recognized liturgical function was found, although some reports indicate that a pair of figures was often placed under a village rain shelter to represent its founders. This evocation of a primeval couple has widespread resonance in African culture. Rare figures with exaggerated genitalia are probably linked to a magico-religious fertility appeal. Alternatively, they may have constituted a more general role, evoking or celebrating the fertility of the village/land, its founders or the forest from which the people made their living.  Marriage  The men of the Bete tribe travel outside of the village to find marriage partners. Choosing a partner within the tribe is not allowed because of the belief that the village is a family unit. Ethnically diverse marriages are strongly encouraged. Before dating begins men ask about the woman's family to prevent an intra-familial match. Marriage is forbidden if the couple is related in any way. Husbands remain in their home village after marriage. Wives join the husband's tribe. The husband is expected to provide a home and land (usually inherited) for his wife. The marriage is discussed only among the bride and groom and is meant to be a surprise for the parents, particularly the woman's parents. The date of the wedding is set and the wife's family is invited to the groom's village to celebrate. The woman's family then visits to make sure the woman is marrying of her own free will. This is a polite formality. When she has said that she is sure of her decision, then congratulations are welcomed. The wedding ceremony takes one week. Each day is a celebration of the bride and she is treated royally. Polygamy is common. Husbands typically have no more than three wives. When a man decides to marry again, the first wife becomes a sort of mother to her. The original wife may choose to become the head of the group of wives. This is a common practice but not an obligation. Any wife may choose to separate if her husband marries another woman. The original wife may attempt to make the second wife feel unwelcome to make her leave instead. Alternatively, the wives get along. Divorce is very common. A wife can leave her husband and return to her home village whenever she chooses without notice or explanation. The husband in turn can choose to kick his wife out. Counseling among friends is very common in marital disputes. Traditions are mostly practiced by people still living in villages. When the children move to cities, they usually adopt Western traditions. See also *B√©t√© language  References  *Bacquart, J. 1998/2000. The Tribal Arts of Africa. Thames and Hudson.

The decree was part of the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 which sought to address inequalities between Muslim and non-Muslim citizens, mainly affecting the Coptic Christian minority. The law mandated that the Ottoman Sultan must issue permits for any construction or maintenance of churches, and the Coptic Pope had to apply for all such permits. After the end of Ottoman rule, only the king, and then the President of Egypt could issue these permits, although in 1999, under the administration of Hosni Mubarak, the law was changed to also allow Egyptian Governors to grant permits. The decree is often confused with the 1934 Ten Conditions of Al-Ezabi, which enlarged the restrictions and added ten limiting conditions. Although the original decree amended a ban on the construction of Coptic churches, today it is the subject of controversies over religious freedom.  History and revisions  While ostensibly part of the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire in the 1800s, the special restrictions on churches trace back to the Pact of Umar in the 7th century. This treaty included a provision against the building of new churches or other religious buildings, and became the jurisprudential basis for subsequent interactions between Muslim leaders and non-Muslim citizens.

At the , Metcalfe had a population of 185. The name 'Metcalfe' probably derives from Baron (Charles) Metcalfe, Governor-General of India and later of Canada, who died in 1846. Metcalfe lies on the Coliban River, downstream from the Malmsbury reservoir. Metcalfe was developed mainly during the central Victorian gold rush of 1851‚Äì1865. It is reported that in 1851, when the first miners arrived on the Mount Alexander goldfield, near Castlemaine, nuggets could be picked up without digging. Nearby reserves still bear the scars of mining activity including deep shafts and adits. In 1861 the Metcalfe road board was established, and in 1865 the Shire of Metcalfe was declared and the shire hall was constructed. The shire hall still contains the record of all councillors and mayors from then until the dissolution of the shire in 1995. For most of its history the major economic activity has been grazing. Recent (2015) purchases of large grazing properties have been made by Chinese interests. At times, Metcalfe has had a school, a post office, a pub and various other businesses, but all of these are now closed. With the opening of the Calder Freeway the volume of traffic travelling via Metcalfe between Kyneton and Bendigo reduced significantly. Metcalfe Post Office opened on 13 December 1866. Attractions At the 'Cascades', just to the west of the village, the Coliban River flows over and among huge granite boulders and outcrops, creating many rock pools, small and large.

He attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, graduating with a bachelor of architecture degree in 1878. Following his graduation, Green was the 3rd architect to be registered by the State University of New York. Career After graduation, Green worked as a junior architect with William Miller in Ithaca for three years while teaching at Cornell for one year. In 1880, along with William Sydney Wicks, an M.I.T. architecture graduate, he opened a practice in Auburn, New York, moving a year later to 69 Genesee Street in Buffalo, New York in 1881. Green was thereafter active in Buffalo, New York through about 1930 where his work left a lasting impression on the city of Buffalo, and it includes such noteworthy structures as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Young Men's Christian Association Central Building, and Twentieth Century Club (1894); all three listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His public buildings include the Buffalo Savings Bank, the Market Arcade, the Buffalo Crematory, and South Park High School, The First Presbyterian Church of Buffalo, Kibler High School, Tonawanda Municipal Building, and Dayton Art Institute (1930) among others.

History In around 1872 the land was purchased by three families and was split into two sections: the first was owned by the Sursock and Tueni families of Beirut, and the second was owned by the Khouri family of Haifa. Both sections were the same size and together measured 17,500 dunams in total. An Arab sharecropper village existed on the land called Qira. It was located near the spring of the Shofet river.Levinger, 1987, p. 153‚Äì155 Yehoshua Hankin planting a tree in the Jezreel Valley. Yehoshua Hankin, a prominent Zionist activist and one of the managers of the Palestine Land Development Company, who had had close ties with the Sursock family since 1891, planned to purchase land in the Jezreel Valley owned by the family. In 1924, the Sursock family initiated the deal and Hankin purchased the section of the land that was owned by the Sursock and Tueni families (8,750 dunams) for a price of 37,686 Palestine pounds. On 6 February 1934, after years of negotiations, Hankin purchased the other half from the Khouri family (8,750 dunams) for a price of 40,391 Palestine pounds. The Khouri family finally agreed to the deal because it went bankrupt. 3,200 dunams were transferred to the kibbutz of HaZore'a.Levinger, Ma'oz, 1983, p.27 Early years In 1933, 250 agricultural land plots were offered for sale. The buyers were Jews from Mandatory Palestine as well as families from Bahrain, Germany, Netherlands, Greece, Lebanon, Lithuania, Iraq, and Poland. The first families arrived on 2 December 1935 and populated 100 of the 250 land plots; they started fencing their plots and building permanent structures. The rest of the land was still held by Beduin sharecroppers from Qira, who refused to leave.Levinger, 1987, p. 156‚Äì158 Yokneam was unique because land was privately owned by the residents, who later transferred the land to the Jewish National Fund. Yokneam 1937 Yokneam watchtower 1937 The moshava suffered in its early years from lack of support from the authorities, undrained valley lands, hilly lands difficult for agriculture, and an overall economic crisis, leading half of the families to leave. One of the reasons for the economic crisis was that most of the land acquired for Yokneam was still populated by the two Beduin tribes, who inhabited the arable land in the nearby plains. While most of the sharecroppers left and received compensation prior to the foundation of Yokneam, attempts to mediate between the remaining sharecroppers and the Jews failed. Another attempt was made in 1936 with the help of an influential emir, who tried to talk with the mukhtar of Qira, but the outbreak of the 1936‚Äì39 revolt suspended the mediation.Levinger, 1987, p. 165‚Äì166 Another reason was the geographical challenges. The arable plain was subjected to floods while the arable parts of the hills were far from the area designated for the settlement itself. The village was planned to be divided by the Haifa-Jenin road (today Highway 66), which on the one hand created difficulties in planning the settlement, while on the other hand gave it an advantage as it was connected to major urban centers. The settlement was also not connected by road to the western part of the Jezreel Valley, with an abundance of Jewish settlements.Levinger, Ma'oz, 1983, p.29 Yokneam's farmers could not drain rain water because the water flowed through the territories still owned by the tribes.Levinger, Ma'oz, 1983, pp.31‚Äì32 During the Arab revolt, militants from Yusuf Abu Durra's group put heavy pressure on the sharecroppers not to leave the land. Following the suspension of the talks, residents from Yokneam and HaZorea tried to take land by gradually fencing fields in September 1936, but after a violent incident the British police intervened and the land was returned to the sharecroppers.Levinger, 1987, p. 161‚Äì162 In May 1939, after the end of the revolt, the mukhtar of one of the Beduin tribes sent a letter to Hankin, telling him he was willing to evacuate the land because the tribe wanted to move to Shefa-'Amr. The other Beduin tribe later agreed to evacuate. By fall 1939, most of the sharecroppers had evacuated the fields and the remainder stayed in Qira itself. During the three years of the revolt, Yokneam's residents earned their living from growing plums on the hills and from outside jobs. The economic crisis ended in the 1940s after a member of the moshava, Perez Levinger, took it upon himself to administer the village. Levinger was described as the \\"central man, the leader, the Mukhtar, the ideological leader of Yokneam\\". In that time, Yokneam had some disputes with the nearby kibbutz of HaZorea over work, land, and water. In 1945 a municipality was established for Yokneam, with the status of a local council. In March 1948 the last sharecroppers fled the land in fear following the Arab defeat in the Battle of Mishmar HaEmek.Levinger, 1987, p. 168 After Israel's independence In July 1950, after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, a ma'abara (absorption camp) was erected within the boundaries of the moshava, which at the time retained the status of a local council. Levinger headed the local council until 1955. Between 1950 and 1955, the village absorbed 60 families and the ma'abara absorbed 350 families. Yokneam Maabara (1952) The maabara initially housed 250 families. In early 1952, another 400 families were transferred there. In 1952, Yokneam was considered unusual in that it had a single school for all regardless of whether they were religious or secular, or from the moshava or the tent camp. Yokneam was the only place in Israel where local elections were not held during the November 1950 local elections nationwide. The council of Yokneam, which was chosen in 1945, has decided to unite into a single list and thus was the sole candidate. The residents supported the decision and the new council promised to hold elections in the future. In 1967, Yokneam was split into two local councils - the moshava - which joined the Megiddo Regional Council - and Yokneam Illit - which later became a city. The division was made due to the desire of the residents of the moshava to remain a rural settlement and not a development town. Both the moshava and Yokneam Illit developed a cooperative relationship and built a joint industrial zone, in cooperation with the Druze towns of Daliyat al- Karmel and Isfiya. In the 1980s and 1990s, the moshava absorbed residents from urban areas. Today the moshava retains its rural character, with some residents working in agriculture and some outside the moshava. In 2013, the mayor of Yokneam Illit appealed to the Interior Minister of Israel to create a committee to examine the option of annexing the moshava into the city, which the residents of the moshava strongly opposed. Yokneam Illit's mayor said that the city needed space for expansion and the moshava was standing in the way. In December 2013 the moshava, with the help of the Megiddo municipality, held a conference in Yokneam, to show support for the independence of the moshava. The director of the Ramot Manasseh Park, where the moshava is located, has revealed that out of 75% of the households in the moshava, 98% signed petition against the annexation plan. As part of the opposition to the annexation plan, the new Megiddo council elected in the 2013 Israeli municipal elections decided to hold its first meeting in Yokneam.

Every year a new locality is chosen in Agra and is elaborately decorated with lights and flowers. The area is given a major facelift befitting the venue for the divine marriage. History The history of Ram Barat is said to go back around 125 years, when Lala Kokamal, a reputed business man, started the tradition of three days of festivities, revolving around the royal wedding. His influence has been so great on this festival that the road from where the Baraat proceeds has been named 'Lala Kokamal Marg', and the grounds where Ram Lila is held are named after Lala Kokamal. In 1966 when he died his son Radharaman took charge as secretary of Ramlila until his death in 1978. Until their deaths in 2016, his youngest son Raj Narain was the treasurer of Ramlila and his Grandson Hari kishan Agarwal was the Vice president of this prestigious society. Now Lala Kokamal's Great Grandson Rajeev K Agarwal has also started devoting his time to the mega event by mainly supporting the fundraising activities. *In 2008, the Ram Barat was held in the Kamla Nagar area. *In 2010 it was held in the Balkeshwar area. *In 2013 Jank puri was celebrated at Kamla Nagar Agra. *In 2015 Janakpuri was celebrated from 8-10 October at Gandhi Nagar locality. *In 2018 Janakpuri was celebrated from 7-10 October in Vijay Nagar locality.

Horn (August 1, 1926 ‚Äì May 25, 1975) was a director of US prime time television programs in the 1960s and 1970s, and helped shape a number of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù adventure and sci-fi series, including Mission: Impossible, Mannix, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, and Wonder Woman. Contemporary fan-sites such as the viewer polling pages of the Internet Movie Database (hereafter IMDB) and TV.com show Horn‚Äôs work to have stood the test of time; many of the 94 episodes he directed for 34 prime-time television series rank among the more popular moments in the first ‚ÄúGolden Age of Television‚Äù. Horn was born in Bangor, Maine. He started directing in 1959-1962 for Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, and was soon among a stable of directors working on such popular prime-time programs as The Untouchables, Route 66, and The Fugitive. Horn‚Äôs most sustained contribution to one series was directing ten episodes of Mission: Impossible, including five in the first season. His ‚ÄúOperation Rogosh‚Äù (1966), the series‚Äô 3rd episode, ties among IMDB voters for the most popular first-season show, and most of his other efforts get high marks. In one of Horn‚Äôs second-season episodes, ‚ÄúTrek‚Äù, Peter Graves appeared for the first time as ‚ÄúMr. Phelps‚Äù. TV pilot episodes Horn was responsible for a number of classic TV pilots. In 1967, he directed the first episode of Mannix (‚ÄúMy Name is Mannix‚Äù), written by Bruce Geller, the creator and producer of Mission: Impossible. Half of the images for the show‚Äôs subsequently-famous opening montage derive from this production. Horn directed an additional seven episodes for the series. Also in 1967, he directed the second pilot for the series Ironside (‚ÄúSplit Second to an Epitaph‚Äù). His last pilot, and final television production, was for the series Wonder Woman in 1975, and was nominated for an Emmy in graphic design and title sequencing. Sci-fi shows Along with adventure, science-fiction was among Horn‚Äôs most successful genres. Of three first-season episodes he directed for The Outer Limits, two are ranked in the top ten by IMDB users, and one, ‚ÄúThe Man Who Was Never Born‚Äù is considered among the series‚Äô classics. Horn‚Äôs single Lost in Space entry (‚ÄúInvaders from the 5th Dimension‚Äù) likewise makes the IMDB top ten of the series‚Äô first-season episodes. In the premier season of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, the four most popular episodes among IMDB users were all directed by Horn, with ‚ÄúThe Fear-Makers‚Äù called by one user ‚Äúthe first truly great episode‚Äù.TV.com users ranked the Horn episode \\"Sub Sunk Here\\" the best of the first season Sub Sunk Here Other genres Even when Horn turned his attention to less familiar genres, such as the Western, he often managed to get the best performances out of his actors. The one episode he directed for The High Chaparral (‚ÄúThe Price of Revenge‚Äù) ties among IMDB fans for the best first-season entry, and is among the most popular in the whole series. Late in his career, Horn turned to police shows, directing nine episodes of The Rookies, three for Police Woman, one each for McMillan & Wife, and The Mod Squad.The Mod Squad episode is listed on Horn's TV.com page but not on IMDB.com Leonard Horn, TV.com He also directed for the short-lived 1974 ABC police drama Nakia.

It is part of the 305th Air Mobility Wing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey. The 2nd Air Refueling Squadron is the second-oldest squadron in the Air Force, having over 100 years of service to the nation. Deployed to the Philippines after World War I, during the 1941-1942 Battle of the Philippines, it was wiped out, with the Japanese forcing some of the personnel to endure the Bataan Death March. It was re-formed as an air refueling squadron by Strategic Air Command in 1949. Today, it operates the KC-10 Extender aircraft, conducting aerial refueling missions. History=Origins The Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps activated the squadron on 12 May 1915. It was the second to be organized in the United States Army, as noted by its numerical designation. It was organized at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, where the only Aviation School at that time was located, and it was from this school that most of its squadron members came from. Other members were taken from the 1st Aero Squadron, which was the only completely equipped squadron in the Army. It was the policy of the Aviation School to completely train and equip a squadron before sending it into the field. The squadron consisted of six flying officers and thirty-nine enlisted men, primarily mechanics. Two officers and ten men were transferred from the 1st Aero Squadron. It sailed from San Francisco for Manila on 5 January 1916. After two weeks of quarantine, the unit reached its station on Corregidor on 14 February without aircraft. It was the first complete aviation unit assigned outside of the United States. The 2d received four Martin S-Hydro seaplanes (Signal Corps numbers 56-59) on 13 March and 15 April, and began flying on 8 May 1916. A radio transmitter was set up in one aircraft, giving the aircraft a broadcast range of 29 miles. On 28 June, the company provided artillery spotting and adjustment for target practice with the Fort Mills batteries. Personnel for a second company were assembled and the unit was re-designated the 2d Aero Squadron on 20 July 1917.Hennessey, pp. 151-152, 156-157, 165. World War I 2d Aero Squadron (Later Squadron \\"A\\"), Kelly Field Texas, 1918 After the United States entered World War I, the squadron was ordered back to the United States. It sailed from Manila on 15 October 1917, arriving in San Francisco on 17 November. It was immediately transferred to Kelly Field, Texas, reaching the post on 22 November. At Kelly, a number of men were transferred and sent to the new training airfields that were being established throughout the country, serving as trainers for new recruits and as experienced backbones. Many of the men of the squadron were assigned to Call Field, Wichita Falls, Texas. The remainder of the squadron was sent to Kelly Field #2, which meant that the squadron would be a training unit at Kelly (Kelly Field #1 was used for training personnel for overseas service).Kroll At Field #2, the mechanics began assembling Curtiss JN-4D Trainers. After a few months, the men had little time to worry about their assignment at Kelly Field when suddenly various squadrons began to be ordered for overseas duty in France. The men of the squadron began to submit transfer requests to be included in these outgoing squadrons. Some transfers were approved, however, most were retained at Kelly Field. The 2d squadron was assigned to \\"Advanced Cross Country\\" and \\"Aerobatic\\" flight training. The squadron was re-designated as Squadron \\"A\\", Kelly Field, on 1 July 1918. At the end of the war, only six members of the squadron remained from the initial cadre that was formed up in San Diego in 1915. The squadron was demobilized on 18 November 1918. Inter-war years 2d Observation Squadron Thomas-Morse O-19, Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands, about 1932 2d Observation Squadron Douglas O-46s in flight over Luzon, Philippines, 1938. 2d Observation Squadron Douglas O-46A 36-139 Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 1941 (4M tail designation of 4th Composite Group) After World War I, the unit was re-organized as a new organization, designated as the 2d Aero Squadron on 3 June 1919 at Rockwell Field, California. A few days later, it was re-designated as the 2d Aero Squadron (Observation). Many of the men were experienced mechanics and officers who had served either in France or at training units in the United States during World War I. After being organized, the squadron was transferred by train to San Francisco, California, where it boarded a ship bound for Manila, in the Philippine Islands, arriving on 24 December. The squadron was assigned to the Philippine Department, and was stationed initially at Kindley Field, on Corregidor Island. The squadron was equipped with some Curtiss HS2L and N-9 amphibian flying boats. Initially attached to Post Headquarters, Fort Mills, it became part of the 1st Observation (later 4th Composite Group) on 10 March 1920. The squadron's primary mission was coastal patrols and reconnaissance in and around the Manila Bay region. It participated in exercises and maneuvers with Army ground forces and Naval forces were a regular and important part of its mission. Another mission of the 2d Observation Squadron during the 1920s was aerial mapping of the Philippines, the topography of many of the islands were largely unknown. On 8 April 1924, it was formally consolidated with its World War I and Philippines predecessor unit, giving the squadron a history dating to 1 December 1915.Clay, As with other squadrons in the Philippines, the 2d received a wide variety of second-line hand-me-down aircraft transferred from units in the United States during the austere years of Air Corps procurement during the 1920s and 1930s. It operated various Loening seaplanes, Dayton- Wright DH-4s, Thomas-Morse O-19s, Sikorsky and Douglas Dolphin amphibians, as well as other aircraft that the Army would send from the United States that it thought could be used in the Philippines. In June 1929, the squadron was moved off Corregidor to the 4th Composite Group and Philippines Department Headquarters at Nichols Field, near Manila.Edmonds, As a result of the rising tensions with the Japanese Empire in 1940, the defenses of the Philippines were judged to be abysmal, and a reinforcement effort was made to defend the islands against any Japanese aggression. Although beginning in 1938, the Army sent some Douglas O-46 observation monoplanes, these were supplemented in 1941 with some new Curtiss O-52 Owls, and the squadron was moved to Clark Field on 1 November 1940. In late 1941, the 4th Composite Group was broken up due to the expanding Air Corps presence in the Philippines. The pursuit squadrons were assigned to the new 24th Pursuit Group and the 28th Bomb Squadron was assigned to the incoming 19th Bombardment Group. The 2d Observation Squadron was reassigned directly to Far East Air Force (FEAF) headquarters as a courier and reconnaissance squadron, reporting to the Headquarters staff. It was moved to Nichols Field on 1 November. World War II The Japanese attack on the Air Corps bases in the Philippines on 8 December 1941 destroyed two of the O-46s at Nichols Field, and almost all of the O-52s. With Japanese control of the air over Luzon during December 1941, the unarmed planes of the 2d Observation Squadron didn't have a chance. By the time FEAF headquarters moved to Darwin, Australia on 31 December 1941, the remainder of the squadron's aircraft were destroyed either on the ground or in the air. The order for all Air Corps units to move to Bataan Airfield in early January 1942 meant that any remaining squadron personnel left the Manila area. Remains of the squadron were scattered among remaining Air Corps resistance forces during the ensuing battle in the early spring of 1942. They were likely being assigned to Army ground forces under V Interceptor Command. The 2d Observation Squadron was carried on as an active unit under the Fifth Air Force after 5 May 1942 until 2 April 1946 when it was inactivated. Strategic Air Command In the postwar years, limited funding for the Department of Defense meant that Strategic Air Command(SAC) was severely limited in the number of units it could support with personnel. SAC also wanted its units to have pre-World War II designations for its units as much as possible. The development of In- flight refueling, long a dream of airmen, was being developed for operational use in the late 1940s. In 1948, the 2d Bombardment Group deployed to England during the Berlin Blockade, but its B-29 Superfortresses could not reach Moscow if a war broke out from its base in England without it being a one-way mission due to a lack of range.2d Bombardment Group official history KB-29M air refueling another B-29MR Superfortress, modified with a nose probe. SAC activated the 2d Air Refueling Squadron, (Medium) on 1 January 1949 as a new squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona and it was assigned to the like-designated 2d Bombardment Group. It was one of the first units to be equipped with the new KB-29M Superfortress tankers equipped with a British- developed hose refueling system. The 2d Bomb Group was transitioning to the new B-50A Superfortress bomber, and SAC was anxious to give its B-50s an air- refueling capability to extend its range. The Group spent the next months training refueling the bombers with the tankers before the Wing was transferred to its operational base at Chatham Air Force Base, Georgia on 16 September 1949. Within a few months, the Wing's first deployment to England took place with its KB-29M tankers in February 1950. The KB-29s were forward deployed to The KB-29Ms flew via Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and Keflavik, Iceland. However, the extremely cold weather in Iceland (-25F) caused difficulties with the aircraft, and the en route MATS services were inadequate. Also, the operation of the hose refueling system was, what was called a \\"Rube Goldberg Affair\\". In addition, it was found that malfunctions in the hose system meant fuel leaks were a hazard. After exercises in England and West Germany, the Wing returned to Chatham in April.Baugher, KB-29M tanker, B-29MR receiver KB-29P with the flying boom extended During May and June, it began receiving the Boeing-developed KB-29P using the flying boom aerial refueling technique which is still in use today.Baugher, Boeing KB-29P Superfortress The wing also transitioned from B-50As to B-50D models, and the next several months were sent in transition training. In May 1951, the wing was ordered deployed to several bases in England, with the 2d ARS being assigned to RAF Lakenheath. None of the problems experienced with the hose and reel system of the KB-29Ms, and, also because of the warmer weather, the deployment was a much more successful operation. However, during operations in England, on 7 June a KB-29 crashed near Kircudreightshire, Scotland. The 2d ARS had the distinction of performing the first USAF refueling of an RAF aircraft, when it refueled three RAF Meteors from RAF Tarrant Tuston. The squadron also flew its first mission to the new SAC base at Sidi Slimane Air Base, French Morocco when a KB-29 landed on the unfinished runway on 13 July. On the redeployment to the United States at the end of August, all 19 of the squadrons KB-29Ps were to fly from Lakenheath to the Wing's new home at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, on a great circle route. This was the longest over- water non-stop flight over the Atlantic in which all aircraft departed the same day and landed on the next. The bombers returned to Hunter at the end of September, and as they approached the Atlantic Coast, they were met by the KB-29Ps. 47 hook-ups were made to refuel two squadrons of B-50s, taking 75.5 total flying hours and 10,140 gallons of aviation gasoline. No incidents were experienced. In July 1952, the squadron supported the deployment of the F-84s of the 31st Fighter-Escort Wing at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia to Japan. The operation began on 4 July when the tankers refueled the F-84s over Wink, Texas, en route to Castle Air Force Base, California. Trans-Pacific refuelings were accomplished, and the 2d was joined by tankers from the 91st and 93d ARS as they island-hopped from Castle to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, Midway Island, Wake Island, Eniwetok Atoll, Guam, Iwo Jima and on to Japan in an 11,000 mile mission. The 2d returned to Hunter on 11 July. Another deployment to RAF Lakenheath was made in September 1952, with the 2d ARS providing support to both SAC B-50 and B-29 bombers, as well as F-84 fighters of the federalized 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing, which was deployed to England. The squadron returned in December. In August 1953, the squadron was stood down and all of its KB-29s were transferred to Tactical Air Command. The crews were sent to various training schools. In October, the first KC-97G Stratotanker arrived, the last of 22 new aircraft in January 1954. Although propeller- driven, the KC-97s were significantly faster than the KB-29s and were designed for aerial refueling. The planes were designed to refuel SAC's B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bomber, with the 2d Bombardment Wing began to receive also in 1953. A 2d ARS KC-97 refueling a B-47 Stratojet in the late 1950s On 6‚Äì7 August 1954, KC-97s from the 2d ARS refueled B-47s during \\"Operation Leap Frog\\", a 10,000 mile non-stop flight from Hunter to French Morocco and back to Hunter. The KC-97s were forward deployed to Lajes Field, Azores prior to the B-47s leaving Hunter. On the return flight back, Kindsley Field, Bermuda was the forward deployment point for the 2d ARS. This demonstrated the capability of the KC-97 and B-47 to perform together. For the next decade, the squadron carried out routine REFLEX deployments to SAC bases French Morocco, as well as training flights in the United States. In the late 1950s, the jet-powered KC-135 Stratotanker was developed, and with the retirement of the B-47 from SAC service, the 2d Air Refueling Squadron was inactivated in April 1963 concurrently with the move of SAC out of Hunter. On 19 September 1985 the 2d Air Refueling Squadron was consolidated with the 2d Observation Squadron (Medium), a unit that was last active 2 April 1946. This action was directed by Department of the Air Force Letter DAF/MPM 662q Attachment 2 (Inactive Units), 19 September 1985. The Consolidated Unit retained the Designation of 2d Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy\\", and the consolidation gave the SAC organization a history dating to 1915. The squadron was re-activated on 3 January 1989 as part of the 2d Bombardment Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana as part of a SAC reorganization of its KC-10 Extender tanker fleet to have 2 squadrons of 10 tankers each. It was equipped with KC-10s transferred from the 32d Air Refueling Squadron. Modern era With the inactivation of Strategic Air Command in June 1992 and the realignment of Air Mobility Command's tanker force, the 2d ARS was reassigned to the 458th Operations Group on 1 June 1992. Using KC-10 aircraft, the squadron airlifted humanitarian equipment and supplies to Somalia, 1992‚Äì1994. Deployed aircrews and aircraft on other contingency operations in many parts of the world, including Haiti in 1994. It continued operations from Barksdale until 1 October 1994 when it was moved to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey where it was transferred to the 305th Operations Group on 1 July 1995. It supported NATO operations over Serbia in 1999. The squadron also refueled aircraft enforcing no-fly zones over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the mid-1990s and over northern and southern Iraq between 1992 and 2002.Rogers, Today, the 2d ARS continues to remain ready to provide the United States with the Global Reach necessary to support our national security objectives, while placing an increased emphasis on squadron members' families-the unsung heroes of the unit's successful operations.305th Operations Group website Lineage ; Squadron A, Kelly Field * Organized as the 1st Company, 2d Aero Squadron on 1 December 1915 : Redesignated 2d Aero Squadron on 20 July 1917 : Redesignated Squadron A, Kelly Field, on 23 July 1918 : Demobilized on 18 November 1918 * Consolidated 8 April 1924 with the 2d Observation Squadron as the 2d Observation Squadron ; 2d Observation Squadron * Organized as 2d Aero Squadron on 3 June 1919 : Redesignated 2d Aero Squadron (Observation) on 5 June 1919 : Redesignated 2d Squadron (Observation) on 14 March 1921 : Redesignated 2d Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923 * Consolidated 8 April 1924 with Squadron A, Kelly Field : Redesignated 2d Observation Squadron (Medium) on 26 February 1942 : Inactivated on 2 April 1946 * Consolidated on 19 September 1985 with the 2d Air Refueling Squadron, Medium as the 2d Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy ; 2d Air Refueling Squadron : Constituted as the 2d Air Refueling Squadron, Medium on 27 October 1948 : Activated on 1 January 1949 : Discontinued and inactivated on 1 April 1963 * Consolidated on 19 September 1985 with the 2d Observation Squadron' and redesignated 2d Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy (Remained inactive) : Activated on 3 January 1989 : Redesignated 2d Air Refueling Squadron on 1 September 1991 Assignments * Post Headquarters, Rockwell Field, 1 December 1915 * Philippine Department, February 1916 (attached to Post Headquarters, Fort William McKinley, February 1916, Post Headquarters, Fort Mills, Corregidor, February 1916) * Post Headquarters, Kelly Field, November 1917 - 18 November 1918 * Post Headquarters, Rockwell Field, 3 June 1919 * Philippine Department, February 1916 (attached to Post Headquarters, Fort Mills, 24 December 1919) * 1st Observation Group (later 4th Observation Group, 4th Composite Group, 10 March 1920 * Far East Air Force (later Fifth Air Force, 28 October 1941 ‚Äì 2 April 1946 * 2d Bombardment Group, 1 January 1949 (attached to 2d Bombardment Wing after 10 February 1951 ) * 2d Bombardment Wing, 16 June 1952 ‚Äì 1 April 1963; 3 January 1989 * 2d Operations Group, 1 September 1991 * 458th Operations Group, 1 June 1992 * 305th Operations Group, 1 July 1995‚Äìpresent Stations * Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, 1 December 1915 ‚Äì 2 January 1916 * Fort William McKinley, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 3 February 1916 * Fort Mills, Corregidor, Philippine Islands, 14 February 1916-c. 15 October 1917 * Kelly Field, Texas, November 1917-18 November 1918 * Rockwell Field, California, 5 June-29 November 1919 * Fort Mills, Corregidor, Philippine Islands, 24 December 1919 * Kindley Field, Corregidor, Philippine Islands, 15 October 1920 * Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands, June 1929 * Clark Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 1 November 1940 * Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands, November‚ÄìDecember 1941 * Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, 1 January 1949 * Chatham Air Force Base, Georgia, 16 September 1949 : Deployed at: RAF Marham, England, February‚ÄìApril 1950 (KB-29M) : Deployed at: RAF Lakenheath, England, May‚ÄìSeptember 1951 (KB-29P) * Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, 28 September 1951 ‚Äì 1 April 1963 : Deployed at: Ben Guerir Air Base, French Morocco, August‚ÄìSeptember 1954 (KC-97G) : Deployed at: Sidi Slimane Air Base, French Morocco, July‚ÄìAugust 1956 (KC-97G) : Deployed at: Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Labrador, February 1961 (KC-97G) * Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, 3 January 1989 * McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, 1 October 1994 ‚Äì present Aircraft * Martin S-Hydro (1916‚Äì1917) *Curtiss JN-4 (1917‚Äì1918) *Curtiss HS2L (1919‚Äì1925) *Curtiss Model N-9 (1919‚Äì1925) *Loening S-1 (1919‚Äì1925, 1925‚Äì1931) *Dayton-Wright DH-4 (1919‚Äì1925, 1925‚Äì1931) *Douglas O-2 (1925‚Äì1931) *Douglas World Cruiser O-5 (1925‚Äì1931) *Loening OA-1 (1925‚Äì1931) *Loening COA-1 (1925‚Äì1931) *Thomas-Morse O-19 (1931‚Äì1938) *Sikorsky C-6 (1931‚Äì1938) *Douglas OA-3 Dolphin (1931‚Äì1938) *Douglas O-46 (1938‚Äì1941) *Douglas OA-4 Dolphin (1938‚Äì1941) *Grumman OA-9 Goose (1938‚Äì1941) *O-52 Owl (1941) * KB-29M/P Superfortress (1950‚Äì1953) * KC-97G Stratotanker (1953‚Äì1963) * KC-10 Extender (1989‚Äìpresent) See also * List of American Aero Squadrons References=NotesBibliography Edmonds, Walter D.

It was initially developed by the mathematical psychologists David Krantz (1968) and Amos Tversky (1967). The theory was given a comprehensive mathematical exposition in the first volume of Foundations of Measurement (Krantz, Luce, Suppes & Tversky, 1971), which Krantz and Tversky wrote in collaboration with the mathematical psychologist R. Duncan Luce and philosopher Patrick Suppes. Krantz & Tversky (1971) also published a non-technical paper on polynomial conjoint measurement for behavioural scientists in the journal Psychological Review. As with the theory of conjoint measurement, the significance of polynomial conjoint measurement lies in the quantification of natural attributes in the absence of concatenation operations. Polynomial conjoint measurement differs from the two attribute case discovered by Luce & Tukey (1964) in that more complex composition rules are involved. Polynomial conjoint measurement=Krantz's (1968) schema Most scientific theories involve more than just two attributes; and thus the two variable case of conjoint measurement has rather limited scope. Moreover, contrary to the theory of n ‚Äì component conjoint measurement, many attributes are non-additive compositions of other attributes (Krantz, et al., 1971). Krantz (1968) proposed a general schema to ascertain the sufficient set of cancellation axioms for a class of polynomial combination rules he called simple polynomials. The formal definition of this schema given by Krantz, et al., (1971, p. 328) is as follows. Let Y =\\\\big\\\\\\\\{y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n \\\\big\\\\\\\\}. The set S\\\\left(Y\\\\right) is the smallest set of simple polynomials such that: * y_i \\\\in S\\\\left(Y\\\\right), i = 1,\\\\ldots, n; * Y_1, Y_2 \\\\subset Y such that Y_1 \\\\cap Y_2 = \\\\varnothing, G_1 \\\\in S\\\\left(Y_1\\\\right) and G_2 \\\\in S\\\\left(Y_2\\\\right), then G_1 + G_2\\\\, and G_1 G_2\\\\, are in S\\\\left(Y\\\\right). Informally, the schema argues: a) single attributes are simple polynomials; b) if G1 and G2 are simple polynomials that are disjoint (i.e. have no attributes in common), then G1 \\\\+ G2 and G1 \\\\times G2 are simple polynomials; and c) no polynomials are simple except as given by a) and b). Let A, P and U be single disjoint attributes. From Krantz‚Äôs (1968) schema it follows that four classes of simple polynomials in three variables exist which contain a total of eight simple polynomials: * Additive: A + P + U\\\\, ; * Distributive: \\\\left(A + P\\\\right)U\\\\, ; plus 2 others obtained by interchanging A, P and U; * Dual distributive: A P + U\\\\, plus 2 others as per above; * Multiplicative: A P U\\\\, . Krantz‚Äôs (1968) schema can be used to construct simple polynomials of greater numbers of attributes. For example, if D is a single variable disjoint to A, B, and C then three classes of simple polynomials in four variables are A + B + C + D, D + (B + AC) and D + ABC. This procedure can be employed for any finite number of variables. A simple test is that a simple polynomial can be ‚Äòsplit‚Äô into either a product or sum of two smaller, disjoint simple polynomials. These polynomials can be further ‚Äòsplit‚Äô until single variables are obtained. An expression not amenable to ‚Äòsplitting‚Äô in this manner is not a simple polynomial (e.g. AB + BC + AC (Krantz & Tversky, 1971)). Axioms Let A = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{a, b, c, \\\\ldots \\\\big\\\\\\\\}, P = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{p, q, r, \\\\ldots \\\\big\\\\\\\\} and U = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{u, v, w, \\\\ldots \\\\big\\\\\\\\} be non-empty and disjoint sets. Let \\" \\\\succsim \\" be a simple order. Krantz et al. (1971) argued the quadruple Z = \\\\langle A, P, U, \\\\succsim \\\\rangle is a polynomial conjoint system if and only if the following axioms hold. * WEAK ORDER. * SINGLE CANCELLATION. The relation \\" \\\\succsim \\" satisfies single cancellation upon A whenever \\\\left(a, p, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, p, u\\\\right) if and only if \\\\left(a, q, v\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, q, v\\\\right) holds for all a, b \\\\in A; p, q \\\\in P and u, v \\\\in U. Single cancellation upon P and U is similarly defined. * DOUBLE CANCELLATION. The relation \\" \\\\succsim \\" upon A \\\\times P satisfies double cancellation if and only if for all a, b, c \\\\in A and p, q, r \\\\in P, \\\\left(a, q, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, p, u\\\\right) and \\\\left(b, r, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(c, q, u\\\\right) therefore \\\\left(a, r, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(c, p, u\\\\right) is true for all u \\\\in U. The condition holds similarly upon A \\\\times U and U \\\\times P. * JOINT SINGLE CANCELLATION. The relation \\" \\\\succsim \\" upon A \\\\times P satisfies joint single cancellation such that \\\\left(a, p, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, q, u\\\\right) if and only if \\\\left(a, p, v\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, q, v\\\\right) is true for all a, b \\\\in A; p, q \\\\in P and u, v \\\\in U. Joint independence is similarly defined for A \\\\times U and U \\\\times P. * DISTRIBUTIVE CANCELLATION. Distributive cancellation holds upon A \\\\times P \\\\times U if and only if \\\\left(a, p, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(c, r, v\\\\right), \\\\left(b, q, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(d, s, v\\\\right) and \\\\left(d, r, v\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, p, u\\\\right) implies \\\\left(a, q, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(c, s, v\\\\right) is true for all a, b, c, d\\\\in A; p, q, r, s \\\\in P and u, v\\\\in U. * DUAL DISTRIBUTIVE CANCELLATION. Dual distributive cancellation holds upon A \\\\times P \\\\times U if and only if \\\\left(a, r, w\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(c, s, v\\\\right), \\\\left(d, p, u\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, t, x\\\\right), \\\\left(d, r, x\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(e, s, u\\\\right) and \\\\left(c, t, y\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(d, q, y\\\\right) implies \\\\left(a, p, v\\\\right)\\\\succsim \\\\left(b, q, w\\\\right) is true for all a, b, c, d, e\\\\in A; p, q, r, s, t \\\\in P and u, v, w, x, y\\\\in U. *SOLVABILITY. The relation \\" \\\\succsim \\" upon A \\\\times P \\\\times U is solvable if and only if for all a, b\\\\in A; p, q \\\\in P and u, v \\\\in U, there exists c \\\\in A; r \\\\in P and w \\\\in U such that a \\\\sim \\\\left(b, q, w\\\\right) \\\\sim \\\\left(b, r, v\\\\right) \\\\sim \\\\left(c, q, v\\\\right). * ARCHIMEDEAN CONDITION.

Everyone was expected to do their part in making the event a success. With over 170 talks and 3 large lecture halls, this edition was by far the largest in the series of quadrennial Dutch events. The special side tents offering off-the-tracks program added to the open atmosphere which was manly driven by mixing technology, art and social aspects together.

Closed in 1983, the station is now operated as the Los Angeles Police Museum. It has been designated as a Historic Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Built from 1925-1926 at a cost of $100,000, the station opened in April 1926 in a ceremony attended by Chief Edgar Davis and Police Commissioners Birnbaum, Insley and Webster. A number of big cases were handled out of the Highland Park station; it was there that Det. Robert Grogan pursued the \\"Hillside Stranglers\\", Angelo Buono, Jr. and Kenneth Bianchi. (\\"In 1973, the Symbionese Liberation Army planted a bomb inside the station; it was a dud.\\") In the early 1980s, the building was cited for failure to meet seismic safety standards and was described as a \\"Shake and Bake Hellhole\\". The radical Symbionese Liberation Army (the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst and engaged in an infamous shootout with the LAPD in 1974) planted a bomb in the Highland Park Station in 1973, but it proved to be a dud. In 1942, future LAPD Chief Daryl Gates was arrested and briefly held at the Highland Park station after punching a police officer; in 1963, Gates returned as a police captain in command of the station. He later wrote, \\"Never dreaming I would voluntarily return to the station where I'd been brought in for punching a cop, I showed up for work, eager to continue trying out my talents as a boss.\\" The station was closed in 1983 as the Los Angeles Police Department moved its Northeast Division to a new location. With the vacant station threatened by demolition, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission declared the building a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #274) in January 1984; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places two months later in March 1984. It is the only precinct police station in California listed on the National Register. (The City of San Diego Police Headquarters, Jails and Courts building is also registered.) As late as 1985, the city considered several proposals to convert the building to commercial office and retail space, a live theater and restaurant. Television production Because it is Los Angeles' last surviving station built in the 1920s, the building has been sought-after as a filming location.

The Rose Garden is popular for all types of outdoor special events including theatrical performances and wedding ceremonies. The Japanese Tea Room and Garden, dedicated in 2006, is a small traditional Japanese garden conceived as a cultural exchange between the Sister Cities of Kurashiki, Japan and Kansas City, Missouri. The park was once a pasture belonging to Kansas City pioneer Seth Ward. During the Battle of Westport in American Civil War Confederate General Sterling Price is said to have to commanded his forces from gun emplacements on the south end of the park. In 1897 Ward leased the land to the Kansas City Country Club for its first golf course. In 1907 J.C. Nichols bought land around the course to form the Country Club District and Country Club Plaza. In 1925 when the golf club moved to Mission Hills, Kansas the land became a city park. In 1977 artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the Walk Ways with 12,500 m2 of orange-yellow coloured shiny nylon fabric. In 1979 Neal Patterson, Cliff Illig and Paul Gorup founded the Cerner Corporation while on a picnic in the park.

It had a launch weight of a 15-year design life and was the first commercial communications satellite built in Japan. Its payload is composed of 28 Ku band transponders with a total bandwidth of 828 MHz. It was originally ordered by Space Communications Corporation, but it was later merged and absorbed by JSAT Corporation and by the time of the actual launch it was a fylly used Superbird-C2 as a replacement for Superbird-C to provide communications services to Japan, Eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean. History On April 2005 Space Communications Corporation (SCC) issued an RFP for Superbird-7, a spacecraft destined to replace the aging Superbird-C. On June 28 MELCO got first contract negotiations right, and on October 31, SCC and MELCO successfully concluded the contract negotiation. On November 1, 2005, SCC makes the orders to MELCO official for the first commercial communications satellite to be built in Japan, the Superbird-7. The contract called for on orbit delivery, with MELCO handling every detail from construction to launch procurement and on orbit testing for final hand over to the customer. It was not only the first SCC order for a commercial communications satellite built in Japan, but the first such order ever. This event meant that MELCO officially entered the market. Superbird-7 was expected to weight around , have 28 Ku band transponders, a design life of 15 years and be launched on the first quarter of 2008. It was going to be renamed as Superbird-C2 once in orbit and be stationed on the 144¬∞E where it would replace the aging Superbird-C. It was expected to offer its services in Japan, Eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean. On March 2008, SCC becomes a fully owned subsidiary of SKY Perfect JSAT Group. On the SKY Perfect JSAT board meeting of August 6, 2008, it was resolved to merge SKY Perfect Communications, JSAT Corporation and Space Communications Corporation. The merger would see SKY Perfect absorb JSAT and SCC and both legacy companies dissolved. Thus, by the time of launch, Superbird-7 was a JSAT spacecraft. Superbird-7 was successfully launched along AMC-21 by an Ariane 5 ECA on August 14, 2008, at 20:44 UTC. It separated from the spacecraft at 21:09 UTC and less than an hour later, at 22:03 UTC, it had already spread its solar panels. After the successful launch, Superbird-7 was renamed as Superbird-C2. On October 17, 2008 MELCO announced that they had performed the final handover of the spacecraft to JSAT. They had performed all orbital maneuvers to its correct orbital slot on the 144¬∞East position, had completed the on-orbit tests and performed the necessary acceptance tests. This concluded the commission phase and the spacecraft was put into service. On August 1, 2012,JSAT and Panasonic Avionics Corporation announced an agreement for under which Panasonic would commit to use the Superbird-C2 beams for its eXConnect in-flight Internet connectivity service in South East Asia.

The former two road locomotive shed is on the left. History The 29 mile long railway from Dyce to Mintlaw opened on 18 July 1861, with the 13 mile section from Maud to Peterhead opening the following year. A 15 mile long section north to Fraserburgh opened on 24 April 1865.Awdry, (1990). p.132 The line was built by the Formartine and Buchan Railway Company, which was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 30 July 1866. On 2 August 1897, the GNoSR opened a section from Ellon to Boddam. Finally on 1 July 1903 a branch from Fraserburgh to St Combs was constructed. Being partly unfenced this was classified as a light railway and was the last line to be built by the GNoSR. In 1923 the GNoSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway, which was in turn nationalised on 1 January 1948. Construction These lines ran through farming country. Most of the promoters were farmers who wanted a line to transport their produce and livestock to market. The route of this railway was not chosen for engineering or traffic reasons. Since investment was soughtThomas chapter 10 from the local landowners their requests for the lines to be placed away from or near to their land was heeded. Indeed, Lord Saltoun invested ¬£6000 but insisted in having a station for his sole use placed close to a road leading to his mansion. This was to be fully signalled and operated at the railway company's expense. His Lordship, his heirs and successors would have the right to have all passenger and goods trains to be stopped on request. A level crossing had to be provided and a gateman employed. Lord Saltoun had the right to sack him if he performed his duties in an uncivil fashion.Thomas chapter 10 On the other hand, the company was instructed to keep away from the Haddo Estate. But for the objections of The Earl of Aberdeen several more stations would have been constructed. The plans were changed many times during construction. Usage Traffic on this line was very seasonal. When the herring fisheries were active, whale and seal oil was being landed and at harvest time the line was very busy with freight. Several auctioneering businesses set up in Maud to take advantage of the line to transport livestock.Thomas chapter 10 In summer there were also many passengers trains for holiday makers; however, away from these seasons the line was very quiet. There was a considerable protest from certain members of the community when the railway company started offering cheap Sunday fares to golfers who were attracted to the new course which had opened at Cruden Bay.

Formartine and Buchan Way near the former Maud station where the path divides for either Peterhead or Fraserburgh Closure and current use Passenger services were withdrawn by the Scottish Region of British Railways in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. Freight trains continued to operate to Peterhead until 1970 and Fraserburgh until 1979. This was in spite of the fact a considerable amount of freight traffic was being generated by the off shore oil and gas industry. The track was subsequently lifted and much of the route now forms the Formartine and Buchan Way, a long distance footpath and cycle path. Transport Scotland is considering re-opening sections of this line. The population in the area, largely thanks to the oil and gas industry, has shown a considerable increase since the line was closed. For example, the town of Ellon has 50% more inhabitants than it had in 1979.

This organ is not found on bony fish (teleosts), therefore, this type of shark repellent is selective to sharks and rays. Permanent magnets do not require power input, making them ideal for use in fisheries and as bycatch reduction devices. Sharkbanz, released in 2014, is a wearable commercially available device intended for recreational users. However independent tests of Sharkbanz products in 2018 highlighted that they did not work.  History  During November 2004, Sharkdefense researcher Eric Stroud accidentally dropped a magnet onto a rubber mat near a captive tank at the Oak Ridge Shark Laboratory. He noticed that juvenile nurse sharks (G. cirratum) near the tank wall swam away. While the initial event may have been due to vibrations, it led him to test the effects of the magnet on the captive sharks. Placing the magnet within the tank, Eric observed that nurse sharks avoided the region around the magnet. Follow-on tests in 2005 with Michael Herrmann at the laboratory used an acrylic Y-Maze and showed preference towards non-magnetic exits and strong conditioning. During February 2005, Patrick Rice and Eric Stroud conducted tonic immobility trials at the Bimini Biological Field Station, Bahamas, which confirmed that juvenile lemon sharks (N. brevirostris) and juvenile nurse sharks (G. cirratum) roused when permanent magnets were presented within 50 cm of the sharks nares. Mobility was not terminated when strong electromagnets were placed near the sharks. On January 1, 2009, a peer- reviewed publication described experiments in Australia showing the efficacy of using magnets to deter sharks.Rigg, D.P., Peverell, S.C., Hearndon, M., Seymour, J.E. 2009. Do elasmobranch reactions to magnetic fields in water show promise for bycatch mitigation? Marine & Freshwater Research, 60, 942-948. On January 12, 2010, Craig O'Connell from SharkDefense also published a peer- reviewed paper on the efficacy of magnetic shark repellents.O‚ÄôConnell, C.P., Rice, P.H., Stroud, E.M., Abel, D.C., Simuro, N.C. 2010. The Effects of Permanent Magnets on the Southern Stingray (Dasyatis americana) and the Nurse Shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum). Marine and Freshwater Behavior and Physiology. A second, confirming paper is currently in peer review. In 2014, Sharkbanz released its first commercially available product. The device is a bracelet or anklet which contains a rare-earth magnet.  Biology  Several species of sharks have demonstrated the ability to sense magnetic fields (Kalmijn, 1978; Ryan, 1980; Klimley, 1993; 2002). The Ampullae of Lorenzini organ within sharks is used to detect weak electrical fields at short ranges. The detection range of this organ is effective only within inches, as sharks sense bioelectrical fields in the final stages of prey capture. The flux per unit area of certain permanent magnets, particularly Neodymium-Iron-Boride and Barium-Ferrite magnets, corresponds closely with the detection range of the Ampullae of Lorenzini. The fields generated by these permanent magnets (ferrite and rare-earth types) decrease at the inverse cube of the distance from the magnet to sharks and rays. Therefore, at distances of a few meters from the magnet, the field exerted is less than the Earth's magnetic field. Animals which lack that Ampullae of Lorenzini organ do not display aversive behavior in close proximity to the magnetic field, making this technology selective. When a shark swims through the Earth's magnetic field, electromagnetic induction ‚Äì a phenomenon which generates voltage in an electrical conductor moving through a magnetic field ‚Äì creates an electric field around the shark. Minute differences in the Earth's magnetic field at different locations result in minute differences in the induced electric field which may be detected by the shark's sensitive electroreceptors, especially as the head region moves back and forth during swimming (Lohmann and Johnsen 2000).  Recent findings  In 2011, the first test of a permanent magnet repellent on a Great White shark was successfully conducted in South Africa with Chris Fallows and Craig O'Connell (SharkDefense). The test was successful, with the shark flinching despite feeding stimulus present, and was featured on Great White Invasion on Discovery Channel's Shark Week.A video link of the experiment is found here. Craig O‚ÄôConnell, previously a partner with Sharkdefense, completed his Master's Thesis at Coastal Carolina University with regards to magnetic shark repellents as selective shark bycatch reduction devices. His studies involved Southern Stingrays (D. americana), adults nurse sharks (G. cirratum), blacktip sharks (C. limbatus), adult lemon sharks (N. brevirostris), and Atlantic Sharpnose sharks (R. terranovae) and showed a reduction of shark catch on demersal longlines and rod-and-reel studies. Craig is currently a PhD student at U Mass Dartmouth, continuing shark magnetoreception studies. In 2008, the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F;) and James Cook University, Australia, reported success with permanent magnets in captive studies with grey reef sharks, hammerheads, sharp-nosed sharks, blacktip sharks, sawfish and the critically endangered spear tooth shark. In 1995 researchers found that sharks have a heightened sensitivity to low frequency electrical fields, at a close range. This helped with the development of technologies like SharkShield, which is a product that is used for various water-sport activities (such as surfing) that emits a 3-D electronic field that surrounds person who is using it. The closer a shark is to the SharkShield, the more likely the shark is to turn away in discomfort. In 2018 independent tests were carried out on five Shark Repellent technologies using Great white sharks. Only Shark Shield‚Äôs Ocean Guardian Freedom+ Surf showed measureable results, with encounters reduced from 96% to 40%. SharkBanz bracelet & SharkBanz surf leash, which utilises magnetic shark repellent technology, showed no measureable effect on reducing shark attacks.  Publications  PUBLISHED O‚ÄôConnell, C.P., D.C.

Dillard. It was the first novel written by Dillard, and featured the debut of Lt. Ingrid Tomson who went on to appear in several further Star Trek works. Plot The peaceful planet of Aritani becomes the center of a Romulan plot to gain power. A Romulan double agent and a severely injured Spock further complicate the situation. Production Before she wrote any Star Trek novels, Dillard described herself as a secret fan of the series and would smuggle the books into her home so that her husband didn't know that she read them. At the time she was an English lecturer at the American University in Washington D.C., and decided to give writing a try after she was fired from the University for attempting to organise a trade union. This gave her the time to develop the novel Mindshadow, which was her first attempt at writing any novel. She used Writer's Market to ensure that she followed the correct format, and sent it into Pocket Books without showing it anyone else. After a year, she hadn't received a response and so chased the editor of Pocket Books for progress, only to find that they had lost her draft. So Dillard set about re-writing it, but before she finished the new version, she was contacted by the publishers as they had found her original version and wanted to publish it. One of the characters in the novel was based on her experiences with the University, after it hired her back and sacked the person who had fired her. In the novel, Lt.

It may be \\"notarized\\" or acknowledged and may be the subject of the statute of frauds. Like the contents of a prenuptial agreement, provisions vary widely but commonly includes provisions for division of property and spousal support in the event of divorce, death of one of the spouses, or breakup of marriage. Canada In Canada, postnuptial agreements are permitted, and in fact most provinces have statutes specifically allowing them. However, courts subject them to more legal scrutiny than prenuptial agreements. The reason for this is the legal theory that prior to marriage, neither spouse has any legal rights, so a spouse is not giving anything up by signing a prenuptial agreement. However, once married, various family law rights crystallize. Thus, if one enters into a postnuptial agreement, one is giving up rights that one already has.  United Kingdom  As with prenuptial agreements, a court has the discretion to reject the terms of a post-nuptial agreements, for example if the court finds that its terms are insufficient to meet the financial needs of partners and children.  United States =History Postnuptial agreements only came to be widely accepted in the United States in the latter half of the 20th century. Before that time, U.S. jurisprudence followed the notion that contracts, such as a postnuptial agreements, could not be valid when executed between a husband and wife. The inability of a husband and wife to contract with one another was due to the concept of marital unity: at the time of marriage, husband and wife become a single entity or person. Since one may not enter into a contract with one's self, a postnuptial agreement would thus be invalid. Even after U.S. courts began to reject marital unity as a legal theory, postnuptial agreements were rejected as being seen to encourage divorce. See Sec. 4, et seq., It was only in the 1970s that postnuptial agreements started to gain broad acceptance in the United States. Factors that contributed to this acceptance include the increase in divorce during the 1970s, and the implementation of so-called \\"no fault\\" divorces pursuant to which a married couple could get a divorce without the need for an accusation of misconduct against one or both spouses. In the wake of those changes, postnuptial agreements began to find acceptance in American jurisprudence. Legal requirements In the United States, much like prenuptial agreements, although laws vary by state there are five basic elements that must generally be met for a postnuptial agreement to be enforceable: # it must be in writing (oral promises of this kind are always unenforceable); # it must be executed voluntarily; # it must be done with full and/or fair disclosure at the time of execution; # it must not be unconscionable; and # it must be executed (signed) by both parties. Although not required in all states, it is a good idea for both spouses to be independently represented by lawyers when they negotiate and finalize a postnuptial agreement. Postnuptial agreements typically address one or more of the following concerns: *Providing for the assignation of marital property at the time of death of one spouse. These agreements may have a surviving spouse waive rights to certain property that they would otherwise have the right to inherit under a will or statutory scheme. *Agreements made in anticipation of separation. These agreements are entered into to avoid the time and cost of divorce proceedings. The disposition of property, other marital assets, custody, alimony and support and the like are agreed to by the marital partners upon separation and the agreement later, usually, incorporated into the final divorce decree. *Agreements that seek to affect the spouses' rights in a future divorce. These agreements address the division of the spouses' assets, including property obtained before and during the marriage, and often limit or waive alimony. Provisions that are included in a postnuptial agreement that relate to child custody or child support are not enforceable, nor are provisions that attempt to regulate routine aspects of the marital relationship.

It is part of the Gadigal Information Service and is the only radio station in Sydney providing full- time broadcasting to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Koori Radio is the city's only Indigenous music station. The music format is one third Australian Indigenous, one third world Indigenous and one-third other black music. The station broadcasts live from 07:00 to 00:00 with a music service overnight. It is a volunteer run organisation and is funded through listener support, grants and limited commercial sponsorship. History Koori Radio grew out of Radio Redfern which was established in the early 1980s. Originally it had programme time on other community station Radio Skid Row. During Australia's Bicentennial in 1988, Radio Redfern played a pivotal role in informing and educating the public about Indigenous responses to the celebration. It also acted as a communication channel for the thousands of Indigenous people from around Australia who had gathered in Sydney for protests. In 1993 Koori Radio came under the umbrella of Gadigal Information Service. It was then part of a series of national Indigenous radio broadcasts during the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Koori Radio conducted 19 test broadcasts while it was applying for a licence. The ACMA granted the licence in June 2001. Koori Radio began full-time broadcasting in December 2001 with a 1 kW transmitter. It switched to a new 50 kW transmitter in December 2003. Koori Radio and other community radio stations in Sydney is set to launch mid year. Current In 2008 Koori Radio received Australian Government funding to renovate and move into purpose built studios in the Black Theatre in Redfern. Programming As well as its format of Indigenous and black music, the station broadcasts news, current affairs, sport and listener involvement programs. There are also programs by the Samoan and MƒÅori communities. Koori Radio's flagship program is Blackchat, a daily current affairs program on weekday mornings committed to discussing news, issues and events from an Indigenous perspective. Koori Radio also contributes programming to the National Indigenous Radio Service. Koori Radio's programming also features Koori Radio Sport, an entertainment programme that covers the latest in sport news, with a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players.

Plot On the planet Centaurus, the planetary capital of New Athens has been annihilated by a terrorist antimatter bomb. Millions are dead; because of a computer malfunction, the planetary defense system is preventing any rescue ships from approaching the planet. No subspace communication is possible, and traditional speed-of-light radio is blanketed with heavy static. Despite an emergency do-not-approach warning (known as Code 7-10, which went unheard), the first three relief ships, carrying hundreds of medical personnel, are destroyed by ground-to-air missiles as they assumed standard orbit. The USS Enterprise has been sent to assess the situation and offer what relief they can, but they are in need of help themselves as the ship is falling apart around them due to an unexplainable massive computer malfunction of their own; the transporter is made inoperable by the antimatter's residual tachyon radiation. The tragedy has a personal touch as well-- Dr. McCoy's daughter Joanna is among the missing, as well as friends and relatives of other crewmembers. While Spock attempts to disable the planetary defense computers, Captain Kirk, Mr. Sulu and attorney Samuel T. Cogley become involved with the terrorists when the terrorist leader contacts Cogley and ask him to represent them in Federation court. Despite his personal feelings, Kirk is determined that the terrorists will get a fair trial under Federation jurisdiction, but certain individuals in the patchwork government are equally determined that the terrorists will not leave Centaurus alive. While the surviving Centauran government engages in an all-out search for Kirk and party, Kirk learns that three more antimatter bombs are somewhere on the planet, and is forced to take refuge in the one place he cherishes most - the little cabin he had built in Garrovick Valley, on the river Farragut. On seeing the names 'Garrovick' and 'Farragut' on a map, Commander Spock correctly surmises where Kirk is hiding, and a scan from orbit reveals an army of government hovercars flitting around the cabin. By leveraging the Enterprise's crippled warp drive's controls, engineer Montgomery Scott and his second-in-command succeed in enabling the Enterprise to enter the atmosphere. The government hit squad's weapons are no match for a starship's phasers set on stun; the captured terrorists are taken in custody, but the secret of cheap antimatter synthesis is lost: its creator was the suicide bomber who set the first weapon off. In the epilogue, Spock traces the computer malfunction to a quantum black hole accidentally forming, against all odds, within the Enterprise in warp, drilling a hole straight through a good part of the computer memory banks.

The village contains 13 historic buildings from around the Cincinnati area; they were moved here to save them from destruction. The village is located within Sharon Woods Park in Sharonville, Ohio. Heritage Village is open year-round for self-guided tours. Architecture The historic buildings located in the village include: *Hayner House, a Greek Revival building featuring fluted column with Ionic capitals, bilateral wings, and seven fireplaces on the first floor and two in the basement. The house was originally built in 1852. It eventually began to deteriorate, was dismantled and put into storage. In 1967 it was rebuilt and restored to its original form at Heritage Village Museum. The house was once located in Warren County Ohio, right alongside the little Miami River close to South Lebanon. In 1862 John Hayner purchased the property the house sat upon along with several other local farms. Hayner made his living by raising and drying corn. Later, he and a few business partners, started to can corn and the business flourished. When there was no longer a need for dry corn he turned his drying barn into a cannery. *Elk Lick House is an example of Carpenter Gothic architecture moved from Clermont County Ohio. It is estimated that the house was built in 1818 and the addition was added in the 1840s. The Two sections of the Elk Lick House have distinctive differences. The original two-room, 1818 cottage in the back had simple lines on the outside and basic woodwork on the inside. The front section is more ornate and speaks of mild affluence. The mid-century country farm house is from the Elk Lick Valley. Several different owners lived in the house and eventually built on the front portion. The house was scheduled to be demolished to make way for the East Fork Reservoir. The Miami Purchase Association for Historic Prevention rescued it by purchasing it from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1969. *Chester Park Train Station is an example of Italianate architecture. It was formerly known as Spring Grove Train Station or Witton Place. In Southwestern Ohio, early settlements along the Ohio River and its tributaries employed riverine transportation, but other settlements inland had no way of getting their extra produce to the market. Trains became the primary means of carrying goods inland to markets but also a better form of transportation. Villagers used the trains to travel from town to town, to take pleasure excursions and commute from suburbs to the city. In 1875, across the road from where the station was located, a racetrack called Chester Park was built. The small station quickly became inadequate to handle the crowds of customers who came from the city to this new park. In 1879 the station was enlarged and named Chester Park. This is the structure that now resides at the Heritage Village Museum. *Benedict Cottage is a Federal building whose original structure was hidden under a Greek Revival cladding. It was originally thought to have been built sometime between 1825 through 1850, but it may be older than that estimate. Originally built as a workman's cottage along Mill Creek, it was eventually moved west of Springfield Pike near Glendale-Milford Road in Woodlawn. There it functioned as a caretaker's home on the grounds of the Benedict Estate, then owned by the Burchenal family of the Procter & Gamble Company. In October 1997 the cottage was moved four miles to the Heritage Village Museum, which has restored it and uses it to interpret 19th-century textile crafts. *Vorhes House is another Federal building and a typical Cincinnati-area farmhouse from the 1820s or 1830s. Moved from Cornell Road in Blue Ash, it is a substantial and well built residence. Its floor plan has two rooms and two fireplaces on the first floor and three rooms with two fireplaces on the second floor, which can be reached by either of two staircases. *Kemper House was built in 1804 by James and Judith Kemper and came from the Walnut Hills section of Cincinnati, which he named. Ordained in late October 1792,Kemper, Andrew Carr. A Memorial of the Rev. James Kemper for the Centennial of the Synod of Kentucky. N.p.: 1899, 10. Rev. Kemper was the first Presbyterian minister ordained north of the Ohio River. This building is considered a house rather than a cabin because of the plastered walls, staircase and wood trim, as well as a large sitting room. Kemper family members continued living in the house until its relocation to the Cincinnati Zoo in 1912. *Somerset Church was built around 1829 and was located at Fields Ertel and Montgomery Roads in Deerfield Township. Rev. Kemper, who never preached at the church, was instrumental in installing the church's first minister. Rev. Kemper's log house now sits next to Somerset Church at Heritage Village Museum. Its roots begin in 1801, when the Montgomery Presbyterian Church was organized. Church records indicate that its Sunday school attendance was large compared to average worship attendance. The building has been restored to its original appearance and is used for special events in addition to representing the place of early settlers' Christian faith. *Langdon Medical Office is an example of 1850s Steamboat Gothic architecture. It was the doctor's office of Dr. Henry A. Langdon, a Civil War physician who resided in the Langdon House in Columbia-Tusculum, whence the office was moved. Here Langdon practiced medicine from 1865 to 1876, and the museum interprets it and its collection of 19th-century medical instruments to tell the story of medicine in the 19th century. Relocation from Columbia- Tusculum required complete dismantling and reassembly. *Fetter General Store is an example of Leadville architecture, moved from Main Street in Boston (now known as Owensville) in Clermont County. Constructed in the 1860s and named for owner John C. Fetter, it was acquired by the Heritage Village Museum in 1983. Extensively deteriorated, the exterior has been restored and is used for education programs. *Schram Printing Company was located on Madison Avenue in Covington, Kentucky. The building located at the Village is not the original structure for the print shop; it was built as a replica of an original structure in order to hold a collection of printing presses and letter trays donated by Schram. *Gatch Barn is believed to be one of the oldest barns from Clermont County and comes from the Gatch family farm. *Myers Schoolhouse is a one-room schoolhouse that was built in 1891. It was taken from Delhi Township.

It is written in the first person from the perspective of Lieutenant Piper. Plot The novel begins with Lt. Piper (no first name), a native of Proxima Beta, taking the Kobayashi Maru simulation at Starfleet Academy. After her \\"ship\\" takes several hits and takes heavy damage, Lt. Piper uses an unusual method to issue commands to the ship's computer via handheld communicator. The technique results in the computer controlling the simulation crashing. The simulator's commander comments during the debriefing that she has come closer to checkmating the no-win scenario than any other command-line candidate, then tells her that she has been reassigned to the starship Enterprise by special request. Lt. Piper meets briefly with Brian Silayna, an Academy cadet in the engineering program and her friend and lover. Piper and Silayna had originally been assigned to the same ship, but with Piper's reassignment (which Silayna reveals was from Captain Kirk, who had been observing the Kobayashi Maru simulation) they wind up saying their goodbyes instead. Lt. Piper takes a shuttle to the Enterprise and reports to her assigned cabin. Here she meets her cabin-mates: a Gorn named Telosirizharcrede, a human from Earth named Judd \\"Scanner\\" Sandage, a humanoid from Altair Four named Merete AndrusTaurus, and a Vulcan named Sarda. It is revealed that Piper and Sarda have a history together which has generated animosity between them. Shortly thereafter, Lt. Piper is summoned to the bridge where she finds out that a top-secret Federation vessel named Star Empire, first of a new class of heavily armed and shielded dreadnought, has been stolen by persons unknown and that the Enterprise has been dispatched in pursuit. The head of the dreadnought project, Vice-Admiral Rittenhouse, is in pursuit as well aboard the destroyer Pompeii. She also finds out that the Star Empire has transmitted rendezvous coordinates to the Enterprise and that Piper's unique biocode would be needed to enable transmissions at the rendezvous point. After a conference, Piper retires to her cabin and has a conversation with AndrusTaurus, where it is revealed why Sarda and Piper have strained relations. Sarda has a talent for defensive weapons design, which Starfleet keeps developing for offensive uses as well and that is something which Vulcans considered immoral. Piper, in her ignorance, informed the Academy staff of Sarda's talents, which led to his great personal embarrassment and being ostracized by other Vulcans in Starfleet. Piper and AndrusTaurus do some research on Vulcan and decide to consult with a Vulcan embassy that specialized in human-Vulcan relationships. Upon arrival at the rendezvous point, the Enterprise finds Star Empire being attacked by four Klingon vessels. The Star Empire is apparently helpless, its crew unable to fight while the attacking Klingons inflict heavy damage on the dreadnought with phaser fire. Enterprise moves in to help the crippled dreadnought, engaging the Klingons with phasers and photon torpedoes. One is damaged and retreats to hide in an asteroid field. Hard fighting results in another Klingon ship being destroyed. However, the Enterprise is also damaged in the fighting and is left facing long odds against the two remaining Klingon ships. Suddenly, movement is detected in the asteroid field, and a second Star Empire appears. Engaging the damaged Klingon ships with heavy photon torpedoes, this unhurt Star Empire destroys two of them and sends the last one fleeing. Then it is revealed that the damaged Star Empire is in fact a sophisticated sensor projection when it dissolves from sight shortly thereafter, followed by the creation of five more dreadnought projections. This projection device is one of Sarda's weapons projects he finds embarrassing. Captain Kirk hails the Star Empire and after Piper's biocode is transmitted communication is established. To everybody's great surprise, Brian Silayna appears on the screen. He reads a message from Commander Paul Burch stating that they have seized the dreadnaught in the name of galactic civility and request an ambassadorial party of Kirk, Piper, and a Vulcan. Kirk refuses to comply and orders Piper arrested for conspiracy with terrorists, then cuts the transmission. Kirk orders the security guards to confine Piper to her quarters. In her quarters, Piper reflects on the situation and decides she had to get over to Star Empire to find out what was going on, why Silayna was on the dreadnought, and why he had never revealed his intentions to her. She tricks open the door by cutting the fire-alarm circuits to the bridge then triggering the heat sensor with a curling iron so that the safety features override the door lock and lets her out. Piper runs to the nearest transporter room and begins to activate the equipment with the intention of beaming over to Star Empire. Sarda finds her there, having deduced her intentions and location after discovering her missing from her quarters, and informs her that the Star Empire has moved out of transporter range. Instead, they move to the hangar bay, open the doors, steal a 2-seat Arco-class light attack \\"sled\\", and head towards the Star Empire. During the flight Sarda informs Piper that 3 more starships (Hood, Lincoln, and Potemkin) have been ordered by Admiral Rittenhouse to the location, and also accidentally reveals another benevolent invention that Starfleet weaponized and that he is embarrassed about. Their trip to Star Empire is cut short, however when the destroyer Pompeii drops out of warp, intercepts the attack sled and uses a tractor beam to haul it inside its hangar bay. They meet Vice-Admiral Rittenhouse, who informs them that Commander Birch was his personal aide but had deteriorated until Rittenhouse believe he had become sociopathic. They discuss the situation of Piper and Sarda briefly with Captain Kirk, then Rittenhouse discusses the recent galactic political situation and hints at his desire to unite the various galactic governments under a common flag of peace. He then leaves the conference room to attend to other duties. Piper, sensing something in the hints that Rittenhouse dropped, uses the destroyer's computer to access Starfleet and Federation organizational charts. She and Sarda find a disturbing pattern: men that had served with Rittenhouse over the years had been placed in high levels of the civilian and military leadership, including the captains of the three other starships en route. Believing Rittenhouse may be planning a military coup, Piper tries to contact the Enterprise, but Rittenhouse and Dr. Boma, a civilian scientist who also worked on the dreadnought project, stop her and order Piper and Sarda thrown in the destroyer's brig. While in the brig Piper and Sarda discuss Earth history and Piper explains the pattern of socialist political, military, and economic changes that Rittenhouse is repeating and how it would affect the Federation and its galactic neighbors. Suddenly, the power to the brig is briefly interrupted (by Boma, after he realizes Rittenhouse's plans for Star Empire's crew), and Sarda acts quickly, throwing himself through the cell's doorway before the forcefield could re-activate. Sarda then turns off the forcefield and he and Piper flee the detention area. Moving through the destroyer, they spy the senior officers from the Enterprise and three other starthips walking through the Pompeii‚Äôs corridor into the conference room. Fearing for the safety of Kirk and his officers, Sarda and Piper move to the engineering section, bluff past the engineers there, and find an isolated spot from which to contact the Enterprise. Sarda contacts AndrusTaurus and Sandage, who transport over. With Sandage's help they manage to use the ship's intercom system to listen in on the meeting. During the meeting, Rittenhouse and his hand-picked captains square off against Kirk, with Rittenhouse advocating for harsh measures and indifferent to the potential deaths of the crew on Star Empire and Kirk advocating talks and negotiation with the Star Empire. Kirk becomes increasingly suspicious of Rittenhouse's unwillingness to let him contact the dreadnought's crew and disregard for their lives and balks. Rittenhouse finally orders security to arrest Kirk and his officers and lock them in a stateroom. Piper, Sarga, Sandage, and AndrusTaurus surprise and disable the guards outside the stateroom and an effort to free Kirk and his officers. They find that Kirk and his officers have disabled the guards inside their room and were planning to come and rescue them. They then sabotage the Pompeii‚Äôs phasers before meeting in the transporter room. Kirk, Spock, Scott, and McCoy beam back first; however, before the others can leave the Pompeii‚Äôs crew disable the transporter. They move immediately to the hangar bay; where they have another encounter with a security team. A fight ensues, ending when AndrusTaurus grabs a guard's dropped phaser and shoots him with it. Against regulations the phaser is set to disintegrate instead of stun and the guard is vaporized. AndrusTaurus feels horrible guilt about her action as they continue to flee to the hangar deck. Once at the deck, they are confronted by Rittenhouse and more guards. Piper threatens to self-destruct the Arco attack sled they arrived on and take the destroyer with it. Rittenhouse, seeing that she's serious, withdraws from the deck and allows them to escape. The four of them escape in two attack sleds, skimming along the destroyer's hull to avoid being shot by the Pompeii‚Äôs phaser batteries. Piper destroys one phaser bank, then the two sleds vector away from the destroyer and towards the Star Empire before the Pompeii can bring more phasers to bear. They escape to the Star Empire and rush to the bridge. There they find a skeleton, untrained, largely bureaucratic crew that has only basic control over the ship's systems. Commander Burch explains the situation and they try to contact the Enterprise. Pompeii tries to jam the signal, and when that fails the destroyer opens fire on the ill-prepared Star Empire. A fierce battle then ensues. The Pompeii's phasers were disabled after the initial shots, leaving three other starships against Enterprise and Star Empire. Piper is able to unlock the ship's systems, giving Star Empire increased shielding and weapons ability to withstand the heavy attacks by the opposing starships. However Star Empire still takes significant damage, as Burch is not a combat commander and is reluctant to fire on other Federation vessels. Enterprise feigns fatal damage, luring Rittenhouse to order two other starships in to evacuate the Enterprise crew. Kirk then fires on the two starships, inflicting heavy damage and evening the odds. The two sides maneuver warily, until Commander Burch is disabled in an attack. Piper is forced to take command of Star Empire and begins to move aggressively, using the dreadnought's multiple phaser banks and newly activated secondary shielding to dish out heavy hits on the opposing starships. With Rittenhouse's three starships considerably damaged, Piper bluffs their commanders by arming Star Empire's heavy photon torpedoes, a single hit from which would destroy any of the damaged starships killing all on board. Rittenhouse's ships fall back, and Star Empire presses in. Rittenhouse, seeing that he no longer has the upper hand and that victory is out of reach, orders Pompeii to make a suicide run on Star Empire. Kirk, seeing this, moves in quickly and destroys Pompeii before she can collide with Star Empire. With Rittenhouse dead, the commanders of his three other starships surrender. The novel ends with medals being awarded to several of the crew and Piper gets promoted to Lieutenant Commander. Then Captain Kirk extends an offer to Piper to go sailing with him on his schooner. Reception and characterization The novel made the New York Times best-seller list for paperbacks on May 18 and May 25, 1986. Robert Greenberger called the book \\"a page turner\\" but noted that \\"One more time, however, a brave, plucky, courageous woman holds the key to success.\\" In a reply to Greenberger's review, Carey commented: The hero of the story, Lt. Piper, has been cited as an example of Mary Sue characterization.

The Encyclopedia of American Studies first appeared in 2001 as a four-volume print edition, published by Grolier Press. The EAS was sponsored by the American Studies Association, which appointed an editorial board consisting of Johnnella Butler, Robert Gross, and Miles Orvell. (Robert Gross was replaced by Jay Mechling during the first year of planning.) The intent behind the EAS was to create a work that would serve the needs of scholars, graduate students, college students and a high school audience, a work that would be accessible yet authoritative and that would cover the range of American history and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective. Articles in the EAS range from the singular features of American material culture (e.g. the Statue of Liberty or Barbie Dolls) to the broadest concepts of American intellectual culture (e.g. Exceptionalism and Millennialism) as well as the methods and theories of American Studies. In 2003 the EAS appeared in its initial online version, and in 2005 Johns Hopkins University Press took over as publisher, working with the American Studies Association, and making the EAS a regular benefit of membership in the ASA. Miles Orvell served as Editor in Chief of the online version until 2011 and organized an EAS Advisory Board appointed by the American Studies Association. In 2011, Simon J. Bronner, distinguished professor of American Studies at Pennsylvania State University, Harrisburg, took over the reins of the EAS as Editor in Chief. Participation in the EAS grew with the involvement of students, staff, faculty, and regional scholars around the doctoral program in American Studies at Penn State Harrisburg in addition to an international roster of contributors and advisory board members. The online version added illustrations, related web links, and bibliographic listings to the original entries. The EAS also sponsored a Forum on the American Studies Association website with essays related to the mission of the Encyclopedia such as \\"Encyclopedias and American Studies\\" with a panel of encyclopedia editors and \\"Organizing a Class on Organizing\\" by Mark Rudd. The EAS is expanded and updated quarterly, with an ever-growing database of articles, illustrations, and bibliographies that stay current with the evolution of American Studies scholarship.

Spacecraft and mission design AMC-21 is based on a STAR-2 platform that provides 4.4 kilowatts of power for the communications payload. The platform will support a 15-year on-orbit mission life. It carries 24 J band (IEEE ) transponders, which will be used to broadcast television signals to Canada the Caribbean, Mexico, and the United States. Manufacture and launch Thales Alenia Space was the prime contractor for AMC-21, and provided the satellite's communications payload. The STAR-2 bus was subcontracted to Orbital Sciences Corporation, as were integration and testing of the satellite. As prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space delivered the completed satellite to SES Americom. AMC-21 was launched, along with the Superbird 7 satellite, by an Ariane 5ECA rocket on 14 August 2008. The satellite separated from the carrier rocket in a geosynchronous transfer orbit. An onboard IHI-500N engine then raised it to an operational geosynchronous orbit and placed it at a longitude of 125¬∞ West of the Greenwich Meridian.

EcoSecurities specialises in sourcing, developing and financing projects on renewable energy, energy efficiency, forestry and waste management with a positive environmental impact. The company has offices in Europe, Middle East, South America and Asia. Its large portfolio of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects covers numerous countries and technologies.  History  EcoSecurities was founded in January 1997, by environmental entrepreneurs Pedro Moura CostaEcosecurities Profile and Marc Stuart. Created ten months before the Kyoto Protocol, EcoSecurities contributed to the evolution of carbon markets and climate policies from the outset. In 2005, EcoSecurities Group Plc was listed in the London Stock Exchange, raising capital for an expansion drive that resulted in offices in 33 countries run by over 350 employees. This enabled the company to develop over 700 CDM projects located in 45 countries and using 50 technologies. These projects resulted in the largest carbon credit portfolio worldwide, worth over USD 4 billion, giving the company a significant global market share. In June 2007, the company raised an additional ‚Ç¨150 million to expand into new markets, with Credit Suisse becoming a major investor. Its trades in the international carbon market were valued at USD 41 billion in the first six months of 2008.

In addition to \\"iVo\\" as an artwork, KTOrg announced that \\"iVo\\" (now a fictional character in the fictional monarchy \\"Counterculture Monarchy of Discordianism\\") was to be elected president of the monarchy. For that purpose, a fictional website was set up at www.ivoforpresident.com. Multimedia activism Along with guerilla activism, members of KTOrg are involved in music production, known as \\"Kunstterrorist Audio Noize\\". The audio tracks are released via the British anti-label Death To Music. The band consists of six members and the music varies in genre from electronica to punk/rock and gabba. The members of Kunstterrorist Audio Noize also created a number of remixes for other bands. Characteristics KTOrg is influenced by and constantly references the culture jamming movement in art, activism and music. The organisation also strongly supports Copyleft and Free Culture Movement and apparently (according to their official web site) is giving away everything it has ever created for free on December 12, 2012. KTOrg's work also references discordianism as a major influence. The discordianism references are most obvious in the organization's frequent newsletters and the information given on its official web page.

Legends There is hallow of a wide range of legends surrounding the temple. The Main legend is about the origin of this great temple. According to this legend the main Idol of Lord Shiva was installed by Lord Sri Rama in the presence of Sita, Hanuman, Sugreeva and Vibheeshana on his return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana. Lord Sri Rama initiated Hanuman to bring a divine Sivalimga from Himalayas. Hanuman went to Himalayas and searched everywhere for a unique Sivalinga, and took some time for that purpose. As the auspicious time for prathishta neared, Lord Rama decided to do the Prathishta at once and using the earth form that place, he molded a Sivalinga and consecrated it. When he returned Hanuman became very sad seeng the prathishta was already done. So Lord Rama told Hanuman to remove the prathishta and install the Divyalinga he brought in its place. Hanuman tried his maximum, but the newly molded earthen Linga remained as such. Instead, the land surrounding it moved up to form a small hillock. So Hanuman prayed pardon, and sought Lord Rama for permission to stay near the Divya Prathishta done by him for ever. Thus Kaviyoor become Hanuman's place. It is traditionally known as the most prominent Hanuman temple in South India. A second legend is about the installation of Hanuman prathishta inside the temple complex. Sage Vilwamangalam once visited this temple and on entering the compound he had a vision of Lord Hanuman sitting on the branch of the huge Ilanji (Mimusops elengi) tree in the north- eastern side of the outer courtyard. He prayed to the Lord to alight from the tree top and sit in a comfortable position in the inner courtyard, near to LordShiva. Hanuman sanctioned his wish and sat on the sage's Japa-Kindi in the north western corner of the inner courtyard. Later, as a result of a dream appeared to Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma a separate sanctum was built for Lord Hanuman in M.E. 1108( AD 1934). Deities The Main deity is known as Thrikkaviyoorappan. The Shivalinga is believed to be made of sand and darbha grass.

Outside the main sanctum in the north-west corner of the inner courtyard is the position of the Hanuman temple. The idol is small and faces east. This deity has more popularity than Lord Shiva.

Babcock and Michael Jane Allen Babcock to take advantage of the fast-growing market for computer time-sharing services. In 1966 the company developed \\"RUSH\\" (Remote Users of Shared Hardware), an interactive dialect of PL/I. Between 1965 and 1966 they assisted in the development of CPS (Conversational Programming System), a timesharing system that ran under OS/360, under contract to IBM. CPS was a subset of RUSH prepared by IBM with the permission of Allen-Babcock. The significant technological outcome was the first idea to alter the hardware of an IBM computer to enhance the performance of a time- sharing system on IBM hardware. This was the first time such firmware was programmed by software developers for this purpose. Later tests showed increases of throughput by as much as 70%. Several such altered 360 Model 50s were delivered to other IBM customers. In 1969 Allen-Babcock held a 3 percent share of the time-sharing services market. During the early 70's Allen-Babcock leased copies of the RUSH software to several industry owners of the IBM 360 series computer systems. One such company was Procter & Gamble. These lessees sought to use RUSH internally to provide their companies access to time sharing on their Internet networks. In 1975 Allen-Babcock was acquired by Tymshare.

The brewery describes its beers as \\"cloudy, yeasty and unpredictable.\\"Pihtla √µlu. Traditional Saaremaa beer. Farmhouse ale is an ancient European tradition where farmers brewed beer for consumption on the farm from their own grain. Most farmers would brew for Christmas and/or the late summer work, but in areas where they had enough grain farmers would use beer as the every-day drink. This was in a time when it was safer to drink beer than water. Farmhouse ale has enormous variation in the ingredients and brewing process used, both of which follow ancient local traditions. Today many microbreweries make beers they market as farmhouse ale, but in most cases the connection with the actual farmhouse brewing tradition is rather tenuous. In Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania, however, there are commercial farmhouse breweries that brew on the farm according to the ancient traditions. Some of these still have the original farmhouse yeast. In Belgium and Northern France there are breweries making beers that are thought to derive from beers traditionally brewed on the farms in these areas, but the connection is not well documented, and it's not clear how close the commercial beers are to the farmhouse-brewed originals. History Farmers have been brewing beer from their own grain since long before the beginning of recorded history, so the beginnings of farmhouse brewing are not documented at all. Originally, farmhouse ale was brewed all over Europe, but in classical antiquity wine-growing largely displaced beer brewing in southern Europe. In northern Europe farmhouse brewing was gradually reduced by taxation and modernization, but in many countries it never quite died out. Over the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest in farmhouse brewing, partly driven by interest in the unique brewing methods and ingredients still in use. One example is the recent adoption of kveik yeast in modern brewing.

The film reveals the step-by-step, behind-the-scenes process of butchering kosher meat, and also looks into the lives of the Oscherwitz family through personal interviews, family stories, and archival home videos. Summary Born in Germany, Isaac Oscherwitz was a butcher who emigrated to America in the 1880s because of oppression and poverty. When he arrived in Cincinnati, he started his own sausage factory, which created jobs and a delicious product for the city‚Äôs surprisingly well-populated Jewish community. But the Oscherwitzes also established their public face to the community through a family-run storefront shop, where they sold their meats and other classic Jewish delicacies. Decades later, Isaac‚Äôs five sons extended the business to Chicago, which had become the center of the meat packing industry, and today the Oscherwitz family is responsible for well-known brands such as Best Kosher, Shofar, and Sinai. This familial intimacy extends beyond the immediate family members to the way they treat everyone involved in the business, from factory workers to customers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think my husband ever felt like his customers were his customers,‚Äù one woman says, ‚Äúthey were his friends.‚Äù Another man, who took a job with the Oscherwitzes after he lost everything to the Holocaust, speaks highly of his employers. ‚ÄúIt was such a family feeling,‚Äù he explaining how warm and welcoming his coworkers have been. The appeal of a family-owned product helped make the Oscherwitz brand popular, but fiscal success also jeopardized the family-run nature of the business. Before the swell of success, business meetings between the Oscherwitz brothers were a literal yelling contest, where arguments were won by the most powerful voice and, despite all the screaming, everyone left on good terms. But a big business couldn‚Äôt run in the same way. The documentary shares the Oscherwitzes‚Äô inside struggles to keep their booming business family-run and shows the effects on everyone when they were bought out by a subsidiary of the Sara Lee Corporation IntervieweesRelease First released in 1998, Divine Food has been broadcast on 18 PBS affiliate stations across the United States and has screened at film festivals 1998 through 2013. It is also serves as an educational documentary used by many Jewish schools to describe and illustrate the Kosher manufacturing process in America, and as an inspirational story of an immigrant family's successful growth and development within the country. The film was released on VHS in 1999 by Ergo Media, and on DVD in 2008 by Chayes Productions though Harris Publications.

Radio London was the first of the UK (pirate) offshore stations to operate a news service and Kaye was the news chief. His bulletins were on the half-hour, which conveniently gave him just enough time to re-write the BBC news which was broadcast on the hour. Kaye also presented programmes, especially in the early months of the station, and his theme was \\"Town Talk\\" by Ken Woodman and his Piccadilly Brass, a tune later used on the BBC by Jimmy Young. In August 1967, the Marine Offences Act became law and the first voice on Radio London became the last as Paul closed the station down.

In southern California, these snakes have sometimes been found in chaparral or cactus country, but usually never stray far from the rocks that provide its usual shelter. Not exclusively a rock dweller, they have also been observed emerging from mammal burrows at dusk. The species has been found at elevations of more than .Klauber LM. 1997. Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Second Edition. 2 volumes. Reprint, University of California Press, Berkeley. . Behavior Primarily nocturnal, these snakes shelter in rock crevices and mammal burrows during the heat of the day. They become more diurnal during the cooler months of the year. Feeding The diet consists mostly of small mammals, although birds and lizards are also taken, the latter especially by juveniles. There is one report of a large specimen that contained a nearly grown cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus auduboni sanctidiegi). Another report describes a specimen that had eaten eight birds, most likely goldfinches, that had been attracted to a small fountain installed as a bird bath at a desert camp. Reproduction Ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to as many as 12 live young. Neonates are long and prey mostly on lizards. Venom Hartnett (1931) describes a case of a man who was bitten on his left thumb. Aside from the sharp stab of the fangs being embedded, there was no pain until after an incision had been made and antivenin had been administered. There was then severe pain that lasted for about an hour after the bite, followed eventually by much discoloration and swelling, his fingers looking like red bananas. His fingers and wrist were covered with blebs and his palm with one large blister. In another case, a man was bitten on his heel, through his overalls and a sock. At first, the sensation was like being struck by a thorn, with only a drop of blood at fang mark. After 45 minutes and a walk, a tourniquet was applied and an incision made. Four hours later, his calf was considerably swollen and discolored, which was later followed by pain in the groin. Further symptoms were obscured by the treatment and an uneventful recovery was made.

With a rotation about the origin, this can also be written :r^n = a^n \\\\sin(n \\\\theta).\\\\, The term \\"spiral\\" is a misnomer, because they are not actually spirals, and often have a flower-like shape. Many well known curves are sinusoidal spirals including: * Rectangular hyperbola (n = ‚àí2) * Line (n = ‚àí1) * Parabola (n = ‚àí1/2) * Tschirnhausen cubic (n = ‚àí1/3) * Cayley's sextet (n = 1/3) * Cardioid (n = 1/2) * Circle (n = 1) * Lemniscate of Bernoulli (n = 2) The curves were first studied by Colin Maclaurin. Equations Differentiating :r^n = a^n \\\\cos(n \\\\theta)\\\\, and eliminating a produces a differential equation for r and Œ∏: :\\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\theta}\\\\cos n\\\\theta + r\\\\sin n\\\\theta =0. Then :\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{ds},\\\\ r\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{ds}\\\\right)\\\\cos n\\\\theta \\\\frac{ds}{d\\\\theta} = \\\\left(-r\\\\sin n\\\\theta ,\\\\ r \\\\cos n\\\\theta \\\\right) = r\\\\left(-\\\\sin n\\\\theta ,\\\\ \\\\cos n\\\\theta \\\\right) which implies that the polar tangential angle is :\\\\psi = n\\\\theta \\\\pm \\\\pi/2 and so the tangential angle is :\\\\varphi = (n+1)\\\\theta \\\\pm \\\\pi/2. (The sign here is positive if r and cos nŒ∏ have the same sign and negative otherwise.) The unit tangent vector, :\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{ds},\\\\ r\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{ds}\\\\right), has length one, so comparing the magnitude of the vectors on each side of the above equation gives :\\\\frac{ds}{d\\\\theta} = r \\\\cos^{-1} n\\\\theta = a \\\\cos^{-1+\\\\tfrac{1}{n}} n\\\\theta. In particular, the length of a single loop when n>0 is: :a\\\\int_{-\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2n}}^{\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2n}} \\\\cos^{-1+\\\\tfrac{1}{n}} n\\\\theta\\\\ d\\\\theta The curvature is given by :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{ds} = (n+1)\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{ds} = \\\\frac{n+1}{a} \\\\cos^{1-\\\\tfrac{1}{n}} n\\\\theta. Properties The inverse of a sinusoidal spiral with respect to a circle with center at the origin is another sinusoidal spiral whose value of n is the negative of the original curve's value of n. For example, the inverse of the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a rectangular hyperbola. The isoptic, pedal and negative pedal of a sinusoidal spiral are different sinusoidal spirals. One path of a particle moving according to a central force proportional to a power of r is a sinusoidal spiral. When n is an integer, and n points are arranged regularly on a circle of radius a, then the set of points so that the geometric mean of the distances from the point to the n points is a sinusoidal spiral. In this case the sinusoidal spiral is a polynomial lemniscate. References *Yates, R. C.: A Handbook on Curves and Their Properties, J. W.

Its services include document destruction, hard drive destruction, and specialty item shredding. The company is also known for its Annual Data Protection Report commissioned with Ipsos, a yearly survey of small business owners, C-level executives and consumers focusing on data protection and information security.  History  Greg Brophy founded Shred-it in 1988 and incorporated the company in 1989. In 1993, Brophy expanded the business by launching a manufacturing division called Securit Manufacturing Solutions \\"SMS\\". Today, SMS manufactures security consoles and specialty shredding trucks for all Shred-it‚Äôs branches. It also sells industrial shredding equipment to other secure information destruction businesses. In 2014, Shred-it merged with Cintas Document Shredding, which now operates under the Shred-it name. In 2015, Stericycle acquired Shred-it and began positioning the company as one of its many waste management and compliance services.  Secure Information Destruction Services = Document Destruction  Shred-it offers document destruction services where paper documents are shredded using industrial paper shredders. This service is offered on a one-time or on a recurring basis. Shred-it maintains a fleet of trucks that can provide this service on-site or deliver materials to Shred- it‚Äôs facilities for destruction. The trucks are prominently featured at Community Shred-it events, where Shred-it partners with organizations like Crime Stoppers, to raise awareness about identity theft and fraud, while providing a safe way to dispose of documents with confidential information. Shred-it provides a custom quote for every document destruction job and ensures all paper waste is recycled.  Hard Drive, Digital Media, and Specialty Item Destruction  Shred-it provides secure information destruction for hard drives and digital media. Deliberately damaging these devices is the only way to ensure confidential information can no longer be retrieved. Shred-it has two methods for securely destroying digital information. Shearing slices hard drives into minuscule pieces using 40,000 lbs of combined force while crushing uses 7,500 lbs of force pressure to drill irreparable holes in the hard drive, so information can never be recovered. The company also offers specialty item shredding, which involves destruction of any item that poses a threat to a business‚Äô reputation or security. Shred- it‚Äôs specialty item services dispose of items, like uniforms to casino chips, ID badges, prototypes, pill bottles, or material with outdated branding.  Community involvement = Community Shred-it Events  Shred-it partners with organizations like schools, credit unions, banks, and police departments to host Community Shred-it Events. Attendees can shred their unwanted confidential documents and learn about best practices for preventing identity theft. These events are facilitated by local Shred-it branches and interested partners in their communities.  Shred-it For A Cure  Shred-it for a cure events began in 2004. Participating Shred-it locations invite people to securely shred unwanted documents free of charge on designated days each month. Participants are encouraged to make a donation in lieu of paying for shredding services and proceeds are donated to local cancer charities.  Good Riddance Day  Shred-it has partnered with the Times Square Alliance to host ‚ÄúGood Riddance Day‚Äù on December 28 in Times Square, New York City. At this event, the Shred-it team helps tourists and local community members say ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù to their worst memories from the last year by shredding them. The event was inspired by a Latin American tradition for New Year‚Äôs in which participants set fire to dolls to rid themselves of the past year‚Äôs bad memories. ‚ÄúGood Riddance Day‚Äù winners in 2017 shredded bills from $25,000 of debt they had paid off.

It was illuminated by Gothic artists from the Dalmatian littoral. It was written in 1404 by krstjanin Hval in Bosnian Cyrillic in the Ikavian accent with a Glagolitic alphabet introduction and is decorated with miniatures and other artistic elements. The codex contains parts of the Bible, hymns and short theological texts, and it was copied from an original Glagolitic text, also evident from Glagolitic letters found in two places in the book. The codex is one of the most famous manuscripts belonging to the Bosnian Church in which there are some iconographic elements which are not in concordance with the supposed theological doctrine of Christians (Annunciation, Crucifixion and Ascension). All of the important Bosnian Church books (Nikoljsko evandjelje, Sreckovicevo evandelje, the Manuscript of Hval, the Manuscript of Krstyanin Radosav) are based on Glagolitic Church books. New analyses of style and painting techniques show that they were inscribed by at least two miniaturists. One painter was painting on the blue background, and the other was painting on the gold background in which the miniatures are situated in a rich architectonic frame.

Life Jouin was born in Berlin. He was descended from a French Huguenot family, which had been forced by the Edict of Nantes to take refuge in Prussia. After spending some time in a French school he went to Poland, where he entered the Catholic Church, and determined to embrace the priesthood. He secured his release from military service, renounced allegiance to the land of his birth, and made his way to Rome. He was admitted into the Society of Jesus, entering the novitiate of San Andrea, 20 August 1841. He studied philosophy for three years in the Jesuit Roman Colleges. He then and worked for a time at Reggio Emilia, where he was ordained priest on 30 April 1848. He was forced by the Revolution of 1848 to flee the country. Accordingly, in October 1848 he went to the United States, remaining in New York City till 1852, and then studied theology at Fordham University from 1852 to 1856, taught in Fordham College until 1859, and spent the following year at Sault-au-Recollet, Canada. Returning to Fordham in 1860, he taught theology to those preparing for the priesthood (1860-3), and later (1866‚Äì72) filled various positions in the college. After a visit to England in 1872, he went to Guelph, Ontario, remaining there until 1875. During 1875-6 he was in Montreal and during 1876‚Äì9 at St. Francis Xavier in lower Manhattan. In 1879 he returned to Fordham, where he remained until his death twenty years later. As a lecturer he occupied in Italy, Canada, and the United States the chairs of science, mathematics, and theology; but it was to teaching philosophy that he gave the best part of the fifty-eight years he spent in the Society of Jesus. Jouin was an accomplished linguist, speaking with fluency German, French, Italian, Spanish, English, Polish, and Latin, besides being well versed in Greek, Hebrew, and Gaelic. He was a skilled moralist, and for many years presided over the theological conferences of the Archdiocese of New York. Works For the use of his students, he prepared, either in lithograph or in print, various treatises on philosophical and scientific subjects. Only a few of these were given to the public. His published works are: *\\"Elementa Logicae et Metaphysicae\\" (4th ed., New York, 1884); *\\"Elementa Philosophiae Moralis\\" (New York, 1886); * \\"Evidences of Religion\\" (1877); *\\"Logic and Metaphysics\\", and * \\"What Christ Revealed\\".

At the 2011 Census the population was less than 100. The population is included in the civil parish of Healaugh, Tadcaster. Etymology The first part of the name Catterton is the Brittonic cadeir, \\"chair, throne\\". This is suffixed with the Old English -tun, \\"a farm\\". Chadderton and Chatterton in Lancashire have the same origins. History Catterton is the location of one moated site which is a scheduled monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Most such sites were built between 1250 and 1350, though construction continued throughout the medieval period. In the 17th century, the inhabitants of Catterton came into conflict with people from the neighbouring village of Bilbrough over a tract of unenclosed moorland between the two settlements. A meeting between the two sides organised by the intervention of prominent Yorkshire figures including Robert Fairfax devolved into violence. In 1723, the two sides resolved their dispute by digging a ditch from Thwaites Lane to Escars to divide the land; the ditch still existed by 1900.

Mann (born May 17, 1969) is a businesswoman and former Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 132nd District, having served from 1999 to 2013.  Personal history  A lifelong Allentown resident, Mann graduated from William Allen High School in 1987. She then graduated from Lehigh University with a B.A. in Economics and Government in 1991. She owned and operated a wireless communications firm before seeking elected office. She had had a hand in politics up to that point by serving on the Lehigh County Democratic Committee.  Political career  In 1998, Mann ran for the House of Representatives, seeking the seat that was being vacated by Charlie Dent when Dent ran for the State Senate. Mann first defeated Emma Tropiano in a primary before beating Allentown City Councilman and former Lehigh County Executive David Bausch in the general election. Mann became the first Democrat to represent the 132nd since Jack Pressman in 1990. Mann has twice competed in elections for a different position. In 2005, she ran for the Pennsylvania State Senate in a special election, seeking to fill the vacancy created by Charlie Dent's election to Congress. Mann lost that race to then State Representative Pat Browne. In 2008, Mann sought the Democratic nomination for State Treasurer. She lost that race to Robert McCord.  Legislative career  During her tenure in the legislature, she served on the House Finance, Environmental Resources and Energy, Consumer Affairs, Insurance and Transportation committees. She was co-chair of the New Democrat Coalition, the Community College Caucus and the Arthritis Caucus, and served on the House Rules Committee. In 2003, the political website PoliticsPA named her as a possible successor to House Minority Leader Bill DeWeese. Mann served in Pennsylvania House leadership as the Majority Caucus Secretary. She is only the third woman to have served in a House Democratic leadership position since the Pennsylvania legislature was formed. In 2012, Mann opted not to seek reelection. She has reentered the private sector, starting a consulting firm based in Allentown.

It was built in 1928, sixty-six years after the Battle of Perryville, the bloodiest battle in Kentucky history, on October 8, 1862. There were 16,000 Union soldiers at the Battle of Perryville, with 4,276 combined killed, captured, wounded, and missing.Perryville, Kentucky trailsrus.comNoe, Kenneth W., Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle, (University Press of Kentucky, 2001) pg.373 The monument was created by a decree of the United States Congress on March 3, 1928. It is a granite obelisk, eighteen feet tall, and is one of only seven monuments to the war in Kentucky that honored the Union cause; the vast majority honored the Confederate States of America. Inscriptions are placed on the north and south sides of the monument.Brent, Joseph. Union Monument in Perryville NRHP Nomination Form (Kentucky Heritage Council, 1997) All but one Union monument in Kentucky was erected by the Federal Government or private funds. The monument at Vanceburg, Kentucky is the only Union structure in Kentucky erected by public submission. On July 17, 1997, the Union Monument in Perryville was one of sixty different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. Three other monuments on this Multiple Property Submission are also in Boyle County. One of them, the Confederate Monument in Perryville, stands between the Union Monument and the visitor center of the Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site, a few yards away. The Unknown Confederate Dead Monument in Perryville is a mile away on private land at the Goodknight Cemetery. Like the Union monument, it was built in 1928, much later than the 1902 construction of the Confederate Monument. The other is in downtown Danville, Kentucky: the Confederate Monument in Danville.

The ligase chain reaction (LCR) is an amplification process that differs from PCR in that it involves a thermostable ligase to join two probes or other molecules together which can then be amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycling (Barany, 1991). Each cycle results in a doubling of the target nucleic acid molecule. A key advantage of LCR is greater specificity as compared to PCR. Thus, LCR requires two completely different enzymes to operate properly: ligase, to join probe molecules together, and a thermostable polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase) to amplify those molecules involved in successful ligation. The probes involved in the ligation are designed such that the 5‚Ä≤ end of one probe is directly adjacent to the 3‚Ä≤ end of the other probe, thereby providing the requisite 3‚Ä≤-OH and 5‚Ä≤-PO4 group substrates for the ligase. LCR was originally developed to detect point mutations; a single base mismatch at the junction of the two probe molecules is all that is need to prevent ligation. By performing the ligation right at the Tm of the oligonucleotide probe, only perfectly matched primer:template duplexes will be tolerated. LCR can also be used to amplify template molecules that have been successfully ligated for the purpose of assessing ligation efficiency and producing a large amount of product with even greater specificity than PCR. Thus, LCR is not necessarily an alternative, but rather a complement, to PCR. Target conditions It has been widely used for the detection of single base mutations, as in genetic diseases. LCR and PCR may be used to detect gonorrhea and chlamydia, and may be performed on first-catch urine samples, providing easy collection and a large yield of organisms. Endogenous inhibitors limit the sensitivity, but if this effect could be eliminated, LCR and PCR would have clinical advantages over any other methods of diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia. Among these methods, LCR is emerging as the most sensitive method with high specificity for known single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection (20). LCR was first developed by Barany, who used thermostable DNA ligase to discriminate between normal and mutant DNA and to amplify the allele-specific product. A mismatch at the 3‚Ä≤ end of the discriminating primer prevents the DNA ligase from joining the two fragments together. By using both strands of genomic DNA as targets for oligonucleotide hybridization, the products generated from two sets of adjacent oligonucleotide primers, complementary to each target strand in one round of ligation, can become the targets for the next round. The amount of the products can thus be increased exponentially by repeated thermal cycling. See also * Gene amplification ReferencesGeneral reading *Walker, J. M., & Rapley, R. (2005).
