The focus of the campaign was AIDS and safe sex education, specifically urging the use of condoms. It was primarily targeted at young Hispanics, who the New York City Health Department felt were not receptive to existing outreach efforts. Publication spanned the mayoralties of David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani, with Margaret Hamburg serving as Commissioner of Health under both administrations. Assistant health commissioner Ann Sternberg managed the series. Often compared to a steamy soap opera, the main story covered just a few days of real-time, but was released at an average rate of about one episode per year. The campaign's catchphrase was a line from the first installment, in which Marisol sobs, \\"I love you, but not enough to die for you\\". The series appeared in Spanish and English versions, titled La Decision, and Decision, respectively. Initially funded by a $60,000 Centers for Disease Control grant, it appeared in both print and broadcast versions, in comic book form, and printed on T-shirts.  Cultural significance  The campaign was most well known for the print ads that ran in as many as 6,000 subway cars. According to Adweek, the Julio and Marisol campaign spots were the subway's most frequently stolen poster. The Cooper Hewitt Museum has the series in their permanent collection, and it was featured in the National Library of Medicine's AIDS is Not Over exhibition. Health Commissioner Benjamin Mojica was quoted as saying, \\"The situations in the story are the kinds which people may see themselves in, situations which people can relate to\\". The series was so well known, it has been used as translation practice text in courses teaching English as a second language to Spanish speakers. There are also anecdotal reports of it being used for less formal translation practice.  Target audience  The first clinical reports of AIDS (although not by that name) were in 1981. Early cases were observed in homosexual men, intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. By the mid to late 1980's, the virus that caused the disease was identified, the outbreak had grown into an epidemic beyond the original patient populations, and the mode of transmission was understood to be exchange of bodily fluids. Use of condoms was known to be an important tool for reducing transmission of the virus, but stereotypical behavior inhibited condom use in the Hispanic population. This led to an advertising campaign specifically designed to reach a Hispanic audience.  Story line  Julio and Marisol are two young lovers, getting ready to have sex for the first time. Marisol is insistent that Julio use a condom, but Julio resists the idea. The series follows the couple as they argued about the dangers of unprotected sex in the face of the growing AIDS epidemic. The action played out in slow motion, as new episodes were posted in subway cars over many years. Topics such as heterosexual HIV transmission, homosexuality, intravenous drug abuse, serial transmission through multiple sexual partners, and condom use were explored through frank discussions between the two protagonists and their circle of friends and relatives. = Episode I = Julio and Marisol are a young couple. They have not yet had sex with each other, but are discussing it. Marisol insists that Julio use a condom, but Julio refuses and storms out. = Episode II = It is later the same evening. Julio talks with his friends Marco and Miguel, and discovers that both of them use condoms. Miguel laments the fact that his cousin Anita has recently died of AIDS and her partner Raul is very sick, speculating that condom use might have saved them both. = Episode III = This takes place in parallel with Episode II. Marisol calls her friend Iris, who tells her about Anita. She goes to visit Raul at the hospital. Raul urges Marisol to protect Julio and herself from infection by using condoms. = Episode IV = Julio has left Marco and Miguel and encounters his younger brother, Luisito, with some of his friends. They are going to \\"see some ladies\\". Julio lectures them about condom use, to which Luisito replies that they learned about AIDS and condoms in school. We then see Julio, by himself, thinking how smart his kid brother is, and realizing he needs to talk with Marisol. = Episode V = The story continues with Marisol visiting Raul in the hospital. Julio shows up and apologizes to Marisol; they profess their love for each other and leave the room. Rosa then enters the room, and informs Raul that she's HIV positive. Raul is just asking Rosa if she's told Julio, when Julio and Marisol re-enter the room. = Episode VI = The story picks up in Raul's hospital room. Rosa is introduced to Marisol as an old friend of Raul's. After they leave, Julio tells Marisol that Rosa is just somebody he knew from the old neighborhood, while back in the hospital room, Raul urges Rosa to let Julio know she is HIV positive. = Episode VII = This shows Julio and Marisol early one day, apparently reunited. Julio leaves for work, and Marisol telephones Iris again. In this conversation, she discovers that Rosa was more than just a casual acquaintance of Julio's, but actually a past lover. Marisol realizes that Julio lied to her. = Episode VIII = Marisol confronts Julio about lying to her about Rosa. Julio protests that it was a long time ago, and Marisol says she wants to go see Rosa. Meanwhile, Rosa has seen a counselor and is ready to talk to Julio about being HIV positive. Julio and Marisol go to Rosa's apartment, Rosa tells them both that she's HIV positive. Marisol wonders if Julio is also positive. = Episode IX = This unpublished episode takes place after Raul's death. The thoughts of friends and family at the funeral are shown. A man wonders if he should get tested for HIV. Another man is determined this will never happen to him. A woman laments that Raul's womanizing and drug use finally caught up with him. A priest remembers Raul as an altar boy. The funeral director observes that he never had so many funerals for young people before the AIDS epidemic. = Follow-ons = After the end of the subway campaign, the Julio and Marisol story was continued in various forms. An untitled episode on the NYC Health blog shows Julio having a conversation with a HIV counselor. Julio has had a HIV test, which showed him to be negative. The conversation covers what Julio needs to do to remain negative, and touches on the fact that Julio's brother is gay. Julio calls Marisol to tell her that he tested negative.  Production history  The campaign was initially contracted to Conill, a Latino marketing agency, who determined that a photo- novella would be the best format for the target audience. Conill's contract only covered the first episode, with subsequent episodes managed internally by the Health Department using freelance artists for the drawing. Overhead strip ads, circa 1960s. In 1995, a new advertising policy was instituted for the subway, in which large customers could purchase all the available space on each side of a car. Previously, individual spots were sold, often to small businesses. This new policy left no space for the Julio and Marisol spots, and the series was halted, with eight episodes having been published, and a ninth one already prepared. The new policy reserved 20% of the cars for smaller advertisers, but it was felt that this would be inappropriate for the campaign. The New York Times reported that Ann Sternberg said, \\"she didn't want Julio and Marisol appearing among ads aimed at hemorrhoid sufferers or people with foot-odor problems\\". The series returned in 1997, when negotiations between the Health Department and the Metropolitan Transit Authority provided a path for the spots to appear in 60% of the subway's cars.

At this time the industrialists of France were using dismissals and other forms of repression in an attempt to stamp out socialism, and workers were responding with strikes. Thivrier was uncompromising in his socialist principles, and was known as the \\"deput√© en blouse\\" for wearing his blue worker's smock in the Assembly to the outrage of the bourgeois members. Early years 1841‚Äì74 Christophe Thivrier (or Tivrier, known as Christou) was born on 16 May 1841 in Durdat-Larequille, Allier, the youngest of four children. His parents were Jean Gilbert Thivrier (1809‚Äì1904) and Marie Anne Mansier (1799‚Äì1852). His father was from N√©ris-les- Bains, and worked as a farm laborer, in construction and in the mines. Christophe had to leave school and start work at an early age. He became a miner. When he was 28 he became a small building contractor, and later became a wine merchant. He was one of the founders of the labour movement in Allier. The \\"Marianne\\", a secret society created to fight the reactionary actions of conservatives, often met in his home. On 15 November 1868 he married in Durdat-Larequille to Marie Martin (1842‚Äì1932). Their children were Gilbert Alphonse (1869-1936(, L√©on Martial (1871-1920), Joseph Isidore (1874-1944) and Louise Ang√©line (1879-1973). Local politics 1874‚Äì89 In 1874 Thivrier was elected municipal councilor for Commentry on the Republican list. He was reelected in 1878. In 1879 he became a supporter of collectivism, and on 21 January 1881 he was elected to the council with the entire list of workers and socialists. It was the first town hall in France to be captured by the workers party and the socialists. Thivrier defeated St√©phane Mony, the director of the Soci√©t√© de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville, which owned the local mines, and a former mayor and deputy. A list was prepared of everyone who had spread socialist propaganda during the elections, including 135 miners. On 4 June 1881 they were all dismissed, and the workers went on strike. Another 300 were added to the list of \\"agitators\\" during the strike, and had to pass interviews to get their jobs back after the strike. 60 failed these interviews, and 67 were told they needed certificates of good conduct from their new employers before they could work again at the mines. Miners who had been elected to the local council could not find work and had to leave the district. Despite this repression, Thivrier was Mayor of Commentry from 4 June 1882, then district councilor, and gained huge support from the working class. Harassment by the prefectural administration against the workers' administration and government persecution prevented the Socialist Party from presenting a list in the elections on 1884, but on 6 May 1888 Thivrier was reelected in triumph and again appointed Mayor of Commentry. He was removed from office on 14 December 1888 for having sent an address of sympathy to the trade union congress in Bordeaux that he signed with his title of mayor. Thivrier's popularity grew, and in 1889 he was elected to the General Council of Allier. Deputy 1889‚Äì95 Thivrier was elected deputy of Allier on 6 October 1889. In his election manifesto he denounced the oppression and misery of the workers, and proposed social measures such as social support for the old and disabled, responsibility of company owners for workplace accidents, and a direct tax on wealth and income. At the request of the Commentry Socialists he continued to wear his blue worker's blouse (smock) in the Chamber as a symbol of the protest of the proletariat against the privileges of the capitalists, and a symbol of their hope of emancipation. He had campaigned as a Boulangist, but joined the Workers' Party (POF) after being elected. Friedrich Engels saw the elections as a success, counting Eug√®ne Baudin, Thivrier and F√©lix Lachize(fr) as Marxists, and considering that Gustave Paul Cluseret and Ernest Ferroul were \\"bound to cast in their lot with the first three.\\" However, Baudin, Lachize and Cluseret were never active in the POF, and Thivrier and Ferroul joined the POF after the election. A rendition of Thivrier's expulsion, with the socialist leaders ranged behind him In 1890 a strike broke out in Commentry due to the dismissal of 300 miners chosen from the most active socialists. Thivrier spoke out against the interventions and provocations of the army and gendarmerie in support of the mining company. Thivrier was a delegate of the French Workers' Party at the Congress of Lille and Calais (1890) and at the International Congress of Brussels. He was soon criticized by his party for his sympathy with the Blanquist Central Revolutionary Committee (CRC). His relationship with Jean Dormoy(fr) and the Montlu√ßon socialists became strained. At the 1892 National Guesdist Congress in Marseille Thivrier raised violent controversy by defending the general strike. He resigned from the party soon after and led most of the Commentry socialist organizations into membership of the CRC. On 1 May 1893 the government ordered closure of the Labor Exchange (Bourse du Travail). There was a protest, and just after √âdouard Vaillant had addressed the crowd the police charged the demonstrators. Thuvrier joined with Eug√®ne Baudin, Jean-Baptiste Dumay and Alexandre Millerand in protesting to the government. Thivrier was reelected on 3 September 1893, holding office until 8 August 1895. In 1893 Henri Ghesqui√®re(fr), a Guesdist leader, reported in La Socialiste Troyen that when Thivrier entered the Assembly wearing his worker's blouse (smock) he was greeted by an uproar among the bourgeois leaders. Ghesqui√®re commented that, \\"... a clean blue smock has every right to be worn in the Assembly, as does a frock, because if clothes do not make the man, neither does the frock make the legislator.\\" Thivrier's program in the 1893 elections included an 8-hour day and one day of rest per week, protection and education for children, equal pay for men and women, participation of workers in developing shop rules, nationalization of the banks and railways and operation of state factories by the workers. On 27 January 1894 Thivrier was temporarily excluded from the Assembly for having shouted \\"Long live the Commune!\\" during a debate on attacks on personal liberty. He was invited by President Charles Dupuy to explain himself from the tribune. He said that unlike the Auvergne deputy [Dupuy] he fully believed what he said. The session was suspended for half an hour and he was forcibly expelled. When the session was resumed √âdouard Vaillant took up Thivrier's defense with a glowing eulogy of the Paris Commune. Thivrier resigned from his seat in the departmental council in 1890 to make way for one of his friends, was reelected in 1892 but was defeated in 1895. He died on 8 August 1895 in Commentry after a short illness. He was given a large funeral by the people of Commentry. The main street in Commentry carries his name. Publications Thrivier was Directeur de publication of the Socialiste of Commentry. While in the Chamber of Deputies Thrivier co-authored a legislative proposal.

On Dec 7, 1981 the Holloway was laid up in Toledo, Ohio never to sail again. In 1985 she was sold to the Marine Salvage Ltd. of Port Colborne, Ontario. Later that year the Holloway was sold to a Brazilian shipbreaker. On September 16, 1986 she cleared Quebec along with the steamer Philip D. Block in tow of the Polish tug Jantar. They arrived in Recife, Brazil on October 21, 1986.

The Vigil prior to the closing Mass was divided into three blocks: Argentine, Latin American and World, for each the Pope directed a different message. =12 April= The central act was the closing mass celebrated in front of the Obelisco de Buenos Aires, on April 12th, Palm Sunday, in front of over a million people and was the first time that a Pope celebrated a Palm Sunday outside of Rome. Audience More than 1 million young people from all over the world gathered at the 9 de Julio Avenue in the Argentine capital to participate in the conference. Its central ceremonies took place at Plaza de Constituci√≥n, one of the largest squares of the Argentine capital. The Cross The Cross of the World Youth Day was a wooden crucifix of 3.8 m height given to young Catholics by Pope John Paul II at the end of the Holy Year of 1984 with the words \\"Take it for the world as a sign of the love of the Lord Jesus.\\" For the first time since its institution, the Cross out of Rome to be one of the main symbols of WYD in Buenos Aires 1987. Hymn of the World Youth Day 1987 THE NEW CIVILIZATION The WYD Hymn of Buenos Aires 1987, popularly known as \\"Un Nuevo Sol\\" was composed by Alberto Croce and Eugenio Perpetua. A land that has no borders but hands that together will form a stronger chain that war and that death. We know it, love is the path A more just and fraternal homeland where we all build unity where nobody is displaced, because all are called. We know...

SAPRAC was founded in March 2016 by Salman Al-Ansari, a Saudi writer and political commentator and is headquartered at 1101 30th St NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington D.C.. The group gets its funding from online subscriptions and corporate funding and seeks to influence policymakers more than the general public according to political observers. In July 2017, SAPRAC purchased $138,000 on seven, 30-second TV spots on WRC-TV, and then $120,000 on four television advertisements played during NBC's Meet the Press. The advertisements were intended to portray Qatar in a bad light, characterizing them as state-sponsors of terror, and an opponent of U.S. allies in the Middle East. SAPRAC established a website called 'The Qatar Insider' which acts as a newsletter, disparaging the Qatari government and its policies. It also purchased ad slots on cable news shows playing the British Open golf tournament, which according to Reem Daffa, the group's executive director, was a deliberate move to influence President Trump, an avid golf fan. However, the groups' founder, Salman al-Ansari, has said SAPRAC's role is an \\"informational\\" one rather than an \\"advocacy\\" one. Barry Bennett, a Republican lobbyist and consultant, urged the Department of Justice in a letter to investigate SAPRAC for allegedly violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The group is registered in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate as a lobbyist under domestic advocacy laws. In September 2017, the group registered as a foreign agent.

He pleaded guilty to \\"money laundering and manufacturing, supplying and selling an unlicensed medicine\\" and was sentenced in November 2018 to 15 months' imprisonment. Business Noakes was a computer consultant for a decade, including for the BBC, according to his own biography. In 2004, he designed an alphabetical keyboard layout. He says he has worked for several Cornish companies, including Holman Brothers, Mount Wellington Tin Mine, and Phillips Frith, and in several countries, including in Brussels and for JPMorgan Chase Bank in New York. =Immuno Biotech= Noakes is CEO and owner of Immuno Biotech Ltd. (trade name First Immune), a Guernsey company that promotes the use of the protein GcMAF, a blood product, as a cure for cancer, autism, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases, claiming to treat 10,000 patients worldwide with income of ¬£1 million per month. Noakes began promoting GcMAF in 2010, and the company had laboratories in Oxford in 2012. Noakes has been on the board of governors of the National Health Federation (a lobbying group promoting alternative medicine ) since April 2016 and was on the long list for Guernsey Press Ambassador of the Year 2013. Noakes advised cancer patients to not take chemotherapy and promoted the treatment to the Guernsey Chamber of Commerce despite criticism from Cancer Research UK; doctors on Guernsey all declined an invite to a meeting about GcMAF. In July 2014, NatWest bank closed the company's accounts. In 2015, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) took over 10,000 vials of GcMAF during an inspection of the company's unlicensed Milton, Cambridgeshire site and shut down production, after it found that the plasma the GcMAF was derived from was not for human use, and that the production site did not meet good manufacturing practice standards. Noakes' former personal assistant, who worked for him in 2012, said that sometimes Noakes' own blood was used. The company had been supplying GcMAF to around 100 Guernsey residents free of charge until imports were prohibited by the Guernsey Border Agency in February 2015. Noakes' company began supplying an alternative called Goleic in place of GcMAF. Noakes claimed in March 2015 that the UK authorities were harassing him and his family, then was interviewed by the BBC's The One Show in May 2015, but stormed out and threatened to smash the camera. A complaint to the BBC Trust about the interview was dismissed. Later that summer, the Swiss regulator Swissmedic closed the First Immune clinic in Bussigny, after five deaths of patients since it opened in October 2013. Noakes worked with American autism doctor Jeff Bradstreet until the latter committed suicide in June 2015, following a federal government raid of his office in connection to his work on GcMAF. Noakes also worked with scientist Marco Ruggiero until Noakes' Swiss clinic was closed. In November 2015, Noakes was found guilty by an employment tribunal of sex discrimination against his former personal assistant at Immuno Biotech, Lucia Pagliarone, and was made to pay ¬£10,500. Pagliarone claimed she was asked to give injections as part of her role, despite not having medical training. Despite a police search of the Immuno Biotech office and a home in January 2016, Noakes had predicted in November 2016 that the MHRA investigation would come to nothing and he would \\"take down\\" the regulator; however, Guernsey police again raided the Immuno Biotech office in Lower Pollet in February 2017 and arrested a man and a woman, which Noakes said was a \\"smear campaign\\". French gendarmes also raided three Immuno Biotech sites in Normandy in February 2017. Noakes also ran a company, Macro Innovations, that illegally manufactured GcMAF for patient use at a laboratory in Cambridgeshire. Noakes was charged with money laundering, and conspiracy to manufacture a medicinal product without a licence, by the Crown Prosecution Service's Specialist Fraud Division in July 2017. He stood trial at Southwark Crown Court in November 2018, along with Brian Hall, Emma Ward and his former wife Loraine Noakes. Two of his Guernsey staff appeared in court in January 2018, in connection with the inquiry into Noakes' suspected criminal conduct. Noakes pleaded guilty to \\"money laundering and manufacturing, supplying and selling an unlicensed medicine\\" and was sentenced in November 2018 to 15 months' imprisonment. He failed to report to police in December 2019 while on bail and was arrested in May 2020 in Truro. In June 2020, a confiscation order of ¬£1,349,400.48 was made at Southwark Crown Court against Noakes and his company. Noakes is also under a European arrest warrant due to charges in France. Politics Noakes joined UKIP in 2003, and was its parliamentary candidate in Truro and St Austell in 2005, gaining 5.3% of the vote. Noakes came last of the four candidates in the 2006 UKIP leadership election, with 851 votes. During the election campaign he called the EU a \\"police state\\" and advocated UKIP forming a shadow cabinet; Nigel Farage won with 3,329 votes. Noakes left UKIP in February 2007, writing in a letter that the leadership had betrayed the membership; Mark Croucher said Noakes was \\"a swivel-eyed loon whose insane conspiracy theories make the rest of us look as mad as a box of frogs\\". Noakes was an independent town councillor for Penwerris ward on Falmouth Town Council and a member of the planning committee from May 2007 until January 2010, when he resigned due to \\"work commitments\\". He was fourth on the list for the United Kingdom First Party in the East Midlands region for the 2009 European Parliament elections; UK First received 1.7% of the vote. He stood in the December 2015 Guernsey by-election in Saint Peter Port North on a platform of increased democracy in Guernsey and introducing a constitution, gaining 109 votes (12.3%). Noakes runs the website EUTruth.org, and since 2007 has published the free monthly newspaper Westminster News, in which he claimed that Zionists and the German company Siemens control the BBC. He has promoted theories about the Illuminati. Personal life Noakes was born in London, went to Truro School and has lived in Port Pendennis, Falmouth, Cornwall, Guernsey, and Waldershare in Kent, where he was living before being jailed in 2018. He was married in 1989 to Loraine, with whom he has a son and a daughter. They are divorced. Noakes sailed a yacht called Moonlight out of Falmouth between 2005 and 2010, and holds a pilot's licence.

Jones-LeCointe came to public attention in 1970 as one of the nine protestors, known as the Mangrove Nine, arrested and tried on charges that included conspiracy to incite a riot, following a protest against police raids of The Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill, London.  Early life and education  Born Altheia Jones in Trinidad, she left for Britain in 1965 to complete a PhD in biochemistry at University College London.  Political activism  While studying in London, Jones- LeCointe became involved in community organising against racism and for the rights of people of African and Asian heritage in the UK. She worked as a teacher and organiser in the Universal Coloured Peoples' Association (UCPA). = British Black Panther Movement = After the arrest and departure of Obi Egbuna in 1968, Jones-LeCointe became a central and leading figure of the British Black Panther Movement. She recruited a central core of activists into the movement, including Darcus Howe and Eddie LeCointe. Eddie LeCointe, her husband, was also a leading figure of the British Black Panther Movement. Jones-LeCointe was a Panther teacher; she spoke at schools and taught classes in anti-colonialism. Poet Linton Kwesi Johnson joined the Black Panther Youth league after seeing Jones-LeCointe debate at his sixth-form. In an interview with The Guardian, Johnson describes Jones-LeCointe as \\"perhaps the most remarkable woman I've ever met\\". She also played a key role in ensuring that defending black women and girls was at the core of the movement. This included building structures into the organisation to ensure that men suspected of the abuse or exploitation of women were interrogated and punished if found guilty. W. Chris Johnson, writing in Gender, Imperialism and Global Exchanges (edited by Miescher, Mitchell and Shibusawa, 2015), states: \\"Jones-LeCointe's authority, and her energetic pursuit of justice, unsettled Panthers who did not see anti-sexism as an intrinsic part of revolutionary praxis.\\" Jones- LeCointe is considered by academics and her contemporaries to be the leader of the British Black Panther Movement. According to the British Black Panthers' official photographer Neil Kenlock: \\"Althea (sic) never called herself the leader, but she led us.\\" Interviewed for an article published in Jacobin magazine, Jones-LeCointe says: \\"I don't know how I've suddenly become 'a leader,'\\" she recalls, \\"we didn't recognize those categories ... we believed in collective leadership.\\" = The Mangrove Nine = Jones-LeCointe was one of the nine protesters arrested and tried in what has since been described as \\"Britain's most influential black power trial\\". In 1969 and 1970, The Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill became the target of repeated police raids. The police claimed the restaurant was a hub for criminal activity, despite a lack of evidence found. A march was organised by local Panthers and community leaders to demand police get their \\"hands off The Mangrove\\".  The march  On Sunday, 9 August 1970, an estimated 150 people took part in the protest. Jones-LeCointe and Howe addressed the demonstrators outside the restaurant. Jones-LeCointe spoke on community self-help and rights for British citizens. The protesters were flanked and monitored by hundreds of police officers, with the estimated number of police officers ranging from 200 to 700. The heavy-handed policing led to clashes in the crowd. During the march, Jones-LeCointe was coming to the aid of an injured woman when she was seized by three police constables and carried to a van.  The trial  Jones- LeCointe and Howe took the move of being their own defence and argued for an all-black jury. In Jones-LeCointe's closing speech, she referred to the police persecution of the black community in Notting Hill. In December 1971, the jury found the defendants not guilty of the most serious charge of conspiracy to incite a riot. The jury asked for more lenient sentencing as Jones-LeCointe was pregnant. Jones-LeCointe and three others were convicted of assault. Judge Clarke suspended the sentences.  Depiction in the media  Jones-LeCointe appears in the documentary film The Mangrove Nine (1973). In 2017, Jones- LeCointe's role in the British Black Panther Movement gained renewed interest following the release of Sky Atlantic drama miniseries Guerrilla, inspired by the emergence of British Black Power. The series was criticised for the casting of a lead character played by Indian actress Freida Pinto and the exclusion of major Black British female characters. Critics accused the show of erasing Black women from the history of the British Black Power movement.

He studied at the Universities of Krakow and Vienna, took a Doctor of Law degree, and taught economics in Poland in the 1930s, eventually being appointed to the Chair of Political Economy at the University of Krakow.New Scientist, 7 March 1953, p. 43.

Sociological career and later life  Zweig arrived in the United Kingdom and became the economic adviser to the Polish government-in-exile headed by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, while also authoring Poland Between Two Wars and The Planning of Free Societies. During the war, he also worked as a lecturer at the Polish Faculty of Law at the University of Oxford;Helen McCarthy, \\"Social Science and Married Women‚Äôs Employment in Post- War Britain\\", Past and Present, vol. 233, no. 1 (2016), pp. 280‚Äì281. it closed down in 1947,The New Oxford Companion to Law (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 372. and he was later a Simon Research Fellow at the University of Manchester. After the war, Seebohm Rowntree commissioned Zweig to study spending habits and poverty, which formed the basis of a book, Labour, Life and Poverty (1948). This was followed by Men in the Pits (1948), The British Worker (1952) and Women's Life and Labour. In the view of Helen McCarthy, Zweig's studies of working-class men were related to the concerns of other post-war social researchers like Brian Jackson, Dennis Marsden and Peter Willmott, \\"all deeply absorbed in the 'male melodrama of the upwardly mobile'\\"; Zweig's studies of women in work, however, reflected interests not shared with those men.McCarthy, p. 281. McCarthy argues that Zweig was one of a number of researchers in the 1950s (such as Viola Klein, Pearl Jephcott, Judith Hubback, Nancy Seear and Hannah Gavron) who \\"helped to entrench new understandings of married women‚Äôs employment as a fundamental feature of advanced industrial societies, and one that solved the dilemmas of ‚Äòmodern‚Äô woman across social classes.\\"McCarthy, p. 270. Zweig's post-war books‚Äîespecially The British Worker and Women's Life and Labour‚Äî\\"established his reputation as a social chronicler\\", according to The Times. He went on to produce The Worker in Affluent Society in 1961, The Student in the Age of Anxiety in 1963, and The Quest for Fellowship two years later. He also produced a study of Cumbernauld New Town, questioning the rationale behind the schemes, and also, in 1976, wrote The New Acquisitive Society for the New Right Centre for Policy Studies wherein he critiqued aspects of the Welfare State. While he held visiting professorships in Israel, he produced The Israeli Worker (1959) and The Sword and the Harp (1969). Zweig had been naturalised as a British subject in 1948; he was married twice, firstly to Dora, who predeceased him, and secondly to Ruth who survived him, along with his daughter Eve, who married the pianist Peter Katin.

She is the author of Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray, which explores the concept of elegance in fundamental physics and cosmology.  Education  Hossenfelder completed her undergraduate degree in 1997 at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t in Frankfurt am Main. She remained there for a Master's degree, and she wrote a thesis under the supervision of Walter Greiner titled \\"Particle Production in Time Dependent Gravitational Fields\\", which she completed in 2000. Hossenfelder received her doctorate from the same institution in 2003, for the thesis \\"Black Holes in Large Extra Dimensions\\" under the supervision of Horst St√∂cker.  Research  Hossenfelder remained in Germany until 2004 as a postdoctoral researcher at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. She moved to North America and completed research fellowships at the University of Arizona, Tucson, University of California, Santa Barbara and Perimeter Institute, Canada. She joined Nordita Institute for Theoretical Physics, Sweden, in 2009 as an Assistant Professor. In 2018 she was a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. Hossenfelder's research interest is in the phenomenology of quantum gravity. She focuses on the role of Lorentz invariance and locality, which would be altered in the discovery of quantum gravity. Hossenfelder is trying to find experimental evidence of quantum gravity. Since 2007 she has been involved with the annual conference series \\"Experimental Search for Quantum Gravity\\". Hossenfelder has created a number of YouTube videos exploring the topic. She has been employed by the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies since 2015, where she leads the Analog Systems for Gravity Duals group. Hossenfelder has also been researching since at least 2008 on how technology is changing researchers' ability to publicize, discuss, or publish their research, when she co-organized the Science in the 21st Century workshop.  Public engagement  Hossenfelder is a freelance popular science writer who has kept a blog since 2006. She contributes to the Forbes column \\"Starts with a Bang\\" as well as Quanta Magazine, New Scientist, Nature, Scientific American, Nautilus and Physics Today. In 2016, Hossenfelder offered to act as a physics consultant on her blog‚ÄîUS$50 for twenty minutes of discussion‚Äîand had to recruit five extra physicists to deal with the demand. In 2017 she created cards featuring pioneering quantum physicists. Live Science and The Guardian quoted Hossenfelder as an authority when trying to evaluate the importance of Stephen Hawking's last scientific publication. In an October 10, 2020 blog post, she argued that science shows there is no such thing as free will. Basic Books are the publishers of Hossenfelder's first book, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray, released in June 2018. A review in Nature described it as \\"provocative\\", and Frank Wilczek recommended it as an \\"intensely personal and intellectually hard-edged\\" book, even though he disagreed with it \\"on many points\\". Peter Woit summarized the book's theme as follows: :At various points Hossenfelder makes it clear that her worry is that physicists are getting stuck due to outdated notions of \\"beauty\\", while at the same time she still believes that successful new ideas will come with their own new form of \\"beauty\\". Hossenfelder also is invited for talks, about \\"What is wrong with physics\\" for example.Was l√§uft falsch in der gegenw√§rtigen Physik? , University of Stuttgart, 2019-05-14. Her 2018 book, Lost in Math, was also published in German with the title, Das H√§ssliche Universum (The Ugly Universe). Hossenfelder posits that a universe (and its particle model) is ugly if it cannot be described by a mathematical (beautiful) Great Unifying Theory that explains how particles gravitate.

He was born in north London on 9 October 1924 of French ancestry. He was educated at Latymer School and St Paul's School, London. He then studied Mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating BA around 1945. Here he had met Prof Ronald Fisher who convinced him of the importance between statistics and the objective of resolving actual rather than theoretical scientific problems. He therefore went to work at the Rothamsted Experimental Station. In 1947 he began lecturing in Statistics at Aberdeen University. In 1949 Cambridge awarded him an MA degree. In 1952 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh aged only 28. His proposers were Reginald Victor Jones, William Ogilvy Kermack, David Cuthbertson and Alexander Aitken. He obtained a further MA Degree from Oxford University in 1953 and joined the Institute of Statistics in Oxford where he stayed until 1955. In 1955 he moved to the London School of Economics as a lecturer and in 1964 to Imperial College, London. He had received a doctorate (DSc) from Cambridge in 1960.

Youth Florence Wyman was born on March 24, 1855, in St. Louis. Her parents were Edward Wyman, a noted educator, and Elizabeth Frances Hadley. Both moved to St. Louis from Boston. When her mother died, her father remarried to Martha Leigh. From the age of eight years up to twenty-two Wyman studied music, her first teacher being Sabatski. Her most influential teacher was William G. Robyn, father of Alfred Robyn. He was succeeded by a number of other teachers, notably Egmont Froelich, who gave her a valuable training in technic specified as the Stuttgart method. At nineteen she began work with Arthur J. Creswold, and after a year was given a position as organist in the First Presbyterian Church, playing in concerts as well as for the service. Florence Wyman was educated at Bonham's Seminary and Mary Institute, graduating from the latter in 1873, in the class with Emilie Johnson and Nellie Hazeltine, and again from the advanced course two years later, under Carlos Pennell, Wilham G. Elliott and Miss Wall. Marriage and family She was married in 1878 to James Richardson II (1855‚Äì1905), vice- president of the Doctor J.H.

The couple had three sons and three daughters (among whom: James III, Dorothea (1880‚Äì1911), Florence Wyman (1889‚Äì1966), and Elizabeth Hadley (1891‚Äì1979)). Elizabeth later was married to writer Ernest Hemingway. Richardson, the husband, killed himself by gunshot on February 8, 1905. It was said he was worried over losses from speculative investments in the wheat market.\\"Losses and Insomnia Cause James Richardson to End Life,\\" The St. Louis Republic, February 9, 1905, page 4 Civic activities Florence Wyman Richardson, 1920 For twelve years Florence Wyman Richardson conducted classes in theosophy, also contributed to leading periodicals. Later she became a member of the Executive Board of the Women's Trade Union League, and of the Suffrage Committee of the National Women's Trade Union. Richardson originated the idea of organizing the Piano Club, of which she was the president for the first seven years. This was the first lasting music club of St. Louis. It was formed to foster piano work, only one-third of the members being vocalists and two-thirds pianists. Many of the musicales were given at Richardson's home in Cabanne Place, where the club entertained among others, Carl Faelton, of the New England Conservatory; Mrs. Eliot, wife of Harvard's president, and also gave its friends the pleasure of a recital by Adele Aus der Ohe. It was again at her home, that Richardson called a meeting of women interested in music to take a part in forming a symphony organization in connection with the local choral society. This was one of the efforts which shortly afterwards helped in the founding of a home orchestra which has developed into the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. She was friends with Josiah Royce, Hamlin Garland and John Fiske; other friends included Guida Lippman, Lydia Fuller Dickinson and Charles L. Deyo. Richardson was a student of theosophy. For twelve years she led classes in this field of religious philosophy. She visited for three successive seasons, several weeks each, the summer colony called Greenacre, at Eliot, Maine, on the Piscataqua River. The colony was attended, among others, by Edward Everett Hale, John Fiske, Edwin D. Meade, Charles Johnston and Nathaniel Schmidt. During her Greenacre experience she lectured seven times ‚Äî the topics being Music, Genius and Theosophy. In St. Louis she presided for several years over the little local branch of the Theosophical Society, but in 1908 resigned continuing her study classes for two years later. Suffrage work Daughter Florence Wyman Richardson in a photo and as sketched by journalist Marguerite Martyn in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of March 13, 1910 In 1882 Richardson joined the suffrage club founded by Virginia L. Minor, working for a time on a petition to the Missouri Legislature asking that the age of consent be raised. At that time it was twelve years in Missouri, ten and eleven in several others, and seven in Delaware. Illness in her family prevented a continuance of this work and a period of inertness and inactivity followed into which she lapsed into a mainly personal life. In 1908 she was placed on the Executive Board of the St. Louis Woman's Trade Union League and at the convention of the National Woman's Trade Union League in Boston, in 1911, was made a member of the suffrage committee of that body. In 1910 Richardson received a call from Laura Gregg who has been active in the Arizona suffrage campaign. She announced herself as being sent from the National Woman Suffrage headquarters in response to a request from Florence W. Richardson, Richardson's daughter. The three women thrashed the matter over that afternoon and immediately afterwards Florence Richardson ‚Äî later married to Roland G. Usher, of Washington University - drew up a circular letter, addressing it to a small number of women. A half dozen met in response. After this, the daughter made a house-to-house canvass; the newspapers hailed the women as something new, giving them a notoriety. The first suffrage speech made by Richardson was at the Artists' Guild, the second was from the platform of the Christian Socialists, and many more followed. A second circular letter was sent to a larger number of women, many of whom met at Richardson's home at 5737 Cates Avenue on April 13, 1910, and organized with forty members, electing her as president; Garesche and Atkinson, vice-presidents, and Bertha Rombauer and Mrs. D. W. Kneffler, secretary and treasurer, respectively. A board of fifteen governors was formed including the officers. Richardson reluctantly resigned the presidency on account of ill-health in February, 1912. Death Mrs. Richardson died on August 19, 1920. She is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

On 23 September 1943, when a German tank broke through the Soviet line of defence where she was treating wounded soldiers, she threw herself under the tank with a bag of grenades, killing herself but repulsing the German counterattack. She was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 June 1944.  Civilian life  Valeriya was born on 18 October 1923 to a Russian family in the village of Modolitsy in the Petrograd Governorate. Her father was a postmaster and her mother worked as a housekeeper. In 1924 the family moved to Bardovskoye, Podporozhsky, in the Leningrad region, where she attended primary school. After graduating from secondary school she joined the Komsomol and intended to join a mining institute. After the start of the Second World War her father was drafted into the military in July 1941 and her mother took over the management of the post office. In September 1941 the approach of Axis troops in Operation Barbarossa put Podporozhsky and other districts surrounding Leningrad in the front line of the conflict. The female members of the Gnarovskaya family ‚Äì Valeriya, her grandmother, mother, and sister ‚Äì were evacuated to Omsk in Siberia and then to the city of Berdyuzhye, where Valeriya and her mother worked in telecommunications. After sending repeated petitions to be allowed to join the ranks of the military on the front lines, Valeriya and several fellow members of the Komsomol finally presented themselves at a recruiting station on 10 April 1942, were permitted to enroll in the 229th Infantry Division, and were sent to complete brief medical courses.  Military career  In July 1942 the unit was sent to the Stalingrad front where she evacuated wounded soldiers from the battlefield. Facing heavy enemy fire she would carry the injured to safety, often having to bear a weapon for protection in close quarters. On July 26 enemy forces broke through the Soviet infantry's line of defense and crossed the Chir River, but the unit continued to fight to prevent the Axis from reaching a railroad. On July 31 her unit, with 112th Infantry Division, tanks, and air support, initiated a counteroffensive and forced the Axis soldiers to retreat behind the Chir river. For over two weeks the unit engaged in nonstop battle, in which she was on medic duty where she contracted typhoid fever. Soldiers carried her, barely alive, to a hospital, and she was considered missing in action. After recovering she was sent back to battle on the 3rd Ukrainian Front. After intense battle between 15‚Äì22 August after carrying 30 wounded to safety she sustained a severe concussion but soon returned to battle. After the concussion she reported in a letter to her mother that she could not hear well after the event. In a battle near the river of Seversky Donets she carried 47 wounded soldiers, officers, and their weapons from the battlefield and personally killed 28 German soldiers in action. Throughout her career she saved an estimated 338 wounded soldiers. In her last battle, which took place on 23 September 1943 near the village of Gnarovsky, then named Ivanenka, as part of the 907th Rifle Regiment she rescued the wounded from the front lines and took them to the hospital tent; she also killed 47 German soldiers in action. When two German Tiger I tanks broke past defensive lines and approached the medical station, seeing the tanks approaching, Gnarovskaya grabbed a satchel of grenades, threw herself under the tank and detonated them, killing herself and destroying one of the approaching tanks. Soviet soldiers managed to overwhelm and destroy the second tank and defended the medical station. At the cost of her life the German attack was repulsed and the mission was completed. After the battle villagers found the remains of her body and buried her. One year later her remains were reburied with full military honors. For her heroism in battle she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 June 1944 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the village of Ivanenka where she died was renamed Gnarovsky.

History The Hamburg Blues Band is a German blues rock group and was founded by the singer and rhythm guitarist Gert Lange in 1982. The original band composition was complemented for a number of years by Alex Conti on lead guitar. Following the departure of Alex Conti, the current line-up of the Hamburg Blues Band consists of Miller Anderson on lead guitar (formerly of Keef Hartley and Savoy Brown), Gert Lange (vocals and rhythm guitar), Hans Wallbaum on drums and Michael \\"Bexi\\" Becker on the bass. Prior to Anderson becoming the band's lead guitarist, the band engaged Clem Clempson, formerly of Humble Pie, among other bands. Becker had also been a member of Lake, a band revived by Conti in the early 2000s, while still a member of the Hamburg Blues Band. The Hamburg Blues Band's former keyboard player, Adrian Askew, was also a member of the revived Lake. British saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith (formerly Bluesbreakers and Colosseum) was an integral part of Hamburg Blues Band from its 1982 inception until his death from cancer in 2004. Heckstall- Smith died shortly before the release of the band's album Live - On The Edge of A Knife. On this album, Heckstall-Smith was given a special memorial with his 18 minute song \\"Woza Nasu\\" ( Bring Home The Goods ). An informal band member is songwriter Pete Brown, known for his association with Jack Bruce and Cream and the primary lyricist for \\"White Room\\" and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", among other songs. A very special experience was the \\"Herzberg Blues Allstars\\" compiled in the summer of 2006 for the \\"Burg Herzberg Festival\\". The HBB formed the baseband here, opened the concert and was reinforced in the course of the evening by a lot of stars of the European blues scene. These were in particular: Chris Farlowe , Clem Clempson , Mike Harrison and Pete Brown. This was recorded on a double DVD produced by the WDR Rockpalast. Following the departure of lead guitarist Alex Conti in spring 2008, former Humble Pie and (yet) Colosseum guitarist Clem Clempson was featured as a permanent member of the band. He left the band again in 2012 and made way for Miller Anderson . Keyboarder Adrian Askew Lake also left the band in 2012 to support Clem Clempson in his solo career. Both are already playing on the 2008 produced studio album \\"Mad Dog Blues\\", which was released in mid-January 2009. In 2011, they toured with Arthur Brown and Chris Farlowe . In the \\"Friends for a LIVEtime\\" tour in winter / spring 2013, the trio Lange / Becker / Wallbaum continued to perform together with the guitarist Miller Anderson .

Occurrence Isophytol has been in found in two red algae species and more than 15 plant species. Concentrations found have been low. Synthesis It can be synthesized in six steps from pseudoionone and propargyl alcohol. Total synthesis begins with the combination of acetylene and acetone to produce 3-methyl-1-butyn-3-ol. Hydrogenation by palladium catalysis results in 3-methyl-1-buten-3-ol. Reaction with diketene or acetic acid ester creates the acetoacetate; thermal reaction leads to 2-methyl-2-hepten-6-one. The steps of adding acetylene and then isopropenyl methyl ether and hydrogenating the product are done twice (this involves an intermediate of pseudoionone); then acetylene is added to create dehydroisophytol. Hydrogenation results in isophytol. Uses Production industrially was estimated to be 35000 to 40000 tons in 2002, created by total synthesis, with about 99.9% used in synthesizing vitamin E and vitamin K1. More than 95% of the less than 40 tons used annually in consumer products is as a fragrance. Less than 2 tons a year is used for flavoring. In perfumes the concentration is 0.2% v/v at most.

It was established in 1859 in a merger of J.C. Burbank & Company and Chase & Allen, at which point it controlled all the major stagecoach lines in the state. In the years before railroads linked Minnesota communities, the Minnesota Stage Company played a crucial role in shaping the commercial and social life of the young state. Background Willoughby & Powers opened the first stagecoach line in 1849 in what was then Minnesota Territory, running between St. Paul and St. Anthony. There were no railroad lines in the territory. Instead, inhabitants relied on carts, wagons, and coaches for overland travel and shipping. Individuals and companies scrambled to establish roads, routes, and coach lines. Establishment James Burbank was born in Vermont and moved to Minnesota by 1849. In 1851, he started a one-man operation transporting letters, documents, and cargo from St. Paul to Galena, Illinois, and back by stagecoach. He officially formed the Northwestern Express Company in 1854. The company's expansion was slow until 1855, when new associate Russell Blakeley helped bring in valuable mail contracts that allowed the company to grow. Along with the mail contracts, the company soon began to gain wider recognition in Minnesota. In 1858, businessmen from Lake City paid them to operate a line of stage coaches between Lake City and Rochester, Minnesota. In the winter of 1857‚Äì58 they were hired by the Hudson's Bay Company to help transport goods from St. Paul to their northern outposts in the Red River Valley. They agreed to operate freight wagons, stage coaches, and steamboats up the Red River to Fort Abercrombie, and then to outposts farther north. Peak years In 1859, J.C. Burbank & Company's Northwestern Express merged with the stage company of Allen & Chase to form the Minnesota Stage Company. That June, Russell Blakeley set out with a group to build and expand a stage route from St. Cloud to Fort Abercrombie. In three weeks the team built bridges, cleared trees, and established stage stops along the stage road. The route, which originally transported freight, soon began transporting passengers to the Red River Valley. The Minnesota Stage Company's road opened the valley to new immigrants. However, it did so at the expense of the area's original inhabitants. While the stage road ran on land already ceded by the Ojibwe people, the company's steamboats passed through territory held by the tribe's Red Lake and Pembina bands. They wrote to the company requesting compensation for the huge increase in traffic that frightened fish and game and disturbed the spirits of their ancestors. The company did not compensate the tribe. Instead, the U.S. government sent negotiators to open talks for a new treaty in 1862. The negotiators, however, were unable to reach the Red River Valley because of the start of the Dakota War of 1862, and talks did not proceed. After the war, the company lost its contract with the Hudson's Bay Company. It maintained the stage route, however, carrying goods and people into the Red River Valley. By the end of 1859, the company controlled all the major stage routes in Minnesota. Its lucrative mail contracts on each line required it to build better roads. It continued to expand its network of stage stops, coaches, and wagons. Where stagecoaches stopped, hotels, restaurants, and shops appeared to serve the traveling clientele. By 1865 the company employed 200 men and regularly used 700 horses. At top speeds, the stagecoaches could travel about in 24 hours. Decline As railroads were built throughout Minnesota in the years following the American Civil War, the role of the stagecoach declined. James Burbank sold his share in the Minnesota Stage Company in 1867 to concentrate on his other business endeavors. By 1880, most parts of Minnesota were linked by railroads, rendering the stage routes obsolete. Legacy While the stagecoach industry thrived in Minnesota for less than 30 years, it played a vital role in the development of the state. The company built roads, extended communication networks, and connected the fledgling state. In the late twentieth century, in recognition of their contribution to the history of Minnesota, efforts were made to preserve the remaining stagecoach roads. The Kandota Section of the Red River Valley Stage Road and the Mount Pleasant Section of the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road, both built by the Minnesota Stage Company, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

He is a member of The Republicans.  Early life and professional career  Ian Boucard was born on 5 May 1988 in Belfort, Territoire de Belfort, to a 19-year-old mother who temporarily suspended her studies in order to raise him. Initially raised in the R√©sidences district in his first few years, he grew up in the Dardel district, and was educated in public schools in Belfort, at the √âcole √©l√©mentaire publique Les Barr√®s, Coll√®ge L√©onard de Vinci, and Lyc√©e Condorcet, taking preparatory classes for business school at the Lyc√©e Courbet. He started coaching youth teams at ASM Belfort at the age of 15, and has continued to supervise teams across all youth age groups since then, including during his studies and professional career, which allowed him to secure an internship at L'Or√©al. He studied at the ESC Dijon Bourgogne for two years, and subsequently entered the supermarket sector, employed by Unilever and Super U. He was the official announcer for ASM Belfort at its home stadium Stade Roger-Serzian during Championnat National 2 matches from 2012 to 2017.  Political career  Boucard first became involved in politics in 2007, after being invited by a friend part of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) to a meeting with Damien Meslot. Two months later, he accepted an invitation by the same friend to join Meslot's list in the 2008 municipal elections in Belfort under the label of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), at position 37 of 45 on the UMP list, which was defeated in the second round a three-way election against the Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC) list led by √âtienne Butzbach which won with 48.27% of the vote, compared to 38.06% for the UMP list led by Meslot and 13.67% for the miscellaneous right list supported by the MoDem led by Christophe Grudler, who refused to merge his list with Meslot's after the first round. He became a member of the UMP in 2009, at the age of 20, and was employed by Meslot as a parliamentary assistant starting in 2013. In the 2014 municipal elections, Boucard once again joined the UMP list led by Meslot and was nominated for spot 7 of 45. Meslot won by a large margin in the second round after Christophe Grudler withdrew following the first round, securing 47.38% of the vote against the Socialist Party (PS) list led by Etienne Butzbach with 31.96% of the vote, the National Front (FN) list led by Marc Archambault with 10.43% of the vote, and the MRC list led by Bastien Faudot with 10.21% of the vote. It was the first time in 37 years that the city was won by the right, having been governed by the left since 1977. As municipal councillor, he was charged with the children, youth and associative life portfolio, and as vice president of the agglomeration community of Grand Belfort, received the housing and urban policy portfolio. He was also an administrator at the office of public housing and public works company of Territoire de Belfort. He was selected as a UMP alternate in the 2015 departmental elections within the canton of Belfort 3, but MoDem candidates Julie de Breza and Christophe Grudler defeated the UMP ticket of Florence Besancenot and Damien Meslot in the second round, receiving 53.50% of the vote against their opponents with 46.50% of the vote. In April 2016, Boucard was designated departmental secretary of The Republicans (LR) in Territoire de Belfort. On 6 November 2016, Meslot confirmed that he would not seek a fourth mandate in the National Assembly, and Boucard was subsequently confirmed as the LR candidate in Territoire de Belfort's 1st constituency in the 2017 legislative elections a week later. He was officially invested as a candidate by the party on 14 January 2017. Although Meslot chose not to run for re-election and instead remain mayor of Belfort, he was still chosen as Boucard's alternate. In the first round on 11 June, Boucard came in second with 23.70% of the vote, with Christophe Grudler, candidate of the MoDem supported by La R√©publique En Marche! coming in first with 31.83% of valid votes. Boucard and Grudler advanced to the second round and the other candidates were eliminated; Jean-Rapha√´l Sandri of the National Front received 17.50% of votes, Ana√Øs Beltran of La France Insoumise secured 12.17%, and Bastien Faudot of the PS and MRC garnered 9.10%. Boucard was elected in the second round on 18 June with 50.75% of the vote, narrowly beating Grudler by 279 votes. He officially took his seat on 21 June with the inauguration of the 15th legislature, joining the LR group and serving on the National Defence and Armed Forces Committee. On the evening of the second round, Christophe Grudler, defeated by 279 votes, announced that he would file an appeal to the Constitutional Council challenging the election, accusing Boucard of electoral manipulation by distributing unsigned electoral leaflets purportedly from La France Insoumise and the National Front. The appeal succeeded, and the election of Boucard was invalidated on 8 December, triggering a by-election, scheduled for 28 January and 4 February 2018. At a public meeting on 18 January 2018, Boucard announced that he decided to sue Christophe Grudler, who called him a \\"cheater\\" and \\"fraudster\\" for his tactics in the June 2017 legislative elections, for defamation. At the hearing on 25 January, Boucard's lawyer contended that leaflets distributed by Grudler's campaign, accusing Boucard of \\"outright electoral fraud\\" and a \\"robbery\\", were \\"defamatory and injurious\\". Boucard and Meslot seek ‚Ç¨500 in damages in the case, which was dismissed on 8 February, after the by-election. Boucard and Meslot were ordered to pay Grudler ‚Ç¨1,000 and cover legal costs associated with the case. In the first round of the by-election, Boucard secured 39.02% of the vote against 26.67% for Grudler, and was re-elected in the second round with 58.93% of the vote, and returned to the National Assembly on 5 February.

Aircraft The aircraft was a de Havilland Hercules three-engined biplane, registered in the United Kingdom as G-EBMZ and delivered new to Imperial Airways in 1927. It was named City of Jerusalem by the airline. Accident The City of Jerusalem was carrying mail from the United Kingdom to India. While attempting a night landing at Jask the pilot misjudged the aircraft's altitude and it stalled and crashed. The landing gear was destroyed and the port wings were badly damaged. Flares were fitted to the wingtips and had been ignited to provide illumination for the night landing. The port wing had been forced backwards in the crash until it lay alongside the fuselage; the burning flare set fire to fuel spilled from the damaged fuel tanks. The pilot, a mechanic and a passenger were killed, the chief mechanic and wireless operator were seriously injured. Investigation The investigation was carried out by the Government of India and the British Air Ministry; the conclusion was that additional precautions were to be adopted, but noted that wing-mounted flares were still regarded as a satisfactory form of emergency landing aid.

It is a regenerative amplifier adjusted to provide positive feedback within the receiver. This has the effect of narrowing the receiver's bandwidth, as if the Q factor of its tuned circuits had been increased. The Q multiplier was a common accessory in shortwave receivers of the vacuum tube era as either a factory installation or an add-on device. In use, the Q multiplier had to be adjusted to a point just short of oscillation to provide maximum sensitivity and rejection of interfering signals. Joseph Carr, Antenna Toolkit Elsevier, 2001 , page 193 A Q multiplier could also be adjusted to act as a notch filter, useful for reducing the interfering effect of signals on frequencies near to the desired signal. In some receiver designs, the Q multiplier was made to also serve as a beat frequency oscillator by adjusting it to oscillate. This could be used for reception of single sideband or Morse radiotelegraphy, but in that case the circuit no longer provided improved selectivity. Tony Dorbuck (ed.), The Radio Amateur's Handbook, Fifty Fifth Edition, American Radio Relay League, 1977 no ISBN, p. 259 The principle of regeneration applied to radio receivers was developed by Edwin Armstrong, who patented a regenerative receiver in 1914. At least one console-model broadcast superheterodyne receiver used positive feedback to improve selectivity in a 1926 design. http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/Museum/Engineering/Electronics/AJSSymphony/Symphony.htm The A.J.S. Symphony Seven Receiver - Inside Out, retrieved January 31, 2018 Q-multipliers were common on shortwave general-coverage and communications receivers of the 1950s.

Crusoe (at that time their respective affiliations were: Galaxy, Arvados, Seven Bridges, and Michigan State University) at the Open Bioinformatics Foundation BOSC 2014 codefest. CWL is supported by multiple analysis runners and platforms such as Apache Airflow (via CWL-Airflow ), Arvados, Rabix, Cromwell workflow engine, Toil, REANA - Reusable Analyses and CWLEXEC for IBM Spectrum LSF, and was identified in 2017 as one of the future trends for bioinformatics pipeline development. Several additional analysis environments are currently implementing support for CWL including Apache Taverna and Galaxy.  Availability  CWL is developed by an informal, multi-vendor working group consisting of both organizations and individuals and is freely available via its GitHub repository under a permissive Apache License 2.0.

They were often built by the governments as the counterpart of civil temples (wenmiao) or Temple of Confucius. Temples that worshiped both civil and military gods are called Wenwu temple (wenwumiao). Martial temples originated from China in 731 AD, initially for worshiping 11 strategists, among whom Jiang Ziya was the dominant figure. The rest of the 10 strategists with comparatively inferior status were called Shizhe (ÂçÅÂì≤), which means \\"Ten Wise Men\\", among whom Zhang Liang had the highest status, only below Jiang Ziya. It was supposed to be worshipped in spring and autumn, and the formality would be similar to the worshiping of the Temple of Confucius. The people being worshipped in the temple however changed in subsequent periods of history. In the Qing dynasty, Guan Yu (as Guandi or Wudi, the God of War) became the major god in the martial temples. Offerings may be made to Guandi on the 15th day or the second month and the 13th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. After the Republic of China established in 1912, the government promoted the joint worshiping of Guan Yu and Yue Fei, the latter was considered a national hero in defending Southern Song dynasty from the invasion of Jurchen Jin. 24 other strategists in history were also worshiped alongside Guan Yu and Yue Fei, but with lower status. After the People's Republic of China established in 1949, the government no longer officially promoted martial temples.

Due to the size of 52 m (171 ft) (previously 60 m) and the projected costs of ‚Ç¨ 1.5m, the sculpture was highly controversial. Munich mayor Christian Ude was the most prominent critic, comparing the sculpture to an egg cup.

Retrieved 27 January 2018. After completing her doctorate, Gavron took up a lectureship at Hornsey School of Art. On 14 December 1965, she locked herself in her neighbour's kitchen, switched on its gas oven and committed suicide. The year after her death, Gavron's thesis was published as The Captive Wife, which is cited as an early example of the emergent British feminist literature and a noted early sociological study on women and work. It was a qualitative sociological analysis of narrative accounts of working- and middle-class married women's lives, and has been called one of the \\"classic examples of feminist interpretation of housework\\". She argued that women tended to leave paid work after childbirth and that motherhood stripped women of independence, bringing their values and aspirations as 'New' women into conflict with the traditional role they were having to play as mothers.Mary Eagleton and Emma Parker, The History of British Women's Writing, 1970‚Äìpresent, vol. 10 (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), p. 115. In the view of Helen McCarthy, this study meant that Fyvel was one of a number of researchers in the 1950s and early 1960s (such as Nancy Seear, Viola Klein, Ferdynand Zweig, Judith Hubback and Pearl Jephcott) who \\"helped to entrench new understandings of married women's employment as a fundamental feature of advanced industrial societies, and one that solved the dilemmas of 'modern' woman across social classes.\\"Helen McCarthy, \\"Social Science and Married Women‚Äôs Employment in Post-War Britain\\", Past and Present, vol. 233, no. 1 (2016), p. 270.

Gerold von Gleich was born on 17 March 1869 in Ludwigsburg, in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, in the German Empire. His father, Alarich von Gleich, was an army officer, who later attained the rank of Generalleutnant. He attended the Gymnasium in Ulm (1876-83). Military career Gleich began his military career in 1886 in the Dragoner-Regiment K√∂nigin Olga Nr. 25 in Ludwigsburg. In 1890 he was transferred to the General Staff. In 1902-05 he served as a squadron commander in the 13. Dragoner- Regiment in Metz. Thereafter he was again seconded to the General Staff, where his exceptional linguistic abilities marked him out for overseas service. In 1912 he was assigned as German Military Attach√© to the High Command of the Greek Army, where he observed victorious Greek military operations against Ottoman forces on several fronts during the First Balkan War. In 1913, following his return to Germany, he was appointed commanding officer of the Dragoner-Regiment K√∂nigin Olga Nr. 25, and took the field with this unit as Oberstleutnant at the outbreak of World War I. In 1915 he was promoted to Oberst.J. Wodetzky, Obituary: ‚ÄúGerold von Gleich‚Äù, Astronomische Nachrichten 266 (1938), pp. 63-4 In February 1916 he was selected for secondment to the now allied Ottoman Army and assigned to Baghdad, as chief of staff to Feldmarschall von der Goltz. There he became chief of staff of the Ottoman Sixth Army, with the Ottoman rank of Mirliva and the accompanying title of Pasha. He participated in the successful siege of Kut-al-Mara and subsequent events in Mesopotamia up to late summer 1916. Infected by unclean drinking water, he suffered severe illness and was transported to Aleppo to recuperate. Gleich subsequently wrote a detailed memoir of his military experiences during 1912-16, which was published in 1921 as Vom Balkan nach Bagdad: milit√§risch- politische Erinnerungen an dem Orient (From the Balkans to Baghdad: military- political recollections of the East).Vom Balkan nach Bagdad: milit√§risch- politische Erinnerungen an dem Orient (Scherl Verlag: Berlin 1921) In January 1917 he commanded the Infanterie-Regiment Kaiser Wilhelm Nr. 120 on the Western Front, fighting on the Somme. As commander of Infanterie-Brigade Nr. 18, he played a part in the fighting at Arras and Cambrai, and during the Spring Offensive. In 1918 he was promoted to Generalmajor and, on his request, retired from active duty in 1919. Contributions to science After the war, Gleich pursued a second career as a gifted and multitalented scientist. From an early age, as an officer cadet, he had demonstrated interest and aptitude in mathematical and astronomical studies. In the post-war era he wrote around 40 scientific papers on physics and astronomy, contributing significantly to debates on relativity.J.

Fujita Museum of Art, Osak. Shigajiku (, \\"poem-and-painting scrolls\\"), are a form of Japanese ink wash painting. These hanging scrolls depict poetic inscriptions at the top of the scroll and a painted image, usually a landscape scene, below. Buddhist monks of the gozan ‰∫îÂ±± or Five Mountain monasteries of the early Muromachi Period (1336-1573) first introduced the poem-and-painting scrolls. Shigajiku is a modern category given to the visual and literary culture of the Muromachi Period rooted in the Zen tradition. The most common visual aesthetic for shigajiku is a monochrome water and ink style of painting, suibokuga Ê∞¥Â¢®Áîª, with only occasional traces of color throughout the scroll. History The first poem-and-painting scrolls came to Japan with the return of the first Zen monks who had been studying in China. The most important cultural precedent to shigajiku was the Chinese version of the poem/scroll, the shijiku Ë©©Ëª∏. This continental version served as a model for the future poem-and-painting scrolls produced by the Japanese Five Mountains monks. Yet, shigajiku are distinct from their Chinese predecessors because of the distinctive hanging scroll format and the number of inscriptions on the scrolls themselves. The creation of shigajiku is closely tied to the secular and religious lives of the Five Mountains monks. The formation of tatuch≈´, or subtemples, provides the basis for the social relationships through which the shigajiku would be created and circulated. The tatuch≈´ created a new social unit among Japanese Zen monks and gave rise to the shikai or poetry meetings. These communities and meetings provide an important social base for the monks of the Five Mountain monasteries. Clerics intermingled with each other and exchanged scrolls with other monks during such gatherings. These monks would then compose and write poems on each other's scroll, thus accounting for some scrolls having between four and thirty inscriptions. The first surviving shigajiku, Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate, was produced in the Five Mountains Zen monasteries during 1400. Of the eighteen inscriptions, six are connected to Nanzen-ji, the temple and literary epicenter for Zen monks during the early 15th century. This connection highlights the importance of the social relationships of the clerics and the spiritual value of the painting. Genre Categories of Shigajiku The subjects of poem-and-painting scrolls vary to include subject such as: portrait scrolls, chins≈ç; scrolls on Daoist and Buddhist subjects, d≈çshaku senki; and landscape scrolls, sansui. Most shigajiku are the last category landscape of which there are many different representations. The different themes of the landscape genre will be focused on here as they appear most frequently in shigajiku. =Themes within the landscape genre= * Zen k≈çan ‚Äì riddles posed by a Zen master designed to teach/enlighten pupils * S≈çbetsuzu ‚Äì farewell pictures * Kaiy≈´zu ‚Äì commemorative paintings * Shiizu ‚Äì painting themes taken from poetry (usually Chinese poetry) * Shosaizu ‚Äì a scholar's study in mountain setting The most common theme of landscape is the image of a secluded scholar's study in a mountain setting or shosaizu. Monks of the tatuch≈´ communities popularized the idea of creating idealizing, memorializing, and pining images of the scholar's study to escape the confines of a private subtemple. These poem-and painting scrolls depict idealized retreats into nature with open skies, vast waters, and hazy mountain views ‚Äì a perfect setting for the intellectual pleasures of retired monks living out their secluded lives. These scholar's studies were seen as blissful escapes from busy city life where peace was difficult to find. Key features include rocks, cliffs, flowing water, a bridge, a mountain path, an elderly scholar climbing, vast expanses of water and sky with mountains soaring in the distance. To say these scholar's study poem-and-painting scrolls were only escapist would be incorrect. A scholar's study shigajiku aids in evoking an idealized landscape to help the monk bring about a sense of peaceful serenity through which they would write, meditate, reflect, etc. Painters manipulated their surroundings and were forced to use their imagination or memory to create these landscapes that were so far removed from their own setting of a bustling Japanese city. Often looking to the deep mountains valleys one would find in China ‚Äì these tiny idealists landscapes became a monks‚Äô flight from reality via Chinese inspiration. For these Japanese monks, ‚Äúincorporating Chinese poetic themes with idealized visions of Chinese landscapes expressed faithful spirituality in a way that simply painting a realistic landscape from their own mundane life could never have done‚Ä¶ painted poetry became the image of utopia in the minds of Japanese and Korean elites, whether or not those images looked like the ‚Äòreal‚Äô China.‚Äù Characteristics of Landscape Shigajiku Poem and Painting Scrolls=Paintings= Reading in a Bamboo Grove. Attributed to Sh≈´bun. Tokyo National Museum. An untitled album leaf by Xia Gui, from the collection of Tokyo National Museum. The painting of landscape shigajiku encompasses different themes, but almost always includes an idealized landscape representing some imaginary corner of nature. This affords a perfect setting for the intellectual pleasures of the monks‚Äô retired and secluded lives. Ancient crooked pine trees clinging tenaciously to a sheer cliff, hills in the distance, vast expanse of water and sky, this secluded corner of nature would have been beloved by Zen monks and their followers and are some of the most common tropes of shigajiku. Historically there were two ways to create the painting of the shigajiku: the ‚Äúold style‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew style.‚Äù The ‚Äúold style‚Äù is believed to have derived from the painting traditions of the Northern Sung painters, specifically Guo Xi (1020-1090), where the aesthetic concentrated around balanced and centered compositions. The ‚Äúnew style‚Äù is believed to be largely derived from the Southern Sung, specifically Xia Gui (1195‚Äì1224), with the central focus of the composition moved into a corner of the scroll to create a dynamic and asymmetrical image. It is important to note that both of these painting styles originated in China and became the way in which Japanese Zen monks desired to paint their shigajiku. Reading in a Bamboo Grove encompasses the most common tropes of the shigajiku, the imposing mountains, with sheer cliffs, trees precariously perched near edges, and hints of a vast open horizon. This scholar's study shigajiku is done in the ‚Äúnew style,‚Äù and when compared with a composition by Xia Gui, the characteristics of the ‚Äúnew style‚Äù become clearer. The positioning of the mountain scene in the corner and the poetic inscriptions above and opposite the image dramatically accentuates the asymmetrical nature of the scroll. =Inscriptions= Sh≈´toku, Early Spring Landscape. Before 1533. Inscribed by Y≈çkoku Kent≈ç and Teih≈ç Sh≈çch≈´. Minneapolis Institute of Art. Five Mountains monks used the shikai or poetry gatherings to discuss, create, and inscribe their poetry onto the scrolls of their fellow monks. The poetic inscription extends no further than 2/3 of the scroll leaving the bottom 1/3 for the painted image. This structuring has led some scholars to argue that the poetry is valued more than painting. The Zen priests inscribing shigajiku were not as concerned with who painted the picture as they were with how successful the painting was in transporting the viewer into an idealistic natural setting. The poetic inscriptions vary in subject matter, referring to the natural poetry of the early century, celebrated works of Chinese poetry, or messages to other monks of greeting, farewell, congratulation, etc. The number of inscriptions varies, but the order in which they were inscribed denotes the prestige of a monk. Active in 16th century, Sh≈´toku created a shigajiku entitled Early Spring Landscape. The format of a tall and narrow poem filling one corner and the ‚Äúnew‚Äù style of paining filling the opposite corner creates an asymmetry that is characteristic of shigajiku. The asymmetry of the composition and the poetic inscription at the top recalls Sh≈´bun, and the painting also reflects the influence of Sessh≈´. The text on the lower right of Early Spring Landscape, authored by Y≈çkoku Kent≈ç (d. 1533), translates to: > Though the west lake swells with water as spring arrives, / the emerald > bamboo outdoors blocks the sight of boats. / Had the east wind facilitated > his quest, / he would have returned by boat in moonlight to the frosted land > of Wu faraway. The text on the upper left, authored by Teih≈ç Sh≈çch≈´ (fl. ca. 1538), translates to: > Floating in a boathouse on the brimming spring river, / what could one > desire in a sound sleep after mooring? / In nothing but insouciant boating > would I spend the rest of my life, / with mountains along the white gull- > dotted stream as my beauties. The poetry of these two different monks, both evoke ideas reflected in the painting below it. The natural images of flowing water, trees, and wind are incredibly calming. The musings of sleep and dreams demonstrates the monks longing to be in such a serene place. The solitude yet tranquil atmosphere of the landscape provides the perfect escape for the monks who were writing and discussing the poems in busy city of Koyto. The shigajiku medium enables the mind to reach that level of contemplation where the world disappears and all one hears is nature ‚Äì a state greatly desired by these city dwelling monks. One Composition Interpretation Towering Above Wilderness Hall. Cleveland Museum of Art. Poem-and-painting scrolls must be understood as a whole piece of art ‚Äì the meaning of the image is informed by the inscription and vice versa. The unity of the shigajiku scroll is ‚Äúpainting of a poetic idea.‚Äù Understanding the two part of the shigajiku together is vital. Scholar Shimao Arata articulates that together, the painting and inscriptions of shigajiku, form the ‚Äúfour perfections‚Äù ‚Äì poetry, painting, calligraphy, and prose. These ‚Äúfour perfections‚Äù express ‚Äúthe mind‚Äôs level of spiritual accomplishment, and this spiritual link between the four perfections is itself the subject of the earliest known poem-and-painting scrolls.‚Äù Sesshu, Toyo, Splashed Ink Landscape. 1495. Tokyo National Museum. Hue of Water, Light on the Peaks. Attributed to Sh≈´bun. Nara National Museum. While the idea of poetry and painting influencing and changing the overall meaning of a composition preexisted the creation of shigajiku ‚Äì it has become a concept fundamental to ascertain the meaning of a shigajiku. The first shigajiku, Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate, follows ‚Äúthe classic formulation of the relation between poetry and painting developed by Su Shih and his circle, which we have seen also was a crucial factor in the rise of the earliest Japanese poem-and- painting scrolls around.‚Äù Poem-and-painting scrolls were intended, from the beginning of their production, to be understood as a whole piece of art with different mediums (‚Äúfour perfections‚Äù) used to convey a single artwork.

In 1939 she took painting lessons from Laura Knight and in 1940 she enrolled at the Farnham School of Art where she studied sculpture and pottery making under Charles Vyse. In 1941, Ascherson won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art but deferred her entrance to enlist in the Women's Royal Naval Service. She served in the WRNS from 1943 to 1945. She is listed on the Bletchley Park Roll of Honour as having been a bombe operator at an out-station in Stanmore. Ascherson eventually entered the Royal College of Art in 1945 and studied there for two years. By that time she had already had paintings accepted for display by the Royal Academy during the war and the Contemporary Art Society had acquired a terracotta work by her. In 1947 she married and moved to Provence in France and in 1948, as Pamela Rachet, wrote and illustrated a book, C'etait Heir - St Remy du Provence, on the region. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Berkeley Gallery in 1953. A series of paintings on racing cars made by Ascherson in the 1960s were acquired by the Donington Park Racing Museum.

It is likely part of the tripartite DENN domain family of proteins that often function as Rab-GEFs to regulate vesicular trafficking. Both the mRNA and protein have been shown to be upregulated following ischemic stroke, and to be produced at altered levels in patients with FTD-ALS, however the gene's contribution to these states is not well understood.  Gene  KIAA1147 is located on the 7th chromosome in humans from bases 141652381-141702188 on the negative strand. Additional names for KIAA1147 include PRO25611, AI841796 in the mouse and RGD1563986 in the rat. Only one mRNA transcript of KIAA1147 has been reported in NCBI, and is composed of 9 exons.  Protein  500x500px Protein LCHN and DENND1b, with cDENN domain highlighted to show similarity in secondary and tertiary structureHuman LCHN is a cytoplasmic protein composed of 455 amino acids predicted to be 51.4 kD before modifications with isoelectric point of 5.06. The majority of its 455 amino acids make up the tripartite DENN domains which are commonly found in proteins that act as Rab-GEFs and regulate vesicular trafficking. LCHN has several predicted phosphorylation sites and contains many motifs for kinase binding. The uDENN and cDENN domains of LCHN are predicted to be primarily coil, while the dDENN domain is predicted to be a combination of alpha helix and beta sheet. The cDENN domain is the most highly conserved domain within DENN family proteins, and is also primarily coil in protein DENND1B, which has been crystallized and confirmed to interact with the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of Rab-35. LCHN also contains a Stability of Polarity Axis (SPA) region. that may allow it to play a role in cell division.  Expression  Immunohistochemistry shows localization of LCHN to cytoplasmic face of Golgi apparatus = Tissues = The Human Protein Atlas reports high levels of KIAA1147 transcription in several brain regions including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and retina, as well as non-brain regions including spleen, thymus, stomach, prostate, lung, and ascending colon. Immunohistochemistry has shown LCHN to be localized to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus in cell culture, and the brain in mouse fetal development. In the adult mouse and human brain, LCHN is expressed relatively ubiquitously. Expression of LCHN has been shown to increase in response to chronic alcoholism, immature and mature dendritic response to hypoxia, and ischemic stroke. = Transcriptional regulation = There are binding sites for two main groups of transcription factors in the predicted promoter of KIAA1147. The first group consists of elements related to the cell cycle and neuronal development and includes AP-2, NRF1, BRAC, E2F, NEUR, and NRSF. The second consists of elements related to brain insult, including HIFF (hypoxia inducible factor), CREB (cAMP responsive factor linked to ER stress response), GREF (glucocorticoid responsible factor), HEAT (heat shock responsive factor), and HDBP (Huntington's disease regulatory binding protein). In patients with FTD-ALS, there has been reported abnormal upstream CpG methylation of KIAA1147  Interacting proteins = SETBP1 = Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown LCHN to physically interact with SETBP1, a protein that contains 3 nuclear localization signals. Despite the lack of a predicted nuclear localization signal in its own sequence, this interaction suggests that LCHN may be able to enter and have functional importance in the nucleus. = TGOLN2 = In affinity chromatography studies, LCHN has been reported to have a physical association with TGOLN2, a surface protein of the Golgi apparatus. This likely explains immunohistochemical finding of strong LCHN localization near the Golgi apparatus despite being a predicted cytoplasmic protein. = Kallikreins = Affinity chromatography studies have also reported a physical association between LCHN and kallikreins KLK5 and KLK11, serine proteases. It is possible that cleavage by these proteases may be relevant to LCHN's function. = EFNB3 = LCHN has been reported to be capable of a physical association with EFNB3, an ephrin receptor ligand with reported importance in neuronal development. This, coupled with the high expression of LCHN in the developing central nervous system, suggests that binding of LCHN to EFNB3 may modulate neuronal development.  Predicted function = Neuronal insult = LCHN is localized to the developing mouse brain LCHN expression has been reported to be unregulated following ischemic stroke, chronic alcoholism, and cell culture responses of immature and mature dendrites to prolonged hypoxia. Additionally, decreased expression as a result of CpG methylation has been implicated to be pathogenic in patients with FTD-ALS. Within the predicted promoter of KIAA1147, there are predicted binding sites for hypoxia response elements that would accompany ischemic stroke, heat shock proteins, factors related to the glucocorticoid mediated stress response, and cAMP responsive factors related to the ER stress response. Due to the reported evidence of LCHN upregulation following ischemic stroke, which often results in neuronal damage or death, as well presence of several binding sites for factors induced by rapid trauma to the brain, it is likely that KIAA1147 plays a role in the brain‚Äôs response to sudden stress and injury. = Neuronal development = The presence of the SPA domain within LCHN suggests that it may play a role in cell division. LCHN has been shown to physically associate with EFNB3, a protein with reported importance in neuronal development. A second reported association with SETBP1 may open up the possibility for LCHN to play a role in cell cycle regulation from within the nucleus. The predicted KIAA1147 promoter contains binding sites for cell-division related factors and factors known to have specific expression during neuronal development. RNA in situ hybrdization has shown KIAA1147 to be located at high levels in the developing brain. Together, these data suggest that LCHN plays a role in regulating cellular division during development of the brain.  Clinical significance  LCHN has been shown to be upregulated following a number of insults to the brain including the response to chronic alcoholism, immature and mature dendritic response to hypoxia, and ischemic stroke. Recent studies have implicated abnormal CpG methylation of LCHN in FTD-ALS. No disease causing SNPs in LCHN have been reported with high frequency.  Homology  Animalian LCHN Orthologs Non-Animalian LCHN Orthologs There are no reported paralogs of LCHN in humans. LCHN homologs exist in animals dating back to the earliest sponges, with a notable lack of reported expression in Drosophila and C. elegans. There are also a number of LCHN homologs in protists including choanoflagellates, amoeba, and algae, as well as other unicellular eukaryotes including fungi.

History In 1884, two buildings were used by the district for schools: the Old Fireman Hall and the Negro Odd Fellows Hall. Beginning in 1898 a superintendent was hired, new school buildings were constructed and funds were budgeted for their maintenance. Beaumont High School graduated a class of three on June 1, 1900, in a ceremony at the Kyle Opera House. Ida Lillian Pittman was valedictorian; Ludlow Calhoun, class salutatorian; and Harry Potter Jirou, class essayist. The title of Miss Pittman's valedictory address was \\"Some Women of History.\\" The cornerstone for the first building used primarily for high school students was laid on January 11, 1904 at College and Neches streets. During its first year of use, the building housed students in grades 5-12. A lack of funds forced the third floor to be left unfinished. The location caused some concern among parents on the north side of the city, because their children had to walk through \\"one of the vilest sections of the Tenderloin district, known here as the 'Reservation.'\\" In 1925, a $40,000 gymnasium and auditorium were added to the College Street building. On April 8, 1928, voters approved a $1.5 million bond issue, including $900,000 for the construction of a new high school at the built in classic Greek style at end of Pecos Boulevard in what was then city's far-west end. In April 1930, the high school's 1,000 students moved into the new, three-story facility. It was planned by Steinman and Steinman Architects of Beaumont. One of the partners, Douglas E. Steinman, was a 1913 BHS graduate. The new building included a modern innovation for the time, a loudspeaker system that linked the principal's office to all rooms on campus. In 1975, as part of court-ordered desegregation of the district, Beaumont High School was merged with the formerly all-black Charlton-Pollard High School to form Beaumont Charlton- Pollard High School. This school was later merged with French High School and renamed Beaumont Central. The Beaumont Independent School District voted in January 2018 to close the 1930 building, which was then housing Central High School, after it was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in September 2017.

Early life and career Richards was born in Swansea on 17 November 1821, the son of Richard and Catherine Richards (formerly Thomas). On 11 July 1844 he was married in Birmingham to Maria Sloane, a native of Northamptonshire. They had six sons and one daughter between 1845 and 1862. The eldest children were born in Birmingham but during the 1850s the family returned to Swansea. Political career=1868 election= Richards was elected to represent Cardiganshire at the 1868 general election, a contest noted for allegations of landlord coercion. His success in defeating John Vaughan, the Conservative candidate was alluded to the influence of the Pryse family of Gogerddan, leading landowners in the county. He also distanced himself from the Liberation Society which had sponsored the candidacy of Henry Richard in 1865. =The 1874 general election= When a general election was called at short notice in early 1874, Richards initially expected an unopposed return, but Thomas Edward Lloyd of Coedmore emerged at the last moment as a Conservative candidate, Lloyd was not a prominent landowner and his estate only comprised 450 acres. However, his father, Thomas Lloyd, a previous high sheriff of the county, was regarded as a Liberal rather than a Conservative. Also, Lloyd had also not been involved in conflict with his tenantry, and his candidacy would not, therefore, attract the same degree of opposition as would face one of the more prominent landowners. Lloyd's candidacy was kept a closely guarded secret until nomination day, although his leaflets and campaign literature had been printed. The Liberal leaders in the county were unaware that they would be opposed until Lloyd's address, in which he described himself as a Liberal- Conservative, was published the morning of the nomination day. In later years, there were allegations of irregularities, and that a ballot box had been tampered with when kept overnight at Aberaeron. Richards was defeated by 245 votes. The result was greeted with consternation and surprise in the Liberal ranks.

Her hymn, \\"Pass away, earthly joy!\\", first appeared in 1843 in Songs for the Wilderness. Two years after, it reappeared in The Bible Hymn Book, compiled by her husband, Horatius Bonar, and was reprinted in the United States with other names appended. Personal life Jane Catharine (or Catherine) Lundie was born at Kelso, 1 December 1821, in the old manse by the River Tweed, located by the Abbey. She was a daughter of Robert Lundie, minister of Kelso, who had attained literary accomplishments, and, besides being acquainted with Sir Walter Scott and other literary celebrities, was an early contributor to the Quarterly Review. Her mother, Mary Grey, was a native of Northumberland. She was a daughter of George Grey and Mary Gray. Mrs. Gray, the sister of John Grey and aunt of Josephine Butler, was an intellectual who, besides being the author of several volumes, assisted her husband in matters pertaining to his parishioners. She compiled the memoirs of Matthias Bruen who lived with the Lundie family for some time. Bonar's paternal grandfather, Cornelius Lundie, had also been minister of Kelso, and had preached in Kelso Abbey before its ruined condition required the erection of a new building which was occupied by her father. In April, 1832, Bonar's father died, and in the autumn, with her widowed mother, her elder sister, Mary Lundie Duncan, and brother, she removed to Edinburgh. In 1835, she was sent to a school in London, and developed a friendship in Mrs. Evans, the friend of her sister Mary. She also spent time with her sister at the manse in Cleish, until 1840, when Mary, a poet and memoirist, died. An elder brother, George Archibald Lundie, went with a missionary band to Samoa, hoping that the climate might restore his failing health, but died in less than three years. There were two other brothers, Cornelius, engineer and railway manager of a branch in South Wales, and Robert, minister of the Presbyterian Church, Fairfield, Liverpool. Career In 1843, she married Rev. Horatius Bonar, becoming the first Free Church minister's wife. After marriage, she became the mistress of the manse of Kelso. Intervening years were spent partly in Edinburgh and partly in Ruthwell, her mother having married Rev. Henry Duncan of that parish. These were years of varied fortune. She removed to Edinburgh with her husband and family in 1867. Of their nine children, five died young. Bonar's poetry possessed a deep spirituality of tone and a submissive glint of piety. Her hymns appeared in Dr. Bonar's Songs for the Wilderness, 1843‚Äì4, and his Bible Hymn Book, 1845. She was chiefly known through her hymn, \\"Pass away, earthly joy, Jesus, all in all\\", which appeared in the Songs for the Wilderness, 2nd Series, 1844, and again in the Bible Hymn Book 1845, No. 108, in 4 st. of 8 1., including the refrain, ‚ÄúJesus is mine!‚Äù The original text was given in Dr. Edwin Francis Hatfield's Church Hymn Book, 1872, No. 661. Sometimes, this was altered to ‚ÄúFade, fade, each earthly joy,‚Äù as in the American Songs for the Sanctuary, 1865, No. 774, and others. The last stanza of this hymn was also stanza iv. of the cento, ‚ÄúNow I have found a friend,‚Äù and others. With health never very strong, Bonar often wore herself out for others. She died at Edinburgh on 3 December 1884. ‚ÄúHe giveth me Salvation,‚Äù were among her last words.

The Serpent River flows entirely in forest area, west of the Gouin Reservoir. Forestry is the main economic activity of this hydrographic slope; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the river is usually frozen from mid-December to mid- April. The south side of the Snake River Head Zone is served by the Canadian National Railway and a forest road from the west along the North Railway and then along the shore. South of the upper part of the Serpent River.  Geography  The Serpent River originates at the mouth of the body of water (total navigable length: ; maximum width: ; altitude: ) with two parts: the southern part (Serpent Lake) has a length of and the northern part (Mitikoganik Lakes), . The two parts are contiguous. The Mitikoganik lakes feed mainly on surrounding streams: Lake B√©dard discharge (from the West), discharge (from the West) of a set of lakes in swampy area, discharge of a set of lakes (coming from Northeast) in mountain areas. The Serpent Lake feeds on the Strait connecting it to Mitikoganik Lakes and the southwest (Longpr√© and Racine Lakes) outlet. Around this body of water, the highest mountain peak reaches west of Mitikoganik lakes and in the east. This body of water takes the shape of a snorkel whose blower looks to the east. Along the length, Mitikoganik lakes have many islands and peninsulas in its southern part. This head of water is located at: * Northwesterly of the watershed with the hydrographic subsurface of the headwaters of the Tr√©vet River flowing northeasterly to discharge on the west bank of the Kekek River flowing north to the M√©giscane River; * East of the watershed with the hydrographic subsurface of the Attic head zone, which generally flows southwestward to spill onto the eastern shore of the M√©giscane River. The mouth of the Serpent Lake is located on the boundary of Valmy and Tr√©vet Townships, which is north of the Canadian National Railway (or from Gagnon-Siding Railway Station), at east of downtown Senneterre, at west of the village center of Parent and north-east of the confluence of the Serpent River with the M√©giscane River. The main hydrographic slopes near the Serpent River are: *North side: M√©giscane Lake, Canusio Lake, M√©giscane River; *East side: M√©giscane River, Kekek River; *South side: Tr√©vet River, Kekek River; *West side: Attic River, Berthelot River, Whitegoose River, M√©giscane River. From the mouth of Snake Lake, the Serpent River flows on according to the following segments: * north- east, crossing Raven Lake (length: ; altitude: ) and continuing to discharge (from the north) of a set of lakes; * (or in a direct line) north-east winding, to the discharge (coming from the north-east) of a set of lakes; * to the north, snaking greatly in the marsh zone, up to a bend in the river; * northwesterly, then making a southwestward hook to the confluence of the river.River segments measured from the Atlas from Canada (published on the Internet) from the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The Serpent River discharges on the southeastern shore of the Noisy Bay of Canusio Lake, which is crossed to the west by the M√©giscane River, which flows generally towards the west forming large zigzags, until the east shore of Parent Lake (Abitibi). This last lake is crossed to the north by the Louvicourt River, whose current will flow on the south shore of Tiblemont Lake. This confluence of the Serpent River with the M√©giscane River is located at north-east of the confluence of the M√©giscane River at north of the confluence of the Kekek River, northeast of downtown Senneterre and north of the former Roll-Siding Railway Station of the Canadian National Railway. Toponymy The term \\"Serpent\\" refers to the narrowness of the lake, especially the northern part. The toponym \\"Serpent River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, e.g. at its creation.Commission de toponymie du Quebec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \\"Serpent River\\"  See also  References  External links  Jam√©sie La Vall√©e-de-l‚ÄôOr Rivers of Abitibi-T√©miscamingue Nottaway River drainage basin ","title":"Serpent River"},{"id":"56425336","text":"Filospermoidea is an order within the phylum Gnathostomulida.

Recruitment Alfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army. On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular Army, and on 11 August the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: \\"Your King and Country Need You\\", urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or \\"K1\\".Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2, 8, 24, Appendix I.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, pp. 1-4.Jackson, p. 13. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised, many of its constituent units were being organised as \\"Pals battalions\\" under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, pp. 37‚Äì42.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 26‚Äì40.Jackson, pp. 14‚Äì7.Middlebrook, pp. 9‚Äì11. The initiative for the \\"Pals battalions\\" came from the Director of Recruiting at the War Office (WO), General Sir Henry Rawlinson, who suggested that many man working in finance in the City of London \\"would be willing to enlist if they were assured that they would serve with their friends\\". The 10th \\"Stockbrokers\\" Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers was raised in less than a week in August. Impressed by the success, the Earl of Derby coined the phrase \\"a battalion of pals\\", and began recruiting in Liverpool. Soon they were springing up all over the country.O‚ÄôNeill, pp. 9‚Äì10.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 26. On 29 August 1914, Charles Wilson, 2nd Baron Nunburnholme had a meeting with Kitchener. Nunburnholme, head of a family of shipowners in Kingston upon Hull, was a former Major in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, and held a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) from service with the City Imperial Volunteers during the Second Boer War. In 1914 he was Lord-Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire and President of the East Riding Territorial Association (ERTA). At this meeting, Kitchener authorised Nunburnholme and the ERTA to raise a battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment.Army List.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 27.Burke's, 'Nunburnholme'.Drake, pp. 44‚Äì7.Who was Who. This was unusual because most of the county Territorial Associations were fully engaged with recruiting and equipping their existing Territorial Force (TF) units and had no time for the New Army units. In contrast, by the end of 1915 Lord Nunburnholme and the ERTA had not only raised 2nd and 3rd Line TF units for the East Riding Regiment, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and Royal Engineers but a full infantry brigade of 'Hull Pals' with a depot battalion, three RGA heavy batteries (the 11th (1st Hull), 124th (2nd Hull) and 146th (3rd Hull)) and the 31st (Hull) Divisional Ammunition Column, RFA.Becke, Pt 3a, p. 21.War Office Instructions: July 1915, Appendix VI; September 1915, No 183 and Appendices VII and IX. Lord Nunburnholme asked Major W.H. Carver, a retired Militia officer (3rd Battalion, (King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry), to command the new unit while it was being recruited.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 28‚Äì35.Bilton, Hull Pals, Appendix 17. The Hull Daily Mail of 31 August 1914 carried Lord Nunburnholme's proposal to raise a \\"Commercial Battalion\\" from men working in business offices in Hull who would serve alongside their friends. Recruitment opened the following day at Wenlock Barracks on Anlaby Road, loaned by the ERTA, and 200 men were attested on the first day. Some came en masse, such as groups from Reckitt and Sons' chemical works and the North Eastern Railway Dock Superintendents' office. The battalion reached its full establishment (just over 1000 men) on 5 September, and recruiting immediately began for a 2nd Hull Battalion.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, p. 38.Horsfall & Cave, p. 55.Middlebrook, p. 10. Hull City Hall. Wenlock Barracks and the peacetime Army Recruiting Office at Pryme Street were inadequate for the surge of volunteers from all over the East Riding, so Lord Nunburnholme borrowed Hull City Hall and opened it on 6 September as the Central Hull Recruiting Office for all the units being raised. Douglas Boyd, a Hull Corporation employee, was commissioned as Lieutenant and appointed recruiting officer.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 35. The 'Commercials' took over the fair ground at Walton Street as a drill field. The 2nd Hull Battalion was the \\"Tradesmen\\", which was recruited to full strength in three days. Lieutenant-Colonel J.L. Stanley, formerly of the 5th (Cyclist) Bn East Riding Regiment (TF), was placed in temporary command and set up battalion headquarters (HQ) in the cricket pavilion on Anlaby Road.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, p. 40. The 3rd Hull Battalion was the \\"Sportsmen\\". The Hon Stanley Jackson, the former England cricket captain, was the chief speaker at a public meeting held at the Park Street Artillery Barracks on 12 September to raise recruits for this battalion, which reached full strength in October. A number of the recruits were drawn from Hull Docks, including members of the violent \\"Silver Hatchet Gang\\". The battalion drilled in Pearson Park.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 37‚Äì9, 42. Lord Nunburnholme organised a second recruiting campaign in Hull in November, which raised a further 894 men for the 4th Hull Battalion which took any able-bodied recruits, regardless of background, and for want of a better name was known in the Yorkshire vernacular as \\"T'others\\". It drilled in the Market Place.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, pp. 51‚Äì2.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 39‚Äì40. Major Carver stood down from the \\"Commercials\\" on 12 September, and was succeeded in command by Lt-Col A.J. Richardson, a retired Regular Army officer who had commanded 1st Bn East Riding Regiment before the war. Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley was replaced at the head of the \\"Tradesmen\\" by Lt-Col Beauchamp St Clair‚ÄìFord, another retired officer, and moved on to raise the \\"T'Others\\" until Lt-Col R.H. Dewing (retired, Indian Army) took over. The first CO of the \\"Sportsmen\\" was Lt-Col H.R. Pease, formerly of the Special Reserve. Training Until early 1915, most of the men were billeted in their own homes, attending daily training in the parks and squares around Hull, or route marches to the outlying villages. One company of the \\"Commercials\\" became known as \\"Glossop's Greyhounds\\" because of the speed of their route marching. There was a shortage of people with previous military experience who could carry out the training, and no weapons with which to train. As with many of the Kitchener and TF recruits across the country, there were no uniforms available at first, but the Hull Pals were lucky in receiving their khaki uniforms in November. Until then, they wore civilian dress with armbands in battalion colours.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 11‚Äì19.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 41‚Äì7 and Appendix 19.Drake, pp. 54‚Äì6. The ERTA appealed for winter clothing for all the recruits in the East Riding. The appeal was headed by Lady Nunburnholme, who also set up the Hull Voluntary Aid Committee, which distributed clothing to troops at the front, trained nurses, and sent parcels to prisoners of war.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, p. 48. Field Marshal Earl Roberts, VC, was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Hull Battalion on 11 November; unfortunately he died on 14 November.London Gazette, 10 November 1914.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 47. After the Army's minimum height requirement was lowered for Bantam battalions in November, a 5th Hull Battalion ‚Äì known as \\"Bobs' Battalion\\" after the diminutive hero Earl Roberts ('Bobs') ‚Äì began to be raised, but failed to reach its minimum establishment strength and was broken up to provide reserves. In mid-November the 1st Hull Bn moved to Hornsea for defence duties on a stretch of coast from Mappleton to Ulrome. The camp was unfinished, 60 men being crowded into each 30-man hut without doors or windows, and the whole camp was a sea of mud. The battalion did receive old Long Lee-Enfield rifles, but when the WO asked for a report on their efficiency Lt-Col Richardson reported that \\"rifles will certainly go off, doubtful which end.\\"Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 47‚Äì52. On 10 December the formation of the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised: the four Hull battalions were to form 113th Brigade of 38th Division. The other brigades of the division were composed of Pals battalions from Northern England ‚Äì Accrington Pals, Barnsley Pals (two battalions), Bradford Pals (two battalions), Durham Pals, Leeds Pals and the Sheffield City Battalion. Similarly, all the field artillery came from Yorkshire, including the Divisional Ammunition Column from HullBecke, Pt 3b, Appendix 1b.Middlebrook, Appendix I.31 Division at Long, Long Trail. The four battalions of Hull Pals also received their formal titles at this time:Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 40. * 10th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (1st Hull) * 11th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (2nd Hull) * 12th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (3rd Hull) * 13th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (4th Hull) On 13 December, each New Army battalion was authorised to increase its establishment by 250 men (to 1350), forming a fifth (depot) company to provide reinforcements. On Christmas Eve every officer and man in the Hull Pals and Heavy Artillery received a Christmas Card from Lord Nunburnholme consisting of a picture of St George slaying the dragon with the badge of the East Yorkshire Regiment and coloured bands representing the distinctive armbands worn by the different battalions and batteries. In April 1915 the WO changed its policy: the K4 battalions now became Reserve battalions with the role of training reinforcements for the K1‚ÄìK3 Service battalions going overseas. The six K4 divisions were therefore broken up and their numbers reassigned to the first six K5 divisions. Thus 113th Brigade of 38th Division was renumbered as 92nd Brigade of 31st Division.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 61. By April all four battalions were in camps in the East Riding: 10th at Hornsea, 11th at Ousethorpe Camp, 12th at South Dalton and 13th at Beverley Westwood.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 54. Local training for the Hull Pals ended in late May and early June, and the units of 31st Division began to assemble at South Camp, Ripon, where brigade training began in earnest. Musketry training was finally begun in August, and in September the division. moved to Hurdcott Camp at Fovant where the brigade received SMLE service rifles and carried out final intensive battle training on Salisbury Plain. The CO of 10th Bn, Lt-Col Richardson, was removed from command after arguments with authority, and replaced by Lt-Col Daniel Burges, a Regular officer from the Gloucestershire Regiment who had been wounded at the Second Battle of Ypres.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 61‚Äì5. In August 1915 a new 14th (Reserve) Bn was formed at Lichfield from the depot companies of the four Hull battalions and it moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire for training. (By April 1916 it was at Seaton Delaval when it split off a new 15th (Reserve) Bn; on 1 September 1916 the 14th became the 90th Training Reserve Bn in 21st Reserve Brigade while the 15th was absorbed by 15th Bn York and Lancaster Regiment as 91st Training Reserve Bn in 21st Reserve Bde.)Bilton, Hull Pals, Appendix 25. Egypt On 29 November 1915 the division received warning orders to join the British Expeditionary Force in France, and advance parties set out for the embarkation ports of Folkestone and Southampton. At the last minute, the destination was changed to Egypt, the advance parties were recalled, and on 7 December the troops embarked at Devonport.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 67‚Äì9. The division reached Port Said between 24 December and 23 January 1916 and went into the Suez Canal defences at Qantara. On 26 February orders arrived to reverse the process and on 1 March the division began re- embarking at Port Said. It unloaded at Marseille between 6 and 16 March and then concentrated in the Somme area as part of the BEF. It remained on the Western Front for the rest of the war.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 69‚Äì102. Somme The brigade was first introduced to trench warfare on 21 March by groups being attached to the 36th (Ulster) Division in the line. On 28 March the 10th and 11th Bns relieved Ulster battalions in front of Beaumont-Hamel and Y Ravine, with 12th and 13th Bns in support. Although this was a quiet sector of the line, the battalions suffered their first casualties during this short tour, mainly from German Minenwerfers (trench mortars). Shortly afterwards 31st Division formed its own light trench mortar batteries (TMBs), with the Hull Pals contributing men to 92/1 and 92/2 TMBs for 92 Bde. 10th Battalion also provided working parties to assist the 252nd Tunnelling Company, Royal Engineers, digging the Hawthorn Ridge mine that was to be exploded to launch the forthcoming Battle of the Somme. Over the next weeks the battalions took their turns in the routine of trench holding, working parties, patrolling and trench raiding, with a constant drain on manpower from shelling and snipers.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 102‚Äì29. Lewis gun section of the 10th Bn East Yorks (Hull Commercials) near Doullens, 28 June 1916. =Serre= 92 Brigade was to be in support of 31st Division's assault on the first day of the Battle (1 July). It held the front line trenches during the British bombardment in the days leading up to the battle, suffering significant casualties from the German counter-bombardment (about 100 killed and wounded for 10th Bn alone). The night before the battle, working parties of 10th Bn were out in No man's land cutting lanes through the British barbed wire for the assaulting troops to pass through. It then withdrew into the support trenches, leaving D Company to hold the front line while the assault went in. 93 and 94 Brigades went 'over the top' at 07.30 on 1 July, 10 minutes after the explosion of the nearby Hawthorn Ridge mine had alerted the enemy. Their objective was the village of Serre. The advancing lines were almost annihilated by German machine guns and shellfire, and only a few parties got into the enemy front line, where they remained pinned down all day.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 129‚Äì36.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 441‚Äì8.Horsfall & Cave, pp. 59‚Äì71.Jackson, pp. 99-114.Middlebrook, pp. 122‚Äì31, 150‚Äì1. Battalion transport of the 10th Bn East Yorks (Hull Commercials) near Doullens, 28 June 1916. 31st Division found it impossible to get any support across the fire-swept No man's land for the rest of the day. 92 Brigade was ordered to renew the attack with two battalions during the night. Luckily, this order was cancelled: even if the brigade could have been brought up through the shattered communication and jumping-off trenches, which were full of dead and wounded, there were no British troops left in the German positions. D Company of 10th Bn had held the British trenches all day and were exhausted, but continued to hold them overnight, stationed in the reserve trench with an outpost in the front line. The brigade had been lucky, and only suffered a handful of casualties during the day.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 137.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 448‚Äì9.Horsfall & Cave, p. 71.Middlebrook, pp. 195‚Äì7, 216‚Äì20, 236‚Äì41. On 2 July the shattered division was pulled out of the line and sent north to a quiet sector for rest and refit, though there was the usual trickle of casualties associated with trench holding and raiding. Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 139‚Äì45. =Ancre= Pte John Cunningham, VC. The Somme Offensive was still going on at the end of October when 31st Division returned to the sector for the Battle of the Ancre, which was to be the last big operation of the year. Serre had still not been taken, and 92 Bde was assigned to the attack alongside 3rd Division (the rest of 31st Division was still too shattered to take part). A 48-hour preliminary bombardment began on 11 November, and the brigade moved into the trenches on the night of 12/13, along communication trenches clogged with mud. Zero hour was 05.30 on 13 November, and 12th and 13th East Yorks led the way up the slope towards Serre, with 11th Bn in close support and 10th providing flank guards and carrying parties. Fog, light rain and a smokescreen reduced visibility to a few yards, and initially the two battalions had little difficulty, 12th Bn achieving their objectives within 20 minutes. The first wave of 13th Bn took the German front trench, and the following waves reached the second trench, but the battalion of 3rd Division to their right was in difficulties and could not get across No man's land. The third wave of 13th Bn took the German third trench, but were counter-attacked from their right and cut off, about 50 men being taken prisoner. 12th and 13th Bns held on in the captured trenches, but 3rd Division made no progress. Small-scale fighting went on all day, and Private John Cunningham of 12th Bn won a Victoria Cross (VC) for fighting on alone when all the rest of his team of bombers became casualties. A Lewis gun team from 10th Bn stopped an attack on the left flank of 12th Bn. By the end of the day both battalions had been driven back to their starting positions. Only two of the 16 officers of 12th Bn who had gone into the attack remained unwounded. The brigade suffered over 800 casualties, mostly in the two attacking battalions.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 146‚Äì66.Horsfall & Cave, pp. 77‚Äì88. The Hull Pals remained on the Ancre through the winter of 1916-17, progressively diluted as reinforcements came in from other battalions of the East Yorks, or from other regiments (including a draft from the Royal Norfolk Regiment). On 24 February information arrived that the Germans had evacuated Serre, and fighting patrols went out the following day; some met considerable opposition but 11th Bn pushed through to the German fourth line. The Germans now began bombarding their own trenches to cover their withdrawal, which was the start of their retirement to the Hindenburg Line. The battalions suffered a number of casualties in attacks following up the retirement.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 166‚Äì78. Arras=Oppy Wood= John Nash On 8 April 1917, 92 Bde left the Ancre and moved to the Arras sector where the Battle of Arras began the next day. After a period of training and trench-holding, the brigade moved into assembly trenches opposite Oppy during the night of 2/3 May, under shellfire. The British creeping barrage started at 03.45 and the brigade set off in four waves, in the dark and mist, into severe machine gun fire. 10th Battalion found that in many places the wire had not been cut and had to funnel through the few gaps. This slowed the attack, which fell behind the barrage. All four company commanders were wounded, and the attack became disorganised. It was later discovered that a number of 10th Bn's men were captured having got through the German trenches into Oppy village. The rest of the battalion remained pinned down in No man's land all day, having lost over 100 men. Similarly, 11th Bn was hit by machine guns firing from Oppy Wood and pinned down. The officers, including 2nd Lieutenant Jack Harrison, reorganised their men for a second attempt. This too failed, but Harrison dashed on alone to try to silence the machine gun that was holding up his men. He was killed and later awarded a posthumous VC. 11th Battalion lost 63 men killed. 12th Battalion's attack also failed, suffering 83 killed. The three attacking battalions withdrew from No man's land to their own trenches after dark, where they were relieved by the Accrington Pals while 13th East Yorks brought in the dead and wounded from the battlefield.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 178‚Äì91.Oppy Wood at Humber Museums WWI Timeline.Jackson, pp. 146‚Äì7. 92 Bde's attack at Oppy Wood 3‚Äì4 May 1917. Lt Jack Harrison, 11th Bn East Yorks, killed in action at Oppy Wood 3 May 1917, posthumously awarded the VC. Casualties in 12th Bn had been so severe that it was temporarily reduced to two composite companies attached to the 10th and 11th Bns respectively. A fresh attack on Oppy Wood was arranged for 28 June. This time the attack was to be made by 94 Bde with 92 Bde in support. 10th Battalion was the brigade reserve, two companies of 11th Bn were to hold the front line, and 13th Bn was to provide carrying parties. Before the attack, each battalion of 92 Bde supplied a detachment for a trench raid to reconnoitre the objectives (Cadorna Trench, Wood Trench and Windmill Trench). 94 Brigade made its attack in the evening of 28 June and successfully took the trenches, completing the Capture of Oppy Wood.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 191‚Äì8. Oppy Wood from the air Oppy under shellfire, May 1917. 31st Division was not committed to the Third Ypres Offensive of Summer 1917, which culminated in the dreadful Battle of Passchendaele, possibly because it was still not considered to have recovered from its ordeal on the Somme a year before.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', p. 226, in Liddle, Passchendaele in Perspective. Instead, it served alongside the Canadian Corps holding the captured line on Vimy Ridge during July and August. In September it moved to the Arleux-en-Gohelles sector, where it continued until the end of the year, trench holding, patrolling and trench raiding. The platoons were reorganised on the new system with specialist sections of riflemen, bombers, rifle grenadiers and Lewis gunners.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 198‚Äì208.Griffith, pp. 77‚Äì9. =Disbandments= By the end of 1917 the BEF was suffering an acute manpower shortage. As a result, its brigades were reorganised on a three- battalion basis in February 1918 and many battalions were disbanded to reinforce the remainder. 12th Bn East Yorks was drafted to the 6th and 7th Bns East Yorks (11th (Northern) Division and 17th (Northern) Division respectively), to 10th and 11th Bns in 92nd Bde, to the 2/4th Bn West Riding Regiment in 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division, and the remainder to the 4th Entrenching Battalion. 13th Battalion was also drafted, the residue going to 4th Entrenching Bn.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1. The two remaining Hull Pals battalions were joined in 92 Bde by the Accrington Pals (11th (Service) Bn East Lancashire Regiment) from the disbanded 94 Bde (which had absorbed the whole of 8th Bn East Lancs from 37th Division).Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 74‚Äì6.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 210‚Äì2.Jackson, pp. 169‚Äì70.East Lancashire Regiment at Long, Long Trail.37 Division at Long, Long Trail. Spring Offensive When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 31st Division was in reserve, with 10th and 11th Bns digging trenches in the 'Army Line' behind the front. On 23 March the division was sent up to hold off the German attack at St L√©ger, but 92 Bde remained in reserve at Ervillers, improvising the defences. Ervillers was attacked on the evening of 24 March, the defence being confused by British troops retreating from the forward defences. Two companies of 10th Bn were pushed up to reinforce 11th Bn fighting in the village streets. About midnight a German patrol got into the village but was captured by 11th Bn's HQ staff. The following day the 11th Bn was reinforced by 10th Bn Manchester Regiment of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and their combined fire stopped the German advance. However, events elsewhere meant that the 31st and 42nd Divisions were ordered on the morning of 27 March to retire through Courcelles-le- Comte.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 214‚Äì23.Jackson, p. 171. =Ayette= The brigade defended Ayette aerodrome against repeated attacks from 11.20 to 16.30, when with both flanks 'in the air' it brigade pulled back to the partly-dug 'Purple Line' in front of Ayette village. Between 24 and 27 March 10th Bn had lost 211 officers and men, and was praised \\"for its exceptional gallantry on March 27\\" by the Commander in Chief of the BEF, Sir Douglas Haig. During the night, Lt- Col Headlam of 10th Bn led up a composite battalion of troops from the quartermasters' details of all three battalions to take over part of the Purple Line, and they helped to recover some 18-pounder ammunition from behind enemy lines, which was fired the following day. Although fighting continued elsewhere along the line, 28 March was a quieter day for 92 Bde, and 11th Bn took over some trenches started by 210th Field Company, Royal Engineers, which they continued to dig. The brigade was relieved on 31 March and marched back to billets near Pommier.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 223‚Äì5.Jackson, pp. 171‚Äì4. =Hazebrouck= While resting in the Monchy-Breton area the brigade received large numbers of reinforcements, mainly under the age of 19. The bombardment for the second phase of the German offensive (the Battles of the Lys) opened on 7 April, and by 11 April the brigade had been called forward in ex-London buses to form a defensive line near Estaires through which retreating British and Portuguese troops could withdraw. 11th Battalion held the outposts while 10th Bn pushed forward to make contact with the enemy. 10th Battalion's patrols found no friendly troops in front, only Germans. Next day the Germans threw in all their reserves to try to take Hazebrouck, with 10th Bn also being attacked by aircraft. After both flanks were again left in the air, 10th and 11th Bns were forced to retire across watercourses and hedges, pursued by the enemy, until they reached a railway embankment at M√©teren and a line at Merris held by the 11th East Lancs and another composite battalion of details from five different divisions under Lt-Col Gurney of 11th East Yorks. The attack was renewed on the morning of 13 May, when the defenders caused heavy casualties among the attacking Germans. The brigade withdrew in early morning mist the following day through a new line held by fresh Australian and British troops, who defeated the attacks and ensured the safety of Hazebrouck.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 225‚Äì34.Jackson, pp. 179‚Äì86. =Le Becque= During April, 10th East Yorks lost 368 men, and 11th lost 426, but fresh drafts were absorbed. Meanwhile, a temporary 92nd Composite Bn was formed from two companies from each of the battalions to relieve an Australian unit in the line. Before the end of the month the brigade was again taking turns in the line with the Australians, carrying out a number of raids. On 24 May the brigade came out of the line and began training for offensive operations. 31st Division was scheduled for Operation Borderland, a limited attack on La Becque and other fortified farms in front of the Forest of Nieppe to be carried out on 28 June, chosen because it was the anniversary of the capture of Oppy. The barrage began at 06.00 and the brigade followed it closely with all three battalions in line, in what was described as 'a model operation' for artillery cooperation. Some casualties were suffered from British shells falling short, but the German resistance was slight and the final objectives were taken by 07.25. Several hundred prisoners were captured, together with field guns and mortars. The positions were consolidated under long range machine gun fire. German troops massing for a counter-attack were dispersed by artillery fire. The brigade was relieved on 30 June.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 235‚Äì45.Blaxland, p. 149.Farndale, pp. 283‚Äì4.Jackson, pp. 187‚Äì94. Hundred Days Successes like La Becque showed that the tide of war was turning. After a relatively quiet period in July, during which 92 Bde achieved small advances through aggressive patrolling and seizing strongpoints (so-called \\"peaceful penetration\\"), the Allies began a coordinated offensive in August. 92 Brigade captured Vieux- Berquin on 13 August 1918 and pushed forward until running into serious opposition on 21 August. After a short rest, it returned to the front to continue pushing forward behind patrols. On 4 September, advancing without a barrage towards the Warnave river south of Ploegsteert, 10th Bn ran into strong German positions and suffered heavy casualties from German machine guns in strongpoints such as Soyer Farm. 11th East Lancs renewed the attack the following day and took Soyer Farm, but lost it to a counter-attack. 11th East Yorks were no more successful with a dawn attack on 6 September. A smokescreen and barrage on 7 September did not help 10th East Yorks, who advanced 1200 yards but failed to gain Soyer Farm, which remained in German hands when the brigade was relieved on 12 September.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 245‚Äì56.Jackson, pp. 195‚Äì8. =Ploegsteert Wood= The brigade returned to the same trenches on 23 September, but the machine guns in Soyer Farm prevented any \\"peaceful penetration\\". A formal attack was arranged for the morning of 28 September (the opening day of the Fifth Battle of Ypres) but was postponed to 15.00 because of bad weather. 10th East Yorks advanced behind a creeping barrage protecting the right flank of 11th East Lancs and suffered heavy casualties, but the general retirement of the Germans along the whole line allowed 10th Bn to push on through Ploegsteert Wood the next day, despite considerable fire from the enemy pillboxes, which were untouched by artillery shells. Following through, 11th East Yorks advanced the brigade's line up to the River Lys on 3 October.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 257‚Äì61.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 71‚Äì2, 82, 85.Jackson, pp. 200‚Äì2. =Pursuit= Returning to the line on 12 October, patrols from 10th East Yorks slipped across the Lys on a raft during the night of 14/15 October and established posts on the far bank. The following afternoon A Company crossed and then advanced under a barrage and reached the De√ªl√©mont‚ÄìWarneton road. 11th East Yorks passed through the following night and continued the advance on 16 and 17 October, liberating several villages. 10th East Yorks took up the pursuit the next day, advancing in company columns screened by XV Corps cyclist battalion, and then 11th East Lancs passed through to liberate the town of Tourcoing. German rearguards held the Tournai‚ÄìMouscron railway line behind, but were driven off. Pressure was kept up through 19 and 20 October, until the brigade was squeezed out of the advancing line and went into support.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 261‚Äì4.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 278, 284, 288‚Äì90.Jackson, pp. 203‚Äì4. Back in the line from 28 October, the brigade continued to advance slowly against machine gun and shell fire, from rearguards who \\"did not appear disposed to give ground\\". It served as divisional reserve for an attack at Tieghem on 31 October 1918 that was so successful the reserve was not required.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 266.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 444‚Äì50. On 3 November the division was withdrawn into reserve. It returned to the line on the night of 6/7 November. On 9 November the 11th East Lancs crossed the Scheldt and the brigade and continued to push forward. 11th East Yorks advanced as part of a pursuit force including an RFA battery and companies from the divisional machine gun battalion, the Motor Machine Gun Corps and XIX Corps cyclists, and marched on 10 November. Despite heavy German artillery fire on the night of 10/11 November, when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, 11th East Lancs were leading the division, and scouts reported that there were no enemy in front.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 267‚Äì72.Jackson, pp. 205‚Äì6. Disbandment The division began to pull back on 13 November, and by the end of the month the Hull battalions were established in 'Hull Camp' south of St- Omer and engaged in road repair. Demobilisation (chiefly of coal miners) began on 11 December and proceeded at a steadily increasing rate during January 1919. On 29 January the 10th and 11th Bns were sent by rail to Calais to deal with possible riots by men working in the Ordnance depot. They returned to St Omer within two days. Demobilisation accelerated in February and by April both battalions had been reduced to cadres. These cadres left for England on 22 May. They arrived at Hull Paragon Station on 26 May and after being inspected by Lord Nunburnholme they marched through the city to the Guildhall and officially disbanded.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 273‚Äì82.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, p. 196.

In 1983, Babardos passed the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, and abortion was made legal, other than upon request without a physician's oversight. Prior to 12 weeks gestation, the woman must get approval from a physician to receive abortion care. Between 12 and 20 weeks, two physicians must approve, and three are required after 20 weeks. Before getting the medical procedure, the woman is required to receive counseling. A medical practitioner must perform the abortion services, and after 12 weeks, they must do so in a government-approved hospital.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act  In 1983, the Barbados parliament passed the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, decriminalizing abortion and giving women access to legal and safe abortion care. Billie Miller, the first woman to serve as minister of health in Barbados, campaigned for seven years to encourage her colleagues to decriminalize medical care for women.

Similar to the observance of the Jewish holiday of Purim, Second Purims were typically commemorated with the reading of a megillah (scroll) describing the events that led to the salvation, specially-composed prayers, a festive meal, and the giving of charity. In some cases, a fast day was held the day before. Second Purims were established by hundreds of communities in the Jewish diaspora and in the Land of Israel under foreign rule. Most Second Purims are no longer observed. A Second Purim did not replace the regular Purim observed on 14 Adar (or 15 Adar, in Jerusalem and a few other cities), which all Jews are required by rabbinic law to observe. Sources A halakhic source for the custom of establishing a Second Purim is cited by the Chayei Adam on Orach Chayim 686: > Anyone to whom a miracle happened, or all the residents of a city, can > ordain by mutual agreement or by censure upon themselves and all who come > after them, to make that day a Purim. And it seems to me that the festive > meal that they make to celebrate the miracle is a seudat mitzvah. (Sefer > Chayei Adam, Hilkhot Megillah 155, ¬∂41) Date The date of a Second Purim marked the anniversary of the day the community or individual was rescued from destruction, catastrophe, or an antisemitic ruler or threat. Some Second Purims coincided with Jewish holidays, such as the Purim of Ancona, Italy, which fell on the second day of Sukkot, and the Purim of Carpentras, France, marking the community's rescue from a blood libel on the eighth day of Passover. The Purim of Rhodes coincided with Purim day itself, when the local Jews were exonerated from a blood libel in 1840. Although days of celebration are typically not held during periods of mourning on the Jewish calendar, Second Purims were established during those times to commemorate the exact date of the salvation. For example, the Purim of Candea was celebrated on 18 Tammuz and the Purim of Ibrahim Pasha (in Hebron) was commemorated on 1 Av, even though these dates fall during The Three Weeks of national mourning for the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Observances Scroll of Esther The community or family celebrated its Second Purim with observances similar to those of the regular Purim. These observances included some or all of the following: * The writing and reading of a special megillah (scroll) retelling the events leading to the salvation. In the Jewish communities of Castile, Saragossa, and Casablanca, the scroll was read in the synagogue using the traditional cantillation of the Scroll of Esther. * The composition and recital of special liturgical poems and prayers. Some of these poems were written in the style of Al HaNissim (\\"On account of the miracles\\", the prayer recited on Purim and Hanukkah). These were recited during the Amidah and during the Grace After Meals on the Second Purim. Some communities said the Hallel prayer during the morning service on their Second Purim, even though Hallel is not recited on Purim day. * A fast day on the day prior * The eating of a festive meal * The giving of charity to the poor. Some communities also exchanged mishloach manot, the traditional food gifts to friends given on Purim day. * The cessation of business activities. Notable Second Purims=Communities= *Purim Ancona (21 Tevet) Modern-day Ancona, Italy The Jewish community of Ancona, Italy, was noted for having four different communal Purims commemorating their salvation from potential disasters in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The first of these was established on 29 December 1690 (21 Tevet), when strong earthquakes rattled the city. On 15 Tishrei 1741, a fire threatened but did not destroy the synagogue. On 24 Adar 1775 the Jewish quarter was similarly spared from a fire. On 12 Shevat 1797 the Jewish population escaped rioting during a revolutionary war. In each case, a communal fast day was held the day before the holiday and special prayers were said on both days. *Purim of the Bandits (22 Elul) Popularly known as Purim de los Ladrones (Purim of the Bandits), this celebration marked the deliverance of the Jewish population of Gumeldjina, a city near Adrianople, Ottoman Empire, from accusations of disloyalty. In 1786 the city was attacked by an estimated 5,000 mountain brigands. Though the governor managed to drive off the invaders, the Jews were accused of helping the bandits enter the city. The community went to great lengths to prove its innocence, and further disaster was averted. *Purim Burghul (29 Tevet) In 1795 the Jews of Tripoli, Libya, established Purim Burghul to celebrate the ouster of Ali Burghul Pasha Cezayrli, who usurped the throne and conducted a reign of terror against them from 30 July 1793 to 20 January 1795. The piyut, \\"Mi Kamokha\\" (, \\"Who is like You\\"), composed by Rabbi Abraham Khalfon, was read in the synagogue on the Shabbat preceding Purim Burghul. *Purim Cairo (28 Adar) In 1524 the governor of Egypt, A·∏•med Shai·π≠an Pasha, arrested twelve of the Jewish leaders of Cairo, including Chief Rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra, and demanded an exorbitant ransom. One day he threatened to murder all the Jews in Cairo after he had finished taking his bath. He was stabbed to death in the bathhouse by one of his junior officers and the massacre was averted. * Purim Hebron (Window Purim) (14 Tevet) The Jewish community of Hebron has celebrated two historic Purims, both from the Ottoman period. One is called Window Purim, or Purim Taka, in which the community was saved when a bag of money mysteriously appeared in a window, enabling them to pay off an extortion fee to the Ottoman Pasha. The other is the Purim of Ibrahim Pasha (1 Av), in which the community was saved during a battle. *Purim Narbonne (21 Adar) In the heat of an argument between a Jew of Narbonne, France, and a Christian fisherman, the Jew struck the Christian and the latter died. Christian residents rioted in the Jewish quarter and stole the entire library belonging to Rabbi Meir ben Isaac. The governor fortuitously arrived on the scene with his troops and order was restored. Rabbi Meir received his library back and wrote a megillah commemorating the event. * Purim Rhodes (14 Adar) In 1840 Greeks who were in competition with Jews in the sponge trade on the island of Rhodes accused the Jewish community of murdering a child for ritual purposes. The Jews of Rhodes were jailed and tortured, though the child was later discovered alive on the island of Syra. The sultan, 'Abd al-Majid, deposed the local governor and issued a firman confirming the accusations were false. The date of the firman coincided with the date of Purim itself, and so the Jews of Rhodes celebrated a double holiday on that day. Special prayers and piyutim were recited in honor of Purim Rhodes, in addition to the usual Purim observances. * Purim Saragossa (18 Shevat) This holiday commemorated the downfall of a Jewish convert named Marcus, who informed the king that the Jews had removed the Torah scrolls from their cases when they brought them to a parade to honor the king in Saragossa, Spain. While the city's rabbis had instructed the Jews to do so, it impugned the king's honor, and the king called for the cases to be opened on the street the next day. That night, the gabbais of the city's twelve synagogues found out about the order and returned the scrolls to their cases. The next day, Marcus' malfeasance was exposed and the king ordered him to be put to death by hanging. It is uncertain whether this event took place in 1380 under Peter IV of Aragon or in 1420 under Alfonso V of Aragon. Purim Saragossa was celebrated by the descendants of the original Jewish community in synagogues in Constantinople, Magnesia, Smyrna, Salonica, and Jerusalem. *Purim Sebastiano (1 Elul) Don Sebastian of Portugal In 1578 Don Sebastian, king of Portugal, went to Morocco to join the Battle of the Three Kings at Alcazar-kebir. Sebastian was defeated by Sultan Moulay Abd-al-Malik and the Jews were saved from calamity. According to a 2005 work, Purim Sebastiano (also called Purim de los Christianos and Purim de las Bombas) is still commemorated annually in Tangier, T√©touan, and Fez; the holiday incorporates the reading of a megillah, the recital of special hymns, and the giving of charity. * Purim Tiberias (7 Elul and 4 Kislev) The Jews of Tiberias established communal Purims on two dates in 1743 after Suleiman Pasha, governor of Damascus, laid siege to the city for 83 days. The governor lifted the siege on 27 August. While planning his next attack, he suddenly died. The Jews of Tiberias celebrated both the day the siege was lifted (7 Elul) and the day the governor died (4 Kislev) as Second Purims. *Purim Vinz (20 Adar) This communal Purim commemorates the persecution and expulsion of the Jewish population of the Frankfurter Judengasse during the Fettmilch Uprising in 1614 and their restoration to their homes on the order of the German emperor in 1616. The antisemitic leader of the uprising, Vincent Fettmilch, styled himself as the \\"New Haman\\" and propagated attacks on the Jewish community. In a final attack, the Jews were expelled and their property confiscated. Several months later, the German emperor ordered that Fettmilch be executed for the injustice; his beheaded and quartered corpse was hung on the gates of the city. Fettmilch's house was also razed, and an account of his crimes and punishment was engraved on a pillar in German and Latin at the site. The Frankfurt authorities welcomed the Jewish population back with military honors. A \\"Vincent Megillah\\" was composed in Hebrew and Yiddish by Rabbi Elhanah Ha'elen. Frankfurt natives Rabbi Nathan Adler (1741‚Äì1800) and Rabbi Moses Sofer (the Chasam Sofer, 1762‚Äì1839) both observed Purim Vinz even while living outside the city, though neither fasted on the day before the festival, as was done in Frankfurt itself. =Families= * Purim of Rabbi Avraham Danzig (16 Kislev) The family of Rabbi Avraham Danzig (the Chayei Adam) established their own Second Purim after an explosion of magnesium in a military camp near their home in Vilnius destroyed many houses and killed 31 residents in 1803. Danzig and his family were also injured, but survived. The family commemorated this personal miracle by fasting during the day of 15 Kislev and holding a celebratory feast later that night (corresponding to 16 Kislev). Torah scholars were invited to the feast, psalms were read, and charity was distributed. This Second Purim was also known as Pulverpurim (\\"Powder Purim\\") in Yiddish, *Purim of Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller (1 Adar) In 1644, Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller of Krak√≥w instructed his descendants to celebrate a Second Purim every 1 Adar to commemorate the end of his many troubles, including imprisonment on trumped-up charges. * Purim F√ºrhang (\\"Curtain Purim\\") (22 Tevet) Maisel Synagogue (photo credit: Jewish Museum in Prague) Chanoch ben Moshe Altschul of Prague designated this annual celebration for his family to commemorate his release from prison in 1623. When damask curtains were stolen from the governor's palace in his absence, all the city's synagogues announced that anyone who had the stolen goods in his possession should turn them over to the gabbai. A certain Jew delivered the curtains to Altschul, then the gabbai of the Maisel Synagogue, claiming he had purchased them from two soldiers. The vice-governor demanded that the buyer be named and delivered to him for punishment, but Altschul was forbidden by synagogue bylaws to name receivers of stolen goods who had returned them voluntarily. Altschul was imprisoned and sentenced to death by hanging. He sought and received permission from the president of the synagogue to name the buyer, who was hung instead. Altschul was released from prison after the Jewish community paid a fine of 10,000 florins. Altschul wrote a scroll titled \\"Megillat Pur ha-·∏≤ela'im\\" (\\"Scroll of the Purim of the Curtains\\"), and obligated all his descendants to read it and eat a festive meal every year on 22 Tevet, the day of his release. *Purim Povidl (\\"Plum Jam Purim\\") (10 Adar) In 1731, David Brandeis of Jung-Bunzlau, Bohemia, established this familial Purim in commemoration of his personal deliverance. On 4 Shevat, the daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which made her family ill; her father died a few days after eating it. The burgomaster of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of consumption and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called Shir HaMa'alot l'David (\\"A Song of Ascents to David\\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. Brandeis' descendants in the nineteenth century were still celebrating Purim Povidl. Second Purims observed by other groups In Karaite Judaism, 1 Shevat is celebrated as a Second Purim; this was the day (year unknown) that a Karaite leader named Yerushalmi was freed from prison. Followers of Sabbatai Zvi established a Second Purim on 15 Kislev, honoring the day in 1648 that their leader declared himself the Jewish Messiah.

As a high school student, Kent began hosting a classical music program for Chicago‚Äôs WBEZ. Over the years he ‚Äúhas served as an inspiration to a number of aspiring African-American broadcasters.‚Äù He was known as the \\"cool gent\\", a phrase that he coined to rhyme with his name. Early years Kent was born Herbert Rogers Kent in Cook County Hospital in Chicago. An only child, he grew up in the Bronzeville neighborhood in Chicago. He attended Hyde Park High School and Northwestern University. He told a reporter in 2009 that as early as age 6 he \\"had a love affair with radio\\", as he enjoyed listening to a blues station at that age.  Career  Members of Kent's radio audience usually felt as if they knew him personally, even though they might never have met him ‚Äî a familiarity facilitated by \\"his lively exchange with guests and co-workers during his broadcasts\\". Kent began working in radio in 1944 when he was 16 years old and still in high school, hosting a classical music program on WBEZ in Chicago. That assignment resulted from his acceptance into \\"highly competitive\\" workshops conducted by WBEZ. By the late 1940s, he was working at two stations -- acting in old-time radio dramas on WMAQ in Chicago and hosting a record program on WGRY in Gary, Indiana. He went on to work at WJFC-AM and WJOB-AM before reaching the role for which he became best known. In the 1950s, Kent became known as \\"The King of the Dusties\\" for his development of the oldies format that he called \\"dusty records\\", a term he coined while working at WBEE radio in Harvey, Illinois. In March 1963, Kent headed the disc jockey lineup at WVON, a newly launched Chicago station that resulted from the purchase of WHFC and a change in format to \\"uncompromising soul-style rhythm and blues.\\" Kent, who was one of two disc jockeys retained from the WHFC staff, had the 7:30-11 p.m. program. Robert Pruter, in his book, Chicago Soul, noted that Kent had a distinct on-air style: \\"Unlike many other deejays of the day, black or white, he never shouted or screamed or used an artificial patter. He always talked in a conversational, ultra-cool style.\\" Hermene Hartman and David Smallwood, in their book, N'Digo Legacy Black Luxe 110: Media Edition, described WVON as \\"arguably the most popular Black radio station ever in America\\" and Kent as the station's most popular disc jockey at his peak. Gary Deeb, radio-TV critic for the Chicago Tribune, noted that Kent's popularity as a night-time disc jockey attracted an audience of young people who also listened to the station at other times. In March 1977, Kent was fired from WVON. The station's owner blamed Kent's lack of energy, but Deeb wrote that the dismissal of Kent and other WVON personnel resulted from cost-cutting measures. In 1978, Kent returned to Chicago radio with a 5-6 p.m. weekday program on WXFM. In the 1990s, he was heard on FM station WVAZ in Chicago. By October 1999, he had returned to WVON, but on the station's FM side. In the mid-1960s, Kent owned the Times Square Club, a rhythm-and-blues venue that leased space in the Packinghouse Workers' Hall on South Wabash in Chicago. =Other professional activities= Kent was the host of Steppin' at Club 7, a dance program on WLS-TV in Chicago in the mid-1990s. The title came from Chicago stepping, a dance with which Kent was associated. He also taught courses in radio broadcasting part-time at Chicago State University.  Civil Rights activities  Kent, who had been master of ceremonies for a Freedom Summer rally held by Martin Luther King Jr. At Soldier Field in Chicago, \\"was the voice on WVON calling for calm\\" after King's assassination. He reported from Chicago's streets during riots after King's killing.  Death  On October 22, 2016, Kent died at age 88. He had done his final radio broadcast that morning. Contested estate Robbin Kent, her father's only daughter, contested his will, which named his girlfriend, Linda Stanford, as executor. Robbin Kent said that because her father had dementia, Stanford \\"took advantage of him and ran amuck.\\" Robbin Kent said that she and her son (Herb Kent's only grandchild) received nothing from the will. Autobiography In 2009, The Cool Gent: The Nine Lives of Radio Legend Herb Kent was published by Lawrence Hill Books. David Smallwood was the book's co-author. Recognition * In 1995, Kent was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. * In 2009, Kent was recognized by Guinness World Records for the \\"Longest career as a radio presenter/DJ (male)\\". A Guinness representative officially recognized him at a ceremony in Chicago. * In 2015, Kent received the Chicago Crusader's Crusading Pioneer Award. * In 2016, Kent received the Lifetime Achievement Award from The Chicago Defender and Real Times Media at the Men of Excellence Awards Dinner in Chicago.

The Suzie River crosses the townships Jalobert, Bourgmont, Bongard, Logan and Bernier. The course deviated by the dams flows rather in the canton of Br√©court via Lake Br√©court. The Suzie River flows entirely on forest land north-east of the La V√©rendrye Wildlife Reserve and on the west side of Gouin Reservoir. Forestry is the main economic activity of this hydrographic slope; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the river is usually frozen from mid-December to mid-April.  Geography  History  In 1948, the Government of Quebec approved the Shawinigan Water and Power Company project to raise the Gouin Reservoir, in order to increase the flow of the Saint-Maurice River and consequently increase the hydro-electric production. The Shawinigan Water & Power Company was able to carry out this project, by diverting the headwaters of the M√©giscane River and the Suzie River, which flowed naturally to the north, the James Bay, to make them flow south to the St. Lawrence River by the Saint-Maurice River. A series of dykes and canals have been built in these two rivers in order to carry out the diversion of the waters.

It used ground waves to follow the curvature of the Earth and allow aircraft to be detected over the sea at very low levels. It was designed to detect a target flying at an altitude of at a range of , well below the radar horizon. Testing was highly successful, but it was abruptly cancelled in 1953 when it was pointed out it could be easily jammed by a low-cost shortwave transmitter even from long range. History In 1948, Claude Shannon used his recently introduced science of information theory to study radar systems and suggest that there were calculable fundamental limits to their performance. This was unexpected, and provoked wide interest in the radar field. In 1949, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), the Air Ministry's radar research arm, began applying this new concept to consider the extraction of both location and velocity information from a radar signal, and to the expected performance of long-range radars against low flying aircraft and the detection of submarine snorkels in rough seas. The work was interesting enough that the Ministry of Supply funded further development under the rainbow code Orange Poodle. The system operated in the shortwave region, at 13 m wavelength. The signal was sent in-phase into a series of vertical antenna elements, and on reception, it was separated through its Doppler shift into bands of ‚Öì Hz. For experimental purposes, Marconi built a smaller version with eight elements that was constructed by connecting them to one of the disused Chain Home antennas at RAF Downderry in Cornwall. This mounting meant it could point only in one direction. Experiments began in September 1952, and found reasonable results in spite of interference from local shortwave sources. A larger version consisting of 32 elements strung between two towers was completed in January 1953, and underwent testing in February and March. Sea clutter was completely absorbed in the lower frequency receivers, and aircraft were easily detected in the higher frequencies, corresponding to faster movement. Signal strength turned out to be even better than expected because scattering off the troposphere added to the signal. The tests were very encouraging and led to plans for a production version that might be part of the ROTOR network. However, by the end of the year development had been cancelled when it was pointed out how easily the system was interfered with by local shortwave sources; an enemy could easily jam the radar using low-cost commercial transmitters while still well below the horizon.

Curb ceased publication in 2016. His 1991 book Places on the Margin, won a Library Choice 'Book of the Year' award for demonstrating a theory of Social Spatialisations. Shields argued that geographical places were understood through a network of contrasting places. Social spatialisation influences social action through embodied habit and casting locations as \\"places for this and places for that\\". This had significant impact on human geographical definitions of spatiality and understanding of the social and political aspects of geographical space. Shields' approach is related to Henri Lefebvre's social production of space. Shields' interest in spatial and cultural categories led to work on Virtuality in which he argued that intangibles social spatialisations were real, not abstract ideas or \\"socially constructed\\" beliefs. 5. His theory of Cultural Topologies extends spatialisation to time by considering cultural conflicts and collective memory and rhythms of places as time-space manifolds Shields introduces the application of topological concepts to the analysis of cultural senses of temporality as well as spatiality or spatialisation) using the example of the historical problem of the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsburg solved by Leonard Euler.

Both male and female were first described by French arachnologist Eug√®ne Louis Simon in 1884 under the name Brachybothrium pacificum. The genus name is a combination of the Greek \\"antrodiaitos\\" (Œ±ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÑŒøœÇ), meaning \\"living in caves\\", \\"antron\\" (Œ±ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ), meaning \\"cave\\", and \\"diaita (Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÑŒ±), meaning \\"way of life, dwelling\\". The specific epithet refers to its geographical distribution along the pacific coast of North America, between San Francisco Bay and Alaska. It is the northernmost mygalomorph spider in North America. Both males and females have a carapace that is dark brown to black, and two to three sclerotized patches on the abdomen. Females are about long, and males are about long. They are active year-round, but most activity occurs between late July and early September, peaking around mating season between early June and late November. They live in cool, damp forest and build burrows in soft substrates, usually sand, moss,or decaying wood, where they brood their eggs and overwinter. During the day, they keep the entrance closed, but when the sun sets and it is sufficiently dark, they will open the burrow and wait at the entrance for potential prey to wander by, predominantly beetles.

The definition is more complicated and technical than the one for complex manifolds due in part to the noncommutativity of the quaternions and in part to the lack of a suitable calculus of holomorphic functions for quaternions. The most succinct definition uses the language of G-structures on a manifold. Specifically, a quaternionic n-manifold can be defined as a smooth manifold of real dimension 4n equipped with a torsion-free \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times-structure. More na√Øve, but straightforward, definitions lead to a dearth of examples, and exclude spaces like quaternionic projective space which should clearly be considered as quaternionic manifolds. Definitions=The enhanced quaternionic general linear group= If we regard the quaternionic vector space \\\\mathbb{H}^n\\\\cong\\\\R^{4n} as a right \\\\mathbb{H}-module, we can identify the algebra of right \\\\mathbb{H}-linear maps with the algebra of n\\\\times n quaternionic matrices acting on \\\\mathbb{H}^n from the left. The invertible right \\\\mathbb{H}-linear maps then form a subgroup \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H}) of \\\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\\\R). We can enhance this group with the group \\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times of nonzero quaternions acting by scalar multiplication on \\\\mathbb{H}^n from the right. Since this scalar multiplication is \\\\R-linear (but not \\\\mathbb{H}-linear) we have another embedding of \\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times into \\\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\\\R). The group \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times is then defined as the product of these subgroups in \\\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\\\R). Since the intersection of the subgroups \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H}) and \\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times in \\\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\\\R) is their mutual center \\\\R^\\\\times (the group of scalar matrices with nonzero real coefficients), we have the isomorphism :\\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times \\\\cong (\\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})\\\\times\\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times)/\\\\R^\\\\times. =Almost quaternionic structure= An almost quaternionic structure on a smooth manifold M is just a \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbb{H}^\\\\times- structure on M. Equivalently, it can be defined as a subbundle H of the endomorphism bundle \\\\operatorname{End}(TM) such that each fiber H_x is isomorphic (as a real algebra) to the quaternion algebra \\\\mathbb{H}. The subbundle H is called the almost quaternionic structure bundle. A manifold equipped with an almost quaternionic structure is called an almost quaternionic manifold. The quaternion structure bundle H naturally admits a bundle metric coming from the quaternionic algebra structure, and, with this metric, H splits into an orthogonal direct sum of vector bundles H = L\\\\oplus E where L is the trivial line bundle through the identity operator, and E is a rank-3 vector bundle corresponding to the purely imaginary quaternions. Neither the bundles H or E are necessarily trivial. The unit sphere bundle Z = S(E) inside E corresponds to the pure unit imaginary quaternions. These are endomorphisms of the tangent spaces that square to ‚àí1. The bundle Z is called the twistor space of the manifold M, and its properties are described in more detail below. Local sections of Z are (locally defined) almost complex structures. There exists a neighborhood U of every point x in an almost quaternionic manifold M with an entire 2-sphere of almost complex structures defined on U. One can always find I, J, K\\\\in\\\\Gamma(Z_U) such that :I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1 Note, however, that none of these operators may be extendable to all of M. That is, the bundle Z may admit no global sections (e.g. this is the case with quaternionic projective space \\\\mathbb{HP}^n). This is in marked contrast to the situation for complex manifolds, which always have a globally defined almost complex structure. =Quaternionic structure= A quaternionic structure on a smooth manifold M is an almost quaternionic structure Q which admits a torsion-free affine connection abla preserving Q. Such a connection is never unique, and is not considered to be part of the quaternionic structure. A quaternionic manifold is a smooth manifold M together with a quaternionic structure on M. Special cases and additional structures=Hypercomplex manifolds= A hypercomplex manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H})-structure. The reduction of the structure group to \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{H}) is possible if and only if the almost quaternionic structure bundle H\\\\subset \\\\operatorname{End}(TM) is trivial (i.e. isomorphic to M\\\\times\\\\mathbb{H}). An almost hypercomplex structure corresponds to a global frame of H, or, equivalently, triple of almost complex structures I, J, and K such that :I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1 A hypercomplex structure is an almost hypercomplex structure such that each of I, J, and K are integrable. =Quaternionic K√§hler manifolds= A quaternionic K√§hler manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free \\\\operatorname{Sp}(n)\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{Sp}(1)-structure. =Hyperk√§hler manifolds= A hyperk√§hler manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free \\\\operatorname{Sp}(n)-structure. A hyperk√§hler manifold is simultaneously a hypercomplex manifold and a quaternionic K√§hler manifold. Twistor space Given a quaternionic n-manifold M, the unit 2-sphere subbundle Z=S(E) corresponding to the pure unit imaginary quaternions (or almost complex structures) is called the twistor space of M. It turns out that, when n\\\\ge 2, there exists a natural complex structure on Z such that the fibers of the projection Z\\\\to M are isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{CP}^1. When n=1, the space Z admits a natural almost complex structure, but this structure is integrable only if the manifold is self-dual. It turns out that the quaternionic geometry on M can be reconstructed entirely from holomorphic data on Z. The twistor space theory gives a method of translating problems on quaternionic manifolds into problems on complex manifolds, which are much better understood, and amenable to methods from algebraic geometry. Unfortunately, the twistor space of a quaternionic manifold can be quite complicated, even for simple spaces like \\\\mathbb{H}^n.

In October, 2001 a spokesperson for insurance specialists AXA Art described the attacks as \\"the biggest single disaster ever to affect the [art] industry\\". The Port Authority held an estimated 100 pieces of art work at the World Trade Center Complex, in addition to the seven public works of art that had been created for the World Trade Center, all of which were destroyed or severely damaged. The offices of brokerage house Cantor Fitzgerald reportedly contained 300 Rodin sculptures. Public art An estimated $10 million worth of public art was lost due to the collapse of the World Trade Center. There were seven one-of-a-kind public works of art in the World Trade Center Complex at the time of the attacks: * Bent Propeller by Alexander Calder, 1970 * The Sphere by Fritz Koenig, 1971 * Cloud Fortress by Masayuki Nagare, 1972 * Ideogram by James Rosati, 1972 * The World Trade Center Tapestry by Joan Mir√≥ and Josep Royo, 1974 * Sky Gate, New York by Louise Nevelson, 1978 * 1993 bombing memorial fountain by Elyn Zimmerman, 1995 =Recovery= *Ideogram, The World Trade Center Tapestry, and Sky Gate, New York were never recovered from the rubble and are presumed destroyed. *Cloud Fortress survived the attack and collapse of the buildings, but was severely damaged and subsequently cleared by rescue workers in the days after the attacks. *Bent Propeller was partially recovered from the rubble. Only a small piece of the 1993 bombing memorial fountain was recovered. *The Sphere was damaged in the attacks, but was refurbished and put on display as a memorial. In addition to the seven public art works, the Port Authority also had approximately 100 pieces of art on the complex, including: * Recollection Pond, a tapestry by Romare Bearden * Path Mural by Germaine Keller * Commuter Landscape, a mural by Cynthia Mailman * Fan Dancing with the Birds, a mural by Hunt Slonem Private art collections The World Trade Center alone held more than 430 tenants at the time of the attacks. In addition to the decorative art that each office contained, some firms held large corporate art collections. Three companies held major corporate art collections in the World Trade Center: Fred Alger, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bank of America. Aside from these three, all other companies in the World Trade Center kept their artwork in other locations. =Cantor Fitzgerald= In addition to losing the most lives in the attack, Cantor Fitzgerald lost the most artwork. Their offices on the 105th floor of the North Tower housed a gallery which held an estimated 300 casts of Rodin sculptures. Some of the Rodin works were recovered a quarter mile away from Ground Zero, including a bust from The Burghers of Calais, two of the three figures from The Three Shades, and a cast of The Thinker. After being recovered, The Thinker cast went missing, possibly due to theft. =Citigroup= The collection of Citigroup, whose office was in World Trade Center Building 7, contained 1113 works of art which were all lost on September 11, 2001, according to Suzanne F. W. Lemakis who was the Citigroup Art Curator at the time of the attacks. The Citigroup collection at the World Trade Center consisted of about 75% prints, many of which were mass-produced and were replaceable. Also lost were English and American antique furniture, and Asian porcelains. According to Lemakis, the most expensive painting in Citigroup's collection was a large mural depicting Wall Street, painted by an unknown designer. =Fred Alger= Also located in the North Tower, this firm lost a collection of photographs by photographers including Cindy Sherman and Hiroshi Sugimoto. =Bank of America= Bank of America's office in the World Trade Center lost over 100 works of art by contemporary artists. =J.P. Morgan Chase= At the time of the attack, the firm had only five lithographs in its Trade Center office, keeping most of its corporate art collection of over 17,000 works of art at its offices two blocks from the World Trade Center. Art studios in the World Trade Center The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its offices in Building 5 of the World Trade Center, and two studios on the 91st and 92nd floors of The North Tower. The Council hosted an artist-in-residency program, called World Views, which hosted 15 artists from around the globe and was supposed to run from May‚ÄìNovember 2001. The 15 artists worked in the studios in the North Tower. Nearly all of their artwork was lost in the attack on and subsequent collapse of the towers. At least one of the artists, Jamaican-born sculptor Michael Richards, also died in the attacks. Richards had worked through the night in the towers on an unfinished sculpture, a memorial piece dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen, which portrayed a pilot riding a burning meteor. The council also lost all of its archives that had been in their offices in Building 5. Government art collections At the Pentagon a total of 24 artworks were destroyed with an additional 40 pieces receiving substantial damage. None of the works were insured so there is no monetary estimate to what was lost but Army art curator Renee Klish noted that \\"the importance of the military collections is historic, not monetary.\\"Heritage Preservation. p. 13-14 Marine art curator Jack Dyer described the art pieces lost at the Pentagon and in New York as \\"Cultural casualties.\\" The Army lost eight paintings at the Pentagon in the Army Center for Military History including: *O.D.

The Air Force lost ten paintings, all of various aircraft. Seven artworks owned by the Marine Corps were also destroyed. They lost six lithographs and paintings and one print. An additional seven other works were damaged. On September 11th, American Airlines Flight 77 came to a stop with its nose cone resting on the back wall of the Pentagon library which held over 500,000 books and documents dating back to the early 1800's. All library staff escaped, but the Chief Army Librarian Ann Parham suffered facial burns. The collection was not fully catalogued, due to the rapid addition of new documents and regulations, and it was not insured. The books and documents were damaged by mold, soot containing hydrochloric acid, asbestos debris, water damage, and smoke damage. Restoration cost $500,000 and saved approximately 99 percent of the book collection and all of the historic materials. Insurance payouts Much of the art was not insured for its full value.

Founded in 1962, it has become a destination for many people from across the Midwest, with an annual attendance of approximately 60,000 people. The festival is a celebration of Bayfield's local heritage, especially showcasing products from the many local apple orchards and wineries. The festival offers a variety of events and attractions. The street festival features over 60 booths, offering fresh foods and local crafts. Other attractions include tours of the 14 local orchards, live music, and an amusement park. History In the early 1960s, Jim Erickson, the owner of an orchard in Bayfield, was traveling to North Dakota to deliver a shipment of apples. While in Duluth, his truck had a flat tire. While waiting for a spare to be driven up from home, many people stopped to ask about buying his fruit. After selling bushels of apples to 25 people, he started wondering why he (and other Bayfield apple growers) were traveling so far to sell their goods. Realizing an opportunity, a discussion was raised about selling the local orchard's products more locally, and the idea of Applefest was born. The attendance of the first event in 1962 was 5,000. Over they years, Applefest has continued to experience huge growth in attendance. No Applefest is planned in 2020 as officials cited the COVID-19 pandemic as cause for cancellation.

Life Wilden began his studies at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, but they were interrupted until 1919 by World War One. One of his most important teachers there was Heinrich Nauen, a proponent of Rhenish Expressionism. His work was influenced by that school and other trends of the time. Watercolours and pastels formed a major part of his oeuvre. He received early recognition as a set-designer around the time of the 1919-20 season at the Schauspielhaus D√ºsseldorf, which developed into one of the most modern theatres in the German-speaking world under the direction of Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann. He was later taken on by theatres in Herne, Gera, Hagen, Barmen-Elberfeld and Cologne, producing a total of around two hundred set designs, featuring vivid colours and often vertical emphases, front-facing architectural motifs and perspectives creating several illusory rooms. He left the theatre behind in 1930 to work as an independent artist, though he did marry the actress Hedwig Sparrer.

Fuller and Gerald Pearson. For this, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. Biography Chapin was born in Ellensburg, Washington on 21 July 1906, although he spent his childhood in Salem, Oregon. There, he obtained his bachelor's degree from Willamette University and later on received his master's from the University of Washington. Before joining AT&T; in 1930, he lectured physics at Oregon State College for a year. Prior to working on solar cells, he worked on magnetic materials. While working on power sources for remote telephone systems in humid areas such as the tropics, where dry cell batteries are unreliable, he investigated solar power as an energy source after considering alternatives like thermoelectric generators and small steam engines. Initially he investigated selenium, getting efficiencies which were too low with a yield of about 4.9 watts per square meter. At the same time, Pearson and Fuller were working on altering semiconductor properties through introduction of impurities. They created a p‚Äìn junction by dipping a gallium-doped silicon piece in lithium at around 500 ¬∞C before exposing it to sunlight, hence discovering its ability to generate photocurrents. Pearson informed Chapin of this discovery, prompting him to switch materials and after a year the functional solar cell was demonstrated on 25 April 1954. The solar cells delivered a power of about 60 watts per square meter, for an efficiency of 6 percent, and was patented as a \\"solar energy converting apparatus\\". The initial discovery attracted major media attention, with the New York Times reporting the discovery on its first page as one which \\"may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind‚Äôs most cherished dreams‚Äìthe harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization\\". It initially failed to gain major commercialization due to its still-prohibitive costs and found only niche use in small electronic devices such as the transistor radio. However, the Pentagon found use of the technology for their satellites and in 1958 launched the Vanguard 1, the first solar-powered satellite. For the discovery, Chapin was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater, Willamette, and the John Scott Medal from Philadelphia, both in 1956. By 1959, he had simplified the solar cell's experiment to the point where it was performed by high school students across the United States. In order to bring down the cost, he experimented with polycrystalline silicon but was unable to reproduce the efficiencies of the single crystals. He died in his home in Naples, Florida on 19 January 1995, at age 88. After his death, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008 alongside his two co-workers.

It is commonly celebrated with fireworks, concerts, torchlight marches, parades, and parties. It is considered to be the national day of Armenia. History Republic Day celebrations in 1919. Shortly after the start of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire began forcible expulsion of Armenians from the empire. Women, children and elderly people were forced to leave Armenia and go to Syria and Russia. 1 to 1.5 million people were killed in what is now known as the Armenian Genocide. Following the genocide, the Armenian National Council Declared its sovereignty on 28 May 1918. Armenia was proclaimed an independent republic on May 28, 1918. The republic immediately experienced massive hunger, and a massive influx of refugees. The republic was short lived, and as of December 2, 1920, the Red Army entered Armenia and proclaimed it a Soviet Republic.

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake helps Terry when he plans to get a vasectomy. Meanwhile, Holt finds out that there's a new Deputy Commissioner who may make his life a living hell. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.31 million household viewers and gained a 1.6/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Terry Crews' performance and Sedgwick's guest performance. Plot Jake steps in to help Terry (Terry Crews), who has a medical appointment to get a vasectomy, When Jake drives to pick Terry up from New York Presbyterian, he finds that they could not perform the surgery because they did not have enough anesthesia. At home Terry, delirious from the anesthesia, confesses that he does not want a vasectomy and makes Jake promise to stop him. When Jake confronts him the next morning, he quickly becomes frustrated when Terry denies his true feelings and insists Jake is just \\"a work friend, not a friend-friend.\\" As he is wheeled into surgery, however, Terry panics and escapes. He later apologizes to Jake for his treatment of him. Captain Holt's fears about the NYPD's reorganization are realized when his old adversary Madeleine Wuntch (Kyra Sedgwick), now the Deputy Commissioner, shows up to conduct a critical review of the 99th's competence. Wuntch previously wanted to have intercourse with Holt but was rejected as Holt revealed he was gay. She has held grudges against him since then. Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) scrambles for a date to the engagement party of his ex-wife and her boyfriend (who are also his landlords) until Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) steps in to help him out. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Chocolate Milk\\" was seen by an estimated 3.31 million household viewers and gained a 1.6/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 40% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.46 million viewers with a 2.6/7 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the third most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney but behind Family Guy and The Simpsons, sixth on its timeslot and eight for the night, behind Madam Secretary, Family Guy, The Simpsons, 60 Minutes, Once Upon a Time, NFL on CBS, and NBC Sunday Night Football. =Critical reviews= \\"Chocolate Milk\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Much like in real life, it's sort of a staple in sitcoms to have certain people realize that, despite the amount of time they may spend with each other, they're not exactly the best of friends. They may be technically close friends through family or other friends, but for some reason, they've never really had to do 'friend things' with each other. It's more than a casual friendship, and it might not even be a thing where there‚Äôs an inherent dislike or difference between the two. They're just not 'friend friends.' Call it a fact of life. The second episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nines sophomore season not only hits that point just right, it returns the series to form in a way that was somewhat absent in the season premiere.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Nobody gives lectures about intimacy in the workplace. People talk about sex ‚Äî what 'Chocolate Milk' is ostensibly about, with plots that feature seduction, friends with benefits relationships, and even a vasectomy ‚Äî but nobody tells you how to be friends. It's hard to be friends, when you're competitive, when you're trying keep your distance, when you don't know if a real relationship is possible. The typical workplace terms then build themselves around emotional distance: work friends, bone bros, master and student. But if you spend too much time with anyone, those labels become harder to define. And on Brooklyn Nine-Nine this week, the easy distinctions in the precinct start to dissolve, like chocolate in teat-to- mouth raw milk.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"There's plenty of funny stuff for the whole Brooklyn ensemble in 'Chocolate Milk,' from Gina slapping Boyle at the thought of them being 'bone bros' to Santiago's eyes going wide with terror at the realization that she just yelled at her captain, to the spectacle of Terry being high. (In addition to the spectacle of Jake clinging to Terry's ankle as Terry easily continues walking.) Solid episode all- around.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 9.0 and wrote, \\"And Brooklyn Nine-Nine continues to show its strength as an ensemble comedy, though lingering questions remain over how the overarching stories introduced in 'Undercover' will impact the series going forward. Given how well 'Chocolate Milk' handles its pursuit of character, though, maybe those don't matter much just yet.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 2) episodes ","title":"Chocolate Milk (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56426629","text":"Eade is an English surname.

Merciless Eden, Published by Ferry Media, Boise, Idaho. 2013. p.9 This section of the trail is currently part of the Nez Perce National Forest Trail System, Trail Number 231, which begins near the Dillinger Mine Trail Head, down Rhett Creek, over the ridge near Rock Rabbit Point, and then down to the Salmon River. Photo of three-blazed tree, 2015 The newly constructed (1902) Three Blaze \\"shortcut\\" Trail was located and marked with three distinctive blazes, or marks, cut on the trees, usually with and axe, to signify this specific route. Three blazes were used, which was different than the common two blaze system used by the U.S. Forest Service. The two-blaze system consisted of a lower 8 inch-long dash with an upper short dot above as explained in \\"Trail Construction of the National Forests\\", U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington Government Printing Office, 1915.Trail Construction of the National Forests, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington Government Printing Office, 1915 The two blaze dot and dash was the more common method to blaze trees as used by the U.S. Forest Service to mark trails until discontinued in the 1980s. The Three Blaze Trail is now part of the National Forest Service Trail System, part of which are numbered Trails 017 and 006, on the Payette National Forest. The trail is no longer maintained as demonstrated by the photo showing the trail clogged with downed timber. Trail showing downed trees 2015 The Three Blaze Trail began at Campbell's Ferry, near the mouth of Trout Creek, traversed up the ridge near Little Trout Creek to Wet Meadows, then follows the Highline Ridge to Upper Trout Creek Meadows. From Upper Trout Creek Meadows the trail dropped into Chamberlain Creek at the mouth of Moose Creek. From Moose Creek the Three Blaze Trail went to Moose Jaw Meadow, then climbed the slope towards the head of Lodgepole Creek and the top of Ramey Ridge. From near Hand Meadows, the trail followed Ramey Ridge southward, past Rock Rabbit Point, Dead Mule Peak, Ramey Spring, to Ramey Point. From Ramey Point, the trail followed the ridge-line and switched-backed down the steep slope to Copper Camp, on Big Creek, the southern terminus of the Three Blaze Trail (route taken from U.S. Forest Service maps and \\"CCC in Idaho Collection, Digital Initiatives, University of Idaho Library, William Allen Stonebreaker, Chamberlain Basin ranch\\". The total distance of the Three Blaze Trail is 41 miles. The route from Copper Camp on Big Creek to the Thunder Mountain Mining area continued to follow an existing trail down Big Creek, from near the mouth of Copper Creek, downstream about 4 miles to Monumental Creek, then up-stream on Monumental Creek about 20 miles to the Thunder Mountain Mining area, and Roosevelt, Idaho.Preston, Peter, p.3.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Work (involving Andrew Baxter Leven, Nigel Laman Thomas, and Harold James Parr) and built from 1930 to 1939. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2016.  History  Ithaca Creek State School (established 1885), located in the inner Brisbane suburb of Bardon about four kilometres northwest of the Brisbane central business district (CBD), is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. It retains a Depression- era brick school building (1934‚Äì1936), constructed as a Depression-era work project, which is an aesthetically-pleasing landmark in the streetscape; and landscaped grounds including retaining walls ( and pre-1960), a parade ground (1934‚Äì1936), tennis court (1939) with tennis shed (pre-1946), a playing field (1932), a World War II (WWII) memorial dedicated to The Rats of Tobruk, and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with its surrounding community. The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p. 2. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 84, 120-1. Land in the vicinity of Ithaca Creek State School was first surveyed in the 1860s, but not auctioned as suburban lots until 1870. In 1880, an early local government area was created incorporating the land between Enoggera and Windsor; it was called Ithaca Division after the Ithaca Creek which flows through it. By 1884 a country postal receiving office operated at Ithaca Creek to serve the small community.Leslie, E Slaughter, Ithaca Creek State School 1884-1957. Ithaca Creek SS, Brisbane, 1957, p. 3QGG, 8 Jan 1870, p. 52Ithaca and Ithaca Shire, Queensland Places' , accessed 21 Oct 2015Theophilis Pugh, Pugh's Queensland Almanac, Law Calendar, Directory, Coast Guide and Gazetteer for 1884, Theophilis Pugh, Brisbane, 1884, p. 128. In the same year, the community petitioned the Minister for Public Lands to reserve land for a school at Ithaca Creek and soon afterwards a one hectare site (Portion 826B) was reserved for this purpose.Slaughter, Ithaca Creek State School 1884-1957, pp. 5, 7Queensland Government Gazette, 1884, vol. 2, p. 1226. Ithaca Creek State School opened on a sloping site fronting Lugg Street (now in the suburb of Bardon with the City of Brisbane), on 28 September 1885, with a timber school building to accommodate 60 pupils. By December of that year 103 boys and 85 girls were enrolled with, on average, 66 boys and 55 girls attending.Slaughter, Ithaca Creek State School 1884-1957, p. 7. The district continued to grow and in 1887 Ithaca Shire was formed from Ithaca Division. It comprised about one tenth of the former division (11.5 km2), included Paddington, Bardon and Red Hill, and had a population of about 10,000 residents.Ithaca and Ithaca Shire, Queensland Places' , accessed 21 Oct 2015. Further growth in the area took place, resulting in the creation of the Town of Ithaca, which replaced the shire in 1903. This development was promoted by the establishment of Brisbane's electric tram network after 1897, which extended from Roma Street to Enoggera Terrace, via Musgrave Road while a second route travelled along Caxton Street and Given Terrace. In 1925 the municipality of Ithaca was incorporated into Greater Brisbane. Ithaca Creek State School grew in synchrony with this development, but its grounds needed work. In 1926 a school committee formed to improve the school grounds to meet modern ideas and provide better equipment for sporting activities. It created a scheme for extension and improvement of the school grounds, which at the time were under and extremely rough, resulting in the children playing on the roadway in front of the school. The scheme embraced the extension of the school grounds, and the provision of septic tanks, swimming pool, gymnasium, library, tennis court, and basketball courts. The first step was the filling in of a gully in the grounds.'Ithaca Creek School Ground Improvements', The Telegraph, 20 May 1932, p. 7. Over the next six years, the committee provided over ¬£550 and the Government provided approximately ¬£410 for purchase of land. As a result, the grounds trebled in size to create a total area of approximately with purchase of land to the south and southeast of the school reserve creating access from Grace Street and Primrose Terrace.'Ithaca Creek School Grounds Improvements', The Telegraph, 20 May 1932, p. 7. In 1928 and 1929 respectively, Portion 138 (546sqm) and Portion 345A (3630m2) were added to the school reserve, increasing its size to 3 acres 3 roods and 21.1p (1.57 ha).[QGG, 1930, vol. 1, p. 352QGG, 1931, vol.1, p. 2460DNRM, Survey Plan SL1131.] The land purchases were Lot 1 RP46439 (446m2) in 1930 (to the east of the school reserve)Lot 3 RP49597 (8283m2) in 1932 (to the south of the land purchased in 1930) and Lot 2 RP46439 (1088m2) in 1934 (giving access to Primrose Street).[DNRM Titles: Certificate of Title No. 341674, 349527, 363979.] This expansion was achieved despite the onset of worldwide economic depression. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders and also embarked on an ambitious and important building programme using day labour and Queensland materials, to provide impetus to the economy.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp, 6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p. 2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work programme by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p. 5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p. 5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930', p. 15. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 58. In mid-1932 unemployed men working under the government's relief scheme were employed at Ithaca Creek State School levelling its newly-purchased grounds.'Ithaca Creek School Gounds Improvements', The Telegraph, 20 May 1932, p. 7. The Hon Richard Hill, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, told a gathering of parents in June 1932 that Department of Public Works' \\"expenditure on improvements to the school and its grounds, and expenditure under the intermittent relief scheme had totalled ¬£2121, from 1929 to 1932. In addition, ¬£800 had been approved for relief work at the school, and ¬£126 for the purchase of additional land, making a total of ¬£3047 for three years, or an average of ¬£1000 a year\\".¬£1000 a year spent School improvements', Sunday Mail, 5 Jun 1932, p. 19. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public works building programme designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building programme included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p. 8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p. 7'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p. 2. Many of the programmes have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland, including the construction of masonry brick school buildings across the state. Most were designed in a classical idiom as this projects the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. Ithaca Creek State School was one of the approximately 30 schools chosen for the addition of a brick school building to replace its earlier timber building. The construction of substantial brick school buildings (E/B1) in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation. The Department of Public Works and Department of Public Instruction were extremely enthusiastic about these Depression-era brick school buildings. They were considered monuments to progress embodying the most modern principles of the ideal education environment.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 60. Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah on the north but little concession was made for this and almost all Depression-era brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 59. Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were based on contemporary tastes and fashions, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; and Neo- classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, aesthetic treatment, and climatic- responsive features.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans. The Chief Architect during this period was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966), who was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department from 1910 to 1951, and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951.Ayr State High School School, QHR 601574. Other DPW architects involved in the design of Ithaca Creek State School were Nigel Laman Thomas and Harold James Parr.ePlan, DPW Drawing 15061684, \\"Ithaca Creek State School, rebuilding scheme\\", 1933. In 1934, stage one of Ithaca Creek State School's brick school building commenced with construction of the north, lateral wing, of the planned U-shaped building comprising a range and two wings, located on the original school reserve. Construction was carried out by the Inspectorial and Construction Branch of the DPW.'Public Works', The Courier-Mail, 8 Jun 1934, p. 20. The Department of Public Works Annual Report to 30 June 1934 reported the building as follows: > Ithaca Creek SS, Brisbane: Erection.

Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 7. The first section was occupied in October 1934 and the next two stages constructed in 1934‚Äì1935 (range) and 1935‚Äì1936 (southern wing); both works supervised by the Inspectorial and Construction Branch of the DPW.Slaughter, Ithaca Creek SS, p. 15'Public Works', The Courier-Mail, 6 Jul 1934, p. 4'State School Buildings Work Authorised', The Telegraph, 4 Apr 1935, p. 19. Concrete retaining walls to the north, south and east were built by the DPW in conjunction with this work.'Record Works Programme', The Courier-Mail, 20 Apr 1934, p. 21. A photograph dated 30 June 1935 shows the Depression-era brick school building, with the first two stages - the northern wing and range - completed, and a prominent roof fleche projecting from the centre of the range. Housing the main entrance to the building, a symmetrical, two-storeyed entrance bay projected west from the range, and featured a stepped parapet, and a pediment supported by large columns and pilasters. Pilasters on the elevation had simple, rendered capitals. Casement windows were located between pilasters in the western elevation of the range and in the entry bay, and had awning fanlights. Block A, 1946 With all three stages completed, the Depression-era brick school building (now called Block A) was officially opened on 21 March 1936 by the Minister for Public Instruction (Frank Cooper) who commented that:'New School for Ithaca Creek', The Courier-Mail. 23 May 1936, p. 19.

The school is accessed from Lugg Street, with additional entrances via Dacca and Grace Streets (north) and Primrose Terrace (east). The school comprises a complex of buildings and structures, the largest of which is a Depression-era brick school building (Block A; 1934‚Äì36), located in the northwestern corner of the site, addressing Lugg Street. Other important elements within the school grounds include various retaining walls (s and pre-1960), a parade ground to the east of Block A, two tennis courts and a tennis shed south of the Block A, a war memorial at the northern end of the Lugg Street entry garden, a WWII Honour Board in the entry foyer of Block A, and mature trees. = Depression-era brick school building (Block A; 1934-36) = Front view, Block A, 2015 Block A is a symmetrical, masonry structure of two storeys, with an undercroft level. A tall copper fleche projects above the tiled, hipped roof and houses the school bell. The building is U-shaped in plan, arranged around an eastern parade ground, and comprises: a range (1935) running north-south; with two lateral wings, the northern (1934) and southern (1936), running perpendicular on a west-east axis. The ends of the northern and southern wings project from the front elevation. Rear view of Block A from the parade ground, 2015 The building is elegantly composed with Classical detailing. Constructed from load-bearing face brick walls, it has rendered decorative elements on the ground and first floors, and rendered walls and piers that resemble channel- jointed ashlar to the undercroft level. Red-brown face brick walls in a stretcher bond are relieved with brown face brick pilasters in an English bond. The pilasters have simple, rendered capitals. A two-storey bay, projecting from the western side of the central range, frames the main entrance. It is topped by brick parapets - with the section over the central pediment being the tallest - and a large, rendered pediment. The pediment is supported by pilasters and two tall, painted concrete columns. It features the words \\"STATE SCHOOL\\" within its entablature and a rendered circle is set on face brick within the tympanum. The centred front door is framed by rendered detailing and has \\"ITHACA CREEK\\" written on the architrave. A stone, set within the wall north of the front door, commemorates the foundation date of the building, 19 May 1934, and the name of the person who laid the stone, Hon. FA Cooper (the then Secretary for Public Instruction). The interior layout of the building is symmetrical, with the northern and southern wings mirrored; and the ground floor layout approximately repeated on the first floor. The entrance bay comprises a ground floor foyer, centrally located between northern and southern office spaces, and two first floor offices. It is aligned with the range's central stair, which is flanked to the north and south by storage rooms and classrooms. The northern and southern wings have three large classrooms (formerly four) on the ground and first floors; terminated at the eastern end by storage rooms and enclosed stairs. The classrooms throughout the building retain bulkheads that indicate the original layout of dividing partitions. Most classrooms and offices have plaster walls, timber-framed floors covered in modern carpet, and flat sheeted ceilings with dark-stained timber battens. Skirtings are generally wide and plastered, and most rooms retain timber picture rails. Stairs are of painted concrete and have metal and timber balustrades. Corridors, along the western side of the range, and verandahs (now enclosed), along the parade ground sides of the northern and southern wings, provide access to the classrooms and offices. They have polished concrete floors and their plaster ceilings are flat, with those on the first floor featuring dark-stained timber battens. Verandahs have face brick balustrades, and early sinks are retained at their eastern ends. The undercroft level is accessed via the central stair and is largely open play-space. Toilets are located at the eastern ends of the northern and southern wings, a tuckshop (former woodwork-classroom) encloses the western end of the northern wing, and a storage room encloses the western end of the southern wing. The undercroft has a concrete slab floor. Timber framing is exposed in parts of the range's ceiling, and some early corrugated metal ceilings within the northern and southern wings are retained. The piers are stop-chamfered. Early timber joinery is retained throughout the building, including: tall casement windows (to the exterior); double-hung sash windows (to the verandahs); and panelled timber doors. A set of early timber folding doors is retained in a classroom on the ground floor of the northern wing, which is rare. Most windows and doors retain their awning fanlights and early window and door hardware. Modern aluminium windows (1979) enclosing the verandahs are not of cultural heritage significance. = Landscape Elements = Tennis shed, 2015 The school grounds are well established, with sporting facilities including a generous playing field (1932) at the southeastern end of the site, and two levelled tennis courts (1939, one recently resurfaced as a multi-purpose court) with a timber tennis shed (pre-1946) to the south of Block A. The tennis shed is located south of the western tennis court; and is lowset, sheltered by a corrugated metal-clad hip roof, and clad with a single- skin of timber weatherboards. It comprises a western store room and an open eastern space, separated by a panelled timber door, set within a timber wall, which is lined with wide timber boards above door head-height, and v-jointed (VJ) boards below door head-height. Metal hooks are retained at the door head height, and a timber seat is built into the southern wall of the eastern space. Window openings have corrugated metal-clad hoods with timber brackets. Many mature trees are located within the school grounds, including a large fig tree (Ficus sp.) southeast of the tennis courts. Retaining wall and stair between Block A and tennis courts, 2015 The sloping site is terraced by several Depression-era concrete retaining walls. These are located: * along the Lugg Street boundary * between Lugg Street and Block A * north, east and west of Block A (including underneath a 2009 two storey brick building) * at the northeastern end of the playing field (s) * in between the school buildings and playing field (pre-1960) Concrete stairs (s) between Block A and tennis courts provide access between the terraces. The terraced nature of the site provides opportunities for views of the surrounding area from within the school grounds and buildings. The parade ground (1934‚Äì1936) east of Block A allows significant views to be obtained of the building's eastern elevation (its recent surface of bitumen is not significant). An Honour Board (1947) is located in the foyer of Block A, listing the names of former students who served in World War II (WWII). Rats of Tobruk memorial, 2015 A painted concrete WWII memorial (erected after 1954) is located northwest of Block A and is dedicated to the Rats of Tobruk. It is of a stepped, art-deco design, with metal crosses fixed to the highest tier; and stands on a stepped plinth. The memorial displays the crest of the Rats of Tobruk Association, and a plaque with the words: \\"At the going down of the sun And in the morning We will remember them.\\" Note that the memorial and the words upon it are a replica; there are no burials on the school grounds. = Other Structures = Other buildings, structures, pathways, swimming pools, modern partitions, modern joinery, and sheds within the cultural heritage boundary are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Ithaca Creek State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Ithaca Creek State School (established 1885) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent example of a government designed Depression-era brick school building (1934‚Äì1936), which was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with retaining walls, sporting facilities and mature trees. The Depression-era brick school building and landscaping of the school grounds are the result of the State Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. A World War II (WWII) Honour Board (1947) located in the foyer of the Depression-era brick school building and a WWII Memorial commemorating the Rats of Tobruk (post-1954) sited in front of the school building are important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in WWII. War memorials, including honour boards, are a tribute to those who served, and those who died, from a particular community. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Ithaca Creek State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school. The school comprises a Depression-era brick school building constructed to a government design and a parade ground used as an assembly and play area. These elements are set within a generous, landscaped site that retains mature shade trees, Depression-era terraced retaining walls, and sporting facilities including a playing field and tennis courts with a tennis shed. The substantial Depression-era brick school building is a highly-intact, excellent example of its type and retains a high degree of integrity. The building demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type, including: its two-storey form, with an undercroft; symmetrical, high-quality design that features classical detailing; loadbearing face brick construction; hipped roof; and prominent and central roof fleche. The building has a linear layout, with rooms accessed by verandahs and corridors, and an undercroft used as an open play space. Typical of this building type, the Depression-era brick school building was located in a growing suburban area at the time of its construction. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its substantial size, high quality materials, face brick exterior, elegant formal composition and decorative treatment, the Depression-era brick school building at Ithaca Creek State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, which evoke the sense of progress and permanence that the Queensland Government sought to embody in new public buildings in that era. The building's assertive massing, classically-influenced design, and elegant composition contribute to its dignified streetscape presence, and contrast with the surrounding small-scale residences. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Ithaca Creek State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established in 1885 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of the community and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Her methods of motivating students of diverse ethnic backgrounds to higher achievement and social responsibility, including respect of self and others and skills of peaceful conflict resolution, won her the support of the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, Rosenberg Foundation, and the San Francisco Foundation, among others. Biography=Early life= Frances Sussna was born on October 23, 1933 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrant Joseph Sussna and his wife Ethel Stein. Sussna and her older sister were the only Jewish children in a strongly antisemitic neighborhood in North Philadelphia. Due to the absence of any Hebrew schools in the area, Sussna and her sister received no formal Jewish education. Sussna attended Olney High School in Philadelphia where she befriended future award-winning Yiddish poet, Rukhl Fishman, the sister of renowned linguist, Joshua Fishman. Sussna attended Temple University for a year and a half. In college, she held multiple jobs one of which was as a librarian in the English department at Gratz College. At the Jewish college, she was exposed to books and resources about the Jewish experience. She read books about The Holocaust, the State of Israel, and on kibbutz movement. Sussna's time working at Gratz College and a fateful conversation with her friend Rukhl, influenced Sussna's decision to leave Temple University and go to Israel. =Israel= Arriving in Haifa in 1953, Sussna decided to join a group of Jewish teenagers from South America to create a kibbutz and military outpost along the Jordanian border. Sussna lived on other kibbutzim and later lived in Jerusalem where she worked as an editor for The Jerusalem Post. =Brandeis= In 1960, Sussna accepted positions on the faculties of San Francisco‚Äôs College of Jewish Studies and Hebrew High School. She became convinced that the answer to adequate Jewish education for children was a Jewish day school. She recruited a prominent local Jewish leader, Rabbi Saul White, to help her raise funds to start one. On September 4, 1963, the Modern Hebrew Day School opened its doors with Sussna as its Founder and Director, and with Rabbi White as an important member of the Board of Trustees. A few months after its opening, the school changed its name to Brandeis Day School. Sussna chose the name \\"Brandeis\\" as a nod to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and as a nod to the Brandies University graduate fellowship she had passed up in order to sustain the school. The school was an immediate success with high student satisfaction and achievement. The Ford Foundation awarded her a prestigious grant. Sussna was concerned that the needs of non-Jewish students at the school were not being fully met. She proposed a modification of the school's structure so that while Jewish students had Jewish studies, the other children would be similarly immersed in their own separate cultural studies. Once a week each group would be host or guest of another group to share with them what they learned and to practice good inter-group communication. Her proposal was approved by the Board of Directors, the staff, and the Parent Council, however, the Bureau of Jewish Education strongly opposed it. Sussna formed a Multi-Culture advisory council to Brandeis consisting of prominent leaders of various San Francisco ethnic groups. =Multi-Culture Institute= The Bureau's obstruction of efforts to establish the Multi-Culture Program at Brandies, convinced Sussna in March of 1967 to leave Brandeis to start the program as a new endeavor. The Multi- Culture Institute, as it became known, received seed money from the Rosenberg Foundation and the San Francisco Foundation and eventually received large grants from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Lilly Endowment among others. The school separated students for part of the day by ethnic group to enable them to talk among themselves about themselves with teachers of their own ethnic background. Students were taught the language, literature, history, geography, music, fine arts, and folklore of their own ethnic heritages. On Friday, groups would teach other groups about their own cultural backgrounds in a \\"children teaching children\\" format. Students developed self-love, pride in heritage, and appreciation and understanding of the heritage of others. Sussna's teaching methods were praised by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the National Urban League, the NAACP, the Human Rights Council, the American Jewish Committee, the National Education Association, and more. Public school districts including New York City, Seattle, and Los Angeles established model programs of the Multi-Culture Institute. Selected parents, teachers, and administrators from public and parochial schools in those cities participated in summer trainings of the Sussna Teaching Method at San Francisco State University. Staff from the Multi-Culture Program in San Francisco worked with and supported them throughout the school year. =Frances Sussna Projects= In 2017, Sussna started the Frances Sussna Projects to introduce schools to her Sussna Teaching Method. Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions In 1963, Sussna received a Bachelor's Degree in Near Eastern Languages from the University of California, Berkeley. Sussna served on the faculties of the College of Jewish Studies and the Teachers Institute of San Francisco. She also served as a consultant to several educational and governmental organizations, including Columbia University and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1969, Sussna was appointed \\"Expert Consultant\\" to the United States Office of Education. In 1970, she was invited to participate in the White House Conference on Children and also gave expert testimony before Congress on Title IX legislation. She was invited to advise members of Congress on The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). In 1971, Sussna received a Doctorate of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa, from the University of San Francisco. She was the youngest person and the first woman to receive that degree from this University. That year, Sussna delivered the major address at the National Education Association's Conference on Civil and Human Rights in Education. The association unanimously passed a resolution to establish mechanisms to implement Sussna Teaching Methods in all public schools across the country. In 1972, Sussna served as an ‚ÄúExpert Specialist‚Äù on the panel of the National Center for Education Research and Development where she evaluated the work of multiple United States National Educational Laboratories and Research Centers and recommended funding levels for those laboratories and centers. She was the only woman on the nine-member panel. In 1973, Sussna spent a month as a ‚ÄúScholar-in-Residence‚Äù at the Rockefeller Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, Italy. The Bellagio Center Residency Program gives prominent individuals in various fields the ability to spend weeks at the Villa to peacefully contemplate their work. Between 1973 and 1974 the Ford Foundation sponsored Sussna‚Äôs travel abroad to investigate the potential of introducing her program to other countries.

Writing for Destructoid, Kevin McClusky gave a positive review of the Nintendo Switch version of the game, saying that while the single player mode is enjoyable, it was \\"much more fun\\" to \\"give the second controller to another player and shout advice at one another as you try to work your way through the maze.\\" McClusky also complimented the level design, calling the levels \\"clean and easy to read\\" and while he noticed some lag while the game was in fullscreen mode calling it \\"annoying\\" he mentioned it never affected the gameplay and was hopeful that it would be addressed in a future software update. In his positive review Nintendo Life reviewer Matthew Mason gave the game 8/10 stars calling it \\"Great\\". He said that while it was \\"cooperative at its core\\" it was \\"imminently [sic] playable as a solo experience\\" and that he found sitting next to someone watching them play it to be a pleasurable experience. The game was nominated for \\"Australian Developed Game of the Year\\" at the Australian Games Awards.

Biography An only child of a single mother, Nona Fern√°ndez grew up in a Matta Avenue neighborhood close to the market Persa B√≠ob√≠o. There she had her first job, selling second-hand clothes. Even though her name is the same as her mother's, Patricia Paola, everyone calls her Nona, the name by which she also signs her works. When she was in her first steps, she used to talk little, hardly anything. \\"All she could say was the monosyllable, sharp, 'no'. Turning this negative into her child's pet word, earning her peculiar nickname Nonito among her family. When she got older, the nickname became Nona. She attended Santa Cruz School in Santiago and later the Catholic University Theater School. Later, as an actress, she founded the company Merri Melodys, participated in productions of many theatrical works, and won a competition of the Centro Chileno-Norteamericano de Cultura as the best actress. In 1995, she participated in a workshop given by Antonio Sk√°rmeta, the same year she won the Gabriela Mistral Literary Games. Her stories were first published in various anthologies of contests, and her first book of short stories, El Cielo, was published in 2000. Her award-winning novel Mapocho was published two years later. Regarding the genesis of that first novel, she states: Fern√°ndez has been included by some critics in the so- called Literatura de los hijos. Her husband, Dante's father, is the writer and theatre director Marcelo Leonart, whom she met when they were both studying at the Theatre School. Together they run the company La Fusa. Nona describes herself with these words: \\"Actress for fun. Narrator for being a nuisance, trying not to forget what should not be forgotten. Scriptwriter for soap operas because of necessity. An uncomfortable Chilean, and sometimes rabid\\". Plaza de Armas, 2013 Her work as a screenwriter for TV series is for Nona Fern√°ndez only a way to make a living. On TVN, she has become the scriptwriter for El laberinto de Alicia. Also, she contributes to the series Los archivos del cardenal, based on the cases defended by the Vicariate of Solidarity during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. She also co-wrote 's film 199 recetas para ser feliz (199 Tips to be Happy) and the documentary La ciudad de los fot√≥grafos (City of Photographers) by Sebasti√°n Moreno. She was selected in 2011 along with two other Chileans: Diego Mu√±oz Valenzuela and as one of the \\"25 literary treasures waiting to be discovered\\", writers \\"whose talent has been consolidated in their countries, but who are still not well known outside them\\", by the Guadalajara International Book Fair in celebration of its 25 years of existence. She made her debut as a playwright in 2012, with El taller, a play inspired by Mariana Callejas' literary workshop at her home in Lo Curro, while her husband Michael Townley directed the underground operations of a DINA headquarters. This black comedy performed by Leonart and Fern√°ndez's company, La Fusa, premiered in April at the Santiago theater Lastarria 90 and re-shown in August at the Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral. It won the Premio Altazor 2013 in the Theater art category. Her second piece, Liceo de ni√±as, premiered in 2015 (with this, the company led by Nona and Leonart is now called Pieza Oscura); it is \\"a fantastic comedy about an overwhelmed science teacher who discovers in his school's laboratory three students who have been hidden since a 1985 taking.\\" Works Greetings from the actors at the end of the Liceo de ni√±as piece (Fern√°ndez is seated left), 9 December 2015 =Novels= * 2002: Mapocho, Planeta A novel that portray, through different symbols and metaphors, Chile‚Äôs biography and the role of the Official History as a speech of power on the structuring of an identity at least questionable * 2007: Av. 10 de Julio Huamachuco, Uqbar Work that represent classic children‚Äôs fears that most of the time cross the time barrier and continues tormenting until adulthood * 2012: Fuenzalida, Mondadori, Santiago Nona Fern√°ndez lead us by the hand through a maze of unbelievable stories that weave together and appears to be telling the reader that is impossible to close the eyes before memories, be them personal or collective * 2013: Space invaders, Alquimia, Santiago.

The team played in the Rugby Super League in the 2011 season, but then folded in 2012.  History  The Utah Rugby Union made a formal request to join the Rugby Super League in 2010 and was accepted into the national competition for the 2011 season. The Utah Warriors team was formed mainly from rugby players within the state of Utah, but also attracted marquee signings such as US national players Mike Palefau and Jason Pye. The Warriors had an active roster of more than 35 players. Utah entrepreneur Sean Whalen oversaw the team's operations and Jon Law was the head coach.

Biography Novack was born to a Jewish family, the son of Sadie and Hyman Novick. He has three older siblings: Miriam (born 1903), Joseph (born 1904), and Lillian (born 1905). His father was an immigrant from Russia who worked as a clothing cutter before opening his own clothing store; after the store failed, the family moved to the Catskill Mountains where he operated a hotel in the Borscht Belt. After his father's death, he operated the hotel with his brother but disagreements led him to move to New York City where he Americanized his name to Novack and ran a haberdashery; the store also failed after he had a falling out with his partner. In 1940, Novack and his wife moved to Miami Beach with $1,800 they had from liquidating his clothing stores assets. At the time, Miami Beach was thriving despite the Great Depression thanks to it having become the winter playground of the rich. He raised additional funds and purchased the 111-room Monroe Towers Hotel which turned into a lucrative investment once World War II started and the U.S. government used Miami as a training ground for 100,000 soldiers that required basic living space. With his earnings, he bought out his partners and went on to purchase four more hotels including the Cornell and the Atlantis. In 1949, he partnered with Harry Mufson and opened the Sans Souci Hotel designed by Morris Lapidus. In 1952, Novack and Mufson purchased the Harvey Firestone mansion for $2.3 million; the partnership soon collapsed after Novack deceived Mufson and set about to have himself as the sole owner on the deed. Novack raised additional funds from a diverse range of investors including mobsters Sam Giancana and Joseph Fischetti; he again used Morris Lapidus as the architect. In 1954, the 1,250-room Fontainebleau Miami Beach Hotel opened. Steve Wynn (who would marry Novack's great-niece) commented that the Fontainebleau created the concept of the hotel as a show. His estranged partner, Mufson, would go on to build the Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel immediately to the north of the Fontainebleau also using Lapidus as architect. In 1977, the Fontainebleau filed for Federal bankruptcy protection. In 1978, Stephen Muss bought the Fontainebleau for $27 million.South Florida Business Journal: \\"Born to build - Muss, Soffer progeny develop joint project : Fontainebleau II\\" by Stephen Van Drake March 11, 2002We Are Many: Reflections On American Jewish History And Identity By Edward S Shapiro retrieved April 13, 2013 Fool's Paradise: Players, Poseurs, and the Culture of Excess in South Beach By Steven Gaines pages 100 -110 In 2005, Muss sold the Fontainebleau to Donald Soffer's, Turnberry AssociatesSun-Sentinel: \\"Turnberry Buys Fontainebleau - $150 Million Targeted For Upgrades\\" by Tom Stieghorst January 21, 2005 for $165 million.

In 1956, Bernice had a son, Ben Novack Jr. Novack died of heart and lung failure on April 6, 1985. His great-niece, Andrea Hissom, is married to Steve Wynn.

Passengers at the airport in Zhengzhou, capital of the Chinese province of Henan, angry over lengthy delays due to snowy weather, smashed computers at airline check-in counters and destroyed information kiosks. It has been estimated that as many as 2,000 people took part over two days before police were able to restore order. Some of the angry passengers had been waiting for as long as five days to catch flights back to their jobs in other cities after their annual trips to see family during the Chinese New Year holiday period. They were further frustrated by the lack of information from airline and airport staff while they waited. The mass incident highlighted the difficulties faced by China's commercial airline industry as more and more passengers choose to fly to their destinations; the airlines blamed the disorder on passengers' limited understanding of the nature of commercial aviation. After the riot, police did not report making any arrests, which outraged some commentators on Chinese social media. However, most of the public sympathized with their underlying complaints. In the years since, Chinese authorities have moved to open up more of the country's airspace, largely under military control, to commercial flights. Background With the industrialization and urbanization of China following its late 20th-century economic reforms, many younger workers left their homes in rural areas to work in growing cities. They are able to return usually only once a year, during the New Year in February. The 3.6 billion individual trips this involves over a 40-day period has been described as the world's largest annual migration. In the 1990s, when this demographic shift began, most of those workers traveled by train, putting great strain on the country's rail network. Overcrowding and long travel times led some travellers to take to the air as an alternative, especially as the country's three major state-owned airlines continued to grow, despite the military limiting civil aviation to less than 30% of the country's airspace. This problem has been compounded on occasion when the People's Liberation Army Air Force has ordered traffic reductions at major airports to free up airspace for training missions. Smog around airports also causes delays. By 2013 FlightStats ranked several Chinese airports among its 20 worst in terms of on-time flight departures. Combined with unrealistic expectations by many newer Chinese flyers from the days when air travel was seen as luxury available only to a few, air rage incidents began occurring in the 2010s. Most of the reported air rage incidents involved a single passenger, or small groups, such as the case of Yan Linkun, a Communist Party official in Yunnan stripped of his position and sent to prison after a widely publicized incident, caught on video, where he smashed a gate agent's laptop in 2013. However some turned into mass incidents involving larger groups of what began being called the \\"air rage tribe\\". In summer 2013, 30 Nanchang Changbei International Airport passengers angry about a seven-hour weather delay pushed past security and occupied the runway. Airports began avoiding announcing flight delays except when there was a \\"major event\\" affecting multiple flights. Riot Heavy snowfall in central eastern China during the first week of February 2014 caused severe disruptions to intercity transportation during the busiest week of that year's New Year. Airports all over the country were plagued by delays, and even rail was affected, with trains limited to slower speeds due to the weather. By Wednesday, 5 February, Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, where many of those who worked elsewhere in the country had returned to visit their families for the holiday, was experiencing intermittent delays. In the late afternoon, the continuing snow eventually turned those intermittent delays into a complete closing of the airport. Passengers continued to arrive, however. With the available seats in departure lounges long since filled, many sat and slept on their luggage, eating instant noodles they had prepared themselves as meals. Eventually it was believed that as many as 2,000 passengers were in the terminal building. Airline representatives claimed later that they had offered the stranded passengers tea, and attempted to find what overnight accommodations they could in the city that night for them. But for many passengers that was too little. Around 9 p.m. that night two incidents reportedly occurred. One passenger reportedly destroyed a China Southern Airlines information office. Another entered the airport's control room and struck Hu Xiaoyu, a staffer, then poured her drink over Hu. The woman threatened to post photos of the aftermath online, Hu said. That break in decorum and order kicked off further violence the next day. There were reports that passengers had attacked check-in areas, assaulted staff before they could get away, smashed computers and generally otherwise vandalized the airline areas. Sina Weibo and other Chinese microblogging sites posted pictures of the damage to the terminal. While airport management denied the reports, businessman Chen Yunxian, on the Internet, likened the airport to a refugee camp. \\"No one is telling people what they should do, and some started to riot and smash things.\\" alt=Four monitors with information on the departures of flights displayed in different colors of text on backgrounds of varying shades of blue. Three are in Chinese and one is in English. At the top is an icon with an airliner taking off and, in yellow, the words \\"Departure Information\\" in English and Chinese next to it. In the upper right is the time, 23:23, in white digital letters Other stranded passengers recalled seeing water bottles thrown at flight information display boards. One said a thrower said \\"Down with China Eastern!\\" as he did. According to People's Daily, the captain of the local police station warned the airlines that if they continued to provide no information to travellers via the display boards, there would be violence. Passengers who did not damage property nevertheless occupied gate areas and demanded their money back. Staff, many of whom had been working for over 24 hours with almost no breaks, barricaded themselves in offices for their own safety. \\"I've been wronged as well\\" Xiaoyu, the assault victim, told a local newspaper, explaining that delays meant she had to stay at work. \\"We can do nothing about the weather.\\" While the stranded passengers understood that the weather was beyond anyone's control, they nevertheless blamed the airport and airlines for failing to keep them informed of any changes. Communications technology, which might have helped fill the information vacuum, instead contributed to the confusion. The airport's wireless network was overwhelmed by passengers trying to access the Internet through their phones; likewise calls to the airport's hotline met with only a busy signal and the airport website crashed. Travellers also complained that whatever airport staff they could find not only knew nothing but responded to queries with indifference or even hostility. Some staff complained that the passengers' behavior was preventing them from doing what they could to alleviate the situation. A China Southern employee said that passengers whom she had gotten on later flights after the ones they had originally booked were cancelled failed to show up when boarding was called for their new flights. Due to the snow and the violence, the airport closed again on the afternoon of 6 February. Later that evening, 160 armed police officers arrived and restored order, per the emergency plan staff were finally able to implement. The next morning the weather broke and the airport was able to reopen. Extra staff arrived to work the check-in counters; still, the airport was twice as busy as normal for that period, with 647 flights carrying the stranded passengers back to the cities where they worked. Aftermath Police did not report any arrests or criminal charges resulting from the riots , leaving some Chinese microbloggers in disbelief despite general public sympathy for the stranded flyers. \\"Are you allowed to vandalize an airport just because your plane is delayed?\\" one asked. \\"Why didn't the police take action?\\" Another said that passengers who had assaulted staff needed to be \\"locked away ... Where were the police?\\" Other commentators noted that the riot highlighted the disparity between the many new airports China had built in the two decades prior and the still poor levels of customer service in the country's airline industry. \\"Zhengzhou Airport is better than the airports in many European and American cities\\" said Chen, the businessman who had witnessed the riot, \\"but the management level and passenger quality obviously remain at the level of Africa.\\" People's Daily, the newspaper of the Communist Party, similarly criticized the airlines for not keeping up with the country's air transport infrastructure. \\"Timely flight departures, user-friendly customer service ... in fact, the requirements of air travelers are not high\\" it observed. \\" But why can airlines and airports not meet these basic requirements?\\" Over a year after the riot, Jamie Kenny, foreign correspondent for Abu Dhabi's The National, wrote that it followed the patterns of many other such \\"mass incidents\\", as Chinese authorities refer to occasions when citizens, angry about violations of their rights or official inattention to their concerns, gather together in large groups to protest, often destructive. \\"In China, people who go through the established means of grievance resolution may find themselves beaten up by hired thugs, kidnapped by 'interceptors' sent by local authorities on their way to petition in Beijing or incarcerated in illicit 'black jails'\\" he wrote. \\"On the other hand, if you gather thousands of people, assemble outside the local government and start burning police cars‚Äîthen you get a respectful hearing.\\" In a 2016 story that described the quality of Chinese domestic air travel as still low, with many of the country's major airports still reporting minimal improvements, if any, in on- time departure rates, the BBC's Capital noted that the airline industry was beginning to make some progress in working with the military to open up more airspace to commercial flights. In 2015 the joint commission of China's Central Military Commission and the State Council had agreed to increase the amount of airspace open to civil aviation to 33%, with varying conditions, below in altitude. While this move will not affect intercity air travel, instead opening up space for helicopter tours and emergency services, the long-term plan is to extend this opening to airspace below , roughly similar to the U.S. See also * 2014 in aviation * 2014 in China * List of air rage incidents * List of riots NotesReferences Riots and civil disorder in China 2014 in China 2014 riots February 2014 events in Asia Zhengzhou ","title":"Zhengzhou Airport riot"},{"id":"56427707","text":"Dirt Candy is a vegetarian restaurant in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Chef and owner Amanda Cohen opened the restaurant in a small East Village space in 2008, and moved to its present location in 2015. It has received critical attention for its creative dishes which often focus on a single vegetable.  History  Amanda Cohen first opened Dirt Candy in Manhattan's East Village, with a small 18-seat space on East 9th Street, in October 2008. The name is based on Cohen's view that vegetables are \\"candy from the earth\\". Cohen is not a vegetarian, but loves vegetables and has a negative opinion of most other vegetarian restaurants for their lack of creativity and politicization of the food. In 2015, the restaurant moved to a larger space on Allen Street in the Lower East Side. With the new location, the menu expanded, a bar was added, and Cohen began a policy of no tipping, instead adding 20% surcharge to every check and paying employees a fair living wage. The restaurant disposed of its a la carte menu in August 2017, instead operating with only a two-tiered tasting menu. Cohen said it was because she wanted the dining experience to be a special occasion. Reception Portobello mousse Popcorn pudding Dirt Candy has attracted critical attention for the quality, creativity, and presentation of its food. The New York Times described Cohen as \\"waging war on the 'eat your vegetables' mind-set\\" with \\"vegetable cookery that is original, clever, visually arresting and, above all, a lot of fun to eat.\\" Several reviewers have commented on the name. In one of the earliest reviews, The New Yorkers Kate Julian wrote that, in contrast to the earthy-sounding name, the food and decor \\"evoke some utopian future where the people have renounced not just meat but also soil, in favor of brightly colored, hydroponically grown produce.\\" The New York Times wrote a mostly positive write-up a few months after it opened, praising the food as \\"artfully composed\\" but criticizing its lighting. Its longer review in 2012 gave it two stars (\\"very good\\"). It has appeared on several publications' lists of best restaurants in the city. New York Magazine ranked it top restaurant in the Lower East Side in 2018, calling its food \\"careful, complex, and delicious, but not overly science-y\\". Dirt Candy has also received some attention for Cohen's outspokenness on food and restaurant industry issues. She has advocated for greater coverage of women chefs, notably writing a critical response to Time magazine's \\"The Gods of Food\\" feature, which included in its list of \\"gods\\" only male chefs. In the blog that she kept from the restaurant's opening in 2008 until 2014, she frequently responded to reviews, offering rebuttals and counter-criticism. For example, she took issue with an early, mostly positive write-up in The New York Times, in particular objecting to its negative description of the lighting, the conduct of its photographer, and for generally reviewing restaurants too soon after opening. Cookbook In 2012, Cohen worked with her husband, writer Grady Hendrix, and artist Ryan Dunlavey to publish Dirt Candy: A Cookbook. Pete Wells noted Cohen's consistent use of humor in his New York Times review, in her interviews, through her blog, and visible in her professional work such that a \\"cookbook in comic-book form [seems] not just sensible but inevitable.\\" Emily Weinstein of The New York Times Diner's Journal wrote that the book is \\"not a straight cookbook, nor is it a memoir. Instead, it's a transparent, sometimes triumphant, more often self-deprecating look at how the restaurant runs, including the agony of working with contractors to build the 350-square-foot [East Village] space and why a salad is $14.\\" ReferencesExternal links The Art of Plating, a New York Times video about Cohen's presentation strategy Vegetarian restaurants in the United States Restaurants in Manhattan 2008 establishments in New York City Lower East Side Restaurants established in 2008 ","title":"Dirt Candy"},{"id":"56427712","text":"Dicercina is a subtribe of metallic wood-boring beetles in the family Buprestidae.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to fifteen small, yellowish green flowers with a reddish labellum. The flowers do not open widely and are self- pollinating. It grows in heath and shallow moss gardens on rock ledges from the Blue Mountains to Nerriga. Description Genoplesium apostasioides is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between three and fifteen yellowish-green flowers are widely spaced along a flowering stem tall and much taller than the leaf. The flowers are long and open erratically, or do not open at all and are self-pollinating. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg- shaped, about long and wide with hairy edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, more or less parallel to each other and sometimes have a gland on the tip. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long, wide with hairy edges and a sharply pointed tip. The labellum is reddish, about long, wide, with hairy edges and a sharply pointed tip. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from December to April. Taxonomy and naming The freak midge orchid was first formally described in 1888 by Robert D. FitzGerald who gave it the name Corunastylis apostasioides from a specimen collected near Berrima, and published the description in his book Australian Orchids. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Alwin Clements changed the name to Genoplesium apostasioides. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium apostasioides grows in forest and in moss gardens on rock shelves, on the tablelands between the Blue Mountains and Nerriga.

McNeil (born June 17, 1977) is an American chemist who currently works at the University of Michigan, where she holds the position of Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Chemistry and Macromolecular Science and Engineering. In 2017, McNeil was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Biography McNeil is from Buffalo, New York. She graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1999 with a bachelors of science in Chemistry. Her graduate work was with Dave Collum at Cornell University, studying the aggregation kinetics and chemistry of lithium amides and lithium enolates. After earning her PhD in Chemistry in 2005, McNeil was a post-doc with Timothy M. Swager at MIT from 2005-2007, studying conjugated polymers. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 2007 as an assistant professor of Chemistry and Macromolecular Science and Engineering. She became an Arthur F. Thurnau professor in September 2013, and a professor for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2014. Scientific career McNeil's lab at the University of Michigan is known for providing mechanistic understanding to the catalyst transfer polymerization process, helping to show that the likely intermediate is a catalyst-polymer œÄ-complex, but the lab has a diverse focus. For her work on conjugated polymers, there has been considerable focus on expanding the use of catalyst transfer polymerization to make polymers of novel or hard-to-reach architectures (such as conjugated gradient copolymers or insulating-conducting block copolymers) and for studying the properties of new conjugated polymers or new blends of known polymers in solar cells to improve their performance. Another focus has been on molecular gelation; McNeil has published molecular gels as sensors of many harmful or hard to detect compounds. This is with the underlying assumption that it is easier to determine if a gel has formed (since it will go from a flowing solution to a gel that resists flow) rather than alternatives, such as if a solution has changed color (hard to tell if the analyte is strongly colored). McNeil's lab has produced gel-based sensors for mercury ions, nitrite ions, explosives, enzymes, and lead ions, which gel when the analyte is present. Many of the gels outperform current sensors for the same materials in sensitivity and in accuracy. Awards McNeil was one of the first class of Beckman Scholars, receiving an award from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation in 1998. McNeil was also selected for a Beckman Young Investigators Award in 2009.

She is a set theorist, a historian of mathematical logic, and a professor at the University of Florida. She was the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics from Dartmouth College, and is known for her research in infinitary combinatorics and the theory of linear spaces. Career Larson was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a minor in English. As an undergraduate, she had planned to go into teaching, but a mentor at Berkeley, logician John W. Addison Jr., recognized her talent for mathematics and encouraged her to go on to graduate study. She earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of James Earl Baumgartner at Dartmouth College in 1972, becoming the first woman to obtain a mathematics PhD there. Larson became an E. R. Hedrick Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1972 to 1974. She has been affiliated with the University of Florida since 1974, where she was promoted to full professor in 1987 and served as Associate Chair for Graduate Studies from 1993 to 1996. In 2002 Larson became chair of the faculty senate at the University of Florida. She credits her Quaker religious practice for making her a good listener and a \\"consensus builder\\", two qualities she sees as important in campus leadership. Research Much of Larson's research is in infinitary combinatorics, studying versions of Ramsey's theorem for infinite sets. Her doctoral dissertation, On Some Arrow Relations, was in this subject. She has been called a \\"prominent figure in the field of partition relations\\", particularly for her \\"expertise in relations for countable ordinals\\". Five of her publications are with Paul Erd≈ës, who became her most frequent collaborator.Larson's author profile on MathSciNet, accessed 2018-02-10. Erd≈ës, another prominent combinatorialist, visited Larson and others at the University of Florida for two weeks per year every year from 1973 to 1996. In the theory of linear spaces, the Drake‚ÄìLarson linear spaces are named after Larson and her co-author and University of Florida colleague David A. Drake. These are linear spaces (finite systems of points and lines, with at least two points on every line, a line through every two points, and not all points on a single line) such that none of the lines have exactly two, three, or six points. When such a space exists, it can be used to construct certain kinds of Latin squares. In a 1983 paper, Drake and Larson determined the possible numbers of points in these spaces, with one exception, the spaces with exactly thirty points. This case was an open problem for many years, until it was resolved in 2010 by Betten and Betten.

Test Book level 1. The Kent Mathematics Project (K.M.P.) was an educational system for teaching mathematics to 9-16 year olds. The system comprised task worksheets, booklets, audio compact cassettes and tests. Through the 1970s and 1980s, it was widely adopted in Kent schools, as well as being exported internationally. The system was based on the idea that: K.M.P. providing materials and structure for non-specialist teachers to teach math classes while sharing the effort required in producing suitable teaching material. History Started in 1966, the project originated at Ridgewaye School, Southborough, Tonbridge Wells which closed its doors in 1991. K.M.P went through several titles including \\"An Auto-Instructional Course in Mathematics\\" and \\"The Ridgewaye Individualized Course\\". The system was inspired by the self-directed learning of the Dalton Plan while attempting to avoid its pitfalls. K.M.P was gradually extended over time, involving trials at a number of schools before being more widely distributed. K.M.P. was adopted by the education authority in 1970 and used in over seventy schools around Kent. In 1988, the project's director objected to the National Curriculum which emphasised goals to be achieved by particular ages. Usage To teach a specific concept, the teacher selected a set of twelve tasks called a \\"matrix\\" from a material bank for the pupil to complete. The teacher was expected to be available to mentor pupils if they encountered difficulty. The tasks were completed in any order, then self-corrected by the pupil and checked by the teacher. When the entire task matrix is completed, the pupil performed a test to check their understanding. The tests results were then used by the teacher to construct the next task matrix. This allowed children to progress at their own rate, either ahead or behind the rest of the class, while allowing the teacher to customize the course to the pupil's needs. Tasks were assigned a level of 1 to 9, depending on their difficulty. The difficulty of tasks assigned was based on the child's ability, rather than their age. KMP materials were published by Ward Lock & Co. Impact Ideas from K.M.P. were adopted in later teaching tools, including Graded Assessment in Mathematics (GAIM) and Secondary Mathematics Individualised Learning Experiment (SMILE).

Local law inspired by Muslim law and African and Malagasy customs applies only to those Mahorais who have retained their personal status, as permitted by article 75 of the Constitution. The law of July 11, 2001 relating to Mayotte maintains the existence of this civil status under local law and specifies the possibilities for renouncing it in favor of the civil status under common law. Despite the strong presence of Islam, the Mahorese culture is imbued with animism and mystical rituals are still widely practiced, especially among the community of Malagasy origin.  Sport  Music  Cuisine  * Mataba : is made from cassava bredes (leaves) simmered in coconut milk. It is most often used for the evening meal. The preparation is long because of the need to pound the br√®des with a mortar and pestle. This dish is therefore generally used during ceremonies, but rarely on the daily menu. It looks like our creamed spinach, but more digestible. * Chahoula ya nadzi: is rice boiled in water or coconut milk. A real basic dish, it is generally served for large meals, to feed the many children or during festive meals. In the latter case, curdled milk is added to the rice. It is an absolutely compulsory dish during ceremonies such as circumcision, debbah, maoulida, the Grand Marriage and mourning in the village. Such a ceremony without this dish cannot exist. The village elders would not participate in the party which would then be totally missed. * Kangu√©: is a dish made from beef boiled until all the cooking water is used up. The name means that the meat was cooked by broth. * Batabata: These are green bananas or cassava, breadfruit boiled in oil. Green bananas are used here as vegetables. There are more than thirty different bananas on the island, including ten bananas to cook. Not to be confused with bananas, a fruit that is little used in the Mahorese diet, except by children, M'zungus or Mahorais, between meals, never during. * The mtsolola. It is prepared from green bananas cut into squares, that is to say, split in half lengthwise and crosswise. Then mixed with meat or fried fish, they simmer in the pot with the usual accompaniments such as lemon, tomato and salt. * Pilao : is a rice-based party dish in which we find diced meat and many spices such as cardamom, cloves, pepper, cinnamon, etc. A \\"luxury\\" dish, it is sometimes served in some local restaurants and is sufficient on its own. It is in a way the Mahorese paella. * Romazava: national dish of Madagascar, it is also cooked in Mayotte. It is a meat broth in which Mafanes br√®des have simmered which give the sensation of anesthesia or freshness to the tongue. Mancarara is a festive cake that is prepared for ceremonies, a cookie made from flour and coconut milk. The dough obtained is spread out then cooked on a pan in hot oil, having taken care to fold the dough to make numerous beads. * Chari : is a mixture of tomatoes or green papaya with tamarind, cooked with onions, pepper and cumin. * The kakamkou : is a soup made from fish, tomatoes, lemon, chili. * Restaurants : There are many restaurants serving French cuisine or Indian Ocean influences in Mayotte. They function thanks to tourism and especially to the presence of many metropolitan officials. Numerous in Petite-Terre and Mamoudzou, they are less and less as one moves away from the city. In general, the big hotels often also have the best tables. Street food, fast food. In Mayotte, they are called mamas brochettis. These mamas serve you, on every street corner in the villages, delicious zebu skewers grilled on site, accompanied by fried bananas and cassava. They are unfortunately suspended with the departmentalization which would impose health standards condemning them. In the winter season, they will offer you grilled corn. In bakeries, there are inexpensive sandwiches and ham and butter. On Mamoudzou- Petite-Terre, there are snack shops and pizzerias. * Picnic : Do not miss! The picnic on the beach (desired) is an excellent opportunity both to meet the local population and to taste good kebabs or grilled fish. In Mayotte, some service providers can organize your picnic for the day, during sea trips or hikes in Salizy. * Drinks : Alcohol is not prohibited anywhere. Only drunkenness in public is not recommended. Moderation is generally the most common behavior. Intoxication can create a scene, but locals are not used to minding other people's business.

Directed by Onat Diaz, Lino S. Cayetano, Jojo A. Saguin, Trina N. Dayrit, Jerome C. Pobocan, and Jon S. Villarin, the series stars Julia Montes as Ana Dimasalang, a paramedic who became Gael's nurse after saving him in an accident. She becomes entwined in an assassination plot arranged by the del Mundos and Ojedas upon witnessing their plan. The show features an ensemble cast consisting of Shaina Magdayao, Paulo Avelino, Aljur Abrenica, Lorna Tolentino, Agot Isidro, Nonie Buencamino, and Cherry Pie Picache.  Plot  The fictional series begins in 1999 when two children, sisters Juliana (Julia Montes) and Katrina Ramirez (Shaina Magdayao), who are separated after a tragic fire that kills their parents. Before her father perishes, he entrusts a book to Katrina but does not tell her that it contains crucial evidence that explains his death. The siblings become orphans and Katrina blames Juliana for their parents' death. Following the tragedy, Juliana is adopted by the hardworking and loving Dimasalang family and changes her name to Ana Dimasalang, while Katrina is adopted by the wealthy and powerful Del Mundo family and changes her name to Samantha Del Mundo. It is 2015 and Ana Dimasalang is an EMT while Samantha del Mundo is a successful jeweler. The two siblings meet again but are not aware that they are related. Ana is in love with Gael Ojeda (Paulo Avelino), a successful lawyer and budding politician, who is also Samantha's childhood best friend and ex-boyfriend. His mother is Miranda Ojeda (Lorna Tolentino), Senator Del Mundo's Political Strategist and Gael's godfather. The del Mundo and Ojeda family are very close and do not approve of Ana, not only because of the difference in their socio economic background but because they have plans for Samantha and Gael to reunite and build a political dynasty. Samantha is still in love with Gael and wants him back but Gael is deeply in love with Ana and is ready to give up everything just to be with Ana. One day, Ana accidentally eavesdrops on the Senator and Miranda Ojeda discussing the need to silence Senator Reinoso, a political enemy. Confused at first, Ana becomes concerned when Senator Reinoso turns up dead. She tells Gael but he does not believe her so she reports it to the authorities, and the story turns into a media circus. The story is headlined all over the news by overzealous media, compromising Ana's security and her ability to tell Gael about Senator del Mundo's dictaphone containing the audio recording of Miranda and the Senator's conversation. Miranda orders their assassin to retrieve the missing dictaphone and kill Ana. Coincidentally, Samantha overhears Miranda ordering someone to ‚Äúget rid of Ana‚Äù. Curious and unsure of what she hears, she follows Ana home and is horrified when she witnesses Vicente and Ana Dimasalang's kidnapping and subsequent murders. Disturbed by what she sees, Samantha keeps her silence. As it turns out, Samantha is not the only witness the crime. After Ana's news interview, some Reformists decide to follow Ana. Xander and Celeste arrive at the warehouse just as Ana and Vicente's bodies are stuffed in cement containers for disposal. While they are unable to save Vicente, they are able to retrieve Ana and she survives. Gael tries to make sense of Ana's motives but she and her family disappears. Devastated, he believes his mother's explanation that Ana is a spy paid by Reinoso to infiltrate his godfather's office to conduct a smear campaign against him. Heartbroken, Gael turns to his best friend Samantha for solace and they resume their relationship. Six months after her disappearance, Ana wakes up from a coma in a house occupied by the children of Reformist Informers, all victims of Senator del Mundo. Ana learns their parents, including Ana's father, worked with the movement to expose the Senator's corruption. Her father perished while attempting to turnover a disk containing crucial evidence against Del Mundo to Celeste and the group. It is this disk that is in Samantha's possession, though she is not aware of it, In the meantime, the Senator gets involved in a hostage negotiation that turns him into a hero. Rowena Barrios, a celebrity journalist and long time staunch supporter of Salvador del Mundo is kidnapped and held hostage along with two Korean nationals by a terrorist group. When the Senator volunteers to negotiate for their release, Rowena discovers the hostage is staged and that the senator's negotiation is a public relations act to boost his image in exchange for arms and weapons sale to the terrorists. The Senator cold bloodedly shoots her, blaming her murder on the terrorists. Despite the young journalists death, the dramatic release of the Korean hostages boosts Senator del Mundo's popularity, His constituents clamor for his re-election. Gael wants to redeem himself with the Senator who blames him for introducing Ana into their lives, so he accepts the Senator's offer to join him as the logistics operations front for the syndicate. Samantha, on the other hand, refuses to lose sight on her husband, albeit newly married and pregnant, joins their core team. Totally unprepared for her father's approval, she revels in the joy of his attention. Nevertheless, the specter of Ana haunts Samantha, and reminders of her permeates into their relationship, she becomes obsessed and determined to eliminate Ana from their lives. To exact her revenge, Ana enters Hillary Del Mundo's world under a different identity as Stella Guerrero, Xander's patrician wife who had died abroad, away from public knowledge a few years ago. Ana is a dead ringer for Stella, the sole heiress of the De la Torre Group, Asia's leading provider of hospitals and medical equipment. Using the Candelaria Mobile Medical Clinics, one of her family's subsidiaries, Ana partners with Hilary's mining company to provide mobile clinics to remote locations in San Isidro, a mining community persistently plagued with health issues. Their partnership couldn‚Äôt have occurred at a better time, their mobile units demonstrate their worth with their quick response when a landslide occurred at the mines. This allows her group close access to the mines where they suspect the logistics for the arms and weapons are executed. As sole heiress of the De la Torre wealth, and with no other surviving relative or associates to say otherwise, Xander and Ana pull off the pretense, convincing the Del Mundos and de la Torre's remaining business partner that Ana is Stella. Except Gael who believes she is really Ana Dimasalang and he is determined to unmask her. Their deception fails and despite the conflict that ensues as Ana's team comes close to bringing down Senator del Mundo, Ana and Gael rekindle their relationship causing a major shift in the dynamics within Ana's world and Gael's. Later, Samantha and Gael divorce, their child dies, and the scandal surrounding Senator del Mundo surfaces, nearly bringing him behind bars. Hillary discovers her husband's true evil nature and decides to leave him. She joins Ana's team. Samantha also leaves her father, he disowns her and everyone discovers she is Ana's lost sibling. Although conflicted at first, Samantha comes around and supports her sister and her relationship with her former husband. Frustrated because Gael is determined to help Ana and remain by her side, Salvador and Miranda's nefarious hands are stayed, unable to proceed with their political ambitions. We learn by this time Gael is Salvador's natural child. The conflict comes to a head when Gael is killed in an ambush ordered by Salvador, but meant for the two sisters. Without Gael to protect her, Ana and Samantha are vulnerable against the might of the del Mundo resources and machinery.

As a laryngologist and chief speech therapist, in 1924 he introduced the term logopedics (i.e., speech therapy) into medical usage. He established the International Society of Logopedics and Phoniatrics, and was a co-founder, together with Karl Cornelius Rothe, of the Vienna School for Speech-Disturbed Children.  Life  Fr√∂schels was born in Vienna in what was then Austria-Hungary. He graduated in 1902 from the State Gymnasium in the city's 6th District and then studied medicine at the University of Vienna. He worked from 1905 to 1908 at the of the University of Vienna and was a guest student at the Institute of Chemistry. In 1907 he received his doctorate, and in 1908 he began to work at the otological clinic (Ohrenklinik, literally: ear clinic) of the University of Vienna under the direction of Viktor Urbantschitsch, because he had the intention of becoming an audiologist. He had to drop this intention, however, because his depth perception was not sufficient for otoscopy. He turned to the voice and speech disorders, and went to in Berlin and, on his return to Vienna in 1909, opened an outpatient clinic for speech disorders at the Ohrenklinik, which he led for many years. In 1914 he was habilitated as a lecturer in otology. During World War I, he was chief physician of the head injuries and speech disorders department of the Vienna Garrison Hospital. After the war, Fr√∂schels worked until 1926 at the Ohrenklinik then led by Heinrich Neumann von H√©th√°rs and was at the same time assistant for phonetics at the Physiological Institute. In 1920, together with colleagues and educators, he set up a language welfare center for schoolchildren in the city of Vienna. In 1921, he and Karl Cornelius Rothe first organized special courses in voice and speech therapy for educators in Vienna and founded the Vienna School for Speech-Disturbed Children. In 1924 Fr√∂schels founded the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP), which he chaired from 1924 to 1953. He taught voice and voice therapy at the teacher training institute and at the conservatory. He was a member of the Association for Psychiatry and Neurology, President of the Austrian Society for Abnormal Child Psychology and from 1926 to 1938 president of the Austrian Society for Experimental Phonetics. He was involved in the Association for Individual Psychology in educational counseling and founded in 1926 an individual psychological outpatient clinic for speech disorders at the Polyclinic, which he directed in collaboration with Alfred Adler and Leopold Stein. In 1927 he was appointed associate professor at the University of Vienna. After Austria's annexation by Germany in the Anschluss, Fr√∂schels was forcibly suspended on account of his Jewish origin and lost his venia legendi (status as a lecturer). In 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where he found a position as a research professor of speech disorders at the Central Institute for the Deaf, led by Max Aaron Goldstein, at Washington University in St. Louis. From 1940 to 1949 he was founder and director at the Speech and Language Clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital and from 1950 to 1955 at the Beth David Hospital in New York. From 1947 he was president of the New York Society of Speech and Voice Therapy. He taught at Pace College in New York and became in 1955 the first director of the Alfred Adler Institute in New York. Fr√∂schels died in New York in 1972.  Work  Fr√∂schels is next to Hermann Gutzmann Sr. as a pioneer of modern language research and founder of speech therapy. In 1909 he published a lecture on the nature and treatment of speech disorders. In 1913 he published his textbook of speech and voice, which contributed to the recognition of voice and voice therapy in medicine with the works of Gutzmann. His research was devoted to the psychological causes of various language and speech disorders. He attributed stuttering to mental, not innate causes. He developed a therapy for stutterers, for whom he thought the typical spasms could be solved by chewing movements while speaking and at the same time stimulating the various muscles of the vocal tract. Therapists support this process, in the sense of individual psychology, by words of encouragement. He was also involved in the invention of Fr√∂schel-Scholit prosthesis for correcting cleft palate. Fr√∂schels wrote 23 books and about 300 articles on speech disorders, psychotherapy, and philosophical issues, and was a member of the American Speech Correction Association, the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy, the Rudolf Virchow Society, and others.  Awards  In 1961, Fr√∂schels received the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art First Class from the Austrian Government for his services in the field of science and art. He was supported by the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP) to be made an honorary member.

Gargani was involved with Catholic Action during her teaching career but is best known for having been a close friend and correspondent with Pio from Pietrelcina from World War I until the saint's death in 1968; the saint wrote a total of 67 letters to Gargani during this period. The cause for her beatification opened in 1988 and she became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis named her as Venerable in mid-2017 and later approved a miracle attributed to her in 2018 which confirmed she would be beatified. The beatification took place in Naples in the metropolitan cathedral on 2 June 2018. Life Maria Gargani was born in the evening on 23 December 1892 in Morra de Sanctis as the last of eight children to Rocco Gargani and Angiolina De Paola. Her devout father instructed the children in catechism and it was from him that Gargani's faith grew over time. Her education was spent in her hometown before finishing it in Avellino where she was the guest of an uncle; she obtained a master's degree in 1913 that would allow her to begin work as a teacher. Gargani began teaching in San Marco la Catola in Foggia from 1913 to 1928 and lived there alongside her married sister Antonietta. It was also there that she first met the priests Benedetto and Agostino Daniele who both became spiritual guides for her as she discerned her vocation. It was in 1914 that this manifested and she recorded that she wept as she discerned her call to follow God due to the seriousness of the task. Gargani later entered the Secular Franciscan Order after having discovered Francis of Assisi. Francis represented to her a model of love that served as an influence on her religious convictions. Not long after this she began teaching catechism to children while also preparing them for the reception of their First Communion and she even purchased a machine to project images to explain to them the life of Jesus Christ. Gargani also began collaborating with Catholic Action around this time. From 1928 to 1945 she began teaching in Volturara Appula. In 1915 her advisor Agostino Daniele was summoned to serve in World War I as a chaplain and so entrusted her to the spiritual care of the Franciscan Capuchin priest Padre Pio while advising Gargani to maintain correspondence with the friar. Gargani made first contact with the friar at the beginning of August 1916 via letter which began several decades of friendship and correspondence that lasted until Pio's death in 1968. The first letter Pio wrote to her was dated 26 August 1916. Pio became a spiritual guide for Gargani was well as a source of moral support. The two met for the first time face-to-face in the Capuchin convent at San Marco la Catola in mid-April 1918. In 1934 she received diocesan permission to form a group of companions in the former convent of Santa Maria della Sanit√† - this became the foundation for the religious congregation that she would establish not long after. Gargani later established the Sisters Apostles of the Sacred Heart on 11 February 1936 with the permission of the Archbishop of Lucca Antonio Torrini; the first convent for the order opened that 21 April. In 1945 the order moved its headquarters to Naples while that 18 April - with other companions - she made her profession as a professed religious as \\"Maria Crocifissa del Divino Amore\\". From 1946 until her retirement she taught in Naples. On 21 July 1951 - in the Santuario della Beata Vergine del Rosario di Pompei - she met the zealous priest Antonio Fanucci who became her new spiritual director. Her order later received diocesan approval from Cardinal Marcello Mimmi on 2 June 1956 and she made her perpetual profession a month later on 22 July. Pope John XXIII granted her order full pontifical approval on 12 March 1963. Gargani died in mid-1973 in her room in Naples; her remains were later exhumed and relocated to the order's motherhouse on 17 May 1992. Beatification The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 31 May 1988 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Gargani as a Servant of God and issued the official edict declaring \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause). Cardinal Michele Giordano inaugurated the diocesan process of investigation on 12 September 1988 and later closed it on 16 May 2002; the documentation was sent to Rome to the C.C.S. who validated the diocesan process on 21 March 2003. From 2007 the postulation began compiling the Positio dossier which was a collation of all documentation and interrogatories gathered from the diocesan process. This dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. later in 2013. Pope Francis later confirmed that Gargani had lived a model life of heroic virtue on 7 July 2017 and titled her as Venerable. Her beatification depended upon papal confirmation of a miracle (a healing in most cases) that science and medicine fail to explain. One such case was investigated in a southern Italian province in a diocesan investigation that the C.C.S. later validated on 28 October 2011. Pope Francis later confirmed this healing to be a legitimate miracle on 26 January 2018 which cleared Gargani for beatification. The beatification took place on 2 June 2018 in Naples. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf with Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe and Cardinal Philippe Ou√©draogo in attendance. The current postulator for this cause is Giuditta Esselen Juran. =Miracle= The miracle that led to her beatification was the 1975 healing of the woman Michelina Formichella from Torrecuso in the Benevento province. Formichella died of a heart attack in 2015.

Purportedly addressed by Plato to one Laodamas, the brief letter first laments that Plato and Laodamas are unable to meet in person. The context of the letter indicates that Laodamas is responsible for helping to institute government in a colony, already understood by the author in the present letter. The author advises that laws alone will be insufficient to govern the colony, or city, without some sort of military or police force which is further tasked with practically enforcing order. TextBackground Unlike the large majority of Plato's major works, the Letters are not Socratic dialogues. Further, despite their traditional attribution to Plato, the Letters are variously held to be spurious or suspect by modern scholarship. Collectively, the thirteen Letters are commonly grouped together as one larger item (called either Letters or Epistles). In turn, this larger collection of Letters is traditionally the last item in the Thrasyllan tetraologies, a traditional grouping of the major works of Plato which divides them into nine tetraologies of four works apiece. In this arrangement, the Letters occupy the thirty-sixth and final place in the traditional Platonic corpus.

It has desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as an application for Android TV. Manual setup is available for wireless routers, NAS devices and other platforms. NordVPN is based in Panama, as the country has no mandatory data retention laws and does not participate in the Five Eyes or Fourteen Eyes alliances.  History  NordVPN was established in 2012 by \\"four childhood friends\\", as stated on its website. Late in May 2016, it presented an Android app, followed by an iOS app in June the same year. In October 2017, it launched a browser extension for Google Chrome. In June 2018, the service launched an application for Android TV. As of October 2019, NordVPN was operating more than 5,200 servers in 62 countries. In March 2019, it was reported that NordVPN received a directive from Russian authorities to join a state sponsored registry of banned websites, which would prevent Russian NordVPN users from circumventing Russian state censorship. NordVPN was reportedly given one month to comply, or face blocking by Russian authorities. The provider declined to comply with the request and shut down its Russian servers on April 1. As a result, NordVPN still operates in Russia, but its Russian users have no access to local servers. In September 2019, NordVPN announced a VPN solution for business, called NordVPN Teams. It is aimed at small and medium businesses, remote teams and freelancers, who need to access work resources securely. In December 2019, NordVPN became one of the five founding members of the newly formed 'VPN Trust Initiative', promising to promote online security as well as more self- regulation and transparency in the industry. In August 2020, Troy Hunt, an Australian web security expert and founder of Have I Been Pwned?, announced a partnership with NordVPN as a strategic advisor. On his blog, Hunt described this role as \\"work with NordVPN on their tools and messaging with a view to helping them make a great product even better.\\"  Features  NordVPN routes all users' internet traffic through a remote server run by the service, thereby hiding their IP address and encrypting all incoming and outgoing data. For encryption, NordVPN uses the OpenVPN and Internet Key Exchange v2/IPsec technologies in its applications. Besides general-use VPN servers, the provider offers servers for specific purposes, including P2P sharing, double encryption, and connection to the Tor anonymity network. At one time NordVPN used L2TP/IPSec and Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) connections for routers, but these were later removed, as they were largely obsolete and insecure. NordVPN has desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile apps for Android and iOS and Android TV app. Subscribers also get access to encrypted proxy extensions for Chrome and Firefox browsers. Subscribers can connect up to 6 devices simultaneously. In November 2018, NordVPN claimed that its no-log policy was verified through an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG. In July 2019, NordVPN released NordLynx, a new VPN tool based on the experimental WireGuard protocol, which aims for better performance than the IPsec and OpenVPN tunneling protocols. NordLynx is available to Linux users and, according to tests performed by Wired UK, produces \\"speed boosts of hundreds of MB/s under some conditions.\\" In April 2020, NordVPN announced a gradual roll-out of the WireGuard-based NordLynx protocol on all its platforms. The wider implementation was preceded by a total of 256,886 tests, which included 47 virtual machines on nine different providers, in 19 cities, and eight countries. The tests showed higher average download and upload speeds than both OpenVPN and IKEv2.  Security issues and controversies  On October 21, 2019, a security researcher disclosed on Twitter a server breach of NordVPN involving a leaked private key. The cyberattack granted the attackers root access, which was used to generate an HTTPS certificate that enabled the attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept the communications of NordVPN users. In response, NordVPN confirmed that one of its servers based in Finland was breached in March 2018. The exploit was the result of a vulnerability in a contracted data center's remote administration system that affected the Finland server between January 31 and March 20, 2018. According to NordVPN, the data center disclosed the breach to NordVPN on April 13, 2019, and NordVPN ended its relationship with the data center. Security researchers and media outlets criticized NordVPN for failing to promptly disclose the breach after the company became aware of it. NordVPN stated that the company initially planned to disclose the breach after it completed its internal audits. On October 29, 2019, NordVPN announced additional audits and a bug bounty program. The bug bounty was launched in December 2019, offering researchers monetary rewards for reporting critical flaws in the service. On November 1, 2019, in a separate incident, it was reported that approximately 2,000 usernames and passwords of NordVPN accounts were exposed through credential stuffing.  Reception  In a February 2019 review by PC Magazine, NordVPN was praised for its strong security features and an \\"enormous network of servers\\", although its price tag was noted as expensive. CNET's March 2019 review favorably noted NordVPN's six simultaneous connections and dedicated IP option. In a positive review published by Tom's Guide in October 2019, the reviewer concluded that \\"NordVPN is affordable and offers all the features that even the hardcore VPN elitists will find suitable\\".Fadilpa≈°iƒá, Saed (October 15, 2019). NordVPN Review: Excellent Price/Quality Ratio. Tom's Guide. Retrieved: February 5, 2020. The reviewer also noted that its terms of service mention no country of jurisdiction, writing that the company could be more transparent about its ownership. The company has since updated the Terms, explicitly mentioning Panama as its country of jurisdiction. TechRadar recommended NordVPN for bypassing state- level Internet censorship, including the Great Firewall in China.

(GtkHeaderBar widget on GNOME Files, 2014-01) Client-side decoration (CSD) is the concept of allowing a graphical application software to be responsible for drawing its own window decorations, historically the responsibility of the window manager. Sometimes client-side decoration is used to refer to the applications that don't have a traditional title bar, however this is a misuse of the phrase, as even applications that have a basic title bar can be client side decorated. By using client-side decoration rather than traditional server-side decoration, applications are able to draw their own title bar, which allows for a wide range of possibilities to customize window decorations and add additional functionality (graphical control elements) into what otherwise would be a typical window manager bar with much empty space in the maximized windows.  Terminology  In Linux and Unix-like systems, it is called Client-Side Decoration which comes from X Window System, where a client is the application which renders a window and sends it to the X server. The alternative is called Server-Side Decoration (SSD) even though on X the decoration is drawn by the window manager, which is not actually the \\"server\\".  Implementations = Widget toolkits = GTK  GTK was the first GUI toolkit on Linux that implemented client-side decoration using the GtkHeaderBar widget. GtkHeaderBar merges the title bar, menu bar and tool bar into one unified horizontal bar in order to give more space to the application content, potentially reducing the amount of wasted space by showing empty bars. This can help to achieve a flexible UI and consistent UX across different computer form factors from desktop systems to small form factor devices by removing the traditional desktop-oriented parts from applications. These have first-class support in GNOME Shell and are widely use by GNOME applications.  UWP  Universal Windows Platform applications can choose to draw their own title bars.  macOS  In macOS, AppKit applications use client-side decoration when using the NSWindow widget.  Electron  Electron has the option to use a frame-less window (without toolbar, menu bar, tabs), however the application is responsible for drawing its own shadows.  Deepin Tool Kit  Deepin File Manager, a Qt-based application with client-side decoration. Deepin Tool Kit is a small modified widget toolkit based on Qt5, it is used by Deepin Desktop Environment. = Applications = Notable applications with client-side decoration: * Steam, uses its own widget toolkit called \\"VGUI\\". * Firefox uses client-side decorations when the title bar is disabled. * Google Chrome uses client-side decorations on Windows and macOS, and supports both client and server decorations on Linux. = Display servers = Wayland  Wayland was designed to have client-side decorations (including the shadows of windows) by default, but has an optional protocol, known as xdg-decoration, which allows an application (client) to query whether the window manager supports server-side decoration and if so for a client to request it. Mutter, the compositor used by GNOME Shell, under Wayland only supports client side decoration, whilst KWin supports both client and server side decoration.  History  * In 2008 Adobe released Photoshop CS4 that uses client-side decorations. * In 2012 Microsoft uses client-side decorations in their new Metro design language by adding toolbar objects like back buttons to the windows title bar. * In 2013 GTK added support for client- side decorations with the release of GTK 3.10.

Established in the 19th century during the Spanish colonial period, Quinta Market was the central market of the City of Manila, originally catering to the wealthy families that lived in Quiapo at the time. By the early 20th century, the market had become one of the city's most important markets, generating significant revenues while also catering to residents of all social classes. However, growing congestion and the shift of business to new developments outside the city have led to its gradual decline, until the market was torn down and rebuilt in 2017 during the term of Mayor Joseph Estrada. History A postcard of Quinta Market in 1911, showing the rear of the market facing the Pasig River from the Puente Colgante Quinta Market was built by the Spanish colonial government in 1851, the same year as the Divisoria Market in Tondo. Built with money bequeathed to the city government of Manila by businessman and philanthropist Francisco Carriedo in the 18th century, its establishment coincided with the growth of industry and trade in the city and the establishment of new public markets to complement existing venues for trade both in the city center and its suburbs. At the time, Quiapo was an attractive location for riverside villas along the Pasig River, and this was immortalized in the market's name, which translates to \\"country villa\\" in Spanish. Also believed to be named after its surrounding countryside, the market originally sold vegetables grown in the farms around Quiapo. The next year, the market was connected to Arroceros in Ermita, where Manila's rice market was located, with the construction of the Puente Colgante, later replaced by the modern-day Quezon Bridge. At the time of its construction, Quinta Market was the most spacious public market in Manila, catering to the wealthy families living in Quiapo at the time, and thanks to its large port area it was also called the city's best market. The original market however was shoddily built, and it was heavily damaged by earthquake in 1863, although commercial activity continued despite the destruction. The market was rebuilt in 1878 according to plans by F√©lix Rojas, the Philippines' first architect. Rojas also prepared plans for the reconstruction of several other structures destroyed in the earthquake, including the Santo Domingo Church in Intramuros. Subsequent plans for the market were drawn up on January 18, 1889 by a successor of Rojas, Juan Jos√© de las Herv√°s. On December 8, 1900, at the onset of the American colonization of the Philippines, new plans for the market were drawn up by Lieutenant Lytle Brown of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who at the time was detailed as the city engineer of Manila. He oversaw the construction of a new, steel market building, constructed at a cost of $67,821.29 (around $2.03 million in 2017 dollars), and Quinta Market reopened to the public on October 21, 1901. During this time, the market was a popular wholesale market which was especially busy on Fridays, serving residents of all social classes, and certain items like beef were more available here than at other markets in the city. The market's importance was evident in the revenues it was generating for the city government: in 1908, the Quinta and Divisoria markets generated a combined 80 percent of the city's market fee collections. Although Quinta Market was known for the wide variety of foodstuffs and other items sold under its roof and in the surrounding area, over the years it had been steadily overshadowed by the opening of new department stores and other retail concepts opening in Makati and Quezon City, as well as by the growing congestion in Quiapo caused by overdevelopment. By the 2000s, not only did it become just a regular retail market, it had also earned a reputation for being damp and filthy, surrounded by stagnant dirty water and ambulant fish vendors selling their wares on the street, to the inconvenience of marketgoers. In 2008, the market was renovated and the area cleaned up in anticipation of a last-minute visit by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Despite improvements to the structure over the years, the market itself was still generally considered to be dilapidated, which prompted the city government of Manila to build an entirely new market. =Construction of the Quinta Market and Fishport= Quinta Market in 2011. In 2015, Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada had the old market buildings demolished to make way for the new Quinta Market and Fishport. In 2014, the Manila City Council passed Ordinance No. 8346, allowing for the city government of Manila to enter into joint venture agreements with private companies and paving the way for the demolition and rehabilitation of several of the city's public markets. Quinta Market was named as the first market to be demolished and rebuilt under the ordinance. The next year, Mayor Joseph Estrada announced the construction of a new Quinta Market, to be built at no cost to the city as part of a joint venture with Marketlife Management and Leasing Corporation, which submitted an unsolicited proposal on September 15, 2014. The agreement between the city government and Marketlife was signed on July 16, 2015, although the agreement was allegedly approved on October 20, 2014. Vendors inside the market sued the city government in an attempt to stop the demolition and the joint venture, concerned that they would either be evicted or subjected to higher fees under the scheme, as well as concerns that the market was effectively going to be privatized. Congressman Amado Bagatsing, who represents the fifth district of Manila and an opponent of the joint venture program, also sided with the vendors, claiming that due process was not followed since Estrada signed the joint venture agreement before the project underwent a public consultation process. The Manila Regional Trial Court however ruled against the vendors on July 25, 2015, ruling that the city had the right to develop the property \\"as an attribute of [its] ownership\\". Demolition of the old Quinta Market took place two days later on July 27, 2015 at 8:00 am PST, although over 500 vendors attempted to physically stop the demolition. Estrada later confronted the vendors, chastising those who refused to yield. He also reassured vendors that the market was not being privatized, and he promised as well to issue \\"certificates of tenure\\" to some 270 affected vendors, which would serve as a guarantee that they would have a place in the new market without being subjected to fee increases. However, the following month some vendors filed graft charges against Estrada with the Office of the Ombudsman, claiming that he awarded the contract to Marketlife without undergoing a bidding process. In its defense, Marketlife said that while they only have ‚Ç±3.2 million in registered capital with the Securities and Exchange Commission ‚Äì the minimum required by law ‚Äì they have up to ‚Ç±200 million allocated for the market's construction from a combination of paid-up capital and bank financing. They also said that the proposal they submitted underwent due process, claiming that they had consulted vendors when instructed to do so and that the city government took its time in approving its proposal, despite submitting their proposal two months before the company was incorporated. During the new market's construction, vendors were housed in orange steel boxes located around the market site, which would allow them to continue selling while construction was ongoing, which was estimated to take around 6‚Äì10 months. The new market's foundation was finished in November 2015, and by April 2016, the columns and flooring had been installed in addition to a portion of the new building's roof. However, the number of street vendors reportedly grew, out of concerns of high rents, while other vendors in the market have been unable to return. On April 19, 2017, Estrada's 80th birthday, the ‚Ç±150 million Quinta Market and Fishport was inaugurated and reopened to the public ‚Äì the fifth market to be renovated under the city's market renovation program. Some 250 vendors reopened their stalls with the market's reopening. Structure and management A fish vendor at the new Quinta Market and Fishport The Quinta Market and Fishport is a two-storey structure, fulfilling Estrada's vision of a \\"modern, convenient and mall-like public market\\". Replacing the previous market building built in neoclassical style, the ground floor houses the market itself, which has a capacity of 360 stalls, while a 100-slot parking garage occupies the second floor. Among the new amenities built into the new building are separate sections for dry and wet goods, air-conditioned restrooms equipped with bidet showers and stainless steel fixtures, a food court, a closed-circuit television system and free public Wi-Fi. The building also has provisions for enclosed standalone establishments, with the Quinta Market branch of Jollibee opening on December 4, 2017. On December 8, 2017, the city government opened the market's new vegetable section, selling vegetables brought straight from farms in Benguet. Inaugurated by Estrada along with Benguet governor Crecenscio Pacalso, the section ultimately aims to bring down the cost of vegetables sold in the city. Incorporated into the structure's rear is a fish port, which would allow the market to directly receive fresh seafood from Navotas and produce from other parts of the country, as well as a ferry terminal. Constructed with the assistance of the Philippine Ports Authority, the ferry terminal's construction is expected to help decongest Quezon Boulevard and surrounding roads with the impending revival of the Pasig River Ferry Service. Although Quinta Market is owned by the City of Manila, it is run by Marketlife under the terms of their joint venture agreement. In exchange for running the market for 25 years, the market's revenues are split between the two, with Marketlife keeping 80 percent of revenues and the remaining 20 percent remitted to the city government. Revenues are primarily generated through stall rental fees, with the original rental fee being ‚Ç±15‚Äì30 per square meter per day. On September 4, 2017, despite promising not to do so, the city government increased rental fees to between ‚Ç±30 and ‚Ç±80 per square meter depending on stall size. The increases in rental fees were criticized by vendors as being too high, although the city defended the increases by justifying that the increases were modest compared to what Marketlife actually wanted, with the company asking for rental rates as much as 300 percent higher, or as high as ‚Ç±67.25 per square meter. Vendors and stalls Informal street vendors in front of the old Quinta Market in 2011. In 2017, hundreds of these vendors were cleared from the market by the Manila city government. Quinta Market is currently home to 279 registered vendors, all of whom were also registered vendors at the old market at the time it was torn down. Their interests are represented by the Quinta Public Market Development Cooperative (QPMDC), also known as the Quinta Stallholders Association. Scandal arose in August 2017 when an organization called the United Vendors Alliance (UVA) alleged that a business mafia was monopolizing trade at the market, protected by officials in the city government. According to the allegations, 26 families reportedly owned 146 stalls which were turned over to other vendors after paying the syndicate additional fees, despite the city's Market Code mandating that a family can only own one stall at a time. They also alleged that the 26 families were not even resident in the City of Manila, and that their arrangement prevented other vendors from getting places in the market, thus forcing them to sell on the street. A member of the Manila City Council named by the UVA as a protector of the mafia strongly denied the allegations, while the QPDMC denied that there even was a mafia operating in the market to begin with, going so far as claiming that the UVA's president wasn't even a registered vendor there. Estrada, for his part, promised to investigate the matter. Informal vendors often congregate around Quinta Market, with vendors occupying as much as half of Carlos Palanca Street, in the process causing heavy traffic. In September 2017, the Manila city government undertook a series of cleanup operations that led to the departure of hundreds of informal vendors from the market's perimeter. =Notable establishments and patrons= Pastora Special Palabok, identified by the Manila Bulletin in 2014 as having the best pancit palabok in Manila. As a commercial hub, Quinta Market is strongly connected with Filipino cuisine and the Manila food culture. In its heyday, the market was seen as a pleasant place to dine at, and shoppers would patronize the many carinderias (food stalls) inside, known for their pancit, menudo, puto and dinuguan. The market is also known for its halo-halo, and it is believed that the dessert was invented here as an innovation on the Japanese mitsumame in the 1920s or 1930s. Some of the carinderias have become notable in their own right: in 2014, the Manila Bulletin identified Pastora Special Palabok as having the best pancit palabok in Manila, while Edna's Eatery, known for its nilagang baka, was featured on the GMA Network morning show Unang Hirit. Quinta Market has also been linked to the origins of a number of Philippine culinary and cultural personalities. R. Lapid's, the Philippines' largest chicharon chain, first started selling their signature product at the family meat stall of the chain's founder inside the market, while the father of radio host Ruel \\"Ahwel\\" Paz was also a vendor at the market in the 1980s. Restaurateur Engracia Cruz-Reyes, founder of Filipino restaurant The Aristocrat, regularly visited the market, as did her daughter Teresita, who became known for the Mama Sita's line of food products. Other regular visitors to the market included restaurateurs Anastacio de Alba, former cook of the Casino Espa√±ol de Manila and founder of Spanish restaurants Alba and El Espa√±ol, and Nenuca Benitez, founder of the Filipino-Spanish restaurant Mario's in Baguio. The area around Quinta Market is likewise home to several stores and stalls selling everything from furniture to clothing. Beside the market is the shopping area known as \\"Ilalim ng Tulay\\" (\\"under the bridge\\"), so called because of its location underneath the Quezon Bridge. Known for its very cheap prices, the stores here sell mostly wood products, furniture and Philippine handicrafts sourced from all over the country, as well as souvenirs for tourists. College students who purchase items from this area often call the place \\"Ils de Tuls\\" or \\"Ile de Toule\\", francisizing the name to make their purchases sound more sophisticated, although the name has since become mainstream among those who frequent the area. Facing the market along Carlos Palanca Street meanwhile are stores selling costumes and props.

He is a veteran of East-Coast street rap battles, and has influenced the majority of modern battle rappers today. Alongside Troy \\"Smack White\\" Mitchell, he grew in popularity among fans of street hip-hop DVDs due to his delivery, crowd control, bars and consistency. He is considered a legend and a flag bearer for the primary era of battle rap https://thesource.com/2018/08/15/can-murda-mooks-return-change- the-landscape-of-battle-rap/ He is a founding member of the Harlem-based rap group Dot Mob, consisting of Mook, his cousin T-Rex, and Dutch Brown, affiliated with A&R; Louie Da 13th. Former members included NymLo (known as NymDot at the time) and K-Shine. Associates include Watts rapper Daylyt, Pittsburgh rapper Real Deal, Baltimore rapper Tay Roc, and hype-man/producer Sho Gotti. Career Murda Mook began his career as a battle rapper, facing well-known Harlem rappers such as T-Rex and Loaded Lux. His breakthrough performance was featured on a 2002 S.M.A.C.K. DVD against Jae Millz, who had recently battled E. Ness and was broadcast on MTV's Making the Band. The combination of these two rappers, both with growing followings at the time, resulted in one of the most influential rap battles of all time. Mook later faced rappers such as Party Arty, Serius Jones, and Philly-native Young Hot in 2008. This was due to his original opponent Cassidy backing out. Mook is currently considered a living 'legend' in the modern-battle rap world, having influenced almost all of the Ultimate Rap League. Outside of S.M.A.C.K. he also made a brief appearance on MTV2's Monday Night Fight Klub where he battled against up-and-coming rappers such as Verse, Cardi aka. Deuce One, and most notably French Montana, who went under the name Young French at the time. His next battle was a rematch against Loaded Lux on fuse TV's Total Slaughter battle event. Four years later, Mook returned to battle rap on R.B.E to face Aye Verb. His most recent battle was a 2on2 match against T-Top and Brizz Rawsteen (Mook paired up with Calicoe) at U.R.L‚Äôs Summer Impact Relaoded event. The battle ended during the first round due to altercations. Mook also called out Drake to a rap battle at a URL event. However, the two have claimed to have no problems with each other. Mook's debut album Murder He Wrote was released under Black Face Ent. in late 2007. He has released and been featured on many New York mixtapes since. In 2011, Mook signed to Ruff Ryders and recorded the anthem \\"You Know (Ruff Ryders Anthem 11)\\". However, after the record label became independent, Mook's music did not see a release. Instead, he re-signed to Busta Rhymes Conglomerate record label in 2016. His future album is still in the works. He was involved with a new Dot Mob mixtape titled \\"Voices\\" in 2016, hosted by DJ Whoo Kid. In 2012, Mook appeared on the Ruff Ryders Cypher of the BET Hip Hop Awards.

He was suffect consul for February through July of the year 18, succeeding the emperor Tiberius, and as the colleague first of Germanicus, then of Livineius Regulus.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 459 The family connections of Seius Tubero have posed a problem for students of ancient history. For example, he is the only consul of either the Roman Republic or Empire to use \\"Tubero\\" as a cognomen who was not of the gens Aelii.Freeman Adams, \\"The Consular Brothers of Sejanus\\", American Journal of Philology. 76 (1955), p. 72 The consensus is that Tubero is one of the two brothers of Sejanus alluded to by Velleius Paterculus;Velleius Paterculus, II.147 however, theories defining this fraternal relationship have changed over the years. Borghesi first proposed that Seius Tubero was the son of Lucius Seius Strabo. Then it was proposed that Seius Tubero was by birth the nephew of Strabo's wife, whom Strabo later adopted. The latest theory of his fraternal relationship to Sejanus, proposed by Ronald Syme, is that Seius Tubero was the son of his wife Junia with her first husband, the jurist Quintus Aelius Tubero, whom Seius Strabo adopted following his marriage to Junia.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 302-305 Seius Tubero's first recorded action is in the year 16, as the commander of cavalry under Germanicus in battle against the Angrivarii.Tacitus, Annales, II.20 He next appears after his consulship, in the year 24, when he and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Augur, described by Tacitus as leading men of the state and close friends of emperor Tiberius, accused by Vibius Serenus of inciting rebellion and public unrest. Because Lentulus was so old and Tubero in poor health, both were acquitted, and Serenus fled from Rome for Ravenna, only to be brought back before the Senate, tried, and punished with exile.Tacitus, Annales, IV.28-30 His life after that incident is a blank. As Tacitus notes that Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus was \\"alone of all connected with Sejanus\\" to avoid death or exile after his fall in the year 31,Tactius, Annales, VI.30 it is likely that Seius Tubero died either before Sejanus' fall, or soon after it.

Pygmaeocereus bylesianus has spherical to short cylindrical dark green shoots up to 8 cm long and 2 cm in diameter. The shoots branch from the base and form small pads. There is a fleshy tap root. The 12 to 14 ribs are initially notched and later divided into clear cusps. The 10 to 15 radiating dark thorns turn gray with age. They are 3 to 7 millimeters long and usually not distinguishable into central and radial spines. Occasionally 1 to 2 cm long central spines are formed. The broad, funnel-shaped, scented, white flowers are around 15 cm long. They have a very slim and long flower tube. They only last 24h and open at night. The spherical fruits are red and about 15 millimeters in size. They are thick-walled and tear open lengthways or dry up. The plants grow very slowly and in cultivation require very well-draining growth media to avoid rots. Distribution and systematics Pygmaeocereus bylesianus is common in the Peruvian region of Arequipa at altitudes of 50 to 1000 m.

(2000) Ethosomes-Novel Vesicular Carriers for Enhanced Delivery: Characterization and Skin Penetration Properties, J. Control. Release, 65:403-418.  Applications  Because of their unique structure, ethosomes are able to efficiently encapsulate and deliver into the skin highly lipophilic molecules such as testosterone, cannabinoids and ibuprofen, as well as hydrophilic drugs such as clindamycin phosphate, buspirone hydrochloride. They have been studied for the transdermal and intradermal delivery of peptides, steroids, antibiotics, prostaglandins, antivirals and anti- pyretics.Horwitz, E., Pisanty, S., Czerninski, R., Helser, M., Eliav, E., Touitou, E.

The species was previously treated as part of Juniperus phoenicea, which is now regarded as restricted to Portugal, Spain and France, whereas J. turbinata is found from Macaronesia throughout the Mediterranean to the Arabian Peninsula. Description Juniperus turbinata resembles J. phoenicea. It is a shrub or small tree up to in height. The smaller branches have reddish bark. The adult leaves are scale-like, closely pressed to the twigs. Pollen is produced in the autumn (October to November), rather than in spring as in J. phoenicea. The seed cones are long (longer than in J. phoenicea), and somewhat elongated, especially when immature. Each cone typically has seven to nine seeds (fewer than J. phoenicea). File:Juniperus phoenicea foliage cones.jpgFoliage and cones File:Juniperus phoenicea kz3.jpgIn maquis shrubland habitat Taxonomy Juniperus turbinata was first described by Giovanni Gussone in 1844. It has been treated as a variety or subspecies of Juniperus phoenicea. Plants occurring in the Canary Islands have been treated as a separate species, Juniperus canariensis. DNA from populations previously assigned to J. phoenicea var. phoenicea and J. phoenicea var. turbinata was studied in 2013. It was found that the two taxa were clearly separated, and hence best treated as two species. No significant difference was found between Canary Island populations and other populations of J. turbinata. Distribution and habitat Juniperus turbinata has a native distribution from Macaronesia throughout the Mediterranean to the Arabian Peninsula. It is known from southwestern and southeastern Europe, North Africa, the Canary Islands and Madeira, and parts of western Asia and the Arabian Peninsula (Cyprus, the east Aegean Islands, Lebanon and Syria, the region of Palestine, the Sinai Peninsula and Saudi Arabia). It favours soils that are composed of sand, Cambrian limestone or volcanic rock.

It has a two-bay nave and single-bay chancel with a south transept all supported by buttresses. Above the gable of the wall of the nave is a small tower. The interior is from the 19th century. The church contains monuments to the families of Hood (Viscount Bridport) and their predecessors the Viscounts Nelson, who gained the title through Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. These include, on the chancel south wall, a commemoration of Alexander Hood, who died in 1814, which was designed and signed by Sir John Soane, with a black marble base topped by a white marble monument on Ionic columns framing the memorial plaque. Mounted on the north nave wall is a fragment of the altar cloth used in the Coronation Service of Queen Elizabeth II.

One World Trade Center=Background= Asher Edelman and his New York gallery, Edelman Arts, were chosen to curate the art of the new One World Trade Center building. The team decided all public art of the building should be abstract and focus on themes of unity. None of the art commissioned for One World Trade Center made any mention of the 2001 attacks, and instead focused on moving forward. Five artists, all Americans, were selected to create works for the new Skyscraper. Two paintings by the late American artist Fritz Bultman were also chosen to hang on the walls of the lobby. =ONE: Union of the Senses (2014) by Jos√© Parl√°= The lobby is dominated by Jos√© Parl√°'s 90 ft by 15 ft mural ONE: Union of the Senses, which is thought to be the largest painting in New York City. Parla, who had previously painted large scale murals in Barclays Center and Brooklyn Academy of Music utilized his trademark technique of blending elements of street art and calligraphy. The mural is noted for its use of bright colors, which according to Parl√° represent the diversity of people in New York City. =Lenape (2015) and Unami (2015) by Donald Martiny= Unami by Donald Matriny The lobby also contains two paintings, Lenape and Unami by Donald Martiny. The two works were the largest Martiny had ever created, and had to be completed on-site as they were too large to have fit through the building's door. Martiny spent two months working on the paintings in the lobby of the world trade center. About the process, Martiny said ‚ÄúUp to this point no one had ever seen me paint, I always paint alone. The Trade Center gets 25,000 visitors every day. That took a bit of getting used to.‚Äù Both works give the appearance of being giant paint brushstrokes, but were created by Martiny completely by hand without the use of a paintbrush, knife, or any other painting tool. Lenape was named after Lenape people, an indigenous tribe that once occupied the land that is now modern-day New York City. Unami was named after the Unami language, an extinct language spoken by the Lenape people. =One World Trade Center Series (2014) by Greg Goldberg= Seven oil on canvas paintings by artist Greg Goldberg are displayed in the 64th floor sky lobby. Each painting is five and a half by six feet, and was completed by Goldberg in his Connecticut studio. The paintings feature a wavy abstract colors. =Prana by Bryan Hunt= Bryan Hunt created the only public sculpture commissioned for the skyscraper. Prana, which means \\"life force\\" in Sanskrit, measures 13 feet by 5 feet and is on display in the east side of the 64th floor sky lobby. The sculpture is inspired by airships, Hunt saying \\"I just wanted something kind of weightless and gravity free.\\" =Gravity of Nightfall and Blue Triptych-Intrusion Into the Blue (1961) by Fritz Bultman= Abstract artist Fritz Bultman was the only deceased artist whose art was chosen for the World Trade Center Complex; all other works were commissioned and created specifically for the World Trade Center. Bultman, who died in 1983, was a member of a group of artists nicknamed The Irascibles along with Willem de Kooning Mark Rothko, and Jackson Pollock. The paintings are on display in the North Lobby of the building. =Randomly Placed Exact Percentages and Isotropic by Doug Argue= The paintings by Minnesota artist Doug Argue are hung in the front of the lobby. Both works incorporate Argue's style of blending elements of math and science into his paintings. 4 World Trade Center The new 4 World Trade Center was developed by Silverstein Properties, who appointed Robert Marcucci art consultant. Marcucci, along with the company's chief marketing officer Dara McQuillan, put forward the idea to create an art studio and gallery on the 69th floor of the building. =Memorial by David Uda= Irish artist David Uda was commissioned to paint a memorial to the victims on the floor of the 69th floor of the World Trade Center 4.

The MAPI is an important element for targeted corporate governance. Bengt Holmstr√∂m, with his economic research and his findings, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2016, laid the theoretical foundation for the application of a relative performance indicator. It states that top management should be incentivised with a long- term relative performance indicator for its variable compensation. In the context of a research project of the University of Zurich under the direction of Ernst Fehr, the MAPI was developed and implemented with the consultancy firm Fehr Advice & Partners. To do this, a listed company‚Äôs total shareholder return (TSR) is compared with the TSR of a customised, relevant peer group. This way external market shocks, for which the management should be neither rewarded nor penalised, can be excluded.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and Boulton & Paul Ltd and built from 1910 to 1960. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2016.  History  View of the school from Banks Street with Block B (left) and Block A (right), 2015 Newmarket State School (established 1904), located in the Brisbane suburb of Newmarket, approximately five kilometres northwest of the Brisbane central business district (CBD), is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. It retains an early Depression-era brick school building (1934, extended 1947) and a Boulton & Paul building (1954, extended 1955, 1956) set within landscaped grounds including a playing field, assembly and play areas, paths, and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with the Newmarket community. By 1900, the Queensland Government had achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children. Beginning with National schools and the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education, Queensland's national and public schools had grown from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875. Further standardisation of curriculum, training and facilities occurred when the State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p. 2Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. School facilities also provided a venue for a wide range of community events.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp. 4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, and standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy. Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 84, 120-1. Newmarket State School opened on 4 July 1904 with 135 children enrolled, four years after its school committee had formed and 40 years after the site was reserved for school purposes.Jan Veacock and Dorothy Jeffrey, \\"And a School was Opened at Newmarket, near Brisbane\\": A history of the Newmarket State School, 1904 to 2004, Newmarket State School P&C; Committee, Newmarket, 2004, p. 20DNRM, Survey Plan S3121. The school comprised a timber school building and a teachers residence on on the corner of Banks Street and Enoggera Road. The occupations of the pupils' parents in the enrolment register show the rural nature of the area - timber-cutter, dairyman, farmer, grazier, drover, horse-dealer and tanner.Newmarket SS, Newmarket State School 1904-1979, n.p. European settlement of Newmarket commenced when country allotments were sold as farmland in the 1860s. In 1877 the Newmarket cattle saleyards, bounded by Enoggera, Newmarket and Wilston roads and Alderson Street, commenced operations. Two years later the Newmarket Hotel opened opposite, on the (southeast) corner of Enoggera and Newmarket roads. A post office to serve the district opened in 1888. The opening of the Enoggera railway line from Mayne Junction to Enoggera in 1899, with a station at Newmarket, boosted suburban development.'Enoggera Railway Branch Line Completed', The Telegraph, 1 Feb 1899, p. 6. A police reserve of one acre was excised from the School Reserve in 1900,DNRM, M33.3209GG1900.2.1274. signalling growth of the area. Newmarket State School continued to grow in conjunction with suburban expansion in the surrounding area and suffered serious overcrowding in the early 20th century. The Kelvin Grove tram along Enoggera Road reached Newmarket Road by 1904, promoting suburban and industrial development. Local employment was offered at sawmills and the Newmarket brickworks (1912-). In 1911 Newmarket's population was 721 people but two years later there were 419 children enrolled at the school. Further extension of the tram line along Enoggera Road, to a terminus at Banks Street in 1926, brought it right to the school and a shopping centre developed adjacent to the tram terminus.'The Erneton Estate', The Brisbane Courier, 30 Jan 1904, p. 8Veacock and Jeffrey, A History of the Newmarket State School, p. 40Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", p. 4 In 1929, the suburb of Newmarket was described by The Sunday Mail newspaper as resembling:'Do You Know Your Brisbane? Newmarket - Suburban and Rural', Sunday Mail, 9 Jun 1929, p. 24. > \\"a prosperous country district [with] scrub-covered spaces, large > residential properties, industries, cattle saleyards, and railway [giving] > it the appearance of a country township of quiet importance....

The breeze- > swept ridges command[ed] delightful views of the outlying purple-shrouded > ranges to the north and west, the picturesque Enoggera Creek flow[ed] > quietly through the greater part of the district\\". The population of the suburb was estimated at 4000 and attendance at the Newmarket State School was about 500 children. The 1930s brought changes to Newmarket and its school. Further residential subdivision was promoted by the closure of the Newmarket Saleyards when they relocated to Cannon Hill in 1931. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders and also embarked on an ambitious and important building programme using day labour and Queensland materials, to provide impetus to the economy.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp, 6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p. 2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work programme by the Department of Public Works (DPW). This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p. 5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p. 5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930', p. 15. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 58. The levelling and clearing of Newmarket State School's grounds was an ongoing project during the 1930s. Past students recalled that men were employed on the excavation of the Newmarket State School oval and filling the gully, under the Unemployment Relief Scheme. In 1932, three men were given two day's relief work clearing lantana and stumps from the school grounds.Veacock and Jeffrey, A History of the Newmarket State School, pp. 47, 52. A concrete cricket pitch was completed in 1932, laid down entirely by voluntary labour and was subsequently available for hire to the public.'School Welfare Association', Brisbane Courier, 13 Sep 1932, p. 5'Prepaid Advrts', The Telegraph, 13 Sep 1932, p. 16. Fundraising fetes and balls for the beautification of the school surroundings took place.'Newmarket State School Fete', Brisbane Courier, 23 Oct 1932, p. 16'Annual Ball', Brisbane Courier, 7 Aug 1933, p. 19. During 1933 the School Welfare Association raised for school improvements.'New School at Newmarket ¬£600 Raised by Committee', Sunday Mail, 1 Jul 1934, p. 5. In 1939 two new tennis courts were opened.Veacock and Jeffrey, A history of the Newmarket State School, p. 52. However, it was the decision by the Department of Public Instruction to address the inadequacies of the school and its need for additional accommodation, by erecting an entirely new building, which transformed the school.Veacock and Jeffrey, A history of the Newmarket State School, p. 47. Subsequently, between 1933 and 1934 a new brick building was constructed at Newmarket State School, facing Banks Street. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public works building programme designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building programme included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p. 8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p. 7'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p. 2. Many of the programmes have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland, including the construction of masonry brick school buildings across the state. Most were designed in a Classical idiom as this projects the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. The construction of substantial brick school buildings in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation.Building type E/B1, according to Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.111-12. The Department of Public Works and Department of Public Instruction were extremely enthusiastic about the Depression-era brick school buildings. They were considered monuments to progress embodying the most modern principles of the ideal education environment.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 59. The Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical layout and prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of previous timber buildings being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah or corridor on the north side, but little concession was made for this and almost all brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft, where one existed, was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 55-6. Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were derived from contemporary tastes and preferences, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; and Neo-classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, aesthetic treatment, and climatic-responsive features.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans. The Chief Architect during this period was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966), who was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department from 1910 to 1951, and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951.Ayr State High School School, QHR 601574. The DPW architect involved in the design of Newmarket State School was Arthur J Moase.DPW plan 76C-18-3-1. \\"Newmarket Brisbane, Additions to State School\\", 1933. Constructed in three stages, it was intended that the first section of the Newmarket State School's new brick building would be the nucleus of a building scheme to accommodate 1038 pupils. The complete scheme was to be:DPW, Report of the DPW for the year ended 30 Jun 1933, Qld Govt Printer, Brisbane, 1933, p. 10.DPW, Report of the DPW for the year ended 30 Jun 1933, p. 10. > \\"of brick construction, two storeys in height, having an overall length of > about 288ft [87.78 m], including the attached lavatory blocks at each end. > The footings will be of concrete, the walls to the height of mould sill > course will be faced brick, above which the brickwork will be rough-cast > externally.

Keyed brickwork on the external walls indicated locations where the building was planned to be extended at a later date (still visible on the northern elevation). This situation was not uncommon, and occurred with other public buildings designed to be constructed in stages. Some examples are the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School), the State Government Offices, Townsville and the Depression-era brick school building at Ipswich North State School.Photo of completed building, DPW, Report of the DPW for the year ended 30 Jun 1934, p.29DNRM: 1936 aerial ref: ADA5-5754.Rear view of Block A, 2015Newmarket State School's new brick school building (now called Block A) was opened on 30 June 1934 by the Minister for Public Instruction (Frank Cooper).'New School at Newmarket ¬£600 Raised by Committee, Sunday Mail, 1 Jul 1934, p. 5. It was a two-storey masonry building, constructed from red brick with a darker brick base and pale stucco treatment to the upper floor. It had a hipped roof with gables over the entrances and a prominent ventilation fleche. The main entrance was through a portico with three round arches. Gables featured a half-timbered ornamental effect, utilising timber, fibre-cement panels and terracotta tiles. The building contained 13 classrooms, a head teacher's office, and retiring rooms on both floors. Circulation was provided by an internal staircase at the eastern end and an external timber staircase attached to the western wall. Windows on the southern elevation were protected by terra-cotta tile-clad window hoods. Landscaping in front of the new building including a row of fig trees along the Banks Street fence line (two of which survive), and the laying out of pathways.DPW plans: 76C-18-3, 76C-18-3-1, 1933 Externally, Block A adopted an Arts and Crafts-style decorative treatment, reminiscent of early 20th century brick schools such as Ascot State School (1920), Windsor State School (1915) and Wooloowin State School (1914), giving it a domestic quality quite different to the more imposing Neo-Classical style brick schools from the Depression-era. With its half-timbered gables, round arches to the entrance portico, and lack of undercroft play space, Newmarket State School is most similar in plan and style to Mackay Intermediate School (now Mackay Central State School), also completed in 1934.Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", pp. 7, 9Queensland Heritage Register entries 601911 Mackay Central State School, 600991 Windsor State School, and 601565 Wooloowin State School. In 1936, the 1904 timber school building was relocated on the site, nearer to the police reserve and perpendicular to Enoggera Road. A donation of was made by a local resident for the building to be re-erected as an up-to- date hall suitable for school functions. It was handed over to the school committee for this purpose in July 1937.'Newmarket SS, The Telegraph, 12 Jul 1935, p. 6'Newmarket SS', The Courier-Mail, 11 Apr 1936, p. 7'Dispute about Painting', The Telegraph, 1 Jul 1937, p. 11. After the former school building site was cleared of its entrance pathway and ornamental trees to build tennis courts, a row of mature trees along the southern edge of the Police Reserve, including fig trees, became the only surviving remnant of the original school planting scheme.DNRM: 1936 aerial ref: ADA5-5754Brisbane City Council PD Online, 1946 aerialDPW plan 228A-40/3, \\"Additions to school and installation of sewerage to school and residence\\", 1944. World War II contingencies had similar impacts upon Newmarket State School as on other Brisbane schools, but during that period the school gained improvements to its facilities. School tennis courts were opened in 1941 by the Minister for Public Instruction, Harry Bruce,'School Tennis Courts', The Courier-Mail, 6 Dec 1941, p. 6. and in 1944-1945 a playshed was erected at a cost of , as Block A had no undercroft for this purpose.DPW plan 228-377_Proposed Playshed_1944_15430316'Shelter Shed for Newmarket School, The Telegraph, 28 Sep 1944, p. 2. In August 1945, the George Taylor Memorial Library was housed at Newmarket State School and opened by Keith Morris, MLA.'School Leaving Age of 17 Advocated', Sunday Mail, 26 Aug 1945, p. 5. The post-World War II period was a time of enormous population growth Australia-wide and was accompanied by a shortage of building materials. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education for the \\"baby boom\\" that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, Jan 2008, pp. 28-31. After World War II the overriding concern for the Department of Public Instruction was the need to build school buildings as expeditiously and economically as possible. Queensland schools were faced with enormous overcrowding and a lack of resources. However, the Queensland Government and community saw education as a low priority and provided the department with only a small budget.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 46. At Newmarket State School, additional classrooms were required to accommodate the growth in pupil numbers: 728 in 1954; 837 in 1956; rising to its peak of 919 pupils in 1958.Veacock and Jeffrey, A History of the Newmarket State School, pp. 53, 56. Although other brick Depression-era buildings were built in stages and completed as many as 10 years later, this did not occur at Newmarket State School, despite its accommodation needs in the post-World War II period. Extension of brick buildings was made difficult by material shortages, and by the 1950s Newmarket State School had already experienced this situation. In September 1945 the addition of a toilet block to the eastern end of Newmarket's Depression-era brick school building had been authorised and an order placed for common and face bricks, but these had not been supplied ten months later.'Brick Lack Holds Up School Work', The Courier-Mail, 27 Jul 1946, p. 3. The toilet block was finally constructed in 1947.Veacock and Jeffrey, A History of the Newmarket State School, p. 53.Block B from the south-west, 2015Instead, in 1954 a timber Boulton & Paul Building was constructed, comprising two classrooms (now called Block B).Building type F/T1, according to Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.114.Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", pp. 4, 8. Responding to materials shortages and the pressures of the baby boom, the Department of Public Works imported a British prefabricated building system from manufacturers Boulton & Paul Ltd of Norwich. Based on an planning and construction module, the prefabricated elements in the Boulton & Paul system included wall panels, ceiling panels, roof trusses and banks of awning windows. The buildings were constructed at many schools across Queensland between 1952 and 1958.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 73-4While ordered in 1951, delivery of the Boulton & Paul classrooms was delayed, with the first classrooms constructed from mid-1952 to meet immediate accommodation requirements and those of the upcoming 1953 school year. Department of Public Works Annual Report, 1952, pp.4-5. Boulton & Paul buildings were timber-framed and clad, had a verandah as circulation, and a gable roof. Ideally, they were orientated so the verandah faced north and the classroom faced south but were also added as extensions to existing buildings regardless of orientation. The building could be high or low-set and had extensive areas of timber framed awning windows, providing more glazing than had ever been used in Queensland classrooms; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed, providing excellent natural ventilation and lighting. The classrooms were , larger than most previous classrooms.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 45. The flexibility of the system meant that the number of classrooms constructed could vary to suit the needs of a particular school. In some cases, Boulton & Paul classrooms were used to form long, interconnected blocks, such as at Geebung State School (1951‚Äì55), Dalby State High School (1954) and Indooroopilly State High School (1953-54).Project Services, \\"Geebung State School\\", 2007Project Services, \\"Dalby State High School\\", 2007Project Services, \\"Indooroopilly State High School\\", 2007. The Boulton & Paul building at Newmarket State School was located to the north of the Block A, aligned parallel to it and overlooking the playing field. The access stairs and verandah, which had glazed screen walls at either end, were on the north side of the building, and a retaining wall was constructed along the southern side of the partially-enclosed understorey. The walls were constructed from prefabricated units, wide, with those on the north and south sides containing large areas of windows. Units were pre-clad with chamferboards, with the edge of vertical timber boards between each unit visible on the exterior. On the interior, walls and ceilings were lined with flat sheeting.Department of Public Works Plan 228-789-2-2, \\"Newmarket S. S. Additional Classrooms\\", January 1954. As the school population continued to rise, more classrooms were required. Extensions to the Boulton & Paul Building were made in 1955 with two classrooms added to its western side. This extension was designed by the Department of Public Works to match the Boulton & Paul section, and illustrates the influence that the Boulton & Paul buildings had upon subsequent school building designs. Immediately after their introduction, DPW developed a standard building which was similar to the Boulton & Paul building but was constructed in the traditional manner. This type adopted many of the Boulton & Paul design features, such as a covered play space under the classrooms and the extensive areas of glazing, but became permanent structures. These architectural features became characteristic of a class of building which was the dominant school type constructed in the 1950s.Department of Public Works Plan 228/621, \\"Newmarket S. S. Additional Classrooms\\", December 1954Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.116. The 1955 extension utilised the same plan, dimensions and construction module as the Boulton & Paul section, however it is unclear if any pre-fabricated components were also used. As the walls were not constructed from pre-clad units the external chamferboard cladding had a more traditional appearance. The glazed screen wall at the western end of the Boulton & Paul verandah was relocated to the end of the extension and a doorway was inserted to link the adjoining classrooms of the two sections. Seating was provided in the understorey, which was partially enclosed by walls with areas of louvres. The retaining wall along the south side of the block was extended and a set of concrete steps linked the understorey to the playground behind.Department of Public Works Plan 228/621, \\"Newmarket S. S. Additional Classrooms\\", December 1954. In 1956 the building was extended again, on the eastern side of the Boulton & Paul building. It comprised two classrooms, a teachers room, store room, and a passageway linking the north verandah to the playground on the southern side. This extension also matched the design and dimensions of the earlier sections. Major changes were made to the understorey at this time, including the construction of brick toilet blocks at each end and a small store room, and the relocation of seating. The ground around the block was concreted and new sets of steps constructed between the different playground levels and to the rear of Block A.DPW 228-621 Additional classrooms, 1954, Plan 15430349Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", pp. 4, 8.

In spite of these new additions, further space was required, and in 1956 the playshed was enclosed and converted for use as classrooms.'Brick lack Holds Up School Work', The Courier-Mail, 27 Jul 1946, p. 3DPW plan 228-679, 'Proposed Temporary Accom'n in Playshed', September 1956. A tuckshop was constructed beneath the Boulton & Paul Building in the 1950s. Over the course of the school's history, buildings have been added and removed to meet the school's requirements. In 1958, temporary classrooms were moved to Newmarket State School from Junction Park State School and located near the teachers residence on Banks Street.Veacock and Jeffrey, A history of the Newmarket State School, p. 56. Also in 1958, the 1904 timber school building, which had been used as a hall for over 30 years, was sold for removal.'New School at Newmarket ¬£600 Raised by Committee, Sunday Mail, 1 Jul 1934, p. 57. After the establishment of the Newmarket State High School in 1963, adjacent to and west of the State School in Banks Street, the temporary classrooms from Junction Park State School were used by the high school and removed after that school's closure in 1996. In 1977 the teachers residence was demolished.Newmarket SS, Newmarket State School 1904-1979, n.p The playshed, next to the tennis courts, was demolished between 1987 and 1992.

In the 1990s, wrought iron gates, believed to have come from the Queensland Trustee's Building in Queen Street, were recovered from the grounds, cleaned and erected in the main entrance portico. This followed requests in 1936 and 1940 from the school to Department of Public Instruction for assistance to erect pillars at the school's entrance from which to hang the gates.Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", p. 8. Alterations to the interior include the removal of all but one set of timber folding partitions, and the insertion of new partitions to some classrooms and office areas. Former hat rooms have been enclosed to form office or storage space, and some ground floor ceilings have been relined.EHP site visit, 19 November 2015. Block B has had some alterations over the years, however the central (Boulton & Paul) and western (DPW) sections remain fairly intact, apart from the enclosure of the western verandah end and modification to some internal partitions. Having undergone a series of renovations since 1999, the interior of the eastern (DPW) section has been heavily modified and is not considered to be of heritage significance. The understory has had further enclosures constructed along the southern edge. Changes to the school grounds have also occurred since WWII. These included the construction of stairs to the oval (the current concrete stairs date from the 1960s, replacing an earlier set).Project Services, \\"Newmarket State School\\", p. 8DNRM 1969 aerial, ref: QAP1874-106. Additions made to the Newmarket School Reserve when it increased to in 1963-4 included the extension of the playing field to its west, as part of works relating to the opening of the Newmarket State High school. Much of the bank excavated during the 1930s along the southern edge of the oval was removed or altered at this time.DNRM Survey Plan Sl.4345DNRM Survey Plan Sl.5619, DNRM 1969 aerial, ref: QAP1874-106. New tennis courts and a shelter shed were completed between 2002 and 2004.'New School at Newmarket ¬£600 Raised by Committee, Sunday Mail, 1 Jul 1934, p. 57 More recent buildings added to the school grounds are located along the Banks Street boundary and around former netball courts in the southeast corner. In the area in front of Block A's entrance portico garden beds have been created, early paths have been paved or laid with bitumen, and several memorials have been established. Anniversary celebrations have been held by the school to mark its milestones. In 1954 for the school's 50th anniversary the first school principal conducted a roll call of foundation students; a fancy dress ball for students was held with an attendance of nearly 1000 children and 500 adults; and a greeting card featuring an illustration of the school by H Williams was produced.Veacock and Jeffrey, A History of the Newmarket State School, p. 64. The 75th anniversary celebrations in 1979 involved publication of a school history, a recreated 1904 classroom and a festive event opened by the Governor of Queensland, Sir James Ramsay. 90th anniversary celebrations were held in 1994. For the school's centenary in 2004, a comprehensive school history was published.Veacock and Jeffrey, A history of the Newmarket State School, p. 64. Newmarket State School 1904-1979.

Recently painted murals depicting Block A are located within the school grounds (beneath Block B) and on a bus shelter on the corner of Enoggera Road and Banks Street (the former Newmarket Air Raid Shelter). In 2015, the Newmarket State School continues to operate from its original site. It retains its 1934 Depression-era brick school building and its 1954 Boulton & Paul Building with DPW extensions, set in landscaped grounds with tennis courts, playing field and mature shade trees. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. Since establishment, Newmarket State School has been a key social focus for its community with the grounds and buildings having been the location of many social events.  Description  Site map, 2015 Newmarket State School occupies a site on the corner of Enoggera Road and Banks Street in the suburb of Newmarket, five kilometres northwest of the Brisbane CBD. The school buildings are located along the southern boundary, parallel to Banks Street, at the highest point of the school grounds, which slope down from Banks Street towards the north. A steep, rocky bank separates the school buildings from a playing field, which occupies the northwest portion of the grounds. The site is bounded by residential properties to the west and north, with a small section of the northern boundary adjacent to Kate Street and an entrance from Trackson Street. A former police reserve and house occupies the corner of Enoggera Road and Kate Street (now a private residence). The most prominent building on the site is a Depression-era brick school building (Block A, 1934, extended 1947) which fronts Banks Street. Behind Block A is a block of 1950s timber classrooms (Block B, 1954, 55, 56), of which the central pair are an imported Boulton & Paul building. The school grounds contain a number of significant mature trees, and landscaping features include earthworks, assembly and play areas, sporting facilities, and paths. = Depression-era brick school building (Block A) = The Depression-era brick school building is a long, two-storey building, orientated east-west and set back from Banks Street, fronted by pathways, gardens and mature trees. Asymmetrical in plan, the main entrance is located at the western end of the building, occupying a gable-roofed projecting bay. A classroom wing extends to the east with a secondary entrance in a projecting bay at the end, and a two-storey 1940s toilet block extension forms the far eastern end of the block. West of the main entrance, the original building extends the width of one classroom, with a 1970s stairwell forming the western end. 1947 toilet block extension to Block A, 2015 Ornamented with an Arts and Crafts-style decorative treatment, the building is constructed from red face brick walls at ground level, which extend up to window sill height on the first floor. Above this, the walls are rendered in stucco. The base of the building is a plinth of darker brick capped with sloped brick coping. The gabled main entrance comprises an arcaded portico with three, semi-circular arched openings. The central opening is enclosed by a pair of wrought iron gates. Above the first floor windows, the main entrance gable is ornamented with horizontal and vertical pieces of timber to create a half-timbered effect, with a triangular section of terra cotta tiles at the peak. This half-timbering effect is repeated on the three other gables of the 1934 section. A horizontal band of render wraps around the building at ground floor window sill height. Render is also used to highlight the keystones of the three arched entrances of the front portico and lintels of ground floor doors and windows. The hipped and gabled roof is clad in corrugated metal sheeting, and the raked eaves are lined with timber. On the northern (rear) elevation, sections of keyed brickwork and a filled-in doorway indicate the location of planned extensions which never occurred. An original entrance door, accessed by concrete steps, is located at the eastern end of the classroom wing. A second entrance has been created from a previously filled-in doorway. Windows openings are regularly spaced and contain sets of timber, three-light casement windows with rectangular, three-light fanlights above. Ground floor windows on the southern elevation are sheltered by timber-framed hoods with hipped, corrugated metal-clad roofs and supported by solid timber brackets. Hoods are also located over one window and the original doorway on the north elevation. Original timber entrance doors are generally high-waisted with timber ornamentation and panes of obscure glass in the upper section, with the exception of the main entrance double door, which has a larger area of glazing. The hip-roofed 1947 toilet block extension is constructed from matching bricks and is a similar (though plainer) style to the original building. It has two entrances in the eastern wall, accessed by concrete steps, with high-waisted, timber board doors with four-light windows of obscure glass. It has tall windows openings fitted with glass louvres, which are divided by a central mullion. The brick stairwell extension (1974) at the western end of the building is constructed from a different type of brick (of a brighter shade of red). While it does contain some early, relocated timber entrance doors, this stairwell is not of cultural heritage significance. Internally, rooms are arranged along the southern side of the building, linked by a single long corridor on each floor. Two rooms are located on the north side of the corridors at the eastern end. A hall leads from the main entrance to the corridor and an original stairwell is located in the southeast corner. The ground floor contains six classrooms, two teachers rooms (on either side of the entrance hall) and a former hat room. The first floor contains seven classrooms, a teachers room and two former hat rooms. Several classrooms have been converted for use as office space and staff rooms, and the hat rooms enclosed for storage space. The 1934 stairwell has concrete stairs, metal balustrades with timber posts and top rails, and original timber doors. Internal walls are generally plaster-lined with simple skirtings, and classrooms retain timber picture rails. One set of original timber folding doors survives between two classrooms on the ground floor. The location of removed folding partitions is indicated by surviving bulkheads in other classrooms. Original ceilings are lined with flat sheeting and ornamented by timber battens forming a grid pattern. Square ventilation panels survive in first floor classroom ceilings but are now enclosed. Original timber double- hung windows and double doors with large, three-light fanlights remain in the internal corridor walls. An early school bell is fixed to a bulkhead in the ground floor corridor, and an honour board and memorabilia from the former Newmarket High School are displayed next to the 1934 stairwell. The 1947 toilet block is accessed from the eastern end of the corridors. Each level has girls, boys and teachers toilets, in generously-sized rooms with high ceilings. Walls are plaster lined and ceilings have timber battens. Most original timber partitions and doors are retained. = Boulton & Paul Building (Block B) = Block B from the north, 2015 Block B is a long, highset, timber- framed building with a gable roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. It comprises: a 1954 Boulton & Paul (B&P;) section in the centre (two classrooms); a 1955 DPW-designed section at the western end (two classrooms), and a 1956 DPW-designed section at the eastern end (two classrooms, passageway, teachers room and store room). Orientated east-west, the building has a verandah along the northern side, accessed by three sets of timber stairs (one to each section). Verandah, Block B, 2015 The exterior is clad in timber chamferboards. The B&P; section is clearly distinguishable from the DPW sections by the breaking up of the external cladding by the edges of vertical timber boards between each panel of the prefabricated wall units. Large areas of windows line the southern wall of each section - timber awning windows to the B&P; section and western DPW section; replacement aluminium double-hung sash windows with timber awning windows above to the eastern DPW section. Angled timber brackets support the roof overhang and the eaves are unlined. The end walls of the classroom level are windowless. The verandah has timber floors and large sections of bag rack balustrades. Part of the western end of the verandah is enclosed with chamferboard-clad walls, while the full extent of the verandah to the eastern DPW section is enclosed by chamferboards and areas of louvres above bag racks. Sections of early, horizontal timber rail balustrades survive in places, including to the western and central stairs. Original timber screens with square glass panes from the B&P; section survive: two panels relocated to the far western end of the verandah, and one panel at the eastern end of the B&P; section. The verandah ceilings are raked and lined with flat sheeting, with bulkheads between the B&P; and DPW sections. The B&P; section has exposed rafters aligned with joins in the wall panels. Verandah windows are timber-framed, double-hung windows with awning windows above. Surviving verandah doors include: half-glazed, timber double doors to the western DPW section and passageway of the eastern DPW section; and a half-glazed, single timber door to the B&P; section. The interior of the B&P; section is lined with panels of flat sheeting, without cover strips, on the walls and ceiling. Vertical members of the structural system are evident on the north and south walls, between pairs of windows. The dividing partition has been removed to form one large classroom, with its location evident in the ceiling lining. Non-significant interior elements include added partitions, modern cupboards and floor linings, and the kitchen fit-out. The interior of the western DPW section is similar to the B&P; section, but without the expressed wall structure on the north and south walls. A large opening has been created between the two former classrooms, and the door to the enclosed section of the verandah has been removed. The interior of the eastern DPW section is not of heritage significance, due to substantial alterations to the building fabric, including the re-lining of all walls and ceilings and the creation of new doorways and large openings. The understorey has a concrete floor, brick toilet blocks at each end, and an exposed, unpainted ceiling revealing the floor structure of the classrooms above. The building is supported on a variety of stumps, including round metal posts, square concrete piers and timber posts to the verandahs. Some early seating remains within the space. A concrete retaining wall runs alongside the building, adjacent to southern side of the block, and a set of concrete steps provides access to the concrete playground to the south. A ramp added to the southern side of the eastern DPW section is not of heritage significance. The southern side of the understory has been enclosed to create storage space. An early, chamferboard- clad timber partition remains between the B&P; and western DPW sections. A large mural, which includes a depiction of Block A, is painted along the northern wall of the enclosures. = Grounds = View across the playing fields, 2015 The school grounds contain mature trees, including two large fig trees (Ficus, sp.) along the Banks Street boundary, in front of Block A, and a row of four large fig trees and a kauri pine north of the tennis courts (along the former police reserve boundary), some of which, according to aerial photos, were planted prior to 1936. A mature Grey Gum (Eucalyptus sp.) is located to the west of Block B. Mature fig trees in north-east corner of the grounds, 2015 The area between Block A and Banks Street includes an early layout of pathways (now relined with concrete and bitumen) and a garden area that contains several memorials. A concrete panel, broken into two pieces and set into the gardens, features the metal lettering: \\"228\\" and \\"NSS\\". Extensive views of the surrounding suburbs and the Brisbane CBD can be obtained from Block A and within the school grounds. Block A, famed by the large fig trees, is a prominent feature in the area.  Heritage listing  Newmarket State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Newmarket State School (established 1904) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains a representative example of a standard, government designed Depression-era brick school building (1934, extended 1947) that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies, and a Boulton & Paul Building (1954) with Department of Public Works-designed extensions (1955, 1956) that were a response to acute building shortages and population growth in the post-World War II period; set in landscaped grounds with earthworks, assembly and play areas, sporting facilities, paths, and mature trees. The Depression-era brick school building and landscaping of the school grounds are the result of the State Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The Boulton & Paul Building, a type that was imported from Britain in the early 1950s, demonstrates the introduction and adoption of prefabricated systems by the Queensland Government during a period of rapid school expansion to cope with a large increase in student numbers. The Department of Public Works-designed extensions demonstrate the influence of Boulton & Paul buildings on subsequent Department of Public Works school designs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Newmarket State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools. These include: teaching buildings constructed to standard designs by the Queensland Government; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The school is a good, intact example of a suburban school complex, comprising a Depression-era brick school building and a Boulton & Paul Building with Department of Public Works-designed extensions. The Depression- era brick school building is a good, intact example of its type. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of Depression-era brick schools, including: its two-storey form; high-quality design with ornamental features from one of a variety of styles; face brick exterior; and prominent entrance bay. The building plan comprises a typical linear layout of classrooms, offices and store rooms, accessed by single long corridor. The toilet block extension (1947) is complementary to the 1934 building and respects the scale and design intention of the original plans. The Boulton & Paul Building is a good, intact example of its type, and clearly demonstrates the characteristics of a prefabricated building through the expression of its modular construction of wide wall panels. Other characteristic features of this type include: its timber-framed, lightweight construction; gable roof; verandah for circulation, with glazed screens at the ends; large areas of glazing to the north and south walls; classroom size of ; and flat internal wall linings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its substantial size, high quality materials, face brick exterior, elegant formal composition and decorative treatment, the Depression-era brick school building at Newmarket State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, which evoke the sense of progress and permanence that the Queensland Government sought to embody in new public buildings in that era. The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Standing on an elevated site and framed by mature fig trees, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area. Extensive views of the surrounding suburbs and of the Brisbane CBD are obtained from within the building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Newmarket State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established in 1904 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Newmarket children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Newmarket and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

It belongs to a group of ignimbrites that exist in the Central Andes and which includes the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex. The plateau covers a surface of ‚Äì with about of ignimbrite. The plateau features several putative vents, including Cerro Condor Nasa, Cerro Livicucho, Cerro Pascual Canaviri, Cerro Villacollo and Nuevo Mundo. The plateau was emplaced starting from 25 million years ago to the Holocene, when the Nuevo Mundo vent was active.  Geography and geomorphology  Los Frailes lies in the Eastern Cordillera of Bolivia, between the southeastern shores of Lake Poopo and the city of Potosi. It is a little-studied volcanic system. Los Frailes belongs to the Central Andean ignimbrites, which cover parts of southern Peru, southwestern Bolivia, northwestern Argentina and northeastern Chile and which contains the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex. Ignimbrites do not cover all of the terrain there, however, and in some places there is more than one ignimbrite. Where ignimbrites get emplaced is controlled by crustal fractures and lineaments, which are not always visible on the surface. Some better studied volcanic centres are Gal√°n and Cerro Guacha. The Los Frailes ignimbrite plateau covers a heart-shaped area of about or , which makes it one of the largest such plateaus in the world. The plateau has an average elevation of . It was emplaced over a pre-existent topography, which resulted in the ignimbrites having irregular thicknesses; they reach maxima of but on average the thickness is about . They consist of mostly welded tuffs with column-like joint structures; a total volume of has been estimated for the plateau, which is a large size. Several potential vents have been identified, such as Cerro Condor Nasa and Cerro Livicucho (both of which appear to be circular structures with post-ignimbrite extrusions) in the northern part of the field, and Cerro Pascual Canaviri, Cerro Villacollo and Nuevo Mundo in its southern part. Cerro Villacollo in the western sector of the plateau is a deep and wide collapse structure, and is accompanied by dacitic lava flows, whereas Cerro Pascual Canaviri and Nuevo Mundo are complexes of lava domes, the latter of which also contains ash deposits that have been in part transported away by wind. Lava domes and lava flows are widespread on their surface, and some volcanic necks contain mineral deposits.  Geology  At least since the Jurassic, the Nazca Plate has been subducting beneath the South America Plate at a rate of about . Volcanism does not occur along the entire length of the subduction zone; where the subducting plate descends into the mantle at a shallow angle volcanism is absent. There are thus three volcanic zones in South America, the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone. An additional volcanic belt, the Austral Volcanic Zone, is controlled by the subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate. The remoteness of many volcanic formations of the Central Andes and the often hostile weather conditions mean that many volcanic formations are poorly investigated. The basement beneath Los Frailes is of Paleozoic‚ÄìMesozoic age and covered by Miocene andesitic-dacitic volcanics; some of these have been dated to 11.6 and 20 million years ago. Pre-existent cracks in this basement may have formed the pathways for the magma that eventually gave rise to the Los Frailes ignimbrite to ascend. = Composition = Los Frailes has erupted rocks ranging from andesite to rhyolite. The main ignimbrite is of rhyodacitic composition and contains phenocrysts consisting of apatite containing monazite and zircon, biotite, ilmenite, orthoclase, plagioclase and quartz. The magmas appear to be partially derived from the mantle and partially as crustal melts, similar to other Central Andean ignimbrites.  Eruption history  The Los Frailes ignimbrites were erupted between about 13 and 2 million years ago, but volcanism associated with the plateau goes back 25 million years, whereas the youngest ignimbrite is dated to 1.52‚Äì1.522 million years ago. Several different stages of volcanic activity have been distinguished. * In the oldest stage of activity, the San Pablo and Kari-Kari systems were active. * Cerro Gordo was active 19.7 ¬± 0.6 million years ago. * Between 16‚Äì10.4 million years ago volcanism occurred at Cerro Carguaicollo as well as the Corona-Anaruyo and Larco ignimbrites, the last of which was erupted 16 ¬± 2 million years ago. Cerro Carguaicollo is dated to 10.45 ¬± 0.47 million years ago. Another centre, Cerro Sombrero Kollu, was active 11 million years ago. * The Condor Nasa-Livicucho system was active between 7 and 8 million years ago, while the main ignimbrite was emplaced about 2-1 million years ago. After the emplacement of the ignimbrites, lava domes and resurgent domes continued the volcanic activity in Los Frailes. Nuevo Mundo is the youngest eruptive system of the Los Frailes plateau; based on the position of its lavas with respect to moraines it must have been active within the last 11,000 years in the Holocene, perhaps even in prehistoric time.

She was a survivor of the Holocaust. Early life and war years Edith Hofmann was born in Prague in 1927; in 1941, aged 14, she was sent with her family to the Lodz ghetto in Poland. Her parents died within their first year there. When the Lodz ghetto was liquidated in 1944, Birkin was sent to the concentration camp at Auschwitz where she spent the rest of her time there working in an underground munitions factory. Birkin was liberated from Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, having survived a death march to the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. She returned to Prague at the end of the war to discover that none of her family had survived. > It was really I think the worst time of the war.

It was an initiative of Colonel Edward Bance, former Mayor of Southampton, and was opened by Edward Stanhope, Secretary of State for War, in 1890. With the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the 1st Hampshire AV became the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery, but the drill hall also became the home of the Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery in 1908.Norman E.H.

Both units were mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914, with the Hampshire RGA manning coast forts and the Hampshire RHA being deployed to the Middle East.Army List, various dates. After World War I, the Hampshire RGA resumed its coast defence role while the Hampshire RHA amalgamated with the Hampshire Yeomanry and evolved to become 378 (Hampshire RHA) Battery with its base in Southampton. It was renamed 218 (Hampshire RHA) Battery in 1937 and served as part of 72nd (Hampshire) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, during World War II.

She was empress consort of the Mughal Empire as the wife of fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir. Early life Born a Timurid princess, Nur-un-Nissa Begum was the daughter of Prince Ibrahim Husain Mirza, a descendant of Prince Umar Shaikh Mirza, second son of Amir Timur. Her mother was Princess Gulrukh Begum, the daughter of Prince Kamran Mirza, son of the first Mughal emperor Babur, and brother of the next emperor Humayun. She had a brother named Prince Muzaffar Husain Mirza, married to Akbar's eldest daughter Khanum Sultan Begum. In 1572, Gulrukh Begum lost contact with her husband Ibrahim Husain Mirza as he was forced to vacate Gujarat by Akbar. She fled to the Deccan with her children. Ibrahim Husain Mirza, who ultimately fled towards Multan, was captured by the royal officers. In 1573, he died while still in prison. On their way to Deccan, the ruler of Khandesh attempted to arrest Gulrukh Begum and her children when they passed through the country, but did not succeed in doing so. However, Nur-un-Nissa, who was two years old at that time, fell into his hands. When Akbar heard of this, he ordered to bring the ruler of Khandesh and Nur-un-Nissa Begum to court. After their arrival at the court, she was taken under Akbar's protection, and handed over to the guardians of the imperial harem. In 1577, Gulrukh Begum and her son Muzaffar Husain came back to Gujarat and renewed their rebellion. However, after some initial successes, Muzaffar Husain was captured by royal officers and was imprisoned. Following the imprisonment of her son, Gulrukh joined her daughter at Agra. Marriage In spring of 1593, Gulrukh Begum petitioned a request of her daughter's marriage with Akbar's eldest son Prince Salim Mirza. Akbar agreeded to her request, and this led to their betrothal. The marriage took place on the eve of 26 February 1593 at the house of Akbar's mother Empress Hamida Banu Begum. More than a year later, Akbar married his own daughter Khanum Sultan Begum to Nur-un-Nissa's brother Muzaffar Husain Mirza. On 28 August 1595, Nur-un-Nissa gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter. Nur-un-Nissa maintained relations of kinship with her sister-in-law, Khanum Sultan, and the latter too strictly observed the rules of courtesy and proper behaviour towards her. In 1614-15, Jahangir during his stay at Ajmer visited her mother Gulrukh Begum, who was ill at that time. During this time, Shaikh Farid Bhakkari, the author of \\"Dhakhirat-ul- Khawanin\\" was serving as a diwan of establishment to her.

The title of the Vice-Chancellor was established in 1851, first as Federal Chancellor Deputy, then formally as Vice-Chancellor in 1881. In order to provide a balance between languages and geographical representation, it became custom since 1895 to name a second Vice-Chancellor from a French-speaking canton if both the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor were Swiss-German. The second Vice-Chancellor became a permanent position in 1967. Unlike the Federal Chancellor, Vice-Chancellors are appointed by the Federal Council directly. After both Vice-Chancellors retired in 2005, a row erupted over language representation when Oswald Sigg was named successor to Vice- Chancellor and Federal Council spokesman Achille Casanova. With Federal Chancellor Annemarie Huber-Hotz and the other Vice-Chancellorship conferred to Corina Casanova (no relationship to Achille Casanova), the three key roles in the Federal Chancellery were held by Swiss Germans. Remarkably enough, though, when Corinna Casanova was elected Federal Chancellor three years later, the nomination of Thomas Helbling as her successor, another Swiss German, raised no such public criticism. At the time, the Tages-Anzeiger speculated that this might be due to the Latin cantons aiming for the post of Oswald Sigg, due to retire a bit later. Whether founded or not, the appointment of Andr√© Simonazzi in 2009 did indeed restore the language balance.

The brigade traces its lineage back to the formation of the 66th Anti- Aircraft Artillery Division () in October 1943 during World War II. The division was sent to the front in early 1944, and fought in Operation Bagration, receiving the Borisov honorific for participating in the capture of that city. From November it fought in East Prussia, receiving the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class for its actions there at the end of the war. Postwar, the division was relocated to Kirovabad in Azerbaijan, where it remained until it was disbanded in 1960. The 189th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment was formed from the division and soon became the 189th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. In 1973 the regiment was expanded into the 140th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade, deploying to Trzebie≈Ñ in Poland as part of the Northern Group of Forces. After the end of the Cold War, the brigade was relocated from Poland to Chita Oblast, being stationed at Domna from 1994.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 66th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division began forming on 6 October 1943 at the Moscow Anti-Aircraft Artillery Training Camp in Pavshino, under the command of Colonel Ivan Korotkikh. It was part of the Moscow Military District, and included the 1981st, 1985th, 1989th, and the 1993rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments. The formation of the division ended on 1 November. In April 1944, Korotkikh became seriously ill with pneumonia and was sent to a hospital in Moscow for treatment. He was replaced by Major General Sergey Sazonov, who command it for the rest of the war. In June, the division was relocated to the area of Smolensk and then Orsha, joining the 3rd Belorussian Front. It was operationally subordinated to the 31st Army, participating in the battles to capture Orsha, Minsk, Lida, and Suwa≈Çki during the year. The division covered the army in the crossing of the Neman in the area of Druskininkai and Bereshany. On 30 June, during Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive into western Belarus and eastern Poland, the division reached the Berezina River following a rapid advance by the 31st Army. After crossing the river on 1 July, the 66th fought in the capture of Borisov and was awarded the city's name as an honorific in recognition of its actions. On 12 November, the division was operationally subordinated to the 11th Guards Army, fighting in the capture of Vilkavi≈°kis and crossing the border of East Prussia near Eydtkuhnen. On 11 January 1945, the 66th was transferred to the operational subordination of the 2nd Guards Army, participating in the capture of Gumbinnen and Wartenstein. It was again transferred to the operational subordination of the 48th Army on 16 February, fighting in the capture of Shlobiten and then Braunsberg on 20 March in the Heiligenbeil Pocket. On 2 April, the 66th was withdrawn to the reserve of the front at Elbing. It was operationally subordinated to the 48th Army on 25 April in the Tolkemit area. For capturing Braunsberg, the 66th was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, on 26 April. Between 28 April and 8 May, it fought in the elimination of the German troops on the Vistula Spit and northwest of Elbing. Between 16 June 1944 and 9 May 1945, a period of eleven months of combat, the division was credited with 38 German aircraft destroyed and one downed, killing 3,094 soldiers, 25 artillery and mortar batteries, 118 pillboxes, sixteen command posts, nine automobiles, and 63 wagons. Additionally, it captured 402 German soldiers.  Postwar  On 18 June, the division was relocated by rail from Elbing to Minsk, in the area of Kodishi station, and became part of the Minsk Artillery Training Camp of the Minsk Military District. It was further relocated to Dagestan by 2 November, stationed in the area of Izberg and Dvigatelstroy as part of the reserve of the Transcaucasian Military District. The division transferred to the 4th Army at Alyat Pristan in 1946, and was moved to Kirovabad later that year. On 27 November 1948 the division received its battle flag. In accordance with a directive of 18 March 1960, the division was disbanded, and its personnel used to form a separate medium-caliber anti- aircraft artillery regiment, which later became the 189th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. Vehicles of the brigade moving to the Telemba training range Between 1 April and 1 August 1973, the 189th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment was reorganized into the 140th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade, inheriting the traditions of the regiment.

Life and work Okudzeto was born in Chicago, to an American mother and Ghanaian father and grew up between London, Chicago and Lagos. She received a bachelor's degree from the Slade School of Fine Art in 1995 and a master's degree from the Royal College of Art in 1997. Okudzeto continued with post-graduate studies in the independent study program at the Whitney Museum of American Art and is currently pursuing her doctoral studies in the program of cultural studies at the London Consortium and at Birkbeck, University of London. Her work incorporates writing, scholarly research and art practice within a wide range of mediums, including painting, film, installation and social sculpture to articulate her methodological practice of ‚ÄúAfro-Dada‚Äù. It explores global connectivity, modernity, and the relationships between Africa, the diasporas, and the rest of the world. Her work forges narrative connections between unexpected vectors, an ongoing exploration of identity politics, material culture and critical responses to previously overlooked socio-economic and political histories. Her installations are designed to represent forgotten or unnoticed forms of material and architectural culture as carriers of lost or hidden histories, especially stories about the genesis of contemporary West Africa and its diaspora. Interwoven into these broader themes are ideas such as economics as an archive of social relations and readings of Lacan in relation to race, performance and the gendered body. Okudzeto's practice locates unexpected juxtapositions in the material culture of post-independence West Africa's modernist narratives and her identity as a West African who is also a European and of U.S. American descent. Okudzeto has published a number of texts and peer reviewed essays and has served on the editorial board of the CAA publication Art Journal (2005‚Äì2009) and taught in a range of diverse fields, including African studies, art, architectural history at a wide range of institutions including The Kunsthistorisches Seminar, University of Basel (2015), at Harvard University (2004), Loyola University, Occidental College and the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung in Basel, Switzerland as well as institutions across Europe, West Africa and the USA. She was the 2018‚Äì2019 Visiting Professor at √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, where she taught a theoretical graduate research seminar \\"Counter-Histories of a Continent; Making, Mapping, Recovering and Reviewing\\" which \\"instead of outlining an ‚ÄúAfrican Art History‚Äù (asked) students (to) examine a history of Africa as constructed by artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers. This paradigm shift in research methodology attempts to ‚Äúcounter‚Äù stereotypes through an analysis of constructions of the image of Africa in the past 100 years, artifacts made both in and outside the geographical boundaries of the continent\\". Since 1998, Okudzeto has developed the ‚Äòconceptual drawing‚Äô workshops incorporating practical and theoretical approaches to drawing, most recently taught at Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts de Paris-Cergy (ENSAPC), The University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Yaba College of Technology as part of the international exchange program she organized as the ENSAPC visiting professor during 2018 and 2019). She is the founder and administrative Director of the partially-dormant NGO Art in Social Structures (AiSS), a donor member society run and funded by artists with the aim of creating and supporting heritage initiatives in Ghana. As Director of AiSS she co-organised and chaired Across the Board, a two-year project by Tate Modern in Ghana (2013‚Äì2014) that \\"provides an organic and experimental platform for emerging artists and explores recent artistic practices in Africa and its Diaspora\\", realized in collaboration with curator Elvira Dyangani Osei and the Nubuke foundation Ghana. She also served as a board member on the Global Agenda Council for the Role of the Arts in Society at the World Economic Forum, Geneva (2012‚Äì2014).

On 10 January 2020, police issued an arrest warrant for Maesiah Thabane in connection with the 2017 shooting death of Tom Thabane's estranged wife Lipolelo Thabane. Biography Born Liabiloe Ramoholi to Basotho people, she married Tom Thabane on 27 August 2017 at a ceremony held at Setsoto Stadium in Maseru. Controversy In May 2018, allegations arose that Maesiah Thabane Trust Fund Director Makarabo Mojakhomo and her husband, Ministry of Home Affairs officer Thabang Mojakhomo, had defrauded the organisation founded by the first lady of up to M200'000. On May 21, after Makarabo disappeared from police custody, Amnesty International published a plea for \\"urgent action\\", reporting, \\"Makarabo's family fear that she has been subjected to enforced disappearance given the history of such cases in the country involving security forces\\". After Mojakhomo's reappearance in South Africa in May 2019, she reported fear that the first lady has \\"powers to control the police and the judiciary so [she] would not get a free and fair trial with her in control\\". Thabane was also accused in September 2018 by Motlohi Maliehe, minister of tourism, environment and culture and chairman of the All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, of corrupt action. Maliehe was fired from his ministerial position after he claimed Thabane was \\"torpedoing government by seeking to control ministers and how they performed their duties\\" and \\"instigating the removal of ministers who refused to comply with her demands\\". Such actions have supposedly contributed to the fracturing of the ABC, one \\"clouded by\\" similar \\"disorderly behaviour\\". In response to Maliehe's allegations, Thabane cited frustration at \\"official bungling and government inertia\\", which \\"sometimes forced her to take matters into her own hands to ensure Basotho got [the] services they needed\\". She said she was particularly concerned about the lack of treatment available for cancer patients, as well as HIV/AIDS.

Biography Frederick Oakes Sylvester was born in Brockton, Massachusetts on October 8, 1869, the son of Charles Frederick Sylvester, a hardware dealer, and Mary Louise, who died two weeks after his birth. Sylvester's father did not encourage his son's artistic aspirations, and Sylverster as a boy sold newspapers to buy art supplies. He attended high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, and during the summer of 1887 he hiked around Massachusetts and Connecticut with a friend, camping out and sketching. He entered Massachusetts Normal Art School in 1888 and took the six-year Teacher's Course. His aunt Rebecca Noyes and his great-aunt Hannah Soule, descendant of the Mayflower Soules, financially supported him in this period. He graduated in 3 years with honors in public speaking and reading. From 1891 to 1892 he was the acting director of the Art Department of the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College at Tulane University, New Orleans. On December 25, 1891, Sylvester married Florence I. Gerry, a Fall River schoolteacher. They had two children: Dorothy Louise (b. 1894) and Kilburn Gerry (1899). In June 1892 Frederick O. Sylvester moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and took the position of art director at the Central High School. They lived at 5924 Horton Place, St. Louis. One of his pupils was Helen R. Rathbun. He also taught night classes at YMCA. In 1899 he was admitted to the Society of Western Artists and later became its vice- president. He was also member of the Two-by-Four Club, the Artists' Guild and the St. Louis Art League. The paintings of this period focus on the St. Louis' riverfront, specifically the area surrounding the Eads Bridge. In 1900 Sylvester exhibited twenty-five paintings of Eads Bridge at the St. Louis Exposition. By 1904 the paintings of the Eads Bridge amounted to over 100, and Sylvester became known as \\"the painter of the Eads Bridge\\". He was an impressionist documenting the growth of St. Louis' industrial life. In 1902 Sylvester went to work part-time for Principia, a young private school located at Page and Belt Avenues, St. Louis. In 1904 Sylvester won a bronze medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and a silver medal at the Portland Exposition. Takuma Kajiwara moved to St. Louis in 1905, \\"lured to the city partly by an offer of employment in a studio and even more by a desire to see the Mississippi River,\\" according to his obituary in the St. Louis Star- Times.\\"St. Louis Losing Kajiwara Because He Finds After 31 Years It Is Poor Soil for His Art,\\" St. Louis Star-Times, February 7, 1906, page 1 Kajiwara and Sylvester were friends. According to one account, their amity was \\"warm enough to cause them to cut wrists and mingle blood in a gesture of unity.\\" Sylvester designed a silver watch fob for Kajiwara showing an artist and a photographer clasping hands, and carrying, on the reverse side, the statement: \\"No East no West, But hand in hand, Life's Unity, To Understand, T. Kajiwara, from:, F.O. Sylvester, 1909.\\" Kajiwara did photographic work for The Great River, a book by Sylvester collecting his paintings of the Mississippi, published in 1911. Photos show the men painting together. Takuma Kajiwara and Frederick Oakes Sylvester at Elsah In 1906 Sylvester spent a period in Europe. Back from Europe, Sylvester started his second period, focused his paintings on the Elsah's area. Elsah is a historic river town in Illinois and Sylvester owned a summer home, Oak Ledge, there that he bought in 1902. With Elsah, Sylvester tried to move beyond impressionism and the urban subjects of before towards the spiritual values of nature. In 1986 Paul O. Williams published Frederick Oakes Sylvester, The Artist's Encounter with Elsah. Frequent guest at Elsah were Kathryn E. Cherry, who succeeded Sylvester as Principia art director, and Takuma Kajiwara. In 1906 Sylvester was awarded the Fine Arts Building of Chicago Prize by the Society of Western Artists. In 1909 and 1910 he served as president of the St. Louis Artists' Guild. In 1910 he exhibited 28 paintings in Columbia, Missouri, for the Art Lover's Guild and gave two lectures, Artists' Ideals and The Relation of Art to Life. In 1911 the St. Louis Art Museum held a major exhibition of 83 Sylvester paintings from the Elsah years. He died in St. Louis on March 2, 1915 and, according to his wishes, a boat set out from Elsah upriver to the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, where his wife and Kajiwara sprinkled his ashes on the water. Today Frederick O. Sylvester's paintings hang in a number of institutions and private homes in the St. Louis' area.

Symbatios was the son-in-law of the Caesar Bardas, the de facto ruler of the Byzantine Empire during the later reign of his nephew Michael III () . By 866, he held the rank of patrikios and the position of logothetes tou dromou. Despite his ties to Bardas, he was a leading member in the conspiracy that resulted in the murder of Bardas on 21 April 866, in hopes of succeeding him. When Emperor Michael III publicly justified the murder of Bardas on 26 May, he claimed that Symbatios and another high court official, the chamberlain Basil the Macedonian, had warned him that Bardas intended to depose him. However, Michael promoted Basil the Macedonian rather than Symbatios, who had to content himself with being named strategos of the Thracesian Theme. From there he rebelled in summer 866 against the growing power of Basil, along with the governor of the Opsician Theme, George Peganes. The rebellion was defeated in the following winter, and its leaders were arrested. Symbatios was mutilated, losing one eye and his right hand. He was publicly humiliated by being forced to beg for three days in the ta Laousou quarter, before being put under house arrest. When Basil the Macedonian deposed Michael III and became sole emperor in September 867, however, he lifted the banishment of Symbatios and the other rebels, and restored their property to them.
