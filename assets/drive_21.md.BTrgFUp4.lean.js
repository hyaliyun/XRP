If the delay is an integer multiple of samples, digital delay lines are often implemented as circular buffers. This means that integer delays can be computed very efficiently. The delay by one sample is notated mathrm{z}^{-1} and delays of N samples is notated as mathrm{z}^{-N} motivated by the role the z-transform plays in describing digital filter structures. If a delay is not an integer of a sample additional filters are applied to account for the fraction of delay different from an integer. Hence delay lines with non-integer delay are called fractional delay lines. Digital delay lines were first used to compensate for the speed of sound in air in 1973 to provide appropriate delay times for the distant speaker towers at Summer Jam at Watkins Glen in New York, with 600,000 people in the audience. New Jersey company Eventide provided digital delay devices each capable of 200 milliseconds of delay. Four speaker towers were placed from the stage, their signal delayed 175 ms to compensate for the speed of sound between the main stage speakers and the delay towers. Six more speaker towers were placed 400 feet from the stage, requiring 350 ms of delay, and a further six towers were placed 600 feet away from the stage, fed with 525 ms of delay. Each Eventide DDL 1745 module contained many 1000-bit shift register integrated chips, and cost the same as a new car. Digital delay lines are widely used building blocks in methods to simulate room acoustics, musical instruments and effects units. Digital waveguide synthesis shows how digital delay lines can be used as sound synthesis methods for various musical instruments such as string instruments and wind instruments.

He rose up the ranks of the Guominjun clique in the Warlord era but then went over to the Kuomintang, and held the position of military governor of Shandong from 1930 to 1938. Han had one wife, two concubines, and four sons.  Biography  Han Fuju was born in Dongshantai Village (), Ba County, Hebei Province. He had had little aptitude for schooling. Nonetheless, while quite young, he had worked as a clerk in his hsien (\\"county\\") until his gambling debts forced him to run away and enlist in the army of General Feng Yu-hsiang. Han rose quickly, from clerk to chief clerk, to lieutenant, to captain, and after an uprising, to major. During the warlord upheavals of the 1920s he emerged as commander of General Feng's 1st Army Group. = Governor = In 1928 he was appointed chairman (governor) of Henan province by Feng, and in 1929 he was confirmed in office and concurrently named commanding general of the 11th Division. When the Christian general revolted later in the year, Han declared his allegiance to the central government of Chiang Kai-shek. In the Central Plains War in 1930, Han fought against the rebel troops of Yen Hsi-shan and his former commander Feng Yu- hsiang in Shandong and was rewarded with appointment as governor of that province.Frank Dorn, The Sino-Japanese War, 1937-41: From Marco Polo Bridge to Pearl Harbor (New York: Macmillan, 1974), pg. 81-82 = Warlord = Han Fuju as a commander He took over Zhang Zongchang's role as the warlord in Shandong Province. In autumn 1932, unified the province after defeating the rival warlord Liu Zhennian, who controlled the eastern part of the province (in particular the sea port of Yantai) and was known as the \\"King of Eastern Shandong \\". As governor, Han was a stern disciplinarian with civil servants and the military. He had virtually wiped out banditry and traffic in narcotics in campaigns of suppression. Through commercial operations, principally in cotton, tobacco, and real estate, he grew rich and gave generously to schools, hospitals, and civic improvements.Dorn, pg. 81-82 In the mid-1930s he was the target of Japanese attempts to get him to incorporate his province of Shandong into one of the North China puppet states they were attempting to construct. After the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he commanded the 3rd Army Group and in 1937 was made Deputy Commander in Chief of the 5th War Area defending the lower Yellow River valley. Han was suspected of having conducted secret negotiations with the Japanese to spare his province and his position of power. When the Japanese crossed the Yellow River he abandoned his base in Jinan. Han abandoned his army on January 6 and fled to Kaifeng, where he was arrested on 11th and brought to Wuchang and was later executed by Chiang Kai- shek for disobeying orders from superior commanders and retreating on his own accord.Dorn, pg. 82 Chiang did this to set an example for those not following his orders. According to one account, Han Fuju was executed in the sanctuary of the Changchun Temple (), a Taoist temple at the outskirts of Wuchang (now, almost in the center of modern Wuhan) by a single pistol bullet fired into the back of his head by Chiang Kai-Shek's chief of staff, General Hu Zongnan.Stephen MacKinnon, \\"The Tragedy of Wuhan, 1938\\", Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 30, No. 4, Special Issue: War in Modern China (October , 1996), pp. 931-943 There are only second-hand accounts of the execution.Diana Lary, \\"Treachery, Disgrace and Death: Han Fuju and China's Resistance to Japan\\", War in History, 2006 =Career= *1928 - 1930 Chairman of the Government of Henan Province *1930 - 1938 Governor of Shandong *1937 General Officer Commanding 3rd Route Army *1937 - 1938 Commander in Chief 3rd Army Group *1938 Deputy Commander in Chief 5th War Area *1938 Arrested and executed at a military conference in Hankou for failing to defend Shandong  Personal life  Besides for his execution as a traitor, Han Fuju is remembered for his bad jokes and poetry.Diana Lary, \\"China's Republic\\", Cambridge University Press, 2007 According to Historian Diana Lary, one of his best known poems was about the Daming Lake in Jinan, though the same poem has also been attributed to Zhang Zongchang by newspapers such as the Beijing Evening News and People's Daily.

The casts themselves are a mix of adult and young adult performers. The programs began operating from space donated in a restaurant before moving to an abandoned fire station donated when the troupe affiliated itself with the social service agency Pillsbury-Waite Settlement House. It previously operated as an accredited school, The Children's Theatre Company and School, first as an \\"after school\\" component of the Twin Cities' Urban Arts program and, by the early 1980s, as its own accredited grade school and high school. Students were taught regular academic curricula for the first half of the day and then studied performance arts for the second half. The theater was founded by John Clark Donahue along with John Burton Davidson, Shirley Diercks, Martha Pierce Boesing and Beth Leinerson. Jon Cranny served as the theater's second artistic director from 1984 until 1997, when Peter C.

Poole was the 2009 keynote speaker at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute. In a major article in April 2009 about Obama Administration Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his role in the national and global financial crisis, William Poole was reported to have said that the Fed, by effectively creating money out of thin air, not only runs the risk of 'massive inflation' but has also done an end-run around Congressional power to control spending.

The heads of state of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe signed the agreement in Lusaka, Zambia on July 10, 1999. Negotiation Lusaka, Zambia Representatives from the Southern African Development Community, Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations met in Lusaka and drafted the ceasefire agreement from June 21‚Äì27, 1999. Defense and Foreign Ministers of the parties to the conflict then met from June 29 to July 7 to discuss the agreement. Zambian President Frederick Chiluba played a major role in the signing of the agreement in his role as Chairman of the Regional Initiative for Peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Treaty terms The parties agreed to halt all military operations within 24 hours of signing the agreement in Article I, clause 2, section c. Article I prohibited further military movement or the transfer of armaments to the battlefield and called on all nations to respect human rights and protect civilians. Article III released all prisoners of war in clause 8 and gave the International Red Cross the task of assisting the wounded in clause 9. Clause 11 requested the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The document also requested that the OAU establish a temporary peacekeeping force to combat militant groups until the UN force arrived. Mwesiga Laurent Baregu and Chris Landsberg of the International Peace Academy criticized this provision in 2003, saying the OAU had been overwhelmed and the SADC was better equipped to handle the burden. Implementation The United Nations Secretary General issued a report recommending the deployment of an observer mission in the DRC on July 15, 1999. The United States State Department announced its support for a peace mission on July 23. The MLC signed the agreement on August 1. Five days later the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1258 deploying military liaison personnel to the capitals of the signatories of the Ceasefire Agreement and established a Joint Military Commission to oversee its implementation. The Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) rebel group signed the agreement on August 31. The Security Council established the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) in Resolution 1273, passed on November 5, to January 15, 2000.

The concept developed alongside other major historic developments of European integration. History After World War II, the concept of a united Europe began to take shape. The ideas of a unified Europe varied in degree. Some envisioned a Federal Europe run by a European government and others merely aimed for an economic co-operation only to achieve a common internal market. The result today is somewhere in between these two extremes.Walter van Gerven, The European Union. A Policy of States and Peoples, Oxford, Hart 2005 As Europe merged politically, a common European tort law also emerged. In the middle of the 20th Century, European tort law was varied and a common European tort law was non-existent. Only in the beginning of the 21st did it start to take shape. Background The ideas on the harmonisation of European Tort Law also vary drastically. On the one hand there is a vision of a codification of European Tort Law as part of a European civil code. But on the other side of the spectrum is the idea that harmonisation should only be to the extent necessary for a functioning of the internal market. Once again, the current situation is somewhere in between. There are various developments occurring in this area. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has developed case law on the basis of general principles common to the laws of the Member States. The European Commission has also looked toward harmonisation by proposing to develop a so-called Common Frame of References. National courts and legislators are also becoming more prepared to look at foreign developments. These various developments demonstrate that although a convergent tendency is apparent at some points, differences between Member States remain substantial. This is not only in content but there are also differences in procedure, in legal culture, and in social, economic and political backgrounds.Cees van Damn, 2006, European Tort Law Oxford University Press. European tort law is not only about slowly growing harmony in certain respects but also about rich diversity in many others. Comparative Law In community institutions, such as the Council, the Commission and the Court, where lawyers from all Member States work closely together, different legal backgrounds inevitably play a role.Walter van Gerven, 'The Emergence of a Common European Law in the Area of Tort Law: The EU Contribution. Comparative law can thus be seen as a vital method in finding common ground and developing Union law. The courts however, usually confine themselves to general expression like 'legal principles common to all or several Member States.'Koen Lennaerts, Interlocking Legal Orders in the European Union and Comparative Law, ICLQ 52 (2003), 873‚Äì906 To acknowledge the existence of a general principle of law, the ECJ does not require that the rules be a feature of all the national legal systems. Rather, the Court merely finds that the principle is generally acknowledged and that, beyond divergences, the domestic laws of the Member State show the existence of common criteria. The highest national courts also show an increasing interest in and need for comparative information. Here it is used to avoid gaps between legal systems. As Lord Bingham notes; 'In a shrinking world there must be some virtue in uniformity of outcome whatever the diversity of approach in reaching that outcome'.Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd & Others [2002] 3 All ER 305 In this sense also, Comparative Law is a converging tool. European Union The legal framework of the European Union consists of the treaties, regulations, directives and case law. Specifically in the area of tort law, a number of rules can be found in tort law directives.Peter-Christian Muller- Graf, 'EC Directives as a Means of Private Law Unification' in Hartkamp et al. (eds), Towards a European Civil Code (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004). Examples of directives include the Product Liability Directive and the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices. A directives can be either a maximum harmonisation directives, which means member states are not allowed to deviate from it, or a minimum harmonisation directive, which only provide a general framework. Article 288 of the TFEU, however, concedes that a directive 'shall be binding as to the result to be achieved, upon each member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods'. Liability can also be based on the violation of community provisions. Article 288 of the TFEU explicitly regulates the liability of Community Institutions for damage caused by the breach of Union Law. This article does not give precise liability rules but refers to the general principles common to the laws of Member States. It does not mean that 'the Community judicature must search for a solution favoured by a majority of Member States ‚Ä¶. It simply means that the Community judicature must look to the national systems for inspiration in devising a regime of non-contractual liability adapted to the specific circumstances of the Community.''Ibid The development of a general principle of liability for breach of Union Law is also in the Francovich case law of the ECJ. In this 1991 decision, the ECJ acknowledged liability of the Member States towards individuals for violation of Union law as being inherent in the system of the Treaty and being necessary for the effectiveness of Community of law.ECJ 19 November 1991, Joined cases c-6/90 and C-9/90, ECR 1991, i-5357 (Francovich and Bonifaci v Italy) On the basis of the general principles to which Article 288 refers, the ECJ developed three requirements for liability: #The rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals #The breach must be sufficiently serious #There must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation resting on the State and the damage sustained by the injured parties. The fulfilment of these requirements is sufficient for a right to compensation, which is directly based in Union Law. European tort law in action There is a group of scholars, known as The European Group on Tort Law which was established in 1992. The group meets regularly to discuss fundamental issues of tort law liability as well as recent developments and the future directions of the law of tort. The Group has founded the European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law in Vienna. The Group has drafted a collection of Principles of European Tort Law similar to the Principles of European Contract Law drafted by the European Contract Law Commission. The full text of the Principles is available online at http://www.egtl.org/Principles. =Principles= # Basic Norm # General Conditions of Liability #* Damage #* Causation # Bases of Liability #* Liability based on fault #* Strict Liability #* Liability for others # Defences #* Defences in general #* Contributory conduct or activity # Multiple Tortfeasors # Remedies #* Damages Future Despite these efforts, there is still the preliminary question of whether harmonisation of tort law is feasible and desirable. There is argument to suggest that harmonisation is not as self-evident as it seems to be at first. Harmonization of tort law does not need only a formal legal basis but also a substantial justification.Van Gerven, W. ‚ÄòHarmonization of Private Law; Do we need it?‚Äô CMLR 41 (2004), 505. The need for harmonisation may be self-evident because the idea was that differences between the Member States were an obstacle to the achievement of an internal market. According to the ECJ, a measure of harmonisation must actually contribute to improving the establishment and functioning of the internal market. A harmonising measure therefore has to delineate the distortions that flow from the differences between national laws. Also, it would have to outline how the measures aim to prevent distortions. In any case, the advantages of these measures need to be balanced with the costs involved. There are two observations which may further question the desirability and feasibility of the harmonisation of tort law. Firstly, the harmonisation of tort law is hard to achieve without taking into account other compensation systems, such as private insurance and social security systems. These systems are strongly interconnected and it is undesirable to harmonise one without the others.Magnus, U (ed.), The Impact of Social Security Law on Tort Law,Vienna, New York; Springer, 2003 Secondly, harmonisation of tort law would also need harmonisation of administrative and criminal law. Most legal systems acknowledge the possibility to be liable for damage caused by the violation of a statutory duty. Hence, if there were to be harmonisation of the rules for breach of statutory duty, one should also harmonise the statutory rules that can be invoked as a basis for this tort. What is certain is that, an agenda for further debate must be pursued. Perhaps the focus should not be on Europe united by European rules, but rather on a Europe united in diversity with harmonised rules where needed and diversity where possible.

He played college football at the University of Florida.  Early years Ker was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was the only son of George and Anne Ker. His father George immigrated to the United States from Scotland, and had previously served in the British Army as a Buckingham Palace guard. When Ker was young, his family moved to Florida, and his father worked several jobs to support the family in Dunedin, Florida; running a lawn service during the day and working at a convenience store at night. After school, and during weekends and summers, Ker followed his father's steps with his work ethic. In the mid-1970s, George managed the kitchen at a sports restaurant in Clearwater, Florida, where Ker worked as a busboy while he was in high school. During school semester breaks and vacations, he also waited tables and cooked in the kitchen. Ker attended Dunedin High School in Dunedin. During his junior year in high school, he decided to become a professional football player. He had not played high school football before his junior year, but he started working out; after beginning high school at 145 pounds, he bulked up to 210. As a senior, he was named All-Conference and the Dunedin Falcons football team won a Pinellas County championship, but no Division I football programs recruited him to play college football. He graduated in 1980, but he wanted to play at a big school to improve his chances of being drafted in the NFL, so he worked out during the first year after graduation, adding another fifty pounds to his six-foot, four-inch frame.  College career  On the advice of a friend, Ker called the football coach at Arizona Western College who invited him to walked-on to the football team. As a sophomore, he was recognized as a junior college (\\"JUCO\\") All-American in 1982. The Florida Gators football coaches were convinced of Ker's talent and offered him a football scholarship to attend the University of Florida for his last 2 years of eligibility in 1983 and 1984. Ker's nickname among his Gators teammates was \\"Big Daddy,\\" and he could bench-press up to 515 pounds making him one of the strongest players in college football. He played two years for coach Charley Pell and coach Galen Hall's Florida Gators football teams. As a senior, he was a starter at right tackle on the Gator's 1984 squad that, at the time, was considered the finest Gators football team ever. The Gators' outstanding offensive line was called \\"The Great Wall of Florida,\\" and included Ker, Phil Bromley, Lomas Brown, Billy Hinson and Jeff Zimmerman. Behind the blocking of Ker and his Great Wall teammates, the Gators' quarterback Kerwin Bell, fullback John L. Williams and halfback Neal Anderson led the Gators to a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 overall win-loss record and won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship with a conference record of 5‚Äì0‚Äì1.The title was later vacated by the SEC university presidents because of NCAA rules violations committed by Charley Pell and the Gators coaching staff between 1979 and 1983, before Ker's arrival in Gainesville. He was recognized as a second-team All-SEC selection and an honorable mention All-American following the 1984 season. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Ker was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (76th overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft, as part of a change in the offensive line philosophy, when the team started to value size and strength over speed and athletic ability. He also was selected by the Tampa Bay Bandits in the 1985 USFL Territorial Draft. He was moved to guard, but only played five games as a 23-year-old rookie, after being placed on the injured reserve list with a back injury on October 23. In , he was named the starter at right guard after Kurt Petersen suffered a season ending left knee injury early in training camp. In , he was switched to left guard to replace Nate Newton, who was moved to right tackle. Ker became the Cowboys' highest-paid offensive lineman, and started in eighty-six of the Cowboys' ninety-one regular season games from to . =Denver Broncos= On March 27, , he was signed in plan B free agency by the Denver Broncos. He was placed on the injured reserve list during the pre-season and later started 10 games after being activated. He was waived on July 9, . =Detroit Lions= On August 20, , he signed with the Detroit Lions. He was released on August 27 and retired.

Young Chinese high-fin banded sharks normally possess brown bodies bearing three dark-colored slanting bands. During the breeding season, adult males are distinguished from adult females by their red coloration. Adult females are of dark purple color with a broad and vertical reddish area along the body. Juveniles of the Chinese high-fin banded sharks are also characterized by high and triangular dorsal finnage that extends up to the rear of the anal fin. The adult appearance is far less distinctive, as they are elongated in shape without the very high dorsal fin. The thick and fleshy lips bear small papillae without barbels. They have a single row of pharyngeal teeth that have comb-like arrangements. Through adulthood, Chinese high-fin banded sharks become darker in appearance. The characteristic pale bands found in young specimens disappear at a length of , and the species has been referred to as an \\"ugly duckling in reverse\\".

The film stars Ashley Judd and Luke Perry and was directed by John McNaughton. The original screenplay was written by husband-and-wife team Peg Haller and Bob Schneider.  Plot  Chris (Luke Perry), a young police officer meets the attractive and sexy Pamela (Ashley Judd) and immediately falls in love with her. Even her drug and alcohol problems cannot affect his mad love for her and they decide to marry. As the relationship continues, more problems arise. Their passionate love is accompanied by destructive fights and Pam's emotional problems start to surface. She shows no respect for Chris‚Äôs family members who are very important to him. Pam's also manipulative and exploits Chris‚Äôs love for her, leaving him to do all the chores and making him buy her expensive things until they are on the brink of bankruptcy. Trouble escalates when Chris loses his job after trouble with a fellow officer. To finance Pam's lifestyle, Chris decides to earn a living by robbing banks. Pam's fascinated with his bank heists and begs him to tag along. After having finally robbed enough banks to afford a house of their own, Chris decides to stop a life of crime, much to Pam's chagrin. Pam soon leaves Chris who quickly finds himself unable to live without her. Chris then agrees to start robbing banks again, which proves to be fatal for the duo.  Cast  * Ashley Judd as Pam Anderson * Luke Perry as Chris Anderson * Bruce A. Young as Agent Parker * Jim True-Frost as Mike Anderson * Penelope Milford as Adele Anderson * Edmund Wyson as Darren * Kate Walsh as Cindy Anderson * Tom Towles as Frank Anderson  Production  Producer Steven A. Jones read an article about Jeffrey Erickson, a suspected bank robber whose wife Jill led the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a chase through 12 different suburbs, with a machine gun hanging out of the window of her van, when they came to capture him, which led to a huge gun battle. She ended up dead, ostensibly taking her own life after she was wounded. He read another article related to the case in the New York Times, and, knowing the author of the articles, tried unsuccessfully to contact him. The rights to the story had already been purchased by someone else, but coincidentally Jones received a screenplay about the couple from the husband-and-wife screenwriting team of Peg Haller and Bob Schneider and producer Richard Maynard, and they agreed to work together. The William Morris talent agency said Luke Perry was interested in the lead role, and they also suggested Ashley Judd for the female lead. Perry was well known for the television series Beverly Hills, 90210 and Spelling Entertainment were willing to put up the money to make the film. The distributor New Line Cinema were optimistic about the film at first. However, test audiences were not expecting a crime drama, instead they expected a Luke Perry movie to be similar to 90210 and reacted negatively. New Line declined to release the film. After director John McNaughton complained in the press, they gave the film a limited release for a week in New York and Los Angeles, and then the film went to HBO.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 10 reviews. James Berardinelli in his article on reelviews.net: \\"Luke Perry, giving the most convincing performance of his career to date, makes it clear how desperately, hopelessly smitten Chris is by his wild, troubled wife.\\" And finally: \\"By depicting the sham of 'normality,' Normal Life reminds us how fictitious and unattainable the 'American dream' can be.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4, called the film \\"fascinating in its portrait of criminal pathology\\" and praised the casting. Peter Sobczynski writes in an article titled \\"A Good Ashley Judd Film? Believe It or Not!\\": \\"[...] her single greatest performance-indeed, one of the strongest bits of film acting that you are ever likely to see-was in what probably remains the most obscure and least-seen film of her career, John McNaughton's 1996 masterpiece Normal Life.\\" Home media The film was released to DVD in February 2005.

Poictiers was part of a squadron of 12 ships that shared in the capture on 13 and 14 March of Christina and Massatoit. Poictiers fired a few ineffectual shots. The position of the channel made it necessary for Yankee to pass close to Poictiers On 4 (or 5) July 1813 the American smack Yankee captured the brig Eagle, which was serving as a tender to Poictiers. The Americans put 40 militiamen on board Yankee and sailed her where Eagle was known to be patrolling. The militiamen concealed themselves while on Yankees deck there were three men dressed as fishermen, and a calf, a goose, and a sheep were tethered. When Yankee encountered Eagle, Eagle fell for the bait of fresh meat and came alongside. The Americans, under Sailing-Master Percival, came out of hiding and fired their small arms. Although Eagle carried a brass 32-pounder howitzer loaded with canister, she was unable to get off a shot. The Americans then took Eagle into New York. Eagle had two men killed, including her commander Master's Mate H. Morris, and Midshipman W. Price mortally wounded. The remaining eight seamen were taken prisoner.

In addition to these commercial prizes, Poictiers took three American armed vessels.http://nauticalscribe.com/PDF/NorfolkPrivateers.pdf The first, on 25 December, was the brig Herald, a 10-gun letter of marque. Herald was pierced for 16 guns and had a crew of 50 men. She had been sailing from Bordeaux to Baltimore.Lloyd's List, 12 February 1813. Poictiers was again in company with Acasta and Maidstone. Herald, prior to herself being captured, had taken a ship, a brig, and a schooner. The cargo of the ship Friendship alone had an estimated value of US$400,000. Next, Poictiers took the American schooner , of five guns and 72 men, on 9 January 1813. She was on her return from the West Indies, where she had made several captures. Under the command of Captain Jeremiah Grant, Highflyer, of Baltimore, had captured two ships, four brigs, one schooner and one sloop; three of these vessels had been armed. The Royal Navy took Highflyer into service under her existing name. The third privateer was Yorktown, of 20 guns and 140 men. The actual captor of York Town was Maidstone, with Poictiers and Nimrod in company. Yorktown, under Captain T. W. Story, had taken 11 prizes, including Manchester before Maidstone captured her on 17 July 1813 after a four-hour chase. The British sent Yorktown and her crew into Halifax. These incidents aside, Poictiers had an uneventful war, though there is a record of one humorous incident. The exhibit center of the town of Lewes, Delaware, has a framed copy of a handwritten letter from Captain Beresford to the town's chief magistrate. Dated 16 March 1813, the letter says: Col. Samuel Boyer Davis, commander of American troops in Lewes, refused the demand, so on 6 and 7 April Beresford shelled the town, killing a chicken and wounding a pig. There is a cannonball from Poictiers lodged in the stone foundation of Lewes's Marine Museum. In November 1813 Poictiers was at Halifax, Nova Scotia preparing to escort a convoy of merchant vessels to England when a gale hit the city. It destroyed or damaged many vessels, though Poictiers was able to ride out the gale.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4833. Poictiers was at Chatham in 1814. Post war and Fate Poictiers underwent a \\"Large Repair\\" at Chatham between April 1815 September 1817. She was fitted at Sheerness as a guard ship between March 1836 and September 1837. She remained in that role at Chatham until March 1848 when she became a depot ship until 1850. In 1857 she was sold out of service and broken up, the breaking up being completed on 23 March 1857. Postscript Poictier's figurehead went to the small museum in Chatham Dockyard. In the 1920s, the figurehead was moved to Sheerness and placed on display inside the dockyard but towards the 1980s, the condition of the wood was such that the figure fell apart, leaving no single piece that could reasonably be salvaged for purposes of reconstruction. The pieces were therefore used, in conjunction with archive photographs, to carve a replica. Andy Peters was commissioned to analyse samples of the paint and to carry out the carving. He then created a sculpture that provides a record of the figure's former glory, complete with gold leaf detailing.http://www.maritimawoodcarving.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath;=65&products;_id=185 Since 2008, the replica has been on display for public viewing at the Blue Town Heritage Centre alongside the original figurehead from after Peel Holdings donated the pair.

She was responsible for delivering and disbursing goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Liberty ship SS Edward Preble was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 772) on 19 October 1942 at South Portland, Maine, by the New England Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 2 February 1943; sponsored by Miss Beverly Brown; renamed Volans and designated AKS-9 on 13 November 1943; and acquired by the Navy on 2 December 1943. Taken to the Tampa Bay Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Volans was converted for naval service at that yard, the work lasting into the following year. On 31 March 1944, Volans (AKS-9) was commissioned at Tampa, Florida, Comdr. Sherman R. Perie, USNR, in command.  World War II operations  Following her shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay and post-shakedown availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Volans loaded her initial cargo and got underway for the Panama Canal Zone on 11 May 1944. After transiting the Panama Canal, the stores issue ship experienced a two-day layover at Balboa, on the Pacific Ocean side of the isthmian waterway, before she sailed on 28 May for the New Hebrides Islands. = Providing service to the Pacific Fleet = Over the next year, Volans performed a vital service to the fleet as a stores issue ship. In the course of her important but unglamorous duties, she traveled from port to port, unescorted, proceeding independently from locales ranging from the Solomon Islands to the Carolines; and from the Palaus to the Admiralties. Ports of call included Guadalcanal; Tulagi; Emirau (Green Islands); Noumea, New Caledonia; the Russell Islands; Munda, New Georgia; Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Finschhafen and Hollandia, New Guinea; Manus; Ulithi; Kossol Roads; Peleliu; and the islands of Guam and Saipan. In addition, she also operated for a time out of Leyte in the Philippines. = A high demand for her goods = Volans, in her unsung role, provided stores to the ships that took part in the initial carrier air strikes on Tokyo in January 1945 and to the ships that took part in landing operations at places such as Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the Philippines. She serviced some 1,302 ships and facilities, filling 30,454 requisitions comprising an approximate 137,000 items. While at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, from 23 March to 5 April 1945, Volans experienced her busiest service. During that period, she issued supplies on a 24-hour basis, supporting the efforts to secure the Philippines and also to take Okinawa. = End-of-war activity = On 10 July 1945, Volans departed Ulithi for Seattle, Washington, and shipyard availability and arrived at her destination on 31 July. She was still under overhaul at the time of the Japanese surrender in mid-August and at the time of the formal surrender in Tokyo Bay in early September. On 25 September, Volans sailed for Okinawa and arrived there on 19 October.  Post-war decommissioning  Volans subsequently returned to Pearl Harbor in November and remained there until decommissioned on 17 June 1946. Towed to San Francisco, California, for disposal, the former stores issue ship was delivered to the Maritime Commission at Suisun Bay, California, on 24 June 1947 and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

He was the son-in-law of the warlord who controlled Shanxi from 1911‚Äì1949, Yan Xishan. Wang served throughout his career in Yan's army, fighting in numerous campaigns. Military service =Suiyuan= In 1936 units under Wang's command were sent to reinforce the Inner Mongolian province of Suiyuan, which Yan controlled. Wang's orders were to defend against an attack by the Japanese puppet army of Mengguguo, led by Prince Teh (Demchugdongrub). Wang's senior commander in defending Suiyuan was Fu Zuoyi, who was also an officer of Yan's. In the subsequent battle with Mengguguo, Prince Teh's forces were virtually annihilated, and Prince Teh lost all areas in Suiyuan and Chahar which were not under the immediate protection of the Japanese Kwantung Army.Gillin 234-236 =Second Sino-Japanese War= When the Japanese invaded Shanxi in 1937, Yan Xishan requested, and received, military aid from the Communist People's Liberation Army, which entered Shanxi and set up operations in much of the province. By late 1938 Yan had become afraid of the rapid power and influence that the Communist forces operating in Shanxi quickly gained, and this fear caused Yan to become increasingly hostile to Communist agents and soldiers. In order to combat the spread and influence of communism within Yan's armies and in the area that Yan controlled, Wang Jingguo persuaded Yan to establish a \\"National Revolutionary Comrades Association\\", a paramilitary organization that existed to identify and persecute Communists in Yan's territory and in the army. The actions of this Association eventually contributed to the destruction of all cooperation between Yan and the Communists in the winter of 1939. From 1939-1945 Yan was successful in keeping his territory free from Communist influence and activity.Gillin 278-279 =Chinese Civil War= By 1948 all Nationalist forces in China, including Yan Xishan's forces, were being rapidly defeated by Chinese Communist armies. In March 1948 Yan himself was airlifted out of Taiyuan, taking most of the provincial treasury with him, apparently for the purpose of asking the central government to send more supplies and materiel to Yan's surrounded forces. Yan did not return. Wang Jingguo was left in charge of much of Yan's remaining forces, including all Nationalist reinforcements left stranded in Taiyuan. Wang's direct superior was a Japanese officer who had joined Yan's army after World War II, Imamura Hosaku, who continued to direct the resistance. In April, 1949, the Communists launched a final attack against Taiyuan's last defenders that included over 1,300 pieces of artillery and a force three times larger than the defenders. After Taiyuan fell, Wang Jingguo was captured. He was last seen in public being led through the streets at the end of a rope.Gillin 288 Footnotes References * Gillin, Donald G.

It began more than 60 years ago as a small organization of U.S. researchers and now is truly international with more than 4500 members in over 85 countries. Approximately two-thirds of members are academic scholars, professors, and graduate students, with the remaining members in government, the media, communication technology, business law, medicine and other professions. ICA also has 59 institutional members (i.e. university departments or related institutions) and a growing number (16) of association members (i.e. communication associations around the world). ICA is headquartered in Washington, D.C, United States. Since 2003, ICA has been officially associated with the United Nations as a non- governmental organization (NGO). History ICA was founded on January 1, 1950 in Austin, Texas as the National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC), a subsidiary organization of the Speech Association of America (now the (United States) National Communication Association), when the SSA determined to exclude basic communication studies from its primary focus on rhetoric. The following year, NSSC published the first issue of its official journal, Journal of Communication. In 1967, the NSSC formally separated from the SSA and opened its membership to scholars outside of the U.S. It changed its name two years later to the International Communication Association. The association restructured into divisions to allow members to find and interact with colleagues who shared similar research interests, among the widely diverse disciplines of communication study. In the face of increasing internationalization, ICA relocated its offices from Austin, TX to the more cosmopolitan and globally accessible Washington, D.C. in 2001. The association purchased a permanent headquarters in Washington in 2006. Governance ICA is governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of: * the Executive Committee ‚Äì President, Presidents-Elect and -Elect Select, the three immediate past Presidents ‚Äì the least recent of whom serves as Finance Chair ‚Äì and the Executive Director. * Five Board Members-at-Large, representing five international regions as defined by UNESCO: the Americas; Europe; East Asia; West & South Asia; and Africa-Oceania. * Two graduate student representatives. * The chairs of ICA's Divisions and Interest Groups (although Interest Group representatives do not have voting rights). The officers (except for the Executive Director) are elected by the association's members. The balloting for President and regional Members-at-Large is association-wide; student representatives are elected by ICA's student members, while Division and Interest Group chairs are chosen by the Division/Interest Group members. Terms of office begin and end at the conclusion of each year's annual ICA conference. The president of ICA serves a one-year term; however, the Executive Committee's makeup of incoming and past presidents means that election as ICA president brings with it a six-year commitment to serve on the Executive Committee. The current (2017‚Äì2018) president is Paula Gardner (McMaster University), and the current President-Elect is Patricia Moy (University of Washington). Past presidents include Peng Hwa Ang (Nanyang Technological University), Amy Jordan (University of Pennsylvania), and Peter Vorderer (University of Mannheim). ICA maintains a series of standing and awards committees to conduct its business in relation to membership, internationalization, publications, liaison with other agencies, etc., annual awards, and ad hoc task forces. Committee members are appointed by the president. The association is administered by the five-member staff at ICA's offices in Washington, D.C. The staff is led by the Executive Director, a position held since 2016 by Laura Sawyer. Divisions and Interest Groups ICA's members are drawn from several disciplines, focuses, and approaches to the communication discipline. Its membership is thus organized into Divisions and Interest Groups that gather scholars and students of common research interests into formal structures within the association. New \\"Interest Groups\\" are formed when a group of 30 or more active members of the association may petition the Executive Director to establish an Interest Group. An interest group appoints its own officers, is allocated conference sessions, and is represented in the Board of Directors, but does not have voting rights. An interest group enrolling at least 1 percent of the members of ICA for at least two consecutive years may apply to become a \\"Division\\". A division also appoints its own offices, and is allocated conference sessions, but unlike Interest Groups, Divisions are granted voting status on the Board of Directors. As of 2017 there are 23 Divisions and 9 Interest Groups within the association.http://www.icahdq.org Conference ICA sponsors a large annual conference for its members to present research representing the latest advances in the field of communication. The conference is held in a different city each year, with every fourth year's conference located outside of North America. Each year's conference has a theme, around which the conference planners organize discussion panels designed to integrate and promote discovery, learning, and engagement as panelists and audience members from different regions of the world take up the conversation on particular topics. The conference also includes annual plenary sessions featuring panels or keynote speakers. One of the plenaries is the Interactive Paper Session, in which participants display their work in the form of visual poster presentations and are awarded based on both the merit of their research and the visual quality of their presentations. In addition, each of ICA's Divisions and Interest Groups organizes presentations and panels that explore the advancements within those Divisions' research focuses. These sessions often examine the conference theme from the aspects of the Divisions/Interest Groups. ICA's President-Elect is head of the planning committee for the conference immediately following his/her election, and acts as the chair of that conference.

Biography =Early Life= In 1908, Zhao Chengshou was admitted to the Taiyuan Army Primary School. Subsequently, he was promoted to Qinghe Army Middle School. After the Xinhai Revolutionary Army launched the uprising in 1911, he returned to Shanxi Province to join the Xin Daining Public Corps (head of the continued Tongxi) as a coach. In November of the same year, two thousand people from Xin Daining Public Corps attacked Datong through Ruyuekou in Fanshi County. Zhao Chengshou led the left-wing guerrillas as a forward. When he entered Huairen County (modern Huairen), he learned that the League of Datong had held an uprising. The Qing Dynasty commander Wang Desheng had led his troops to retreat. On the same day, two thousand people from the Huai Army Guo dian State Department and Xuanhua Chenxiyi Department in Xuanhua District and Zhangjiakou of the Qing Dynasty reinforced Datong and besieged Datong City. The Xin Daining Public Corps and the Datong Uprising Army held on to Datong for more than forty days. After the North and South reconciliation succeeded, the Xin Daining Public Corps withdrew to the south of Yanmen Pass in accordance with the agreement. In 1912, the Xin Daining Public Corps was disbanded, and Zhao Chengshou re- entered the Qinghe Army First Preparatory School. After graduation, he was promoted to the fifth phase of the Baoding Military Academy. In 1928, he was appointed as the cavalry commander by Yan Xishan and then held the post for 10 years. =Second Sino-Japanese War= In 1936, he was awarded the rank of lieutenant general by the Nationalist government in Nanjing. On November 15 of the same year, during the Battle of Honggeltu, the Japanese and Wang Ying‚Äôs Grand Han Righteous Army attacked Honggeltu. The cavalry unit of Zhao Chengshou Station stationed in Honggeltu held its position. The battle continued for two days. The Japanese and Wang Ying bu did not Can break through. The Damilingsulong and Yi Shifang's local security corps cooperated with Zhao Chengshou's department. On November 16, Zhao Chengshou and Fu Zuoyi went to the front line of Jining District to command troops. After attacking the enemy, they defeated the enemy and won the battle of Hongertu. After that, Zhao Chengshou helped Fu Zuoyi plan the battle of the Bailing Temple and win. Because of the merits of Suiyuan campaign, Zhao Chengsui was awarded the second-class Order of the Sacred Tripod. The war of resistance against Japan broke out in July 1937. Zhao Chengshou was reorganized into the 1st Army of Cavalry. Zhao Chengshou served as the commander of the army. He led the army to attack Linxi County in Rehe Province (modern Linxi County, Inner Mongolia), and conquered Shangdu County in northern Chahar Province and Nanhao Valley in Huade County (of Zhangbei County). When Zhao Chengshou was continuing to expand the results, he was forced to relocate due to the defeat of the right- wing flat-sui line and returned to Northwest Shanxi in early 1938. Zhao Chengshou's headquarters has been stationed in Basing County, Ningwu County, Nanguan County, Jingle County and other places. Prior to this, the Eighth Route Army had been stationed in the areas of Sulan, Wuzhai, and Lanxian. At the time, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China cooperated. The troops of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army in the northwest of Shanxi were under the command of Zhao Chengshou, and the 120th Division Commander He Long personally visited Zhao Chengshou on the dam of Ningwu County. Since then, Zhao Chengsui has cooperated with 120 divisions for many times and won battles in battles such as Battle of Octagon, Battle of Limin Fort, Battle of Mitsui, Battle of Yijing and other places in Ningwu County, Xuangang Town, Shenchi County, and Wuzhai County.Á∫¢Ê†ºÂ∞îÂõæÊàòÂΩπÔºå‰πåÂÖ∞ÂØüÂ∏ÉÂ∏Ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊîøÂ∫úÔºå2009-12-01 In 1939, Zhao Chengshou was promoted to commander-in-chief of the 7th Army of the National Army and director of the Second Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government. When returning to the northwest of Shanxi from the commander-in- chief of the second war zone in Qiulin Town, Yichuan County, Shaanxi Province, Zhao Chengshou passed through Shaanbei (northern Shaanxi) and lived in Yishan Village near the east of Yan'an. After learning of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Chengshou was sent to Yan'an and a welcome meeting was held. =Chinese Civil War and later life= In 1946, the Second Civil War broke out. Yan Xishan appointed Zhao Chengshou as commander-in-chief of the field army of the Taiyuan Suijing Office. In May 1948, the First Corps of the North China Field Army attacked Jinzhong. In July of the same year, Zhao Chengshou surrendered to the North China Field Army. Since then, he has mobilized the 71st Division of the Yan Xishan Division and the 8th Corps to surrender. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he worked in the Water Resources Ministry and died of natural causes in Beijing.

A British and Gurkha force defeated a force of sepoys who had rebelled against the British East India Company. The British victory allowed them to besiege and ultimately capture Delhi. Outbreak of the Rebellion Tension between the East India Company and the sepoys (Indian soldiers) of its Bengal Army had been growing for several years, and increased rapidly during 1857. The rebellion finally broke out when the Company attempted to introduce a new Enfield rifle. The cartridges for this were believed by the sepoys to be greased with beef and pork fat. A Hindu soldier who bit the cartridge open to load the rifle would lose caste, and a Muslim soldier would be defiled. The sepoys believed that the company was attempting to force them to become Christians. The first revolt occurred on 10 May at Meerut, north-west of Delhi. After killing many of their British officers and some civilians, three regiments of Bengal infantry and cavalry marched to Delhi. When the first of them arrived on 11 May, they called on the three Bengal infantry regiments there to join them, and for the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II to lead them. By the end of the day, Delhi was in rebel hands, and news of the rebellion was spreading rapidly over northern India. British moves Most of the units of the British Army in India, and the \\"European\\" units of the Bengal Army, were in the \\"hill stations\\" in the foothills of the Himalayas. At Simla, the Commander in Chief, General Anson, began collecting a force to recapture Delhi. Although aged, Anson nevertheless acted swiftly, but was handicapped by lack of transport and supplies. He succeeded in collecting a force at Ambala on 17 May, and they began advancing to Karnal, where most of the British civilians who had escaped from Delhi were taking shelter. On the way, his men indiscriminately hanged or blew from the guns, many suspected rebels or sympathisers. Another small British force was advancing from Meerut to meet Anson. It was commanded by Major-General W. Hewitt, whose health had been broken by his age and many years' service in India. He eventually had to hand over command to Brigadier Archdale Wilson. On 30 May, some Indian forces from Delhi attacked Wilson's force at the Hindon river. Wilson's infantry, the 60th Rifles, made good use of their Enfield rifles to drive the Indians from the field and capture five light guns. The rebels tried another attack the next day and were again driven back, though they lost no more of their artillery. The battle General Anson had died of cholera at Karnal on 27 May. He was succeeded by Major-General Sir Henry Barnard, who had recently fought in the Crimean War. Barnard's force advanced to join with Wilson's at Alipur (north-west of Delhi) on 1 June. The combined force advanced along the Grand Trunk road towards Delhi. The rebel sepoy regiments had dug in at Badli- ki-Serai to oppose their advance. Their strength was estimated in some works as 30,000,Michael Edwardes, Battles of the Indian Mutiny, p.14 but was put closer to 4,000 by historian A.H. Amin.Orbat.com This number includes the sepoy regiments only, who were probably accompanied onto the battlefield by irregular contingents from Delhi, and scavengers and sight-seers, making effective numbers difficult to estimate although the historian Saul David stated the rebel force numbered about 9,000 and thirty guns. The rebels' right flank, with most of their artillery, occupied a serai (a walled enclosure) and a village, also surrounded by a wall. Their left flank consisted of a \\"sandbagged\\" battery. Both flanks were supposedly protected also by areas of marshy ground. On the left however, there was a gap of a mile between the end of the swamp and the Western Jumna canal, which was not defended. The right flank was similarly vulnerable. When the British advanced against this position early on 8 June, they suffered high casualties from the rebel artillery, which was heavier than most of the British guns and well-handled. Barnard sent his cavalry under Colonel James Hope Grant to outflank the rebel left and a brigade of infantry under Colonel Graves (temporarily replacing Brigadier Jones, who was ill) around the rebel right. As these forces began to threaten the enemy flanks and rear, Barnard ordered his other brigade under Colonel Showers (which included a Gurkha regiment) to charge and capture the enemy artillery with the bayonet. There was severe fighting for the village and serai, but the rebels fled to avoid being surrounded, abandoning thirteen guns. The sepoys retreated to Delhi in disorder, and some of the citizens thought that the British would follow close on their heels and capture the city before resistance could be organised. The British were too exhausted by the heat and their exertions however, and contented themselves with occupying Delhi Ridge north of the city. This led to a costly siege lasting three and a half months, but the city was eventually stormed and the rebels were defeated. Results The battle had exposed the rebel weaknesses, the most damaging of which was their lack of competent leaders. Bahadur Shah had nominated his son Mirza Mughal as commander-in-chief of his army, but the sepoys treated him and the King disrespectfully. Mirza Mughal was preoccupied with the administration of Delhi, and showed himself to be most unwilling to lead a force to attack Meerut or confront Barnard. He had not been present at the battle, and later issued a rather fatuous statement that \\"...as a castle in the game of chess, he was firmly seated beyond all fear of check being given.\\" The sepoys' officers had attained rank by seniority only and none of them proved to be gifted generals, as opposed to platoon commanders. At Badli-ki-Serai they deployed no forces to protect against outflanking moves and left themselves no reserves. The sepoys refused to use the Enfield rifle (for which they lacked ammunition in any case), and were forced to use the Brown Bess, which was far less accurate than the Enfield rifle (some of the British units at Badli-ki- Serai also had the Brown Bess, but its short range and inaccuracy hampered the defenders more than the attackers).

Early life and career Guan Linzheng was born in a rural peasant family in Hu County, Shaanxi. Shanxi General Governor Yu Youren recommended him to join the Chinese Nationalist Party headed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Canton. and attended the Whampoa Military Academy, where some of his notable classmates included Du Yuming, Fan Hanjie, Hu Lien, Liu Yuzhang, Zhang Lingfu, and Lin Biao. In 1925, Guan a member of the first graduating class the Academy, he was seriously injured in his knees during the Eastern Expedition against the Cantonese warlord Chen Jiongming. In 1926, Guan was appointed to be the battalion commander of the Central garrison regiment and participated in the Northern Expedition. In 1927 Guan received his promotion as regiment commander of the General Headquarters of National Revolutionary Army, and was then transferred to the 11th division, one of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's most elite units. In September 1928, Guan was promoted to brigade commander of the 11th division and later as deputy commander of the newly established 5th division. In 1930 he fought under President Chiang Kai-shek during the Central Plains War and was transferred again to the South to attack the Chinese communist forces under Red Army commander Chen Geng in Hubei, forcing them to join the Long March two years later. He was then promoted to command the 25th division because of this accomplishment. Second Sino-Japanese War In 1933. Guan received orders from the nationalist government to help General Song Zheyuan to defend North China against the Imperial Japanese Army led by Field Marshal Nobuyoshi Mut≈ç in the Defense of the Great Wall. He personally led an infantry charge against a Japanese position and was severely wounded in the action, his deputy commander Du Yuming took over command of the division. The nationalist government awarded him the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun after the conclusion of the battle. General Guan's unit stayed in Beijing after this clash as part of the garrison and was post in Luoyang in 1935. In 1936, he led his unit into Shanxi province to help the local warlord Yan Xishan to drive away the communist troops commanded by his former classmate Lin Biao and was successful in his mission. On October 15, 1936, Guan was promoted to lieutenant general and tasked to block a large Chinese communist force commanded by his former classmate Xu Xiangqian, who had been ordered by the Chinese Communist Party to establish a base in Xinjiang, as part of the communist plan to receive aid from the Soviet Union. General Guan again successfully accomplished his mission and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek promoted him to commander of the 52nd corps when the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out the next year. Guan led his unit in successive battles against the Japanese Army, which included the Battle of Taierzhuang, Battle of Wuhan, and Battle of Changsha (1939). Because of his personal bravery, he was nicknamed Guan the Brave and the Iron Fist. In 1938, General Guan was promoted to command the 33rd army, and was promoted to the position of commander-in-chief of 15th army group, becoming the first graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy to command an army group. In 1940, Guan led his unit into Yunnan province, and was put in charge of defend the border between China and Vietnam. However, Guan's relation with General Chen Cheng suffered another setback when he decided to remove Chen Cheng's favorite commander General Huang Wei as commander of the 54th corps because of Huang's alleged corruption. In 1944, General Guan received another promotion as deputy commander-in-chief of the 1st Area Army and was one of the most successful Chinese commanders in the entire war. Chinese Civil War Because of General Guan's impressive track record, he was President Chiang Kai-shek's original choice to lead the American-trained Nationalist troops to Manchuria against Communist troops under Lin Biao in 1945. However, General Chen Cheng opposed Guan's appointment as security commander of Manchuria because of the intense rivalry between the two of them, and Guan was appointed as garrison commander of Yunnan instead. On November 25, college students went on strike in Kunming to protest the resumption of the Chinese Civil War. Four days later, General Guan held a press conference and stated the government troops has the right to use force to quell the strike, and ordered the students to resume their classes. But on December 1, 1945, nationalist troops and student protestors clashed with each other and there were many casualties on both sides, Guan was made a scapegoat of the incident and resigned his command the next year. In 1947, Guan succeeded President Chiang Kai-shek as commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy, and was appointed as deputy commander-in-chief of the ROC army. In August 1949, the acting president Li Zongren appointed him as commander-in-chief of the ROC army, because Chiang Kai-shek put Guan's old rival General Chen Cheng in charge of Taiwan and greatly favored him, General Guan decided to retire in Hong Kong in that November. He formally resigned his position as commander-in-chief of the army in 1950. Retirement in Hong Kong During his stay in Hong Kong, Guan declined any political activities and spent most of his time in calligraphy and Chinese opera. Guan's relationship with General Chen Cheng was very rivalrous throughout their career, Guan maintained a close friendship with General Hu Lien, one of Chen Cheng's ablest subordinates. Guan also formed a closer relationship with his own former adjutant, General Liu Yuzhang when their children married each other. In April 1975 Guan travelled to Taiwan to show his last respect to Chiang Kai-shek's funeral. In 1980, General Guan Linzheng himself died at age 75. General Guan Linzheng and his wife are buried in Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. General Guan Linzheng is survived by two sons, four daughters, twelve grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

They are a research resource for ornithology, the science of birds, and for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds is useful. These collections are archives of avian diversity and serve the diverse needs of scientific researchers, artists, and educators. Collections may include a variety of preparation types emphasizing preservation of feathers, skeletons, soft tissues, or (increasingly) some combination thereof. Modern collections range in size from small teaching collections, such as one might find at a nature reserve visitor center or small college, to large research collections of the world's major natural history museums, the largest of which contain hundreds of thousands of specimens. Bird collections function much like libraries, with specimens arranged in drawers and cabinets in taxonomic order, curated by scientists who oversee the maintenance, use, and growth of collections and make them available for study through visits or loans.  History of bird collections  =Origin= Early collection used lifelike mounts like this red-footed falcon. The roots of modern bird collections are found in the 18th- and 19th- century explorations of Europeans intent on documenting global plant and animal diversity.Barber, L. (1980). The Heyday of Natural History. Doubleday & Co., New York, . It was a fashion to collect and display natural curiosities in Victorian England. Some wealthy cabinet naturalists were able to amass large collections using networks of field collectors. These early collections were not intended for scientific study and the collectors gave importance to aesthetics rather than scientific value. It grew into a more scientific pursuit much later.Allen, D. E. (1994). The Naturalist in Britain: A Social History. Princeton University Press, . =Growth= Early scientific bird collections included those belonging to Pallas and Naumann in Germany, Latham and Tunstall in England and Adanson in France. Collections grew in size with increasing maritime activity, exploration and colonialism. For example, Charles Darwin collected over 400 bird specimens during his travels on the Beagle, and it was many years after his return to England that his bird collections from the Galapagos inspired (in part) his theory of evolution through natural selection. The Paris museum had 463 bird specimens in 1793 and this grew to 3411 in 1809; The Berlin museum had 2000 specimens in 1813 growing to 13,760 around 1850. In 1753 there were 1172 bird specimens in the museum established by Sir Hans Sloane but these appear to have perished before they moved to the British Museum. Early specimens from Captain Cook's voyages as well as those described by Latham in his General Synopsis of Birds (1781‚Äì1785) were also lost possibly due to poor preservation technique. The scale of collections grew to the point where they needed more space and full- time curators. In the earliest days of ornithology, collecting was the dominant method of bird observation and study. This approach has diminished with the growth of the discipline. The use of mist-netting and photography, blood sampling (for DNA, immunological and other studies), the development of optics and the use of other new techniques for studying birds have reduced the need to collect specimens for research, yet collections continue to act as a vital shared resource for science (particularly taxonomy) and conservation. In an era of mass extinction, bird collections will evidence lost species.  Collection and preservation techniques  Skinning a bird Historically, bird specimens were collected mostly using firearms. Shotguns with \\"dust\\" shot were preferred to reduce damage to the specimens. Today, specimens come from a variety of sources. Many (perhaps most) are salvaged from birds killed by window and communications tower strikes, domestic cats, by-catch from fisheries, die-offs from disease, vehicle strikes, and other accidental sources of mortality. However, the world's bird collections have been argued to be inadequate in documenting avian diversity, from taxonomic, geographic, and temporal perspectives, with some parts of tropical regions considered under-represented in particular museums. Underrepresented taxa continue to be actively collected by ornithologists, generally using either firearms or mist- nets. Permitting agencies oversee these activities in most countries. A partly skinned bird Techniques to preserve birds were attempted even from the early 16th century as shown in the writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt to preserve bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste B√©coeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Trait√© √âl√©mentaire et Complet d‚ÄôOrnithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.Blake, E. R. (1949). Preserving birds for study. Fieldiana: Technique no. 7. A prepared skin A more recent preparation method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones for a complete skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America).Dickerman, R.W. 1989. Schmoo preparation. Pp. 7‚Äì11, in S. L. Rogers and D. S. Wood, eds. Notes from a workshop on bird specimen preparation. Section of Birds, Carnegie Mus. Nat. Hist., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, as is the case with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate- controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen's scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections' data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.  Uses of bird collections  Study skins of Garrulus glandarius in Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin Bird collections are used for a wide variety of purposes. All biological species including those of birds are represented by a holotype, the vast majority of which are full specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may be compared to the holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these characteristics, as they allow studies to be replicated ‚Äì anyone may go back and repeat the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re- examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece. Cabinet with study skins, Louisiana State University In the case of molecular studies, the preservation of a specimen that can vouch for the source of the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields surprising results that make reexamination of the original specimen crucial. Studies on ectoparasites, usually obtained during capture, but also obtained from old museum specimens, are valuable for studies on coevolution and zoonoses.Health Protection Agency (2006) Investigation of specimens for ectoparasites . National Standard Method Issue 1. In addition to taxonomic research, collections can provide information relevant to the study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts.Reitz, E.J., and E.S. Wing. (1999). Zooarchaeology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, . Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens. For seabirds, museum specimens are adequate proxies for feather colour but not for skin colour. Bird collections have been useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer the potential for current and future researchers to make in- depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this was the use of egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs could never have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction. As threats to bird populations grow and extinctions continue, historical specimens are valuable in documenting the impacts of human activities and causes of decline for threatened species. Bird collections have also been used to gauge the flow of environmental pollutants over time. A study of soot deposits on specimens collected within the United States Manufacturing Belt was used to track concentrations of atmospheric black carbon over a 135-year span. Other possible uses for bird specimens not known today may arise in the future.  Collection debates  Specimens of the endangered kakapo at the Vienna Museum of Natural History; thousands of kakapo were collected for museums across the world The issue of whether birds should continue to be actively collected for research has been the subject of some debate among ornithologists (examples of this can be found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan). Those opposed to collecting believe that much of current collecting is unnecessary, arguably motivated by the personal field scores of individuals or by competition between museums, rather than the result of a strict scientific rationale; that collecting, in extreme cases of species on the verge of extinction, can pose a threat to bird populations; and that in many cases in which the necessity of specimens is claimed, new technology such as digital photography and blood sample analysis of mist-netted individuals could instead be used. Finally, at a time of rampant deforestation and species extinctions, scientists and conservationists should take the lead in providing an example to local people not to kill or hunt birds. Where other techniques not involving killing of a bird are feasible, to take a specimen is viewed by some as simply unethical. Proponents of collecting counter-argue that compared to the many millions of birds killed each year by habitat destruction, domestic cats, window strikes, and tower kills,Sibley, D. A. Bird Conservation ‚Äî Mortality . sibleyguides.com scientists collect only a few thousand birds per year worldwide and populations will quickly recover from an episode of collecting as long as their habitat remains. Supporters of continued collecting also point to the greater scientific utility and legacy of museum specimens compared to blood samples or photographs, and argue that collecting for research offers the only source of avian mortality with a positive outcome for birds in terms of the biological knowledge gained. Although taking small blood samples from wild birds is often viewed as a harmless alternative to collecting, it reduces survival by as much as 33% and does not provide the benefits of a voucher specimen. Scientists have pointed out that bird populations represent renewable resources, and that scientific collecting represents only a tiny and non-additive proportion of annual bird mortality.Banks, R. Human related mortality of birds in the United States. Washington, D.C.: Special Scientific Report, Wildlife, No. 215, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, examples exist of species whose extinction was directly contributed to by museum collecting (e.g. Guadalupe caracara, ivory- billed woodpeckerHoose, Phillip (2004).

History The bridge opened on February 18, 1928, as the first permanent crossing of Lake Pontchartrain. The bridge was the longest concrete bridge in the world upon completion. The bridge is wide and has two bascule-type draw spans for passing vessels and barges. The bridge was originally a toll structure, costing $1.25 for a motor vehicle with one driver plus ten cents for each additional passenger. In February 1928, the New Orleans Stock Exchange was closed on a Saturday so members could attend the opening of Pontchartrain Bridge. Louisiana Governor Huey Long was opposed to toll bridges and offered to have the state purchase the bridge from its private owners. The offer was rejected, so Governor Long constructed two free bridges to the east along U.S. Route 90 across Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets Pass. With a free alternative, the toll bridge faced financial ruin and was sold to the state in 1938 for $940,000. Following the purchase, the bridge's name was changed to the Maestri Bridge, named after Robert Maestri, the mayor of New Orleans. U.S. Route 11, formerly co-signed with U.S. Route 90 across the Chef Menteur and Rigolets Bridges, was re-routed onto the Maestri Bridge around 1941. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina virtually destroyed the I-10 Twin Span Bridge to the east. However, due to its sturdy construction, the Maestri Bridge was largely undamaged and was the only route to New Orleans from the East until the Twin Spans could be temporarily fixed (US-90 was also closed due to damage to the Fort Pike Bridge). The bridge was closed in January 2012 for repairs. LA DOTD awarded a $5.7 million contract to rehabilitate the bridge's railings. It reopened on May 21. It was closed once more in January 2019 as part of a $28.6 million overhaul to the bridge.

In April, he served as the commander of the 12th Army of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army and the commander of the 8th Army. Afterwards, he went northward again and disarmed the 30,000 people of the Zhilu Coalition Army in Luanhe and stayed in Tangshan.

Gregorian, (1909 - January 14, 2003), was a Greater Boston oriental rug dealer and author of books on oriental rugs. He is considered by some to be the world's leading collector of rare, inscribed Armenian rugs.Southpinellas: Arthur T. Gregorian, 93, rug collector Arthur T. Gregorian purchasing rugs in Kabul, Afghanistan - 16mm frame Early life Gregorian did not know his birthdate. However, he marked it as November 15, 1909. He was born in Rahvah, on the western shore of Lake Urmia, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran, of Armenian parents, and died on January 14, 2003, in Concord, Massachusetts. In 1919, Gregorian and his family fled the Armenian Genocide by oxcart on a thousand-mile journey with hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees from his ancient Armenian homeland near Lake Urmia, over the Zagros Mountains in southwestern Iran, down to Basra, Iraq. There, they stayed at a British refugee camp. Gregorian almost died of cholera and worked as a sidekick to a hakim or herbal doctor to earn food for his family. After traveling by steerage to India, Italy and France, he finally reached Boston and settled in New Britain, Connecticut. In high school, Arthur met Phebe Ballou, his future wife. He spent his final year of high school at the Northfield Mount Hermon School, where in later life he became the director of the board of alumni. After high school he worked in a rug shop to get money to go to night school at Boston University, so he could become a doctor. Wellesley In 1934, Gregorian took his savings of $700.00 and moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts, partly to open his own oriental rug store there and partly to see Phebe who was attending Wellesley College. The store was tiny and below street level, so he visited his potential buyers in their homes or businesses. He and Phebe were married in 1936. The business flourished and in 1940, Arthur was able to move east across the Charles River to larger quarters on Washington Street in Newton Lower Falls. Newton Lower Falls In his new store in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts (), Gregorian finally had the space for his customers to come to him to see his rugs. Business continued to be good until World War II disrupted his importation of rugs as well as reduced the demand for luxury goods. After the war was over, however, the economy of Greater Boston boomed and Arthur's business boomed along with it. He had a store in Newton Lower Falls and another in Chatham, Massachusetts. In 1948 he bought the old Crane Paper Company paper mill next door and expanded his showrooms into it. In 1965 and again in 1989, additions were made to the two buildings, which resulted in of space divided into 10 galleries and over 6,000 rugs on display. Personal life In 1936, Arthur T. Gregorian married Phebe Ballou (April 14, 1912 - November 19, 1999). They had three children, Lynda, John and Joyce (1946‚Äì1991). Phebe was regional president of the Girl Scouts and founding Director of the United Nation's Asian Women's Institute. St. Petersburg, Florida, interlude Arthur and Phebe Gregorian retired to St. Petersburg, Florida in the mid-1970s, but around 1979, Arthur grew tired of retirement and opened an oriental rug store in downtown St. Pete and later exhibited rugs from his collection at local art museums. The Gregorians returned to Massachusetts in 1999. He was a founding member of The Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College. Impact on the study of oriental rugs Perhaps Greogrian's most important legacy has been in his study, writing, filmmaking, collecting and lectures on oriental rugs. Fluent in Armenian, Turkish and Persian, he spent months at a time in the bazaars of Afghanistan, Armenia and Iran buying rugs and filming his bargaining and travels with a 16 mm Bell and Howell movie camera. In the study and erudition of oriental rugs, he will be best remembered for his books, Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell,Gregorian, Arthur T., Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell, 3rd ed, revised and enlarged, Boston: Nimrod Press, 1975 and Armenian Rugs of the Gregorian Collection, done in collaboration with his daughter, Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire and his grandson, Douglas Christian.Gregorian, Arthur T. and Hampshire, Joyce Gregorian, with photos by Douglas A. Christian, Armenian Rugs from the Gregorian Collection, Newton Lower Falls: Congraf, paperback, 1987 In Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell, he divided rugs into three major categories: tribal, village, and city rugs. He observed that it is often difficult for a novice to distinguish between a Sarouk, Isfahan or a Tabriz, but it is not difficult for the novice to distinguish between the innate characteristics of a village woven Bidjar and an intricate and highly stylized city woven Qum. Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell was a breakthrough in the study of rugs, because it made the study of rugs clear and accessible. His book on Armenian oriental rugs came out of realization that many rugs labeled as Turkish or Kazakh or something else were in fact Armenian in origin. He was extremely proud of his Armenian heritage and spent the last decades of his life collecting and documenting the particular aspects of Armenian oriental rug weaving. His collection of Armenian oriental rugs was shown throughout the world and the majority of it was donated to the Armenian Library and Museum of America, of which he was a founding member and director. He was also president of the Armenian Rugs Society. He also wrote a book with his wife, Phebe, entitled Armenag's Story, about his own travels by ox-cart from his Armenian home to a British refugee camp in Basra in present-day Iraq.Gregorian, Arthur T. & Phebe, Armenag's Story, Newton: Lower Falls Publishing, 1989 Other notable achievements Gregorian was actively involved in social causes throughout most of his life. He was president of the Newton Rotary Club, as well as a long time active member of the Kabul, Afghanistan Rotary Club. He was the founding chairman of the board of directors for Damavand College, a women's college located north of Tehran. In 1953, as President of Morgan Memorial and President of Goodwill Industries, he called his friend and fellow Armenian, Stephen P. Mugar, and asked if he could place a new collection receptacle he had designed in the parking lot of the Star Market in Wellesley Hills. The container was a dumpster painted blue with a rectangular hole cut in the side for shoppers to deposit their extra clothing for the needy. This first Goodwill collection box became such an attraction for grocery shoppers that soon competitors of Star Market were requesting containers of their own. References External links * Arthur T.

Williams notes that many plaintiffs do not meet the criteria for PTSD, and he has also observed that individuals with a grievance will experience many of the same subjective psychological events as someone who actually suffers from PTSD.

Ken Lonsinger Arts and crafts features The Roadhouse pre-dated the American Craftsman style, yet contained many of the elements that are found in it. From the flared \\"Oriental\\" eves, to the \\"clinker\\" brick fireplace. The use of natural redwood shingles and the windows to take in the light and warmth. The interior wainscoting and the hardwood floors which were covered with oriental rugs. The placement of the house and its longer western wall, took advantage of the natural oceans setting. The placement above a natural cove that was accessed by stairs to the beach below. The Roadhouse may be the trend setter that led to the Craftsman shingle style Berkeley style made well known by Julia Morgan, Bernard Maybeck and Greene and Greene. It reflects many of the concepts found in The Simple Home, Charles Keeler, 1906 , a great influence on the Craftsman School. Architect This century-old home, with the visual clues and the proximity of this site to Esty/Houghton home, leads historians to believe that is an L D Esty home. (see Ross) HisPogonip Clubhouse is on the National Register of Historic Places. Houghton His father-in-law A D Houghton was architect and engineer for John D. Rockefeller. Houghton's house sat on over of land at the tip of Soquel Pt. It was noted as a beautiful home when it burned in 1915. The Roadhouse and the Houghton house have many visual similarities. Pogonip The Pogonip Clubhouse and the Roadhouse also have many similarities. Both are Brown Shingle construction in Natural settings. Very striking is the visual connection between the back of the Clubhouse and the side of the Roadhouse. Esty L D Esty went on, in 1931, to work with C J Ryland. A former employee of Julia Morgan. Esty went on to rebuild the Santa Cruz Mission and to build the City Halls in Santa Cruz and Monterey. Whoever the Architect was, if not L D Esty, the Roadhouse is a great example of the[Arts and Crafts] thinking of its day. A great home for a successful businessman, Henchy, who developed this area of Soquel/Pleasure Point.

He is best known for his photorealism work and creative use of painting surfaces. His latest technical development are paintings wrapped across two- and three-dimensional surfaces. They range from drawings a few inches wide to sculptural assemblages more than five feet tall and eight feet long. His paintings are more about the nature of art and the experience of seeing than about the subjects they depict. Jerry Ott is a true master airbrush artist and a leading painter in the 'Photo Realist' school of painting that emerged in the 1960s. In the early 1970s Jerry Ott received a great deal of attention in his career as one of two such artists ‚Äì Hilo Chen being the other ‚Äì dealing exclusively with the nude figure. If there ever were a subject ideally suited for rendering by an airbrush, it would be the human figure and the airbrush is the tool used to develop that \\"feel\\" of the human body‚Äîskin that you think you can touch. Ott's work has found international acclaim. His realistic paintings appear in the art capitals of Europe, Japan and as far a field as New Zealand. Among the prestigious Institutions that have acquired his works are New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center. In his recent paintings, the effects of light and shade, optical illusions, nubile woman and delicate flesh continue to fascinate Ott. In \\"Pipe Dreams,\\" he juxtaposes a pretty but unanimated girl with three banal lamps which refer to the mass- produced ceramic jars, vases and lamps sold as art. In Ott's painting, however, the reflections in the porcelain lamp bases and shadows that play across the skin are least as important as the woman herself.

Married, with three children, he lives with his family in Florida. Early years While attending the Academia Catolica during his school years, he was elected president of his sophomore class, publisher of the school newspaper and president of the student council. After enrolling in the University of Puerto Rico, he was elected to the General Studies Student Council and was elected its president. While in college, he represented Puerto Rico in the First International Youth Congress held at the United Nations General Assembly. Granados continued his political career as a student leader at the University of Puerto Rico campus in R√≠o Piedras, along with future House Speaker Edison Misla Aldarondo, future Senator Oreste Ramos, Jr. and future Senate Vice President Orlando Parga, Jr. In 1968 he was an unsuccessful candidate for elective office under the Statehood Republican Party (SRP) banner, as most statehooders switched their allegiance to the New Progressive Party (NPP), an offshoot of the SRP, which went on to win that year's general election. As secretary general of Acci√≥n Progresista, a pro-statehood student organization, he founded the longest lasting pro-statehood newspaper weekly, Decisi√≥n, in 1971. In that year, he was elected president of the New Progressive Party Youth organization and was nominated as one of that party's candidates for an at-large seat in the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. Elective office Elected to the House in 1972, he became an outspoken member of the opposition. After Gov. Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's defeat in 1976, Granados was elected in 1977 as the Majority Leader in the House. In 1981, after the NPP lost control of that legislative body, he became outgoing Speaker Angel Viera Mart√≠nez' Minority Whip. When Viera Mart√≠nez bolted the NPP to join the Puerto Rico Renewal Party (PRP) in 1983, Granados became House Minority Leader, a position he held until 1988. In 1981, Granados founded the Puerto Rico Statehood Commission, a grassroots non- partisan organization dedicated to research and education on Puerto Rico statehood. The organization operated until 1986 and included among its leaders a wide array of prominent statehooders, such as attorney Zaida Hern√°ndez, who served as House Speaker and subsequently an appellate court judge. Also included were attorney Zulma Rosario, former Corrections Administrator and current head of the Government Ethics Office, attorney N√©lida Jim√©nez Vel√°zquez, also an appellate judge, Senator Oreste Ramos, Jr., Sol Luis Descartes, a former treasury secretary under PDP Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who is the current secretary of state, former senate president Kenneth McClintock and attorney Luis D√°vila Col√≥n, currently Puerto Rico's most prominent political analyst. Granados' ideological organization still serves as a model, a quarter century later, for NPP educational efforts. Many elected public officials in Puerto Rico initiated their incursion into electoral politics, either as members of his youth organizations or as members of his legislative staff. The youth organization served as a launching pad for Charlie Rodriguez, who later became President of the Senate; Senators Anibal Marrero and former senator Freddy Valentin, State Representatives Albita Rivera, Antonio Silva and Benjamin Velez; and mayors Juan Cruz Manzano of Manati and Benjamin Cintron Lebron of Patillas. Also State Representative Carlos Lopez, who later served as ombudsman. Granados legislative office was a breeding ground of future political leaders. The present governor, Luis Fortu√±o, who led his party in 2008 to its largest landslide victory in history, was a summer intern at Granados' office while studying at Georgetown University. His aide, Zaida Hernadez, later became Speaker of the House of Representatives; Kenneth McClintock culminated a four-term senatorial career as the 13th President of the Senate before becoming Puerto Rico's 22nd Secretary of State, while Orlando Parga, another Granados' aide, served as McClintock's Senate President pro tem; and H√©ctor O'Neill, who became senator and later mayor of Guaynabo and president of the Mayors Federation. The best recognition of the \\"breeding ground\\" status of his office can be found in the refusal by a political opponent, House Speaker Severo Colberg to approve a staffer selected by Granados, Manuel Agromayor, which resulted in litigation in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and reached the United States Supreme Court. While studying the budget for a special election to fill a vacant House seat, Granados was appalled by the cost of ballot boxes. At the time, they were constructed of wood with the option of using metal. So he pulled out a piece of paper and designed the cardboard ballot box that is being used now throughout the world. He did not patent it. This was one of the more successful inventions attributed to him. A forceful public speaker, he organized the mass rallies that provided the \\"grand finales' of the NPP's electoral campaigns in 1976 and 1980 where his party's candidate, Carlos Romero Barcelo, was elected and subsequently narrowly reelected to the governorship. He also produced a daily 30 second TV ad transmitted under the name Directo Al Punto credited by some with having contributed greatly to Pedro Rossello's triumph as governor in 1992 and 1996. In 1988, when San Juan Mayor Baltasar Corrada del R√≠o lost his bid for governor in that year's PDP landslide, Granados lost the race to succeed Corrada in City Hall, losing to Hector Luis Acevedo of the PPD party, by a minuscule margin of only seven votes that finally had to be ratified in the courts. Jose Granados made a comeback in 1992 when he was returned to the House, where he became Majority Leader. As chairman of the Socio-Economic and Planning Commission, he conducted studies on the condition of Puerto Rico's economic infrastructure including land, air and maritime transportation, water and sewage, energy production and waste management and was responsible for most of Rossell√≥'s legislative agenda that laid the foundation for the major accomplishments of his gubernatorial administration. In 1997 he became Speaker of the House Pro Tem until his resignation from office. Literary accomplishments In the early 1980s, Granados co-wrote and edited a ten- volume collection of educational lesson books on statehood for Puerto Rico. He authored a novel, The Aikman Theory, that is being edited for publication and is writing a second one: The Dome on the Wall.

In September 1948 Communist forces launched the Battle of Jinan and Wang was captured and held as a prisoner of war until his pardon in 1959. During the Cultural Revolution he came under attack by the Red Guards for being a former nationalist commander and died of a heart attack in 1968. Early life and career Wang was born into peasant family in Shandong province. He lost his father and elder brother when he was young, and his mother raised him into adulthood. When Sun Yat-Sen opened the Whampoa Military Academy, Wang was working as a shop keeper. He immediately borrowed money from his employer and traveled to the South to join the national revolution. Some of his notable classmates included Du Yuming, Fan Hanjie, Hu Lien, Liu Yujian, Guan Linzheng and Lin Biao. After his graduation he joined the Northern Expedition under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek against the northern warlords. After Chiang purged the communists in Shanghai on April 12, 1927, he stayed with the Kuomintang as a regiment commander in the National Revolutionary Army. In 1930 he fought in the Central Plains War as a colonel in the central army against an anti-central government coalition under Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang and Li Zongren. In 1932, he was received by Chiang Kai- shek after successfully defend his position under communist attacks during the Fourth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet. He was promoted to brigade commander and later as commander of the 51st division. Two years later he participated the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet and captured Chinese communist leader Fang Zhimin and killing another red army commander in battle around September 1934. In 1935 he scored yet another victory at Jiangxi province by capturing the entire officer corps of the Red Army's 10th corps and was promoted to major general. Second Sino-Japanese War In 1937, Wang led his unit in the Battle of Shanghai. His regiment commander was Zhang Lingfu, whom he had just bailed out of prison. In late November, the Chinese army lost the battle for Shanghai and the Japanese Central China Area Army under General Iwane Matsui advanced toward Nanjing. During the Battle of Nanjing, Wang's 51st division suffered heavy casualties and his superior General Tang Shengzhi fled the city without even notifying him and the other senior commanders. Wang barely escaped the city and only 3,000 troops under his command managed to breakout from the Japanese onslaught. In 1938 he took part in the Battle of Lanfeng to fight against the Japanese 14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) led by General Kenji Doihara, one of the masterminds of the Manchurian Incident. The failure to hold off the Japanese attacks also led the nationalist government open dykes on the Yellow River, causing the 1938 Yellow River flood. During the Battle of Wanjialing, Wang's unit fought against the Japanese attempts to break out from the Chinese encirclement, in which the 106th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) under Lieutenant General Junrokur≈ç Matsuura was almost wiped out. In 1939, Wang led his unit to participate in the Battle of Nanchang, but Chinese forces failed to hold the city. Wang, however, distinguished himself during the Battle of Changsha and was promoted to the command of the 74th corps. Under his command, the 74th corps became one of the elite units of the Chinese government forces and fought in almost every engagement in the remaining period of the War. By the war's end, General Wang was promoted to command the 4th area army and became a member of the KMT central committee. Chinese Civil War When the Chinese Civil War broke out again in 1946, General Wang was named as governor of Shandong Province and commander-in-chief of the 2nd pacification zone. But he had great difficulty to establish his authority due to intense inter- service rivalry among different nationalist commanders and Communist forces stepped up their attacks on isolated nationalist garrisons in the province. In May 1947, his career suffered a serious setback when the 74th enhanced division under his old subordinate lieutenant general Zhang Lingfu was lost in the critical Menglianggu Campaign and most of the nationalist troops assigned to his sector was pulled out of the province to be redeployed elsewhere. When the Chinese communist forces under Chen Yi and Su Yu attacked the provincial capital in 1948 during the Battle of Jinan, General Wang only had local garrison forces which made up by raw recruits and second-rate troops. The fate of Jinan was sealed when one of his corps commanders (Wu Huawen) defected to the Chinese communist forces. The communist troops breached the city defenses and General Wang fled from his headquarters and was captured in a nearby county. Later life and death During his imprisonment Wang urged his fellow nationalist commanders to surrender to the PLA and caused a firestorm of controversy since President Chiang Kai-shek always favored him. As result of his collaboration with the communist forces he was among the first nationalist commanders to be released in 1959 with his senior classmate Du Yuming. He worked in the Chinese political consultative conference and other government organizations when the Cultural Revolution broke out. He was forced to go to struggle sessions by the Red Guards and died of a heart attack in 1968. He died under harsh treatment, but was posthumously rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping's government in 1980 and given a state funeral.

New building The new building, which cost in the region of ¬£11.6M, was part- funded by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£4.9M, and replaces much smaller buildings which were located at the Lower Hillhead and King Harald Street. The lead consultant for the development was the Building Design Partnership, and the main contractor D.I.T.T. Construction Ltd. started work on the building in 2004. The display designs in the building were created by GBDM of Dundee in collaboration with museum staff. The completed building is a massive step forward for the Shetland Museum with five times the space for exhibits, not including the three-storey boat hall. The building also contains a state of the art archive storage facility and search room - again with increased space and much better facilities. There is also a 120-seat lecture hall, temporary display areas, and a cafe, which will serve, as much as possible, local produce. In April 2008, it was announced that the Museum & Archives had been nominated for a major award - the Art Prize Fund for museums & galleries. The building won the \\"Commercial & Public Access\\" award and the overall \\"Gold Award\\" in the 2008 Wood Awards. Galleries The display galleries are split between two floors. The ground floor, with approximately 500m2 of gallery space, concentrates on the history of Shetland up till 1800, from environmental, geological, and geographical factors, early settlers in the islands, through early agriculture, fishing, early boats, and the rich folklore of Shetland. The 360m2 of first floor gallery space brings the story of Shetland right up to date with exhibits from the last 200 years. These detail the changes in culture, politics, population, and industry, including the development of the knitwear industry and Shetland's association with the sea through fishing, whaling, wartime service, and merchant shipping. The exhibits in the museum range from items of great historical importance, to items, which although not old, are of great significance to Shetland. From items which tell a story on their own, to items which help form part of a larger picture, and from items as delicate as lace shawls, to complete boats. The Shetland Archives contains records from the fifteenth to the 21st century, and a big library of local literature. Hay's Dock The building sits on the shore of the biggest exhibit, the Category B listed Hay's Dock, which was built in 1815 by a company called Hay & Ogilvy. As part of the project the dock area has seen major refurbishment works including the restoration of the pier house, and dredging of the dock itself, which will be home to the Museum's floating exhibits.

Known for most of its length as Shepherdstown Pike, the state highway begins at the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River, where the highway continues south as West Virginia Route 480 (WV 480) through Shepherdstown. The state highway runs east to U.S. Route 40 Alternate (US 40 Alternate) in Boonsboro. MD 34 is the main east-west highway of southern Washington County, connecting Shepherdstown and Boonsboro with Sharpsburg and Keedysville. The state highway, which was preceded by the Boonsboro and Sharpstown Turnpike, was constructed as a modern highway in the late 1910s and early 1920s. MD 34's bypass of Keedysville opened around 1960. The western end of the state highway has had three bridges. A 19th-century bridge was destroyed in a 1936 flood and replaced by the James Rumsey Bridge in 1939. The present bridge, also named for James Rumsey, opened in 2005. Route description MD 34 begins at the West Virginia State line, where the highway crosses the Potomac River on the James Rumsey Bridge. The highway continues into Shepherdstown as WV 480. MD 34 heads east past an access ramp to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park as two-lane undivided Shepherdstown Pike through a mix of farmland and forest. The state highway descends into an underpass of Norfolk Southern Railway's Hagerstown District, which crosses the state highway at an oblique angle then parallels the highway northeast past the historic home Mount Airy. MD 34 splits away from the railroad as the highway enters the town of Sharpsburg. The state highway's name changes to Main Street at its intersection with Mechanic Street. MD 34 passes through the Sharpsburg Historic District, which contains the Jacob Highbarger House, William Chapline House, Good-Reilly House, Joseph C. Hays House, Piper House, and Tolson's Chapel. At the eastern end of the town, the state highway intersects Church Street, which heads north as MD 65 through the main unit of Antietam National Battlefield and south as a county highway toward Burnside's Bridge. View east along MD 34 through Antietam National Battlefield MD 34 leaves the town of Sharpsburg and passes through the grounds of Antietam National Battlefield. The state highway passes Antietam National Cemetery and passes through open fields before leaving the federal reservation by crossing Antietam Creek on the Porterstown Bridge. MD 34 continues northeast, passing the Pry House Field Hospital Museum before heading through Keedysville. The old alignment of MD 34, MD 845, splits to the east to pass through the center of town as Main Street while MD 34 passes along the edge of town. MD 34 crosses Little Antietam Creek, crosses an abandoned Baltimore and Ohio Railroad grade, and passes the Doub Farm and Baker Farm before receiving the other end of MD 845, Keedy Drive. The state highway passes through a forested area before passing Crystal Grottoes. MD 34 continues east through farmland before entering the town of Boonsboro and crossing Beaver Creek. The state highway heads east through the town as Potomac Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 Alternate (Main Street). The roadway continues east as St. Paul Street toward South Mountain. History The predecessor highway of much of MD 34 was a 19th-century turnpike called the Boonsboro and Sharpsburg Turnpike between the two eponymous towns via Keedysville. The modern state highway was constructed starting in 1918 with a section from Boonsboro to Keedysville. By 1921, the paved highway was extended west to the Norfolk Southern Railway west of Sharpsburg. The highway was completed to the Potomac River in 1923. MD 34 was one of the original signed Maryland state numbered highways in 1927. The state highway was relocated at its western end following the completion of a new bridge across the Potomac River in 1939. The underpass of the Norfolk Southern Railway between the Potomac River and Sharpsburg was completed around 1940. MD 34 was reconstructed from the Potomac River to Sharpsburg in 1953 and 1954. The state highway was rebuilt from Sharpsburg to Boonsboro between 1956 and 1958, including a new bridge over Antietam Creek. MD 34's bypass of Keedysville opened around 1961; the old highway through town was designated MD 845. Lock 38 of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and ruins of a bridge across the Potomac River at Shepherdstown, West Virginia, ca. 1861‚Äì1865 (Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division) The original river crossing at Shepherdstown was a ford downstream from the modern bridge that had various names, including Boteler's Ford, Pack Horse Ford, Shepherdstown Ford, and Blackford's Ford. This ford was utilized by Confederate forces in their retreat from the Battle of Antietam. Around 1755, Thomas Swearingen started a ferry that operated through 1849, when the first covered bridge was constructed across the river. The first covered bridge was destroyed by forces under Stonewall Jackson in 1861. A second covered bridge was constructed in 1871 and lasted until it was destroyed by the same series of floods in 1889 that devastated Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The piers of the covered bridge remain immediately downstream from the modern bridge. An iron bridge was constructed just upstream of the present bridge. This iron bridge was destroyed in the March 1936 series of floods that heavily damaged Pittsburgh. A high-level Wichert continuous truss bridge was constructed at the site of the present bridge and opened July 15, 1939. The new bridge was dedicated to James Rumsey, an 18th-century pioneer of the steamboat, who demonstrated his invention on the Potomac River at Shepherdstown in 1787. Finally, the present bridge, a steel girder span also named for Rumsey, was constructed starting in June 2003 immediately to the north of the 1939 bridge. The new bridge opened July 15, 2005, exactly 66 years after the opening of the previous bridge, which was subsequently torn down.

It was named after Admiral Sir Robert Calder, Bt. KCB, who was appointed Captain of the Fleet to Admiral John Jervis in 1796, and saw action at the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. Originally destined for the US Navy as a turbo-electric (TE) type Buckley-class destroyer escort, HMS Calder was provisionally given the name USS Formoe. However, the delivery was diverted to the Royal Navy before the launch. Actions HMS Calder served exclusively with the 4th Escort Group, earning battle honours for service in the North Atlantic.

A gun battle then ensued, with U-1051 finally sinking after it had been rammed by HMS Aylmer. This action resulted in the loss of all hands (47) from the crew of U-1051. It was entirely clear that the ramming of U-1051 by HMS Aylmer was intentional and that Cdr B.W.Taylor was not removed from command of HMS Aylmer shortly after this incident (see the article on for more information). On 8 April 1945 the submarine was sunk in the North Atlantic south-west of Ireland, at position , by the frigates HMS Bentinck and HMS Calder.

On 19 May 1943 the sisters took charge of the Seth Mulchand Municipal Maternity Home on Britto Road. The sisters administered the maternity home efficiently for over thirty-five years. The sisters opened a chapel dedicated to St. Clare, and daily Mass was attended by residents of Soldier Bazaar and Catholic Colony. After Independence the sisters visited the Catholic residents of Soldier Bazaar regularly, teaching catechism and preparing children for the sacraments. They visited the sick and the aged of Soldier Bazaar and Catholic Colony, administering medication and checking blood pressure.

Administration Due to the increasing numbers of members and apostolates spread through various regions of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, a need was felt to decentralize the administration for better efficiency and organization. During its 10th General Chapter held in 2005, the congregation decided to divide its administration into two provinces: the Province of St Francis of Assisi in Pakistan and St. Clare's Province in India. The Province in India consists of the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, Archdiocese of Mumbai, Dioceses of Vasai and Pune.

Known as Kitzmiller Road, the state highway runs from the West Virginia state line at the North Branch Potomac River in Kitzmiller, where the highway continues south as West Virginia Route 42 (WV 42), north to MD 135 on top of Backbone Mountain. MD 38 connects Kitzmiller with the rest of Garrett County and across the North Branch Potomac River to Blaine and Elk Garden in western Mineral County. The state highway was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 38 originally ran from U.S. Route 219 (US 219) near Thayerville through Deer Park and Altamont to Kitzmiller. The state highway was truncated at Backbone Mountain when MD 135 was extended west to Oakland in the mid-1950s. Route description View south along MD 38 at MD 135 near Kitzmiller MD 38 begins in the town of Kitzmiller at the Kitzmiller Bridge across the North Branch Potomac River. The highway continues on the other side of the river as WV 42 in Blaine. After passing Main Street, MD 38 begins its steep, curvy ascent of Backbone Mountain as a two-lane undivided road. The southbound direction of the state highway features a mandatory truck stop to check brakes at the top of the hill. Beyond the truck pull-off, MD 38 continues uphill at a more gentle gradient all the way to its northern terminus at MD 135 (Maryland Highway) on the ridgeline of Backbone Mountain. History MD 38 originally extended north toward Deep Creek Lake. The state highway descended Backbone Mountain toward Altamont and continued west to Deer Park following what is now MD 135 and Edgewood Drive into the center of the town. In Deer Park, MD 38 turned north along Main Street and followed Sand Flat Road to US 219 near Thayerville. MD 38 was paved from its original northern terminus through Deer Park to Altamont between 1924 and 1926. The highway was extended east to the top of Backbone Mountain by 1930; this construction included the bridge over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Altamont. The present segment of MD 38 south to Kitzmiller was under construction by 1930 and completed in 1933. The present bridge across the North Branch Potomac River and an approach road beginning at State Street on the north were completed in 1955. This bridge replaced the original 1892 bridge that crossed the river just to the east of the present crossing. MD 38 was rolled back to its current northern terminus on top of Backbone Mountain in 1956. MD 135 was relocated onto the portion of MD 38 between MD 38's present terminus and Deer Park and extended west toward Oakland. Sand Flat Road was transferred to county maintenance.

He was the first Faroese person to earn a doctoral degree. The subject of his doctoral thesis was the Norn language in Shetland. Life Jakob Jakobsen's parents were Hans Nicolai Jacobsen from T√≥rshavn, and Johanne Marie Hansdatter from Sandoy. Jakob was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters. Their father, H. N. Jacobsen, earned his living as a bookbinder and also ran a bookshop in T√≥rshavn. The original bookshop was in the old town, but H. N. Jacobsen moved the shop in 1918, to a central location further uptown, where it still stands today, retaining its traditional Faroese grass roof. Founded in 1865, H. N. Jacobsens B√≥kahandilHNJ B√≥kahandil T√≥rshavn F√∏royar Faroe Islands f√∏royskar b√∏kur f√∏royskt mentan b√≥kmentir at bokhandil.fo is one of the oldest shops still in business in the Faroe Islands today. Jakob Jakobsen went to the ‚Äúrealskolen‚Äù school in Torshavn, where he showed a natural talent for learning languages. At the age of thirteen he went to school in Denmark and finished college in Herlufsholm in 1883. In 1891 he graduated with Danish as his main subject and French and Latin as subsidiary subjects. In 1897 he earned a doctorate with his work ‚Äúdet norr√∏ne sprog p√• Shetland‚Äù (the Norse language in Shetland). Later in life, one of Jakobsen's sisters played a great role in her brother's life in Copenhagen; after his death, she translated his Shetland works into English, in accordance with Jakobsen's own plans. Jakobsen and Faroese J. Jakobsen‚Äôs work within the field of Faroese folklore and oral poetry played an important role in the rise of modern Faroese written literature. This is the case most of all with his collection of Faroese legends and folktales, F√¶r√∏ske Folkesagn og √Üventyr. He looked upon folk tales as a kind of fictional literature, while the legends to him were a kind of source about early Faroese history. He also collected oral poetry, worked with Faroese place-names and created many neologisms. He was the first to point out some Celtic place-names in the Faroes, and is also responsible for the grammar section and texts-samples in the 1891 F√¶r√∏sk Anthologi edited by V. U. Hammershaimb. In 1898 J. Jakobsen proposed a new Faroese orthography based on a then new science, phonetics. The principle of the 1898 orthography is that there must be a one-to-one correspondence between phoneme and letter, and that the written language should be easy to learn by children. Due to political controversy, the proposal was abandoned. Jakobsen and Shetland Dr. Jakob Jakobsen is a key figure in Shetland's culture. As John J. Graham writes in his preface to the 2nd edition, his \\"Dictionary of the Norn Language in Shetland\\" is the unrivaled source-book of information on the origins and usage of the Shetland tongue. Based on Jakobsen's fieldwork in Shetland during 1893-95, it first appeared in Danish in four volumes between 1908 and 1921, and was subsequently published in English in two volumes, 1928 and 1932. The dictionary has established itself internationally as a major work of scholarship in Scandinavian philology. In 1985 The Shetland Folk Society, of which Graham was President at the time, succeeded in finding funds to reprint the two volume English edition in facsimile. When Jakobsen left the Faroes for Leith near Edinburgh, his only knowledge of the language of Shetland was drawn from Thomas Edmondston's glossary and those parts of George Stewart's Shetland Fireside Tales that are written in Shetland dialect. In Edinburgh he met Gilbert Goudie, and there he read \\"a valuable manuscript supplement\\" to Edmondston's work written by Thomas Barclay. He arrived in Shetland in 1893 and during his field work there he interviewed a large number of Shetland dialect speakers and scholars, including Haldane Burgess, James Stout Angus, John Irvine, Robert Jamieson (1827-1899), James Inkster, John Nicolson, and Laurence Williamson. Jakobsen's correspondence with Goudie was edited by E. S. Reid Tait and published in 1953. In 1981, Roy Gr√∏nneberg published a study entitled Jakobsen and Shetland.

This was based on the microbial infallibility hypothesis. He states that \\"the biomedical approach would be to identify the genetic basis for that capacity, and to put one or two genes into ourselves, thereby enhancing our own ability to break things down, and to thereby get rid of things that we cannot naturally break down\\". In order to add credibility the concept, de Grey created an experiment using soil from a graveyard and took the bacteria from it.

In 1980, the Estate was sold and converted to a winery. History In 1980, a two-day jousting festival called the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire was held in the winery parking lot to attract visitors. The event proved popular, and expanded in the following years. In 2009, the Faire was held on a site with 90 shows performed daily on 12 stages, hundreds of costumed characters, and a recreation of a 16th-century English village with authentic Tudor buildings. Musical performances, Shakespearean plays, and other acts were offered, twenty-three \\"Royal Kitchens\\" served food and drink, and Renaissance merchants were on-site. The Swashbuckler Brewing Company was founded on the grounds in 2000, and its product is available at the Swashbuckler Brew Pub. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the 40th season was shortened to 9 weeks from Labor Day weekend- November 1st when similar events got cancelled. Praise The Faire's music and storytelling have been praised by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Little Buffalo Performance Center, and, in 1998, the Faire was named one of the top 100 motorcoach-accessible events in America by the American Bus Association. Business As a privately owned business, the faire is not required to report revenues to the public. In a 1998 interview, the owner, Chuck Romito, revealed that \\"Gross sales for wine purchases and tickets for shows at the Mount Hope Estates--including Christmas, Halloween, Roaring '20s and other theme performances--hover around $4 million,\\" while the faire's expenses were about $2 million. As of 2008, American Renaissance festivals were much larger in scale than their European counterparts. Consuming History specifically mentions the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire for its high attendance, along with the Maryland Renaissance Faire, which draws 225,000 visitors over three weeks, and the Bristol Renaissance Faire, which reached a peak in 1990 with 400,000 visitors in seven weekends.

He is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester, and the younger brother of Edgar, the Earl's legitimate son. Early on in the play, Edmund resolves to get rid of his brother, then his father, and become Earl in his own right. He later flirts with both Goneril and Regan and attempts to play them off against each other. His mother died during child birth. Origins Shakespeare's source for the subplot of Edmund, Edgar and Gloucester was a tale from Philip Sidney's Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia of a blind Paphlagonian king and his two sons, Leonatus and Plexirtus. The name \\"Edmund\\" itself means \\"wealth protector\\" or \\"protector of wealth.\\" Edmund and Edgar were also the names of the sons of Malcolm III of Scotland who killed Macbeth. Historically Edmund of Scotland had betrayed his immediate family to support his uncle Donald III. Following the death of Malcolm III from being stabbed in the eye, they ordered the killing of Edmund's half brother Duncan II, the rightful heir, to take the Scottish throne. Edgar, Edmund's younger brother, then returned to Scotland and defeated them to become King. Edmund was then sent to an English monastery where he later died. Due to these clear parallels the choice of Edmund and Edgar as names may have been a nod by Shakespeare to the continued story of the Scottish throne following the events of Macbeth. There is also a more immediate literary fore-runner, in a play by an unknown author or authors, current in London around 1590; The True Chronicle history of King Lear, and his three daughters, Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. The plot of this play follows fairly closely the account given in Geoffrey of Monmouth but adds a significant character to whom no name is given, possibly because he does not figure in the original. Known only as a Messenger, he does (or tries to do) much of what the Edmund character in Shakespeare does. At the point the Messenger first appears, Lear has already left the household of Goneril for that of Regan, now Queen of Cambria. The Messenger allows Goneril to take from him Cornwall's letters for Lear, and replace them with her own to her sister, intended to provoke Regan to the murder of Lear. Having taken money for this service and promised, in terms full of sexual quibbles, to be Goneril's servant, he then extracts a second fee from Regan to see to Lear's murder, and a third fee for the murder of Lear's companion. He ends the scene by speculating that he believes he could make a sexual conquest of Regan as well as her sister. The part of the character which Shakespeare abandons is that the Messenger comes on Lear and his companion dozing in a garden and, in a lengthy scene of mixed pathos and comedy, loses his nerve after they wake, and abandons the enterprise altogether.

SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900 8:2 (Spring 1968), pp. 187‚Äì216. whose ambitions lead him to form a union with Goneril and Regan. The injustice of Edmund's situation fails to justify his subsequent actions, although at the opening of the play when Gloucester explains Edmund's illegitimacy (in his hearing) to Kent, with coarse jokes, the audience can initially feel sympathetic towards him, until his true character is revealed. Like Shylock and his \\"Has not a Jew eyes...?\\" (Merchant of Venice, III, 1, 60), Edmund makes a speech, \\"Why bastard? Wherefore base?\\" (I, 2, 5) decrying his stereotype before conforming to it. Edmund rejects the laws of state and society in favour of the laws he sees as eminently more practical and useful: the laws of superior cunning and strength. Edmund‚Äôs desire to use any means possible to secure his own needs makes him appear initially as a villain without a conscience. But Edmund has some solid economic impetus for his actions, and he acts from a complexity of reasons, many of which are similar to those of Goneril and Regan. To rid himself of his father, Edmund feigns regret and laments that his nature, which is to honour his father, must be subordinate to the loyalty he feels for his country. Thus, Edmund excuses the betrayal of his own father, having willingly and easily left his father vulnerable to Cornwall's anger. Later, Edmund shows no hesitation, nor any concern about killing the king or Cordelia. Yet in the end, Edmund repents and tries to rescind his order to execute Cordelia and Lear, but it is done too late: Cordelia has already been executed at Edmund's orders. Because of primogeniture, Edmund will inherit nothing from his father. That, combined with Gloucester's poor treatment of Edmund in the opening lines of the play, gives Edmund motivation to betray his brother Edgar and manipulate his way into relationships with both Goneril and Regan. If Lear, Cordelia, and Kent represent the old ways of monarchy, order, and a distinct hierarchy, then Edmund is the most representative of a new order which adheres to a Machiavellian code. Edmund's determination to undo his brother and claim his father's title causes him to cut his own arm early in the play to make an imaginary fight between Edgar (his brother) and himself more convincing. Late in the play, Edmund begins to adhere to the traditional values of society, and tries to repent for his sins, but he crucially delays in rescinding his order to execute Lear and Cordelia. Edmund's declaring Nature as his goddess undermines the law of primogeniture and legitimacy. Another character that Edmund is often compared to is Iago of Othello, but Edmund is seen as the better character of the pair, as he tries to repent. After his betrayal of Edgar and his father, Cornwall, Regan's husband, becomes like a new father to Edmund, as he also has an opportunistic bent. Edmund's affairs with Goneril and Regan tie the two subplots together very well, although the relationships are not presented in detail, and they do not exist in the source material for Edmund, Plexirtus. He does not appear to have as much affection for the two sisters as they do for him, and although he was effective against his father and brother, he cannot effectively play the two sisters off against each other. When he speaks to Goneril and Regan, he does not speak well, whereas in other situations he speaks very well ‚Äì this is partially due to his trying to conceal his involvement with both of them. Edmund is the sisters' lust object, rather than true love, although he himself does not realise this. His marrying the two sisters as he dies is an allusion to and parody of courtly love, in which lovers separated by circumstance could be married in death. Spin offs \\"Edmund, Son of Gloucester\\" by Chris Lambert was performed by Exiled theatre in 1996 and toured nationally. The play studied Edmund's back-story from birth to his appearance in King Lear to explore the reasons for his actions. The play starred Adrian Ross-Jones as Edmund and Robert Addie as Gloucester.

Known as Friendsville Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 219 (US 219) near McHenry north to the Pennsylvania state line near Asher Glade, where the highway continues as State Route 2013 (SR 2013) in Fayette County toward Pennsylvania Route 281 (PA 281) in Markleysburg. MD 42 provides the most direct route between Friendsville and southern Garrett County. The state highway was constructed as a modern highway from Friendsville to north of Accident in the early 1920s. The remainder of the highway through Asher Glade was completed in the early 1930s. The southern terminus was shifted from Accident to McHenry in 1960. Route description View north along MD 42 at I-68 near Friendsville MD 42 begins at a tangent intersection with US 219 (Garrett Highway) at the northern edge of McHenry near Deep Creek Lake. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road. After meeting Hoyes Sang Run Road in the hamlet of Hoyes, MD 42 curves west then north again through farmland. The state highway features a pull-off for trucks to check their brakes before starting a descent with grades of up to 8%. The uphill direction has a climbing lane for part of the ascent. At the bottom of the hill, MD 42 enters the town of Friendsville and turns west. First Avenue, which is unsigned MD 742, heads north into the center of Friendsville while MD 42 bypasses the town center to the south and west. After crossing the Youghiogheny River, MD 42 turns northwest and meets Interstate 68 (I-68) at a diamond interchange. The entrance ramp from MD 42 to westbound I-68 forms the fourth leg of the intersection with the other end of MD 742, Maple Street, which receives the exit ramp from westbound I-68. MD 42 heads west up a creek valley to an intersection with Blooming Rose Road, then turns north and crosses Buffalo Run. Shortly after crossing Laurel Run and Glade Run, the state highway passes through the unincorporated community of Asher Glade before the highway reaches its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The road continues north as SR 2013 (Friendsville Road) toward Markleysburg, where the highway meets PA 281. History MD 42 originally connected Friendsville with US 219 north of Accident via Bear Creek Road instead of the current connection near McHenry. The state highway was paved for about east of Friendsville in 1921. The highway was complete to present day US 219 at the hamlet of Kaese Mill north of Accident in 1923. The first section of MD 42 from Friendsville to the Pennsylvania state line was completed in 1928 from the west side of the Youghiogheny River to Blooming Rose Road. The modern Maple Street bridge over the Youghiogheny River was built in 1932. Construction of MD 42 from Blooming Rose Road to the state line began in 1932 and was completed in 1935. MD 42 was transferred from its eastern terminus near Accident to a southern terminus near McHenry, following First Street north to Maple Street within Friendsville, in 1960. The state highway originally followed Hoyes Road east from the crossroads in Hoyes to US 219 north of the present terminus. MD 42 was shifted to its present terminus south of Hoyes around 1972. The state highway was relocated in Friendsville to connect with its interchange with I-68 in 1975; First Street and Maple Street through Friendsville were designated MD 742.

The large unincorporated community of Prairieville and the city of St. Gabriel both lie on its southern side. Etymology Dr John R. Swanton, a linguist who worked with Native American languages, suggested that the name Manchac is derived from Imashaka, which is a Choctaw word meaning \\"the rear entrance.\\" An early Choctaw language dictionary written by Cyrus Byington defines the word im as a preposition meaning \\"place\\" and ashaka meaning \\"the back side or rear\\" Exploration In March 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville made his way up the Mississippi and came to the area that is now the city of Baton Rouge. He wished to find a quick way back to the Gulf of Mexico, where his ships were moored at Ship Island. On March 26, 1699, the chief of the Bayogoula tribe, who had accompanied him to the future site of Baton Rouge, showed him the bayou that the Bayogoula used to travel between the present-day Mississippi Gulf Coast and their village. Though it once formed an international boundary, attempts to navigate the bayou as a shortcut between the Mississippi and Amite rivers, or to make it navigable, were generally unsuccessful. Fort Bute In 1764 the British established a trading post on the Iberville River and called it Fort Bute at Manchac. The British traded with boats traveling down the Mississippi and encouraged trading at Manchac rather than with the Spanish farther down at New Orleans. The fort at Bayou Manchac was a strategic position for the British and was positioned to compete with Spain for the fur trade, valued at that time at 100,000 pounds sterling annually. San Gabriel de Manchac Soon after the British built Fort Bute, the Spanish responded by building a trading post on the opposite side of the river. On September 28, 1766, an English ship arrived in New Orleans from Maryland carrying 224 exiled Acadians. The Spanish Governor Antonio de Ulloa at the Isle of Orleans gave them supplies, and they settled around San Gabriel de Manchac. Industrial use and today Bayou Manchac became one of the most important waterways of southeastern Louisiana. It served the vital role of linking Baton Rouge to Lake Pontchartrain via the Amite River and Lake Maurepas. Through time, as ships became larger and faster, Bayou Manchac was too small to support modern traffic. In the 20th century, when the Mississippi River levees were built, Bayou Manchac was cut off from the river, and later the upper sections dried out or were cut off by roads. Now the bayou is only useful for drainage and recreation, but the area is still regarded by those who live in the vicinity as one of Louisiana's most beautiful examples of nature.

It was co-edited by John F. Callahan, the executor of Ellison's literary estate, and Adam Bradley, a professor of English at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The book was published on January 26, 2010, by Modern Library. An excerpt of Ralph Ellison's unfinished manuscripts was previously published as Juneteenth (1999). Background Ralph Ellison's first novel, Invisible Man, was published in 1952 to great critical success. In 1953, it beat Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea to win the National Book Award. Following the success of Invisible Man, Ellison became one of the most respected writers in the country and prominent in many elite circles. Invisible Man sold so well that royalty checks provided financial security for the rest of Ellison's life. The stream of money meant that the release of a second novel would be a literary decision and not a financial one. Ellison spent the 42 years after the publication of Invisible Man, until his death in 1994, working on his second novel. The reasons for this delay have been a subject of speculation and debate. He produced over 2,000 manuscript pages but never turned the content into a coherent novel. =History= Ellison began work on his untitled second novel around 1954, following the publication of Invisible Man. Ellison claimed to be devastated when part of the original manuscript was destroyed by a fire in 1967. However, Arnold Rampersad advanced the opinion that the loss of the crucial, irrecoverable sections of his manuscript appears to have been something Ellison concocted after the fact to justify his lack of progress. In his 2007 biography of Ellison, Rampersad points out that, following the fire, Ellison wrote to critic Nathan Scott of his relief that he still \\"fortunately had a full copy\\" of all his writing. In different interviews, the lost manuscript pages were described as \\"360 pages, and \\"500 pages\\", and \\"about a summer‚Äôs worth of revisions\\". Ellison published eight excerpts from the novel during his lifetime, including an excerpt called \\"Juneteenth\\" in the Quarterly Review of Literature in 1965,Pruitt, Sarah (June 19, 2017). \\"Why Ralph Ellison Never Published a Second Novel During His Lifetime,\\" History.

However, although he had written over 2,000 pages by the time of his death (other sources say 1,500 pages, not including revised versions of scenes)Feeley, Gregory (May 23, 1999). \\"Invisible Hand\\", The New York Times Magazine. Retrieved June 20, 2020., Ellison never finished the novel. Literary executorship According to John F. Callahan, a professor who had become close friends with Ellison after writing an article about Invisible Man, Ellison was so discouraged by the thought of his own death that he never discussed his literary executorship. Shortly after Ellison's death, his widow appointed Callahan as his literary executor. Callahan was overwhelmed by the amount of notes, computer disks, and manuscript pages that Ellison had left behind. Ellison's readers were eager to see what Ellison had written, but Callahan needed time to sort through the manuscript and find a way to make it publishable. In the meanwhile, he edited The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison, published in 1995, and Flying Home and Other Stories, published in 1996. In 1999, Callahan finished editing the most cohesive part of Ellison's unfinished manuscript, which was released as the standalone novel Juneteenth. After several more years of work, and with the co-editing of Adam Bradley, who started as a student assistant to Callahan in 1994 and eventually completed a doctorate in literature at Harvard University, a publication date (January 26, 2010) was set for a release of the manuscript with supporting notes under the title Three Days Before the Shooting. Plot The plot of Three Days Before the Shooting revolves around a man named Bliss, of indeterminate race, who is raised by a black Baptist minister named Alonzo Hickman. As an adult Bliss assumes a white identity and eventually becomes a race-baiting United States Senator named Adam Sunraider.

Each day's front page also includes a prayer. History The first daily newspaper in Somerset, the Somerset Daily Herald made its first appearance on July 1, 1929 with the headline, \\"'Polish John pleads today.\\" Initially distributed to 300 subscribers, the publication began under the leadership of Henry Baker Reiley, following his acquisition of the semiweekly Somerset Herald, and was eventually renamed as the Daily American. The family business - Somerset Newspapers Inc., which included the Daily American and the Somerset County Shopper (now known as Somerset County Direct) - was sold by Reiley in 1997 to Schurz Communications Inc. of South Bend, Indiana. In 2006, the newspaper opened an office in Johnstown for the start of the Our Town weekly newspaper. It is an information company providing newspapers, websites, books, maps, brochures and place mats and billboards to residents and businesses in Somerset and Cambria counties. According to Charles Welsh, a former Herald employee who later worked as a news editor at the Associated Press World News Service, few in Somerset thought the idea of a daily newspaper would work. It did under the direction of Reiley and his staff that included, Robert S. Scull, Mary Black and Mary Hause whom Welsh describes as a small-town challenger to Barbara Walters. The paper and its inner-workings including a Linotype, a keyboard machine with a keyboard that listed lower and capital case letters in no particular order, were housed in a three-level brick building across from Somerset County's Courthouse along Union Street. In 1930, the paper moved to 216 W. Main St. where it stayed until 1966, four years after Rev. Henry Reiley Jr. Henry Baker Reiley's son, became publisher. He relocated the paper's office again and constructed a new building at 334 W. Main St. The third-generation Reiley, David H. Reiley, began working at the paper in 1970 and was promoted to publisher After his father's death in 1984. Schurz, whose masthead paper is the South-Bend Tribune, named Jon G. Starn as the publisher of the Daily American. Starn retired in 2002 and was replaced by Douglas Caldwell. Starn supervised the Daily Americans 10,000 square feet, multimillion-dollar renovation project, which, according to Caldwell, gave the paper local recognition and modern offices. Caldwell was promoted by Schurz on March 6 to oversee the corporation's latest acquisition in Northern Michigan. He is serving as publisher for a daily newspaper and oversees operations at two weekly newspaper and other niche publications including a telephone directory in Petoskey, Michigan. On May 1, 2006, Andy Bruns, a 41-year-old Hollister, Calif., resident with an extensive background in newspaper advertising, started as the new publisher. The publisher oversees 85 Daily American employees in editorial, circulation and advertising departments. The staff is working in a 2002 two-story building with conference rooms and more space throughout the facility. In June 2011, Bruns also assumed the responsibilities of being publisher for the Herald-Mail newspaper in Hagerstown, Md., another Schurz property. Business Manager Rebecca Flyte was named general manager of the Daily American to assist him in the day-to-day operations. The Thursday, March 7, 2013 newspaper was the last one printed on Somerset's press. On March 8, 2013, all of the newsprint products started being published by the Altoona Mirror. Its news pages deadline was changed from 12:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. to accommodate the new delivery schedule. On November 19, 2013, a paywall/membership plan was started for digital subscribers.

As a student at Chouinard Art Institute (now CalArts), Foulkes began exhibiting with the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles in 1959. He held his first one-man exhibition at Ferus in 1961. Other early solo exhibitions included the Pasadena Art Museum (1962) and the Oakland Art Museum (1964). He also showed with a new gallery across the street from Ferus (exhibiting Jess, Georgia O'Keeffe, Irving Petlin, and others) called the Rolf Nelson Gallery (1963, 64). In 1967, Foulkes was awarded the Prize for Painting at the Paris Biennale, Musee d‚ÄôArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris followed by a European exhibition there. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was the first museum to acquire his work for its collection, in 1964 as the original building was still under construction. Charles Proof Demetrion selected Foulkes to represent the United States in the IX S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, Museu de Arte Moderna S√£o Paulo, Brazil also in 1967. Through the late sixties into the seventies Foulkes created landscape paintings that utilized the iconography of postcards, vintage landscape photography, and Route 66-inspired hazard signs. This period resulted in his first retrospective organized by the Newport Harbor Art Museum (1974). Music also became a major catalyst in Foulkes's work at this time. He played drums with City Lights from 1965 to 1971, and formed his own band, The Rubber Band, in 1973, which stayed together until 1977. By 1979, Foulkes had returned to his childhood interest in one-man bands and began playing solo with \\"The Machine,\\" which he created. He still performs with The Machine regularly on the West Coast and has released a CD of original compositions, entitled Llyn Foulkes and His Machine: Live at the Church of Art. Since the early 1980s, Foulkes began working on a series of tableaux, beginning with O‚ÄôPablo (1983).

He participated in the Northern Expedition and Second Sino-Japanese War, in which he served with distinction. A portrayal of his conduct as a frontline commander in 1938 can be found in chapter 3 of Freda Utley‚Äôs China at War. For the later War years 1939-1945, he served as Chair (governor) of the Guangdong provincial government. His last role in public life was as Interior Minister during the acting-presidency of Li Zongren, the last Kuomintang administration in mainland China  BiographyÊûï‰∏äÊ¢¶Âõû: ÊùéÊ±âÈ≠ÇÂê¥ËèäËä≥‰ºâ‰ø™Ëá™‰º†, Âπø‰∏ú‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 2012-8-1 (Li Hanhun‚Äôs autobiography in Chinese).  At age 17 Li joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), the Society chiefly instrumental in the overthrow of the Manchu Dynasty and establishment of a Republican government in China in 1911. He became a career military officer on graduating from the Baoding Military Academy in the Academy‚Äôs sixth graduating class in 1919. He was a division commander in the famed ‚ÄúIron‚Äù Fourth Corps of the National Revolutionary Army that helped eliminate the power of warlords and unify the nation in the late 1920s. Li Hanhun played notable roles at several junctures in the conflict with Japan. As the Sino-Japanese War was brewing in 1936 and factions within the Kuomintang were in power struggles verging on civil war, Li gave up his commission with the leader of one faction (Chen Jitang ÈôàÊµéÊ£†), while issuing a universal call-out to all Chinese forces to unite under the leadership of Chiang Kai Shek in resistance against Japan invasion. In 1938, as commander of the 64th Army in the Battle of Lanfeng, he defeated General Kenjii Doihara in Luowangzhai (ÁΩóÁéãÁ†¶), a depot town on the Longhai Railway where Doihara headquartered his main forces; Doihara had been the principal commander of Japanese forces in China and had been engaging in efforts to control China‚Äôs major railroad systems. From 1939 to 1945, General Li served as Governor of war-torn and partially occupied Guangdong Province, during which he devoted himself to good governance and war relief efforts. As part of the latter efforts, he collaborated with and supported his wife Wu Chu-Fang (Âê¥ËèäËä≥) in a range of enterprises to mitigate the problems of war- displaced refugees. In 1947 after the War had ended, Li was granted permission for two years of medical leave to the United States, and a study tour to the Americas and Europe to observe post war reconstruction. Li returned to China in 1947, participated in the national election in which he was elected to the National Assembly, and also served as Minister of Interior during the brief acting-presidency of Li Zongren. When the Communists took over the mainland at the end of that year, General Li Hanhun emigrated to the United States to rejoin his family there. Though his career in public life in China had mainly been in military service and War zone governance, General Li Hanhun was self- described as a reluctant warrior in his own writings and in his life-long devotion to Buddhism and Chinese classical learning. He was the principal facilitator in the 1934 restoration, under the abbot Xuyun, of the sixth century Nanhua Temple in Shaoguang, Guangdong; Li‚Äôs calligraphy on pillars and doorways of that Temple are still displayed today. His collected writings of essays, poetry, history, diaries and autobiography have now all been published.ÊùéÊº¢È≠ÇÂ∞áËªçÊñáÈõÜ, ‰∏≠ÂúãÁ§æÊúÉÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 2015-1; In 1949, Li Hanhun went with his family to the United States, where he lived in the New York City area for the remainder of his life. Together with his wife Wu Chu-Fang, they operated a series of three Chinese restaurants, the one in White Plains, the China Garden, being particularly successful and famous in its time. The family history, against a backdrop of world events, is recounted in the book by his daughter Virginia Li: From One Root Many Flowers: A Century of Family Life in China and America. In 1987, he died in New York. Former Harvard Professor Frederick Pei Li was his son.

Because Wei Lihuang refused to concentrate the majority of the nationalist forces in Jinzhou, unable to disobey the orders of his superior officer, Fan fought as hard as he could, but he was outmaneuvered by the communist forces led by Lin Biao, who used massed artillery to achieve a breakthrough into the city defense, and on October 15, 1948, Jinzhou had fallen and Fan was captured by the communist Manchurian Field Army. He was imprisoned in Jinzhou Jail until his pardon by Chinese Communists years later. Later life After his release in 1962, he was elected as a member of the CCP national committee on historical records. He had written a \\"Jinzhou campaign memoir,\\" documented his war effort. In 1964 he was elected as the fourth member of the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. On January 16, 1976 he died in Beijing, at age 82.

The driverless system transports passengers along Concourse A of the airport's Edward H. McNamara Terminal, which is the world's second-longest airport concourse. Detroit Metro Airport serves as the second largest hub for Delta Air Lines, after Atlanta. The ExpressTram entered service when the McNamara Terminal opened on February 24, 2002. Technology The system was custom designed by Poma-Otis Transportation Systems, a joint venture between Otis Elevator Company and Poma that has since been dissolved. Installation was performed by Otis, who currently operates and maintains the system. The system operates above the main floor, and it consists of two cable-driven trams that ride upon an air-cushion, similar to a hovercraft. 3-PSI of air pressure is enough to lift the tram vehicles approximately 1/2\\" above the guideway surface. (The same \\"Hovair\\" technology is used in the Hub Tram and the Cincinnati Airport People Mover) Each tram is made up of two cars and can carry up to 208 passengers at a time. The track, referred to as a guideway in the APM industry, is over long. LED displays in the stations, and in the trams, provide information, such as the upcoming stops, supplemented with a pre- recorded male voice which delivers audio information and warnings.  Route The ExpressTram services three stations along Concourse A. The stations at the ends of the concourse are appropriately named the North Station (which serves gates A56-A78) and the South Station (which serves gates A1-A28). The center station serves gates A29-A55, Luggage Claim, Ground Transportation, and Concourses B and C. The center station is officially known as the Terminal Station, based upon its close proximity to the main terminal building, which houses baggage claim, airline check-in counters, and ground transportation facilities. A maintenance garage lies beyond the North Station. The system's primary infrastructure consists of a single guide-way with a bypass. When approaching the Center station, one tram veers off from the main guideway into the bypass, allowing the two trams to pass each other. The bypass reconnects to the main portion of the guideway beyond the center station. Operating software attempts to keep the trams synchronized, so that the trams arrive at the Center Station simultaneously, but this is not essential. In the event that trams lose synchronization, as is frequently the case with passenger induced delays, the first tram to arrive at the Center station will be held until the opposite tram enters the bypass area, providing a clear path for the waiting tram.

He played college football at Pacific Lutheran University. Early years Kupp attended Selah High School, where he competed in football, basketball and tennis. He didn't have a notable high school football career, so he wasn't highly recruited. He accepted a football scholarship from Montana Technological University, where he received All-Frontier Conference honors as a quarterback and punter. He transferred to Pacific Lutheran University after his freshman season, to complete his studies closer to his home. As a sophomore in 1987, he was a backup behind Jeff Yarnell and was a part of the NAIA Division II national championship team. As a junior in 1988, he became a starter at quarterback. His team eventually lost 35‚Äì56 in an NAIA Division II playoff game, after the Oregon Institute of Technology accomplished the biggest comeback in school history, by scoring 49 points in the second half. Kupp led his team to a 35‚Äì7 advantage at halftime, tallying a career-high 272 passing yards, 16-of-21 completions, 2 passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown, before fracturing his left ankle with just two minutes left in the first half. As a senior in 1989, he made 185-of-286 pass completions (64.7%) for 2,398 yards (school record), 25 touchdowns (third in school history) and 3 interceptions, setting the record for passing yards in a season and an NAIA Division II record for interception rate with a 1.04% mark. Against Southern Oregon University, he set school records for passing yards (411) and touchdown throws (6) in a single-game, while leading his team to a 52‚Äì50 win. He received All-Columbia Football Association honors at the end of the season. He finished his college career with 300-of-499 completions for 3,921 yards (fourth in school history), 41 touchdowns (fourth in school history) and 11 interceptions.

In 1991, a training camp knee injury to starting quarterback Timm Rosenbach, allowed Kupp to gain additional playing experience. In his only professional football game, Kupp completed 3-of-7 attempts for 23 yards in the fourth quarter of the Cardinals' 34‚Äì0 loss to the Washington Redskins in week 3. On November 6, 1991, he was released to make room for quarterback Chris Chandler. =Dallas Cowboys= On November 7, 1991, he was claimed off waivers by the a Dallas Cowboys. After starter Troy Aikman suffered a knee injury in the twelfth game against the Washington Redskins, Kupp ascended from third- string to backup quarterback behind Steve Beuerlein.

PAS-D is a stain often used by pathologists as an ancillary study in making a histologic diagnosis on paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. PAS stain typically gives a magenta color in the presence of glycogen. When PAS and diastase are used together, a light pink color replaces the deep magenta.

In 1926, he was promoted to the commander of the Second Army of the National Revolutionary Army. In 1928, he led his army into Qinghai and surrendered Ma Qi, who dominated Qinghai. Later, he once acted as the chairman of the Qinghai provincial government. In 1930, during the Central Plains War, Gao Shuxun fought with Chiang Kai-shek. After the defeat, Gao Shuxun surrendered to Chiang Kai-shek and was appointed the 27th Division Commander of the 26th Route Army. In 1931, in the third encirclement of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in Jiangxi Province, he suddenly left the army and fled to Tianjin. Later, Gao Shuxun secretly contacted the Communist Party of China. In 1933, Gao Shuxun joined Feng Yuxiang to organize the Chahar People's Anti- Japanese Allied Army in Chahar and served as the second commander of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. In 1937, after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Gao Shuxun served as the director of the Hebei Provincial Security Department and the general commander of the Hebei Guerrilla. In February 1939, he served as a member of the Chahar provincial government. In December 1940, due to Shi Yousan's attempt to surrender to Japan, Gao Shuxun was arrested and buried alive by Chiang Kai-shek's secret order. In January 1941, he was promoted to deputy commander-in-chief of the 39th Army. In May of the same year, he also served as the commander of the new 8th Army.

After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on October 30, 1945, during the Battle of Handan, Gao Shuxun led the newly formed Eighth Army and the Hebei Civilian Army. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China praised this. Soon Mao Zedong also launched the \\"Gao Shuxun Movement\\" to promote the Kuomintang army uprising, surrender, and accept the adaptation. On November 10, 1945, Gao Shuxun ‚Äôs Democratic Founding Army was established. Gao Shuxun was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Democratic Founding Army, Wang Dingnan was the director of the General Political Department, Fan Longzhang was the first army commander, and Qiao Mingli was the second army commander. On November 13, 1945, with the approval of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, introduced by Deng Xiaoping and Bo Yibo, Gao Shuxun officially joined the Communist Party of China. After the establishment of the Democratic National Founding Army, the Jinji Luyu Military Region sent a batch of political work cadres to the Democratic National Founding Army to carry out political work, but these cadres were not happy with the general of the Democratic National Founding Army. On June 14, 1947, the so-called \\"conspiracy riots\\" of the Democratic People's Republic of China were reported. On June 15, 1947, Gao Shuxun was arrested and examined for the \\"conspiracy uprising\\" of the Democratic Founding Army, and the designation of the Democratic Founding Army was revoked. One year after the review, no evidence was found, and Gao Shuxun was appointed deputy commander of the North China Military Region. Later, after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the injustice of the so-called \\"conspiracy riot\\" by the Democratic People's Founding Army was finally vindicated.

Historically the name Dunrossness has usually referred to the area on the Shetland mainland south of Quarff. However, in 2016 there were three separate Shetland Community Councils for a) Gulberwick, Quarff and Cunningsburgh; b) Sandwick; and c) Dunrossness. The 2011 census defined Dunrossness as including everybody within the British ZE2 postal code, which goes as far north as Gulberwick. It has the best and largest area of fertile farmland of any parish in Shetland. Dunrossness includes the island of Mousa, Levenwick, St Ninian's Isle, Bigton, Scousburgh, the Lochs of Spiggie and Brow, Boddam, Quendale, Virkie, Exnaboe, Grutness, Toab, Ness of Burgi, Clumlie Broch, Scatness, Sumburgh Airport, Sumburgh Head, West Voe, the islands of Lady's Holm, Little Holm, Horse Holm island and Fair Isle. Dunrossness is associated with a number of eminent people, such as Haldane Burgess, George Stewart, Sir Herbert J.C. Grierson, Jenny Gilbertson, Elizabeth Balneaves as well as that symbol of providence Betty Mouat. The author Sir Walter Scott visited Dunrossness in 1814 and wrote the novel The Pirate, which is set mostly in the Parish. Robert Stevenson built Shetland's first lighthouse at Sumburgh Head in 1821, and his son Thomas Stevenson and his grandson, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, visited the Shetland lighthouses and Fair Isle in 1870. Dunrossness had 1,505 sites of archeological interest in 2016, 181 of them scheduled (i.e. nationally important). For example, Jarlshof, perhaps the best known prehistoric archaeological site in Shetland and Old Scatness (which has mediaeval, Viking, Pictish, and Iron Age remains) both lie within the parish of Dunrossness. Another example is the lost township of Broo (other spellings include Brew and Brow) near Quendale Beach. Broo was headed by the wealthy Sinclair family and was inhabited until probably the last decades of the 17th century when the buildings were covered with up to two metres of sand and abandoned. These have been excavated since 1997. Quendale beach was the site of the largest whale- kill ever recorded in Shetland in 1845 when 1,540 Long-finned Pilot Whales were driven ashore. In 1969 the oil tanker MV Braer ran aground on Garths Ness in Dunrossness releasing 85,000 tons of crude oil one of the worst oil spills in Shetland's history.

Located mostly on the Shetland Mainland, the centre lies about 2 miles north of Scalloway. Tingwall Airport is located in the village. Parish Tingwall parish includes the settlements of Scalloway, Whiteness, Veensgarth and Gott, and the Vallafield housing estate. The centre of the parish was the Tingwall Kirk.Tingwall Church (The Church of Scotland) It comprehends a section of Mainland, stretching from the Atlantic at Scalloway, to the North Sea at Rova Head and includes the formerly inhabited islands of Hildasay, Langa, Linga, and Oxna. The Mainland section is divided into two districts by a hill ridge, and comprises two parallel valleys (nearly at right angles from the ridge). The Tingwall valley extends north from near Scalloway to the south end of Lax Firth. It is diversified by the lochs of Tingwall, Girlsta, Asta, Strom and some others. It is so indented by the sea as to contain no point farther than two miles from it. Measured across marine intersections, it has a length of about nineteen miles, and a maximum breadth of ten miles. History Earl of Orkney in Tingwall kirkyard The small promontory at the end of Tingwall Loch, known as Tingaholm or Law Ting Holm was once home to Shetland's earliest parliament. It was once an islet entirely surrounded by water and accessed by a stone causeway. In the 1850s the level of the loch was lowered, and the holm took on its present form.Law Ting Holm (Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland) Tingwall was also the base of the Archdeaconry in Shetland. The present day church lies on the site of a much older building, originally dedicated to St Magnus. The burial vault in the churchyard is believed to belong to this earlier building, which is thought to have had a round tower, similar to that of the St Magnus Kirk on Egilsay, Orkney. There are a number of ancient and historical monuments in Tingwall, including a standing stone Loch of Tingwall (Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland) known as the murder stone. This stone is traditionally said to be the site where the Earl of Orkney killed his cousin in a power struggle over Shetland. Local folklore also suggests that a person could escape punishment at the Thing if they were able to run to the stone and claim sanctuary. Other versions of this story involve running to the Kirk, or the nearby croft at Griesta. Tingwall was the home of brothers Laurence I. Graham (Lollie) and John J. Graham, two of Shetland's most influential 20th Century Writers. Wildlife Tufted duck, red-breasted merganser and common and black-headed gull frequent the loch, which is also home to Shetland's only mute swans.\\"Tingwall Central Mainland Law Ting Holm Shetland Parliament\\". iknow-scotland.co.uk Retrieved 15 August 2010.

The tallest buildings would have been the Old City Harbor Towers II and III, which were planned as twin office skyscrapers that each rise 636 feet (194 m), with 37 floors. Old City Harbor Tower I was being planned as a residential tower, rising 435 ft (132 m), with 42 floors. The Greater Philadelphia World Trade Center would have been the shortest of all four buildings, rising 324 ft (99 m), with 17 floors. In 2012, the plan was revised by Waterfront Renaissance Associates as 1,458-unit residential tower complex, with two taller 435 ft towers and two shorter 435 ft towers. The development would have violated the 100 foot height limit imposed by the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation in their master plan. In response to height concerns, the plan was revised in July 2013 to lower the height of the tallest tower to 240 feet and build five towers instead of four.

He is now Australia's head rowing coach announced in September 2016. He immediately coached the Australian men's four to a gold medal at the 2017 world rowing championships (Sarasota, Florida). Rowing career Wright was born in 1961 in Wanganui, New Zealand. He moved to Hamilton and became a member of the Hamilton Rowing Club. He had Harry Mahon as his rowing coach. Wright won two medals at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. He won silver with Barrie Mabbott in the coxless pair and bronze in the eight. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Wright won bronze in the coxed four along with George Keys, Greg Johnston, Chris White and Andrew Bird (cox). At the 1989 World Rowing Championships at Bled, Yugoslavia, he won a bronze in the men's four with Bill Coventry, Alastair Mackintosh, and Campbell Clayton-Greene. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Wright finished 11th in the coxed four. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, he came 13th in the coxless four.

Coaching career A teacher, Wright was involved in rowing coaching school and age-group at national level. He coached several Maadi Cup winning squads at both St Paul's Collegiate School and Hamilton Boys' High School. He is described as \\"intense\\" and speaks his mind, which does not sit well with some people. He is held in high regard by those who have been coached by him. From 2005 to 2009, Wright was head coach at the Melbourne University Boat Club. Wright worked for Rowing New Zealand as coach for the men's eight, and was head coach at the Waikato Regional Performance Centre with training at Lake Karapiro. In late 2014, Wright was appointed head national coach of Switzerland. He led the lightweight men's four to become the 2015 world champions. A year later, the same boat won Olympic gold at the Rio Olympics. In September 2016, he was appointed head rowing coach for Australia's men.

It consists of a sterile aqueous suspension of Technetium-99m (99mTc) labeled to human albumin aggregate particles. It is commonly used for lung perfusion scanning. It is also less commonly used to visualise a peritoneovenous shunt and for isotope venography.  Preparation  DraxImage MAA kits for preparing 99mTc-MAA are available in the United States from only a single manufacturer; Jubilant DraxImage Inc. The kits are delivered to nuclear pharmacies as lyophilized powders of non- radioactive ingredients sealed under nitrogen. A nuclear pharmacist adds anywhere from 50 - 100 mCi of Na[99mTcO4] to the reaction vial to make the final product, in the pH range of 3.8 to 8.0. After being allowed to react at room temperature for 15 minutes to ensure maximum labeling of the human albumin with 99mTc, the kit can then be diluted with sterile normal saline as needed. Once prepared the product will have a turbid white appearance. =Quality control= No less than 90% of MAA particles can be between 10 - 90 micrometres in size and no particles may exceed 150 micrometres due to the risk of pulmonary artery blockade. No less than 90% of the radioactivity present in the product must be tagged to albumin particles. Thus, no more than 10% soluble impurities may be present. Dosage and imaging  The typical adult dose for a lung imaging study is 40-150 Megabecquerels (1-4 mCi) (containing between 100,000 - 200,000 albumin particles). The particle burden should be lowered for most pediatric patients and lowered to 50,000 for infants. The use of more than 250,000 particles in a dose is controversial as little extra data is acquired from such scans while there is an increased risk of toxicity. Patients with pulmonary hypertension should be administered a minimum number of particles to achieve a lung scan (i.e. 60,000). In any patient by administering a greater quantity of particles than necessary for the diagnostic procedure increases the risks of toxicity. Because of gravity effects, people administered 99mTc MAA should be in the supine position to ensure as even a distribution of particles throughout the lungs as possible. The total percentage of particles trapped in the lungs can be determined through a whole body scan after the administration of 99mTc MAA through the equation: :% text{Right-to-left shunt} = left(frac{(text{Total body counts}) - (text{Total lung counts})}{(text{Total body counts})}right)times 100%.

Biography  Born Thomas Alexander Robertson at Westerwick at the southern tip of the parish of Sandsting, his mother's home. He was the second son of Andrina Johnston and Thomas Robertson of Skeld, a merchant seaman. His father drowned before his first birthday, and his mother moved with her two sons to Stove in Waas. He grew up in hardship though his love for the land and the people overcame that. It was to be the old Norse name for the area that he adopted as his nom-de-plume. A shy boy who adjusted with difficulty to the rough and tumble of school, he was nonetheless able both at physical and intellectual pursuits, and in time he excelled. He took his MA at the University of Edinburgh and was offered the possibility of postgraduate work at Oxford, which he turned down for financial reasons, instead becoming a teacher at the Lerwick Central School and carer to his ailing mother. In 1953, he married Martha (‚ÄòPat‚Äô), daughter of the Reverend Robert Andrew, Church of Scotland minister in Walls for over 40 years, a girl he had known in childhood. She became a colleague and collaborator on many fronts, and together they edited Da Sangs at A‚Äôll sing ta Dee (The Songs that I'll sing to you), a collection of dialect songs and music (1973). One of his own lyric poems, Da Sang o da Papa Men, written from the perspective of the Papa Stour fishermen 'rowin Foula doon', has become a favourite Shetland song, to music composed by T. M. Y. Manson. In 1945, Vagaland was instrumental in the founding of the Shetland Folk Society and he was an office-bearer from its inception until his death after a long illness, in Lerwick on 30 December 1973. He was one of the writers who helped to establish The New Shetlander in 1947, and he was a key supporter of the journal for 27 years till his death. Each issue included at least one poem by Vagaland. With John J. Graham, he co- wrote 'Grammar and Usage of the Shetland Dialect' (1952); co-edited the influential anthology of Shetland verse and prose, 'Nordern Lights' (1964), both crucially important publications, and a number of volumes of The Shetland Folk Book. :\\" ‚Ä¶ His constant passion for maintaining the continuity of local tradition ‚Ä¶ was no mere antiquarian indulgence. It was fired by a real conviction, founded on personal experience, that the past revealed true insights into the art of living; that out of the lives of ordinary folk, engaged in their daily tasks and sustained by the warmth of close communities, there emerged basic truths about the human situation. And his poems were evocations of that life and affirmations of those truths ‚Ä¶ \\" John J.

Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Lavan attended both Hope College and the University of Michigan from 1908 to 1911 before playing in the major leagues. Lavan played in 1,163 major league games, of which 1,126 were at the shortstop position. In 11 seasons, Lavan had a lifetime batting average of .245 with 954 hits, 377 RBIs, 338 runs scored, and 186 extra base hits. He had his best season as a batter in 1920 when he hit .289 with 32 extra base hits and 63 RBIs. Lavan also had good range as a shortstop.

Folklore often displays features seen similarly in Scandinavia and some Celtic traditions. Norse literature The earlier Norse language faded slowly, taking at least three hundred years to die out in certain isolated parts of Shetland such as Foula and Unst, as first Lowland Scots and then English became the language of power. The Norn language influences the variety of Lowland Scots spoken in Shetland today, in lexicon and grammar.

Little remains of the old Norse tongue, Norn, in script form, and what is extant (such as the ballad \\"Hildina\\", The \\"Unst Boat song\\" and various Norn fragments collected by Jakob Jakobsen) is often corrupted. These works have been studied in depth, and scholars have notionally fixed the old Shetland Norn as kin to Faroese and Vestnorsk. The oral tradition for which Shetland was famed in the Norse era (when it was known as a land of bards) died with the language, though it may well be that some of the old folktales and ballads were translated into the oral tradition now known in Shetland dialect, and that the continuing proliferation of writers in Shetland could be considered an ongoing form of that tradition of 'bards', even across the difficult cultural shift from Scandinavia to Britain. Shetland is mentioned, however, in sources from the surrounding countries. For example, the Orkneyinga saga, mainly about Orkney talks about the archipelago on a number of occasions. British Period In the British era, which properly began for Shetland with the Napoleonic Wars, Shetlanders developed a literature in variant written forms of the spoken Shetland dialect, as well as in English. The first widely published writers were two daughters of the Lerwick gentry, Dorothea Primrose Campbell and Margaret Chalmers, who wrote for the most part in a rather formal English. Subsequent Shetland dialect writers such as Haldane Burgess, James Stout Angus, George Stewart and Basil R Anderson helped forge the written form of the native tongue. There are now a number of titles that might be termed Shetland dialect classics, in the sense that they found a ready market among Shetlanders when first published and became definitive of some part of the islands' culture. These works are not always the works of natives ‚Äì incomers and visitors to Shetland have made considerable contributions to literature about Shetland, as in the cases of Jakob Jakobsen and Hugh MacDiarmid for instance. Much of this literature is currently out of print and has been, in some instances, for a very long time. As a result, subsequent generations of Shetlanders have grown up unaware of this tradition ‚Äì and specialist readers, the scholars beyond the islands who might be interested, remain oblivious to the work.

Haldane Burgess (28 May 1862 - 16 January 1927) was a Shetland historian, poet, novelist, violinist, linguist and socialist, a noted figure in Shetland's cultural history. His published works include Rasmie's B√ºddie, Some Shetland Folk, Tang, The Treasure of Don Andreas, Rasmie's Kit, Rasmie's Smaa Murr, and The Viking Path, the latter being translated into German. He was one of the Shetlanders who gave assistance to Jakob Jakobsen, in his researches into the Norn language in Shetland. Early life Burgess was born on 28 May 1862. He was a son of Lerwick, whose grandfather had left Dunrossness as a soldier during the Napoleonic period and lived in Edinburgh for a time before settling in 'da toon' as a shopkeeper. Haldane Burgess won first place in the Glasgow Bursary Competition. He spent four years as a teacher in Bressay in order to pay for his university education. He studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh, but found himself in disagreement with certain doctrines. He lost his sight in his last year of study, took his final exams orally and returned to Lerwick. Later his promotion of socialist ideas made him a popular and radical figure. He was a major supporter of the development of the Shetland Festival Up Helly Aa. Writings He was a linguist and a champion of Esperanto. He developed a lifelong interest in Norse culture and taught himself Norwegian, later contributing articles to journals in Norway. In his lifetime he was best known for a novel entitled The Viking Path ‚Äì A Tale of The White Christ (1894), set in Shetland and Norway at the coming of Christianity. The best-known of his work now is probably his verse in dialect, as published in Rasmie's B√ºddie: poems in the Shetlandic (1891), which was republished in 1913, and later in 1979 with illustrations by Frank Walterson. The poem 'Scranna' is one of the acknowledged classics of Shetland literature. Laurence I. Graham, in his essay \\"Shetland Literature and the idea of community\\" in Shetland‚Äôs Northern Links: Language and History (1996), writes that his novel Tang \\"... was written in the closing years of the last century. It tells the story of a young girl, Inga, and her divided love for two men: one, her devoted admirer, a steady, hard working fisherman, and the other, a newly arrived minister, young, idealistic, unsure of himself and very susceptible to feminine charm and persuasion. It also presents a picture of a small community of crofter-fishermen, their women-folk, the merchant, the teacher, the minister and the laird. Burgess brings out the darker side of this community, the hypocrisy and occasional dishonesty, the servility of some crofters towards the gentry, the malicious gossip, the petty jealousies and spitefulness within the congregation and the damage done by itinerant hot-gospellers and their infernal, illegitimate-producing revival meetings' as Hakki, the agnostic schoolmaster, calls them. The novel certainly gives an unflattering picture of what passed for religious life at this period ... The arguments between Hakki, the outspoken agnostic, and the minister and laird are among the highlights of the book and it is obvious where the author's sympathies lie. It is certainly an unusual novel for its time when the Scottish Kailyard school of writing was still at its height ...\\" Personal A street in Lerwick, Haldane Burgess Crescent, is named after him.

He also was a member of the Fort Worth Cavalry in the Arena Football League. He played college football at the University of Houston. Early years Dixon attended Vernon High School, where he played as a running back. He was named the MVP of the Oil Bowl, which matches high school senior All-stars from the states of Texas and Oklahoma. After high school he joined Cisco Junior College, where he played as a running back. In 1987, he transferred to the University of Houston to play under new head coach Jack Pardee, who converted him into a wide receiver. As a junior, he posted 59 receptions (third in the conference) for 659 yards (tied for third in the conference) and 3 receiving touchdowns (tied for fifth in the conference). He set a Southwest Conference record with 908 kickoff return yards and led the conference in kickoff return average (27.5). In 1988, the football team was employing the run and shoot offense with Andre Ware at quarterback and Jason Phillips as the main wide receiver. Dixon and Phillips became the first teammates in school history to register 1,000-receiving yards seasons in the same year. They are also the only wide receiver unit in NCAA history to each record over 100 receptions and rank 1-2 in the nation in receiving in the same season. In the season, he posted 102 receptions (second in the nation) for 1,103 yards (eighth in the nation) and 11 receiving touchdowns (tied for fourth in the nation), while earning second- team All-American honors. He had 15 receptions against Rice University. He finished his college career second in Southwest Conference history in kickoff return yards (1,468) and third in kickoff return average (25.3). Professional career =Detroit Lions= Dixon was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Detroit Lions after the 1989 NFL Draft, who were using the run and shoot offense. He was waived on August 29. =Dallas Cowboys= On August 30, 1989, he was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys. As a rookie, he started 7 games after Michael Irvin and Kelvin Martin suffered knee injuries. He registered 24 receptions for 477 yards, a 19.9-yard average (led the team), 1,688 all-purpose yards (ranked 10th in the NFL) and 2 touchdowns. In the 10th game against the Phoenix Cardinals, he set a franchise rookie record with 203 receiving yards (the fifth highest in club history), including a 75-yard touchdown reception, in the same contest that Troy Aikman set a then-NFL rookie record with 379 passing yards. His 477 yards were the fourth- most receiving yards by a rookie receiver in team history. The 1,181 kickoff return yards broke Mel Renfro's franchise record of 1,017 set in 1964. His 47 kickoff returns broke Ron Fellows' franchise record of 43 set in 1983. He ranked fifth in the NFL and second in the NFC in kickoff returns with a 25.1-yard average, the highest a Cowboys player has finished since 1971. Against the Kansas City Chiefs, he returned a kickoff for a 97-yard touchdown, becoming the first Cowboy player to return a kickoff for a touchdown since 1975. He added a 90-yard kickoff return against the Green Bay Packers, making him the first player in franchise history with 2 kickoff returns of 90 yards or more in his career.

She authored a novel, Harley Radington: A Tale (1821), and had poems and short fiction printed in London periodicals. Campbell continued to share her talent with the world in the face of family trauma, poverty, and ethnic and gender discrimination. Her melodic and whimsical poems and works of fiction are seen as revealing works of English literature, covering themes reminiscent of historical and societal barriers Campbell faced due to her own circumstances. Life =Early life and family difficulties= Dorothea Primrose Campbell was born in Lerwick, Shetland, Scotland on the fourth of May in 1793. On the eleventh of May in 1793, Dorothea Primrose Campbell was baptised at her birthplace, Lerwick. Her father, Duncan Campbell, was a surgeon who had married one of the Scotts of Scottshall in Scalloway, Elizabeth (Eliza), the eldest of a large family. Dorothea was the eldest sibling of her family as well. It is recorded that she had a younger sister and two brothers. Dorothea's life was full of many difficulties. Besides her family's perpetual struggle with hereditary debts from her grandfather, her mother struggled with opium addiction, and her father died when she was just sixteen. =Teaching= Dorothea Primrose Campbell was well educated. It appears that she began writing poetry at a very young age, and used her writing abilities to support her family. By 1812 Campbell became a teacher.\\"Archives of the Royal Literary Fund, 1790-1918.\\" Location: London, World Microfilms. N.d. In 1813, Campbell opened her own school at Lerwick. Through her Scott family connection she met Sir Walter Scott, a distant relative, during his tour of the north of Scotland aboard the Lighthouse Commission's yacht. Scott was encouraging, and even shipped her a piano for the little school to teach the children of the gentry she had established in Lerwick. Sadly, the school closed due to Campbell's poor health and her mother's opium addiction. After the closure of the school, Campbell worked as a schoolteacher to support her family with her own earnings. Between 1817 and 1821, Campbell corresponded with Walter Scott and he offered both moral and financial support to her. Despite this financial support, her debt is apparent in court records revealing that she owed small sums to creditors in 1822, 1823, and 1835. In 1841, Campbell was invited to move from Shetland to England to work as a governess to Dr Clarke's family, which consisted of his daughter, Eliza Frances Hook, and Eliza's husband, James Hook. Unfortunately, after Campbell arrived in England, the Clarke family went bankrupt and Campbell was left unemployed in England.

As a woman over forty and a Shetlander, the prejudices against her race, age, and sex made it nearly impossible for her to find work. Eventually, Campbell applied to the Royal Literary Fund in 1844 after having been unemployed for some time. The Royal Literary Fund paid her ¬£30 which helped her to get by. She was also able to find a job teaching at Sevenoaks.

Writings =Poems, Inverness (1811)= Campbell had a talent for writing poetry and short fiction. Aspiring to relieve her family's grim financial status, Campbell corresponded with the publisher J. Young, whose support and sympathy meant that Campbell's Poems were published in duodecimo at Inverness in 1811. According to records, Dorothea Primrose Campbell was only 10 years old when she wrote Address to the Evening Star. Despite the work being published in 1811 (when Campbell was 18), Campbell mentioned its earlier date of composition in 1816. However, one critique notes that Campbell's poems published at Inverness \\"do not read like juvenilia. They are flowing, expressive, verbally and musically skilled, whether in conventional poetic diction or more colloquial mode.\\" =Poems, London (1816)= In November 1816 Campbell issued a second, London edition of Poems. The subscribers were mostly from Lerwick and London. It included some poems from her first volume. \\"Campbell often expresses sorrow and nostalgia in exile and a longing for wider prospects.\\" Campbell's straits appear as her \\"tone becomes progressively darker, dwelling on death and the slights meted out to poverty.\\" Sadly the poems did not bring prosperity. The publisher may have gone bankrupt ‚Äì only half the stock of 500 copies had sold by April 1818, ‚Äì though Sarah Josepha Hale noted in Woman's Record (1853), \\"The character of her poetry, chiefly suggested by the wild, rough scenery with which she lives surrounded, is healthy in its tone and breathes of home and heaven.\\" =Harley Radington: A Tale (1821)= In October 1821, A. K. Newman of Minerva Press published Harley Radington: A Tale, Campbell's one known novel. The tale itself (a tribute to her birthplace, the Shetland Islands) impressed and interested a handful of readers. In 1823, William Scott Burn exalted Campbell's writing capabilities in a letter to his friend: \\"I read your Miss Campbell's Harley Radington when I was ill ‚Äì that woman has very considerable talent, and should be encouraged to employ it oftener.\\"W. Scott Burn, Letter to Arthur Nicolson, 25 December 1823. MS D.24/51/46/2. Shetland Archive. Campbell seems to have been trying to fit her novel into a national-tale category, like previous works set in Ireland and Scotland Highlands. In a letter to Walter Scott from September of 1821, she writes, \\"I have published an attempt at a 'Zetland Tale'\\".Campbell, D. P. Letter to Walter Scott. 21 Sept 1821. MS 32278, ff.102-4. National Library of Scotland. Presumably, Campbell decided to subtitle the book \\"A Tale\\" over \\"A Zetland Tale\\" due to her uncertainty that the Shetland Islands would be accepted by the public as a novel \\"set in the regions of Great Britain,\\" as Shetland was revered by many in Britain as a \\"little-known country\\" at the time. According to Penny Fielding, researcher and Professor of English at the University of Edinburgh, \\"The novel focuses on the journey of the metropolitan hero to a distant part of the nation where he has family associations, and touches on questions of gender, superstition, ethnography, land improvement, and travel.\\" =Campbell as Ora, the Lady's Monthly Museum (c. 1813‚Äì1853)= Recently found evidence has revealed that Campbell was a member of the Lady's Monthly Museum for a number of years. During this time, she adopted a pseudonym, \\"Ora from Thule,\\" under which she published 53 poems and tales. One of them, \\"The Apollonian Wreath,\\" begins, O hail! thou solitary star! To me how dear thy dewy ray, Which kindly streaming from afar, Illumes a pensive wand'rer's way.

The term alias expansion is sometimes used to indicate a specific mode of email forwarding, thereby implying a more generic meaning of the term email alias as an address that is forwarded in a simplistic fashion.RFC 5321 defines alias expansion as opposed to the list expansion of mailing lists, noting that the replacement of the address to whom bounce messages are returned makes a key difference. An email alias is different from a contact group, or distribution list. According to Microsoft, a contact group is \\"a grouping of e-mail addresses collected under one name. A message sent to a contact group goes to all recipients listed in the group.\\" Usage Email aliases can be created on a mail server. The mail server simply forwards email messages addressed to an email alias on to another, the specified email address. An email alias may be used to create a simple replacement for a long or difficult-to-remember email address. It can also be used to create a generic email address such as webmaster@example.com and info@example.com. On UNIX-like systems, email aliases may be placed into the file /etc/aliases and have the form: :\`local-alias-name: adifferentlocaluser, anotherlocaluser, an@external.user.example.com\` Control issue Messages forwarded through an email alias retain the original SMTP envelope sender and recipient. If the message is a blind carbon copy, the recipient can only tell whether the message was forwarded through the alias by examining the message headers. However, the standard does not mandate mentioning the envelope recipient in the headers. Therefore, recipients of a message may not be able to recover what email address has been used by the sender to eventually deliver the message to their mailbox. Recipients who cannot trace what address the sender used are unable to ask the sender to stop sending, because the sender most likely will not be able to associate their current email address with the one used for sending. Even if users are able to learn the exact address used for sending, their mail client may not provide a convenient way to submit a reply using the latter as the sender address of the response. In other words, aliasing is not reversible. This is particularly relevant in opt-out situations where the sender does not provide a reliable mechanism in the body of the message. Typically, newsletters sent to undisclosed recipients can be sent submitting the body once along with a list of recipients, which is much less resource intensive than submitting a different body for each recipient. However, if VERP or BATV are being used (e.g. to prevent email backscatter), the electronic mailing list software will send individual messages to each recipient with a different SMTP FROM address.  Abuse issue  The recipient's SMTP server sees only the forwarding system's IP address. In general it has no reason to trust the Received: headerfield generated by the forwarding system and does not know the originating system's IP address. Therefore, recipients cannot reliably distinguish spam to the alias address from spam generated on the forwarding system. When a recipient reports a message to his ISP as spam, the ISP credits that spam to the forwarding system. ISPs with low abuse thresholds may begin blocking email from the forwarding system.

Early life Margaret Chalmers was baptised on 12 December 1758 in Lerwick. Her father, William, is said to have been the son of a Lord Provost of Aberdeen, factor to Earl of Morton and tacksman of various local estates. Her mother Catherine (Kitty) Irvine was born in Trondra in 1734. Chalmers had four sisters and a brother, William, who joined the navy and was killed, aged 35, in the battle of Trafalgar. The death of her father is not recorded, but by time of Trafalgar, her mother and one of the sisters were bedridden and the family was living in penury. Petitions were raised in the hope of securing a government pension, but these failed. Career Like her younger fellow Lerwegian poet, Dorothea Primrose Campbell, whose life was similarly marred by poverty, Chalmers arranged to publish her poetry by subscription and her solitary book was published in Newcastle in 1813, after long delays during which many subscribers lost interest. She had sent copies of her poems to Sir Walter Scott during his visit to Shetland in 1814. However, there is nothing suggesting she ever received a reply; it is worth mentioning that she spoke to him as an equal in the letters held at the National Library of Scotland. After the publishing of her lone work, it did not garner the profit she had hoped for. However, copies were sold in areas from Shetland all the way to North Carolina. In 1816, she applied instead to the Royal Literary Fund, which awarded her the sum of ten pounds. Dear and legacy She died in Lerwick on 12 March 1827. \\"Miss Chalmers Stairs\\" in Lerwick, named in her honor, no longer exist. Style and themes In her lone work, her poems play with the ideas of imagery in regard to reflections. She also speaks on the life of a women living in Shetland during the late 1700s to early 1800s. Her own perspectives on the socio-economic status of Shetland is reflected in many of her pieces. Selected works * Poems, Newcastle: S.

Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was a reserve division of the VII Reserve Corps and was recruited primarily in the Province of Westphalia and the Rhine Province. The division included an active infantry brigade from the 14th Division. Combat chronicle The 14th Reserve Division fought on the Western Front, participating in the opening German offensive, which led to the Allied Great Retreat, including the capture of Namur and Maubeuge. Thereafter, the division remained in the line in the Aisne region until October 1915, and then went into Army reserve for two months. It fought in the Battle of Verdun from February to September 1916, and remained in the line at Verdun thereafter. It went to the Somme region at the end of 1916 and to the Champagne region in late January 1917, fighting in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne, from April to May. After a few months near Reims, the division went to the region along the Ailette River. In 1918, it participated in the German Spring Offensive. It was then primarily on the defensive, resisting various Allied offensives including those of the Hundred Days Offensive.

Optional wire mesh grill. With canopy up. The TD2000 is a retro- classic roadster styled after the MG TD. It is produced by TD Cars (Malaysia) Pte. Ltd., a private limited company incorporated in 1998. The company acquired the rights, intellectual properties and trademarks associated with the production of the TD2000 Roadster. The car is assembled in Malaysia today and exported overseas. It is available in Japan, Australia, Brunei, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Scotland, Ireland, England and the Middle East.  History  The idea of creating a retro- classic to pay homage to the 1950s British entry-level sports car MG TD based on a modern Japanese drivetrain. The roadster originated in 1986 using Nissan components and original MG TD jigs, dies and moulds. Australian Classic Cars (ACC), under Westmex, created the chassis, improved on other technical aspects and creature comfort. Gason of Ararat, under contract with ACC, successfully produced and launched about 100 vehicles in Australia. However, sales were unprofitable so the car arm of the company changed ownership several times until TD Cars acquired it and moved the production to Malaysia. Under the new management, TD2000s expanded beyond its border.  Design  Today, the TD2000 roadster consists of 2 models, a Silverstone comes with a 5-speed manual shift and Gatsby with a 4-speed automatic gear. It sits on a steel chassis and is equipped with an independent double wishbone front suspension, a leaf-spring back axle and all-round disc brakes, delivering better handling and smoother ride than the original. Many local OEM engineers were contracted to study and build a complete suspension system with softer absorbers and 3-leaf springs, colder air-conditioning unit, and integrate a double-core radiator into the cooling system. Its fiber glass bodywork incorporates side intrusion bars, is protected by stainless steel bumpers. With a 2-liter Toyota 3S-FE engine developing 130bhp, the rear-wheel drive roadster delivers better performance than its predecessor. Power-to-weight ratio is superb as the roadster weighs less than 1 ton. Standard features come with spoked wheels, walnut-burr dashboard, mohair soft-top and integrated roll-over bar. Options include leather trims, air-conditioning, wooden Motolita steering wheel, stainless steel luggage rack and roll bar. The National Automobile Museum at Sepang International Circuit houses a pearl-blue Silverstone for public viewing.

Biography Tibors is one of eight trobairitz with vidas, short Occitan biographies, often more hypothetical than factual. Research into Tibors' the poet's identification with an independently recorded individual is hampered by the popularity of her name in Occitania during the period of her life. Tibors was the daughter of Guilhem d'Omelas and Tibors d'Aurenga, who brought her husband the castle of Sarenom, probably S√©rignan-du-Comtat in Provence or perhaps S√©rignan in the Roussillon. Sadly for historians and Occitanists, Tibors and Guilhem had two daughters, both named Tibors, after their mother. It is possible but unlikely that Tibors d'Aurenga was herself the trobairitz. Since she was married in 1129 or 1130 and her daughters were married by 1150, it is unlikely they were born long after. Raimbaut d'Orange, the famous troubadour, was a younger of son of Guilhem and Tibors and thus a younger brother of the two Tibors sisters. In 1150 the elder Tibors died and by her will left Raimbaut, then a minor, under the guardianship of her elder daughter and her son-in-law, the trobairitz' second husband, Bertran dels Baus. The younger sister, Tiburgette, was the recipient of a wedding gift from their father in that year (1150). In the will of her father, Guilhem, Tibors is referred to as autre Tiburge (the other Tibors), while her younger sister is given pre- eminence. By 1150 (or 1155 if the dating of Tibors d'Aurenga's will is incorrect), Goufroy de Mornas,Also Gaufroy or Gaufred. Tibors' first husband, had already died. She had no recorded children by him, but with Bertrand she had three sons: Uc, father of Barral of Marseille; Bertran, father of Raimon; and Guilhem, also a troubadour. Tibors is said to have died soon after her husband (1180) in 1181 or 1182, but a document of her son Uc dated 13 August 1198 refers to \\"the advice of his mother Tibors\\". Poetry Of Tibors' work only a single stanza of a canso with its attached vida and razo has survived.The vida ends with the razo \\"E fetz aquestas coblas e mandet las al seu amador' (Schutz, XCV, 324). Nonetheless she is mentioned in an anonymous ballad dated to between 1220 and 1245, where she acts as the judge of a game of poetry. Her only work goes like this: { :Bels dous amics, ben vos posc en ver dir :que anc non fo qu'ieu estes ses desir :pos vos conven que.us tene per fin aman; :ni anc no fo qu'ieu non agues talan, :bels dous amics, qu'ieu soven no.us vezes; :ni anc no fo sazons que m'en pentis, :ni anc no fo, se vos n'anes iratz, :qu'ieu agues joi tro que fosetz tornatz; :ni [anc]. . .  :Sweet handsome friend, I can tell you truly :that I've never been without desire :since it pleased you that I have you as my courtly lover; :nor did a time ever arrive, sweet handsome friend, :when I didn't want to see you often; :nor did I ever feel regret, :nor did it ever come to pass, if you went off angry, :that I felt joy until you had come back; :nor [ever]. . .Bogin, 80-1. } Sources *Bogin, Meg (1976).

Smith, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in which Smith stated the church was no longer sanctioning marriages that violated the laws of the land and set down the principle that those entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages would be excommunicated from the church.\\"Statement by President Joseph F. Smith\\", Improvement Era 7/7:545‚Äì546 (May 1904). Background In 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff had issued the initial Manifesto, in which he suspended the LDS Church's long-standing practice of plural marriage. However, after the Manifesto, it became clear that a number of church members, including members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, were continuing to enter into or solemnize polygamous marriages.Kenneth Cannon II, \\"After the Manifesto: Mormon Polygamy, 1890‚Äì1906\\", Sunstone, Jan.‚ÄìApr. 1983, p. 27.D. Michael Quinn, \\"LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890‚Äì1904\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Spring 1985, 9‚Äì105.B. Carmon Hardy (1992). Solemn Covenant: The Mormon Polygamous Passage (Urbana: University of Illinois Press). Smith issued the Second Manifesto near the beginning of the Reed Smoot hearings, United States Congressional hearings into whether LDS Church apostle Reed Smoot should be permitted to sit as a United States Senator from Utah; Smoot's opponents alleged that the LDS Church hierarchy's continued tolerance or encouragement of plural marriage should exclude Smoot from sitting in the Senate. Announcement The \\"Second Manifesto\\" was announced at the general conference of the church held on April 6, 1904. At a public meeting, Smith announced that he would like to read an \\"official statement\\" that he had prepared so that his words \\"may not be misunderstood or misquoted\\". Smith read: > Inasmuch as there are numerous reports in circulation that plural marriages > have been entered into, contrary to the official declaration of President > Woodruff of September 24, 1890, commonly called the manifesto, which was > issued by President Woodruff, and adopted by the Church at its general > conference, October 6, 1890, which forbade any marriages violative of the > law of the land, I, Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ > of Latter-day Saints, hereby affirm and declare that no such marriages have > been solemnized with the sanction, consent, or knowledge of the Church of > Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And I hereby announce that all such > marriages are prohibited, and if any officer or member of the Church shall > assume to solemnize or enter into any such marriage, he will be deemed in > transgression against the Church, and will be liable to be dealt with > according to the rules and regulations thereof and excommunicated therefrom. > > Joseph F. Smith, > President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Conference > Report, April 1904, p. 75. Francis M. Lyman, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, then presented the following resolution of endorsement, which was seconded by B. H. Roberts and accepted unanimously by those in attendance at the conference: > Resolved that we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day > Saints, in General Conference assembled, hereby approve and endorse the > statement and declaration of President Joseph F. Smith just made to this > Conference concerning plural marriages, and will support the courts of the > Church in the enforcement thereof.Conference Report, April 1904, p. 76. Smith's official statement was later published in the Improvement Era, an official magazine of the church. Aftermath A number of church leaders were opposed to the enforcement of the \\"Second Manifesto\\", including apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley. As a result of their opposition, both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1906, and in 1911 Taylor was excommunicated for continued opposition.Victor W. Jorgensen & B. Carmon Hardy, \\"The Taylor‚ÄìCowley Affair and the Watershed of Mormon History\\", Utah Historical Quarterly 48:4 (1980). In 1909, Francis M. Lyman chaired a church committee to investigate plural marriages since the Second Manifesto that excommunicated people who had been involved in such practices.Thomas G. Alexander, \\"Second Manifesto\\", Arnold K. Garr, et. al, ed., The Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2000) p. 702 Although the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s. As the church began to excommunicate those who continued to enter into plural marriages, some of those individuals began the Mormon fundamentalist movement. Many such dissidents were motivated by the belief that it was improper for the church to ban plural marriage, which they saw as an \\"eternal commandment\\", while others pointed out that neither the original nor the Second Manifestos were presented as revelations from God, as previous statements of important church doctrine had been.Kraut, Ogden. The Holy Priesthood. Genola, Utah: Pioneer Press, 2005. Unlike the 1890 Manifesto,.David E. Campbell, John C. Green, and J. Quin Monson (2014), Seeking the Promised Land: Mormons and American Politics, New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 58‚Äì59, .. the LDS Church has not canonized the \\"Second Manifesto\\", but it nevertheless remains an accurate description of the church's attitude towards its members who enter into or solemnize polygamous marriages.

By a 2018 count, Attleboro had 1,547 daily riders, making it the fourth busiest station on the system outside Boston. Attleboro has had railroad service to its downtown area continuously since 1835. The two-story northbound and southbound station buildings, now private businesses, were built during a grade crossing elimination project in 1906-1908 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. MBTA trains stop at platforms located slightly south of the historic buildings. Attleboro is an important transfer station for the Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority, with seven routes converging at the adjacent Attleboro Intermodal Transportation Center. History Original station in 1906, just months before it was replaced with the modern station buildings Early postcard of the northbound building A Conrail freight passes the then- closed station buildings in 1983 The original Boston and Providence Railroad station, a complex Victorian Gothic building, was located north of Mill Street at a grade crossing. Service began in June 1835 from Boston to Providence. Two branches opened from Attleboro: The Attleboro Branch Railroad (run by the B&P;) opened in January 1870, followed by the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad's Attleboro Branch (to Taunton) in August 1871. The Boston & Providence was taken over by the Old Colony Railroad in 1888, which itself was absorbed by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893. The lease of the Attleboro Branch Railroad expired in 1901; the New Haven built a different connector to the Walpole and Wrentham Railroad and the branch was returned to its owners. It was converted to an interurban trolley line locally known as the \\"Gee Whiz Line\\" in June 1903. Taken over by the Rhode Island Company in 1907, service lasted as long as 1932. The town plans to convert part of the right of way into a recreational trail. In 1891, the town petitioned the New Haven Railroad to eliminate dangerous grade crossings in the town. In 1905, the railroad set out to construct a lengthy viaduct for the mainline and the branch to Taunton. The project removed 13 grade crossings and made the line four tracks through Attleboro - one of the few locations east of New Haven where the railroad completed quadruple-tracking plans. Two-story Romanesque station buildings were built on both sides; the northbound building opened in 1906 and the larger southbound building two years later. Service on the branch to Taunton lasted until 1958, with summer-only long-distance service to Cape Cod lasting until 1964. In April 1979, off-peak MBTA service to Providence was cut back to Attleboro due to a reduction in subsidy from the state of Rhode Island. All service was cut to Attleboro on February 20, 1981. The station served Amtrak's Cape Codder during the summers of 1986 to 1988, with the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad operating additional state-funded service from Attleboro to Hyannis in 1988. The CC&HR; stopped operation after the 1988 season due to elimination of state subsidies. The Cape Codder discontinued its Attleboro stop in 1989 as it served just 3 riders per train, though the service ran until 1996. Rush hour MBTA service was restored to Providence on February 1, 1988. Off-peak and weekend service was extended to upon its opening on June 20, 1990; those trains were later extended to Providence under expanded funding agreements. On January 5, 1989, the station buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Both buildings are owned by private businesses. On January 16, 1989, the MBTA began a $990k renovation project, which included the installation of mini-high platforms to make the station accessible. The station was accessible by late 1990. In August 1971, the MBTA began operating Boston‚Äì and Providence‚ÄìFoxboro service for events at the new Foxboro Stadium. Providence service was soon discontinued, but began again in 1994, with Attleboro as one of the intermediate stops. The Attleboro Intermodal Transportation Center was opened on November 7, 2013 to provide better connections between local bus and commuter rail services. The facility includes dedicated busways and a waiting room located on the west side of the railroad viaduct. Bus connections Attleboro Intermodal Transportation Center viewed from the southbound MBTA platforms GATRA operates seven local bus routes connecting to the station: *Route 10 - Attleboro to North Attleboro *Route 12 - South Attleboro to Attleboro *Route 14 - Attleboro to Plainville *Route 15 - Oak Hill *Route 16 - Seekonk to Attleboro *Route 18 - Attleboro, Norton, and Taunton *Route 24 - Attleboro to Pawtucket See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Massachusetts References External links *MBTA - Attleboro * Mill Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Main Street entrance from Google Maps Street View Stations on the Northeast Corridor MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Bristol County, Massachusetts Attleboro, Massachusetts Former Amtrak stations in Massachusetts Romanesque Revival architecture in Massachusetts Railway stations in the United States opened in 1908 Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts National Register of Historic Places in Bristol County, Massachusetts Former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad stations 1908 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Attleboro station (Massachusetts)"},{"id":"12885040","text":"The E-learning maturity model (eMM) in software engineering is a model to assess the capability of electronic educational technology (e-learning) processes.  Overview  eMM is a quality improvement framework based on the ideas of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination (SPICE) methodologies. The underlying idea that guides the development of the eMM is that the ability of an institution to be effective in any particular area of work is dependent on their capability to engage in high quality processes that are reproducible and able to be extended and sustained as demand grows. The eMM provides a set of thirty-five processes, divided into five process areas, that define a key aspect of the overall ability of institutions to perform well in the delivery of e-learning. Each process is selected on the basis of its necessity in the development and maintenance of capability in e-learning. All of the processes have been created after a programme of research and testing, conducted internationally.  History  The eMM is being trialled in the Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot, by the University of Manchester. Additional projects applying the eMM are underway supported by the Scottish Funding Council in Scotland and ACODE in Australia. Development and application of the eMM in New Zealand was supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Education Tertiary E-Learning Research Fund. Version 2 of eMM has changed considerably from the Version 1 of 2003. The eMM and associated documentation is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 License.  Topics  = Key idea = The key idea underlying the dimension concept is holistic capability. Rather than the eMM measuring progressive levels, it describes the capability of a process from these five synergistic perspectives. An organization that has developed capability on all dimensions for all processes will be more capable than one that has not. Capability at the higher dimensions that is not supported by capability at the lower dimensions will not deliver the desired outcomes; capability at the lower dimensions that is not supported by capability in the higher dimensions will be ad hoc, unsustainable and unresponsive to changing organizational and learner needs. = Five dimensions = Capability in each process is described by a set of practices organised by dimension.

The lyrics were written by Dorothy Fields and the music was by Jerome Kern. This dramatic dance was performed at the end of the movie after John 'Lucky' Garnett (Astaire) finds out Penelope 'Penny' Carroll (Rogers) is engaged to Ricardo 'Ricky' Romero (played by Georges Metaxa). This is a dance of desperation, despair and love. It starts slowly, Lucky not wanting Penny to leave. As she is walking up the stairs, he begins his serenade to her in hopes that she will understand how heartbroken he is over losing her. After he is done singing, he tries to win her back one more time dancing. So, elegantly and desperately, he pulls out all the stops, hoping to change her mind. At first, the dance is slow and somber, but eventually the pace and tempo pick up, and Lucky and Penny seem to be together again. However, in the final movement, Penny twirls out of the room and doesn't come back, leaving Lucky standing there forlorn. Fred Astaire recorded the song commercially (Brunswick 7718) and it proved popular.

Located in downtown Mansfield, it serves the Providence/Stoughton Line. With 1,966 weekday boardings in a 2018 count, Mansfield is the third-busiest station on the system outside Boston. With mini-high platforms on both tracks, Mansfield is fully accessible. Large parking lots are available west of the tracks, with limited parking including accessible spots next to the station building east of the tracks. History =Early stations= 1908 view of the original depot building The Boston and Providence Railroad opened through Mansfield in 1835, with a flat-roofed depot built near the modern station site. The Taunton Branch Railroad opened the next year; through cars operated to New Bedford soon after the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad opened in 1840, though the service was not suitable for commuters until 1885. The Mansfield and Framingham Railroad opened in 1870 as part of the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad; it was merged into the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad in 1876 which itself became part of the Old Colony Railroad system in 1883 as the Old Colony's entrance to northern Massachusetts. Mansfield became a short turn point for some B&P; trains in 1885. The Old Colony acquired the B&P; in 1888 and subsequently increased Mansfield - New Bedford service which connected with trains to Boston at Mansfield. The Old Colony was absorbed by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893, unifying rail service in southeastern Massachusetts under the single operator. After South Station opened in 1899, both Taunton and New Bedford service operated as through trains to Boston via Mansfield. Service to the South Coast began running more often via Stoughton after 1918, and most branch line service via Mansfield except a handful of Taunton locals was cut by 1927. =Declining service= The 1955-built \\"temporary\\" station in 1985 Service to Framingham ended in 1933. South Coast service was switched back to via Mansfield in 1937 though New Bedford service was once again changed to via Stoughton in 1950. In 1955, the New Haven Railroad raised the tracks through Mansfield to eliminate grade crossings; the branch to Taunton was severed and all South Coast service ran via Stoughton until it was cut three years later. A 'temporary' wooden station was built, which became permanent as the New Haven fell into financial crises. Mansfield was briefly served by a small number of Amtrak intercity trains around 1972. =MBTA era= The MBTA began funding service to Mansfield in August 1971. The same month, game-day service from Boston and Providence to Foxboro station at the New England Patriots' newly opened Schaefer Stadium was introduced. The Providence section was discontinued after one season while Boston service continued. By the early 1990s, Boston‚ÄìFoxboro trains operated over the Providence/Stoughton Line, with intermediate stops including Mansfield; a reverse move was made at Mansfield to access the Framingham Secondary. Providence‚ÄìFoxboro event service resumed in 1994, with intermediate stops including Mansfield; Boston‚ÄìFoxboro service was rerouted over the Franklin Line. Ramp structure under construction in December 2018 In mid-2002, the town of Mansfield began a $1.5 million project to replace the derelict 1955 station. The new brick station opened in January 2004; it also serves as a town meeting hall for community functions. Mansfield is located on a straight section of the Northeast Corridor where the Acela Express is permitted to travel at its top speed of . Mansfield and Kingston are the only two stations where the Acela Express reaches this speed on platform tracks.Attleboro, T.F. Green Airport, and Wickford Junction are also located on sections where the Acela Express does not stop, but the platforms at these stations are located on sidings not normally used by the Acela Express. A fence is located between the tracks to prevent passengers from crossing, due to the danger from high-speed trains. On March 2, 2016, a crossing passenger was struck and killed by a northbound Northeast Regional. The station was closed through the next day because hazardous materials workers had to clean the site because of the high speed of the collision. Another illegally crossing passenger was struck and killed by a Northeast Regional train on September 22, 2016 - the ninth fatality involving a train in Mansfield in less than a decade. A construction project is under way which will improve accessibility at Mansfield station. The project includes replacement of the mini-high platforms, better signage, new ramps and stairs between the platforms and to Route 106, better lighting, improved guardrails, and full paving of all parking lots. Construction began in June 2017. A temporary inbound mini-high platform opened that December, with a similar temporary platform also added on the outbound side. In July 2018, estimated completion was delayed until December 2019 after it was discovered that the ramps would not meet code. The new ramps and stairs opened on March 6, 2020, followed by the outbound mini-high platform on April 27 and the inbound mini- high platform on May 4.

Manitowoc was constructed by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and launched in 1969 and entered service in 1970. Manitowoc was deployed to Vietnam during the Vietnam War, was part of U.S. peacekeeping efforts in Beirut, Lebanon in 1982‚Äì83 and was part of the force sent to invade Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. In the early 1990s, the ship took part in operations in the Gulf War before being decommissioned in 1993. The ship was acquired on loan by the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) in 1995 and underwent a refit at Newport News Shipbuilding before being recommissioned into the ROCN in 1997 as ROCS Chung Ho. In 2000, the ROCN acquired the ship outright as part of the Security Assistance Program. The ship remains in service. Description Manitowoc was the second of the which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. Manitowoc had a displacement of when light and at full load. The LST was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. Manitowoc was fitted with six General Motors 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. Manitowoc was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977‚Äì1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers. Construction and career =United States Navy service= Ordered as part of the second group in Fiscal Year 1966, the LST was laid down at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 27 February 1967. The ship was named Manitowoc after the county in Wisconsin on 21 March 1967. The vessel was launched on 4 January 1969 and sponsored by the wife of U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. Manitowoc was commissioned on 24 January 1970. Manitowoc conducted two deployments off Vietnam in 1971 and 1972 during the Vietnam War. She carried troops to Lebanon in 1982 and 1983 during the U.S. participation in the Beirut Multinational Peacekeeping Force. En route to Lebanon in October 1983 she also participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion of Grenada as part of Amphibious Squadron Four. On 25 October Manitowoc and , a , were unexpectedly ordered to transit to the western shore of the island to open a second front on the enemy forces. A beachhead at Grand Mal Bay near the capital city was secured by 13 amphibious landing craft carrying a company of marines which were launched from the LST.

It serves the Providence/Stoughton Line. The station has two separate entrances for inbound trains to Boston and for outbound trains to Providence and beyond. Sharon station is the only public transportation in the Sharon area, as there are no public bus lines in the town. New platforms were constructed in 2014 to make the station accessible. History 1870s-built Sharon station on a 1908 postcard The Boston and Providence Railroad started full operations between the two cities in June 1835, including a station at the modern location in Sharon. In the 1870s, the original Sharon station was replaced by a larger building similar to those still extant at East Greenwich and Kingston in Rhode Island. The Boston and Providence was leased by the Old Colony Railroad in 1888, which was in turn absorbed by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad in 1893. The current inbound station building and the small outbound shelter were designed by F.J. Pitcher and built in 1936 by the New Haven Railroad. The station building was formerly a private business, but is now open to commuter rail riders. Penn Central took over New Haven Railroad commuter operations on January 1, 1969. On January 27, 1973, the MBTA acquired a number of Penn Central's Boston commuter lines, including the Providence/Stoughton Line. In June 1973, the MBTA began subsidizing commuter rail service to Sharon. The town had been part of the MBTA district since 1964. By the early 1990s, Boston‚ÄìFoxboro trains for events at Foxborough Stadium operated over the Providence/Stoughton Line, with intermediate stops including Sharon. When Providence‚ÄìFoxboro event service resumed in 1994, Boston‚ÄìFoxboro service was rerouted over the Franklin Line. =Accessibility= Mini-high platforms at Sharon station in 2016 Until 2014, Sharon was the busiest station on the system that was not accessible. All other stations with daily ridership above 1,000 passengers had accessible high-level platforms, as did all other stations on the busy Providence/Stoughton Line. After an accessibility complaint was filed in May 2011, construction was mandated to take place by November 1, 2012. No construction took place in 2012, prompting concerns that the commuter rail stop - not just the building - would be closed. On October 15, 2012, the state's Architectural Access Board granted the MBTA an extension until October 1, 2013 to make the station accessible. The project, which included adding mini-high platforms and improving handicapped access to the building, was originally expected to begin in the spring of 2013 and to be completed that fall at a cost of $1.2 million. In May 2013, the MBTA issued a request for bids for the then-$2.6 million project, with work to start in August. Notice to Proceed was given to the chosen contractor on September 5, 2013, with work to be completed by February 2014. Noise testing begun in April 2014, followed by ongoing construction of mini-high platforms as well as improvements to the building and parking lot. The accessible parking spots and the building retrofits were completed during May 2014, but construction of the platforms continued for several more months. The mini-high platforms were opened on September 30, 2014, making Sharon fully handicapped accessible. =Other Sharon stations= Sharon Heights station in the early 20th century A station was located in Sharon Heights near Garden Street, about a mile south of Sharon proper. It was closed sometime in the mid-20th century, at least a decade before the 1973 MBTA takeover. In the late 1800s, a short-lived half-mile branch line led from Sharon Heights to a summer-only station at Lake Massapoag. The branch was also used to haul ice from the lake to surrounding locales. The remnants of the wye to the branch are still visible from passing trains on the main line.

A second track would be added through the station to support increased bidirectional service; the two new platforms would be located fully south of Wyman Street so that trains do not block the crossing. Due to a sharp curve, full-length high-level platforms were originally thought not to be feasible; instead, each platform was to have a 45-foot-long mini-high platform at the southern end.

C. Dounis (; c.1886 to 1894 ‚Äì August 13, 1954), was an influential teacher of violin and string instrument technique, as well as violinist, violist, and mandolin player. D.C. Dounis Life and work Considerable uncertainty prevails on the subject of Dounis's early life, beginning with the date of his birth in Athens, variously given as 1886 (according to most library catalogues), 1893,Wrochem, p. 1345. or 1894.Eaton, p. 559. He is said to have performed his first violin recital at the age of 7, and to have toured the United States as a mandolinist at 14. In Athens, he participated in the famous Athenian Mandolinata, conducted by Nikolaos Lavdas. He studied under Franti≈°ek Ond≈ô√≠ƒçek in Vienna, where he also took a medical degree, specializing in neurology and psychiatry. He also studied in Paris with C√©sar Thomson. After World War I, when he served as a doctor in the Greek army, he was appointed to the chair in violin at the State Conservatory of Thessaloniki, but soon established himself in the United States. Dounis focused his early medical career on treating professional musicians from the world's major symphonies. He would work with a musician for at least six months, observing the musician's technique, asking questions, and devising new exercises to indirectly address the problem. Dounis also wrote several instructional books. In his 1921 volume The Artist's Technique of Violin Playing, Dounis emphasized the importance of shifting and finger exercises. These were to develop the musician's mental map at the beginning of practice, after which scale drills would be more effective.

Seven-ball is a contemporary pool game with rules similar to nine-ball, though it differs in two key ways: the game uses only seven as implied by its name, and play is restricted to particular pockets of the table. William D. Clayton is credited with the game's invention in the early 1980s. Rules At the start of the game, balls one through seven are in a hexagonal configuration, with the 1-ball placed at the rack's , centered over the table's , the 7-ball placed at the rack's center, and all other balls placed clockwise (see photo top right). Immediately following the , the opponent must elect three pockets along one of the table's , and the player who broke is automatically assigned the three pockets situated along the opposite long rail. Once that selection is made, balls 1‚Äì6 may be in any pocket in rotation, starting with the one, as the object ball. Balls pocketed via combinations off of the object ball are legal. The 7-ball must be pocketed in the called side to be a legal win. Scratches on any object ball allow the opponent ball-in-hand, but the sunk ball remains potted. Scratching on the 7-ball is a loss. Pocketing the 7-ball in any other pocket than the called side is a loss. A special 7-ball was designed for television matches by Charles Ursitti (billiards historian, referee and Willie Mosconi's one time manager) to address the problem that the color of the seven and three balls in a standard set of pool balls are nearly indistinguishable when viewed on a TV screen. The ball adopts the of the with the color of the black , the \\"\\" of their respective namesake games. A similar effect can be achieved with a standard 15-ball set, substituting the striped 15 for the seven, after which, on coin-operated tables, a second game may then be played with the striped 9 to 14, and the solid seven as the money ball. Racking up a game with the diamond rack and a regular 7 ball No special equipment is required for play in pool halls or home pool rooms. As illustrated to the left, a regular set of pool balls and a nine-ball diamond rack turned sidewise are adequate. The original informal incarnation of seven ball led to a variant professional ruleset that enjoyed a brief heyday in the Sudden Death Seven- ball series of pro tournaments, broadcast on the American cable TV network ESPN from 2000 to 2005.

It is south-west of Falkirk, east of Cumbernauld and north-east of Airdrie. Slamannan is located at the cross of the B803 and B8022 roads, near the banks of the River Avon, close to the border between Falkirk and North Lanarkshire councils. Slamannan had a population of around 1,360 residents. In 1755 the population was recorded as 1209. Fifty years later the population was around the 1000 in the Parish of Slamanan (although elsewhere in the same volume the usual spelling is used). The 19th-century parish church can accommodate upwards of 700 people. History and Toponymy Blaeu's map from 1654 based on Pont's original c.1596 \\"The East Central Lowlands (Stirling, Falkirk & Kilsyth) - Pont 32\\" map depicting Slamannenn and Slea-manann Moore The name relates to the Manaw Gododdin tribe about whom little is known. The name possibly means hill-face of Manan. The church at Slamannan used to be named after St Laurence. There is also a well which bears his name. It is recorded that in 1470 James II gave a charter to Lord Livingstone for the lands of Slamannan. The area was once well known for steam coal which was worked at Longriggend. Farming was also practiced on about 40 farms in the parish. Several other old maps show Slamannan with various spellings including maps by John Grassom, John Ainslie and John Thomson. Only the Ordnance Survey Map shows the Culloch Burn. Gas lighting was set up in 1855. By 1882 the population had grown to 1644 with over 200 people in school. Newspaper articles mentioning Slamannan are available from the 18th century. Notable residents Former Cabinet Minister Viscount Horne was born in Slamannan in 1871, the son of the village's Church of Scotland minister. After study at the University of Glasgow, he became a successful QC and was elected to represent Glasgow Hillhead in Parliament, and served as Minister of Labour, President of the Board of Trade and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lloyd George after the First World War. He was ennobled in 1937 as Viscount Horne of Slamannan. Other distinguished sons of Slamannan manse include John Cameron and his brothers Hugh, Sandy and Kenneth, all of whom won national titles in athletics in the 1960s and 70s (John and Kenneth as runners, and Hugh and Sandy in the heavy field events). All of them later went on to become doctors. Their father, Alexander Cameron was an interesting man in his own right, having been a miner who went up to Glasgow University from the West Central coalfields in the depths of the Depression to study divinity. After serving as an army padre throughout the War, he went back to the coalfields in 1946 as a Church of Scotland minister. He was also the village's Labour county councillor and convener of Stirlingshire Education Committee for twenty years until his death from black lung in 1968. Early twentieth-century Everton footballer, Alex \\"Sandy\\" Young was born in Slamannan, and spent his youth years playing for Slamannan Juniors. He remains the all-time fourth-highest scorer for Everton, and scored the only goal at the 1906 FA Cup Final. Another footballer, Andrew Smith, also hailed from the village. He played for numerous clubs in Scotland and England including East Stirlingshire, West Bromwich Albion, Newton Heath (later renamed Manchester United) and Bristol Rovers. Lance Corporal Samuel Frickleton, was born in Slamannan, in 1891, the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Frickleton. The family emigrated to New Zealand to take advantage of the plentiful jobs on offer in the coal mining industry, and the following year saw the outbreak of the First World War. Corporal Frickleton was awarded the military's highest honour for his actions in the Battle of Messines. His bravery was so outstanding that his commanding officer claimed he could have won the Victoria Cross \\"twice over\\". Another notable military man from the village who was highly decorated was Sgt Observer James Bryce, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal for his exploits in the RAF in WW2.

It was established in 1797 by Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon as a fishing village. It had a population of 844 at the time of the 2011 census. Currently the Portgordon Community Harbour Group is trying to regenerate the harbour and open a marina. History By 1793 Buckie was the principal fishing community in the area. At that time fishing was confined to line fishing for cod, ling and haddock, in boats no larger than 14 tons. Development of the industry was limited by the lack of a proper harbour, and disputes amongst the three owners of the various boats. One of these, Alexander, 4th Duke of Gordon, decided to establish a new village, just to the west of the tiny community of Gollachy which comprised but a few houses in the area that is now Gordon Street. Work was underway on the harbour in 1795 and stone was shipped from Lossiemouth in 1796. In 1797 houses were built for ten fishermen and their families from Nether Buckie (the western side of Buckie). This was the third new village the Duke had established, but unlike Fochabers and Tomintoul before, this was a smaller venture and little planning was done with regards to street layout. The land immediately to the west of Portgordon was owned by Patrick Steuart of Tannachy and Auchlunkart, who built there the Seatown of Tannachy (now more commonly Porttannachy) during the 19th century. At this time trade was expanding, not just in fishing and boat building, but in the export of grain, and import of salt, coal and lumber, and the building of granaries. This placed Portgordon at a great advantage over Buckie which was still limited by its natural harbour to fishing alone. By the 1850s a post office had opened and there were many coopers, fish processors and net makers. By 1861 the population had grown to around 630. The opening of a fertiliser factory in Keith lead to traffic in bones through the harbour too. Rail service began in 1886 with the opening of Portgordon railway station on the Moray Firth coast line on the Great North of Scotland Railway. The line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and part of British Railways in 1948. The Beeching Report recommended closure, and it was closed on 6 May 1968. In 1981 a bowling green and play park were opened on the site of the old station. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 established Banffshire County Council and this led to the establishment of street names throughout the village, and the demise of Seatown of Tannachy and Gollachy as distinct communities. A boat building industry began, with local yards first constructing Zulu‚Äôs and from 1903 steam drifters. In 1907 one yard employed fifty men and launched a drifter every month or so but this business in drifters had dried up by 1915, though the yard continued to produce salmon cobles. Street lighting was introduced in the 1920s, and paraffin was used as there was no mains gas or electricity. Portgordon was one of the last communities to get electricity in 1937, and the village was nicknamed \\"Paraffin City\\". During World War II in 1940, two German spies, Karl Drucke and Vera Erikson were captured at the railway station and held at the police station. =Portgordon harbour= The harbour entrance is open to the north. From the piles of creels it looks as if there is still crab and lobster fishing going on in 2008 The original harbour of 1797 was constructed with wooden piers. Both fishing and an import/export trade thrived, and Portgordon became the principal port in the area. The Gordon estates transferred first to George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon and thence to his nephew Charles Gordon- Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond. In 1859 the Duchess of Gordon presented a barometer for the use of the fishermen and it was installed at the harbour. It was to Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond that the Harbour Committee turned in the late 1860s when the condition of the harbour was deteriorating and generally becoming inadequate for the increasing traffic. He agreed to pay for reconstruction if the fishermen would assist with transport of materials from Lossiemouth and Hopeman. The new harbour would enclose 3 acres, and cranes were to be installed for the first time at Portgordon. Construction took place between 1870 and 1874 and subsequently over a 100 boats were registered in the harbour. Success was short lived though, and the number of boats was in decline by 1881 due to competition from new harbours in Buckie and Buckpool. By 1904 the harbour was beginning to silt up and boats were having to wait for the tide to be able to enter harbour. Charles Gordon- Lennox, 7th Duke of Richmond was asked to build an extension to the eastern pier to stop the beach from washing into the harbour, but only dredging was carried out in 1906 and 1907. In 1908 the Duke offered to give the harbour to the community along with ‚Ç§2,000 to pay for the extension, but this offer was turned down in 1909 with many villagers fearing the maintenance costs. In 1935 ownership of the harbour transferred from the Gordon-Lennox family to the Crown Estate Commissioners when Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond sold his Scottish estates to pay crippling death duties. By 1945 there were only fourteen in the harbour and there was little commercial activity. Crown Estates Commissioners closed the harbour in 1947 and it was thereafter used by only a few pleasure craft. The structures were further damaged in the North Sea flood of 1953. By the late 1970s the north-west corner was breached and the mouth of the harbour was seriously silted up. Funded by various grants, the 69th Gurkha Independent Field Squadron rebuilt the harbour between 1985 and 1989. =Churches= In the early part of the village's history the populace was served by churches in other communities nearby. Roman Catholics in the area had first been using the clandestine church of St Ninian's Church, Tynet, which was supplanted in 1788 by St Gregory's Church, Preshome. St. Gregory's was the first church building to be openly built by Catholics in Scotland since the Reformation of 1560. The United Free Church had a church at Enzie crossroads a mile to the south of the village. In 1860 a Methodist minister, James Turner, preached a series of sermons which resulted in an interest in Methodism and the closure of six of the ten pubs in the village. A Methodist congregation was formed and the present church was built in 1874. In 1902 the United Free Church opened a new church hall in Portgordon. Landmarks A memorial to those who had lost their lives during World War I was unveiled on 9 June 1921. It is a Celtic cross of granite, situated in East High Street. It records the names of 28 killed during World War I and a further 28 from World War II. Gollachy ice house is somewhat unusual, being sited on the shore, and excavated rather than being built into side of a hill. It is of rubble construction, built in the early 19th century, with a hip roof of turf. It was restored in the 1970s and is a category B listed building. Transport Portgordon, on the Speyside way, looking west along Gordon Road on the A990 Portgordon is on the A990 road. The Speyside Way, Moray Coast trail and National Cycle Route 1 pass through the village. The nearest railway stations are at Elgin and Keith. Education Portgordon Primary School had a pupil enrollment of 60 as at 23 September 2014. In 2014, Moray Council's Sustainable Education Review recommended merging the school into Cluny Primary School in Buckie, but following petitions council voted to give it a five-year reprieve.

It was formerly in the county of Peeblesshire, but since local government re-organisation in the mid-1990s it is now part of Scottish Borders. Many of its residents are commuters, owing to the village's proximity to Edinburgh, which is to the north east. West Linton has a long history, and holds an annual traditional festival called The Whipman Play. History The village of Linton is of ancient origin. Its name derives from a Celtic element (cognate with the modern Irish Gaelic linn, Scottish Gaelic linne, and modern Welsh \\"Llyn\\") meaning a lake or pool, a pool in a river, or a channel (as in Loch Linnhe, part of which is called An Linne Dhubh, the black pool, or Dublin, an Anglicisation of dubh and linn, meaning black pool) and the Gaelic \\"dun\\" Welsh \\"din\\"), for a fortress, fortified place, or military camp (related to the modern English town, by way of the Saxon \\"tun\\", a farm or collection of dwellings), and is evidently appropriate, as the village appears to have been surrounded by lakes, pools and marshes. At one time it was known as Lyntoun Roderyck, identified perhaps with Roderyck or Riderch, King of Strathclyde, whose territory included this area, or with a local chieftain of that name. The Scottish Gaelic version of the place name is a partial translation, Ruairidh being a Gaelic form of Roderick. The prefix \\"West\\" was acquired many centuries later to clarify the distinction from East Linton in East Lothian. The first written record occurs in the twelfth century, when the Church of \\"Linton-Ridric\\" was gifted to the Church of St Mary of Kelso and \\"the Monks serving God there\\". The Church remained within the Diocese of Kelso until the Reformation (1560). There is considerable evidence of the pre-historic occupation of the area. A right-of-way through the foothills of the Pentland Hills follows an important pre-historic routeway linking the Upper Clyde valley with the estuary of the River Forth. It is marked in this section by two large Bronze Age cairns, one of them being the best preserved example of its kind in the country. In 1994 a Bronze Age cemetery was excavated at the Westwater Reservoir. Significant artefacts were discovered, including several beakers and an important lead necklace. The old Edinburgh to Lanark road follows the line of the Pentland Hills. Between Dolphinton and Carlops it is now a right-of-way, approached from West Linton by the Loan or Medwyn Road: it crosses the road from West Linton to Baddinsgill near Medwyn House. This route continues north-west, following the important droving route along which sheep and cattle passed northwards through the Pentlands by way of the Cauldstane Slap for the great trysts at Crieff and Falkirk markets. Livestock from the north came south via the same route to West Linton and Peebles. Linton was raised to a Burgh of Regality in 1631, with the right to hold fairs and markets. The importance of droving and the markets reached their zenith in the early years of the nineteenth century, when upwards of 30,000 sheep would be sold annually, including the famous Linton breed. The markets at Linton were considered the largest in Scotland and were widely referred to as an expression for any gathering of a large size: \\"big as a Linton Market.\\" West Linton had two therapeutic wells, the waters of which were sold on market days for either a penny or a half penny, depending on the well. West Linton manor house There were a tannery and brewery situated on the Upper Green and a gas works on the Lower Green, all now gone. The Manor House at the top of the main street dates from 1578, and is said to have been built on Saturday nights by masons who were engaged by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Regent of Scotland, to work on his castle of Drochil, seven miles distant down the Lyne valley. =Education= The appointment of a schoolmaster was first recorded in 1604, but there is no note of a schoolhouse until 1657. In 1791 the parish school was situated near the cross. A new parish school was opened in 1864 as a single-storey building and may be seen, somewhat altered, on the opposite side of the main street. At one time it was attended by over eighty pupils, all accommodated in the single room. On the Lower Green was a school for females and infants. There was also the Episcopalian School on Chapel Brae, connected with St Mungo's Church. Children of the United Presbyterian Church congregation attended the Somervail School, built in 1852 from money left for the purpose by James Somervail of Moreham, whose wife was a member of the brewing family of Younger, of long standing in the village. The 'New' School on School Brae was built in 1907 but is now disused, replaced by the new primary school on Deanfoot Road that opened in October 2013. Climate As a part of the British Isles, West Linton experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. West Linton can be prone to notably low temperatures. Contributing factors include its location in a valley and the relatively elevated position of the village centre at approximately 230m above sea level. It has recorded a number of British low temperature date records, such as -21.8 ¬∞C on 12 January 1982, -11.7 ¬∞C on 1 April 1917, -10.0 ¬∞C on 30 October 1926 and -18.3 ¬∞C on 16 November 1919. Village Greens West Linton has two village greens, the Lower Green to the south and the Upper Green to the north, the land for which was granted to the inhabitants in perpetuity by the feudal Lord, the Earl of March. In 1729 there was objection on the part of a section of the congregation to the enforced settlement of the minister, and, on the day of ordination in 1731, \\"riotous scenes\\" were reported. Soldiers were sent to restore order, and as they forded the river at the Lower Green, they were pelted with stones by the indignant villagers, several of whom were taken to Edinburgh to answer for their disorderly conduct. St Andrew's Parish Church Kirks and folk Adjacent to the Lower Green is the parish church of St. Andrew, flanked by the old graveyard in which stood the original church and manse. In 1780 plans were approved for a new church to be built on the old manse glebe, the minister to be compensated for the loss of his land by the addition of twelve shillings to his stipend. A new manse was built on the glebe land which had been acquired south of the river and in 1782 the new church itself was completed. In 1871 it was enlarged, the roof being raised to accommodate the gallery, larger windows were installed and the spire added. In the succeeding years the wood carvings executed by two local ladies, Miss Jane Fergusson of Spitalhaugh, and Mrs Wodropp of Garvald, were added to the interior walls and gallery. Of note in the graveyard are two bee-boles in the boundary wall in which ministers living in the old manse would place their skeps. St Mungo's Scottish Episcopal Church sits at the top of the hill over looking this Green. Rail and road The Leadburn to Dolphinton branch line which was linked to the Peebles-Edinburgh railway was opened in 1864 and was designed by Thomas Bouch, who was also responsible for the ill-fated Tay Bridge. It was built to facilitate mining and quarrying activities in the area, and although these industries declined, the line led to the expansion of the village to accommodate Edinburgh folk who might rent a house in the summer, or decide to live here permanently, either travelling to work or as a place of retirement. At the southern end of the main street near the parish church is the old toll house, built in the early nineteenth century at the entrance to the village on the Blyth Bridge to Carlops turnpike road. Tolls were levied on travellers, including the many drovers and their animals passing through the district. The ticket issued entitled the purchaser to pass free of charge through other districts provided they did so on the same day, but anyone attempting to bypass the toll could be fined twenty shillings if caught, and there were also severe penalties for those convicted of damaging or destroying a toll house. Merchants and craftsmen At the end of the eighteenth century there were between twenty and thirty looms in the village, rising to about eighty in the early nineteenth century, some weaving household goods but most weaving cotton cloth for Edinburgh and Glasgow merchants. It is estimated that in 1834 about fifty hands worked in the mines and quarries of the area. There were collieries near Carlops and Macbiehill, the latter operating until recent times; also quarries producing limestone for agricultural purposes. In 1834 there were five tailors in the village, four dressmakers, two butchers, five carriers, nine retailers of meal, groceries and spirits, two surgeons and four innkeepers.

Back home, he set up a darkroom in a convenient cellar with another keen amateur, the local postman Battista Minguzzi, and began developing and printing his own black & white work. The encounter with a local professional photographer Nevio Natali was very important: in Nevio's studio, Roversi spent many hours realising an important apprenticeship as well as a strong durable friendship.  Career  In 1970, he started collaborating with the Associated Press: on his first assignment, AP sent Roversi to cover Ezra Pound's funeral in Venice. During the same year, Roversi opened, with his friend Giancarlo Gramantieri his first portrait studio, located in Ravenna, via Cavour, 58, photographing local celebrities and their families. In 1971, he met by chance in Ravenna, Peter Knapp, the swiss fashion photography and legendary artistic director of Elle magazine. At Knapp's invitation, Roversi visited Paris in November 1973 and has never left. In Paris, Roversi started working as a reporter for the Huppert Agency but little by little, through his friends, he began to approach fashion photography. The photographers who really interested him then were reporters. At that moment he didn't know much about fashion or fashion photography. Only later, he discovered the work of Avedon, Penn, Newton, Bourdin, and many others. The British photographer Laurence Sackman took Roversi on as his assistant in 1974. Roversi endured Sackmann for nine months before starting on his own with small jobs here and there for magazines like Elle and Depeche Mode until Marie Claire published his first major fashion story. Roversi's career has since bloomed to include celebrity and fashion photography. He has been a regular contributor to American Vogue, and Vogue Italia, W, Vanity Fair, Interview and i-D. He has also photographed advertising campaigns for Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Gar√ßons, Dior, Cerruti, Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino and Alberta Ferreti.  Technique  Roversi has said of his technique: He is known for shooting with 8x10 Polaroid film, and claimed to buy as much as he could find before it was discontinued.

Piker Clerk (January 19, 1904) A. Piker Clerk was a short- lived yet influential newspaper American comic strip created in 1903 by the cartoonist Clare Briggs. It was syndicated in William Randolph Hearst's Chicago American until June 7, 1904. Characters and story A horseracing- related comic strip seen daily on the sports pages, A. Piker Clerk gave readers a racehorse tip each day. The strip featured Mr. Clerk, a character with a gambling problem, who placed daily bets on a horse in the Chicago races each day. The following day Clerk's win or loss was posted, as described in Toonopedia by comics historian Don Markstein: :Mr. Clerk's claim to vulgarity was his gambling habit. Each day‚Äîhis strip was probably the first reliable daily‚Äîhe'd bet on a horse in a Chicago race. Next day, the race run, the strip would open with him having won or lost, depending on how the real-life horse did, then it was on to the next bet. The character and his gimmick were created by cartoonist Clare Briggs, who is much better known for a later creation, the domestic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Briggs did it at the behest of editor Moses Koenigsberg, who thought a racing-related comic, running in the sports pages, would appeal to adult readers of the daily papers. Many sources give 1904 as the year A. Piker Clerk began, but the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art has a couple of strips from December, 1903 in its collection. Influence It soon inspired similar strips in other papers, notably A. Mutt, which began in 1907 in the San Francisco Chronicle and evolved into Mutt and Jeff. In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Blog, Robert McHenry wrote: :Mutt & Jeff wasn't the first newspaper comic strip, but it was the first to achieve great success. It had been predated by three years by Clare Briggs‚Äô A. Piker Clerk, a series that was also closely tied to the sport of kings but that died after a short run. An odd circumstance that caught my attention a great many years ago is the remarkable number of early comic-strip cartoonists who were from the Wisconsin-Illinois-Indiana region.

In the Natalie interview, Yoshikawa said that she had thought of the body swapping idea in the Yankee-kun days, and had researched some medical books on the differences between men and women, both physically and emotionally, but generally went with it because she liked the idea. \\"It just kind of came to me, but I was wondering how a guy finding himself in a girl‚Äôs body would react, and the reverse\\".

With regards to drawing in Yamada-kun, she tries to vary each kiss, but mostly uses the side angle to make sure it comes through.

Thanabalasingam was the third chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy and the first Malaysian to be appointed to the post. Thanabalasingam joined the British Royal Malayan Navy, which was then under British control, in May 1955. He was sent to the Britannia Royal Naval College (BRNC) in Dartmouth, England, from which he graduated in early 1958. He then decided to join the newly established Malayan Navy, which was fully Malayan owned and administered in late 1958. On his return to Malaya, he was appointed the first Naval Cadet Training Officer at the then Federation Military College at Port Dickson (currently the Royal Military College, Kuala Lumpur in Sungai Besi) from January 1, 1959. By then, newly independent Malaya under Tunku Abdul Rahman's leadership had successfully negotiated with the British Government to transfer the British Royal Malayan Navy to the Malayan Government on July 1, 1958. The British Royal Malayan Navy and all its assets (the ships, the bases and jetties and personnel) were merged with the existing Malayan Navy and from then on it became Malayan owned and administered. This new entity was named Royal Malayan Navy, and the designation ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù was a reference to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. After the trials and tribulations of the Indonesian Confrontation settled down, especially after the signing of the agreement between newly formed Malaysia and Indonesia in 1966, Tunku Abdul Rahman and his colleagues decided to Malaysianize the top posts in the navy and air force. They initially offered these posts to two senior Malaysian army generals, who declined for two main reasons. Firstly they felt that they were not professionally qualified and secondly because they did not want to jeopardise their own careers in the army. Tunku and his cabinet then decided that they would select two officers, one from the navy and one from the air force, and appoint them chiefs of the respective services. They were fully aware of Thanabalasingam's age but decided, nevertheless, to appoint him and take the risk. This exercise created history not only because Malaysians for the first time were appointed to these two top posts but also because of his age‚Äîhe was 31 years old and a bachelor. Under Thanabalasingam and with Tunku Abdul Rahman's foresight, the Royal Malaysian Navy was gradually transformed from a coastal navy (brown water force) to an ocean-going navy (blue water navy). At the end of 1976, he retired from the naval service as Rear Admiral at the age of 40. He ventured subsequently into private business. He currently lives in Kuala Lumpur.

A Raisin in the Sun debuted at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast by ABC on February 25, 2008.

They're anticipating a life insurance check for Lena's husband's death in the amount of $10,000, and each of them has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. Matriarch Lena wants to buy a house to fulfill the dream she shared with her deceased husband. Walter Lee would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store, believing the income would put an end to the family's financial woes. His wife Ruth, wanting to provide more space and better opportunities for their son Travis, agrees with Lena. Beneatha would like to use the money to pay her medical school tuition. Lena spends $3,500 for down payment on a house in Clybourne Park,, gives him the remaining $6,500 and tells him to save $3,000 of it for Beneatha's medical school and take the remaining $3,500 for his own investments. Ruth discovers she is pregnant and, fearing another child will add to the financial pressures, considers having an abortion, a suggestion to which Walter voices no objection, but Lena is strongly against, saying \\"I thought we gave children life, not take it away from them\\". Lena puts a down payment on a house in Clybourne Park, an entirely white section of the city. When their future neighbors find out the Youngers are moving in, they send Karl Lindner from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away, but they refuse the deal. Meanwhile, Walter has lost the balance of the insurance payment to his friend Willy Harris, who \\"took the cash to invest in the liquor store\\" but in reality made off with the money. It turns out that Walter did not even put the $3,000 for Beneatha's schooling in the bank. Beneatha rejects her suitor George, believing he's blind to the problems of their race. She receives a marriage proposal from Nigerian Joseph Asagai, who wants her to complete her medical studies and return to Africa with him. Walter, depressed and angry, forms a new idea about the \\"takers and the tooken\\", an idea that repulses everyone in the Younger household. When Walter calls back Lindner to confirm the deal, he has a last-minute change of heart and seeking to restore the Youngers' pride, rejects Lindner's offer again. The Youngers eventually move out of their apartment, fulfilling their dream. The future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they believe that they can succeed through optimism, determination, and remaining together as a family.

Critical reception In his review in Variety, Dennis Harvey said, \\"Strong performances and a brisk pace downplay the original script's more dated, preachy aspects . . . No one will mistake this well-produced but inevitably dialogue-driven piece for pure cinema, but Leon and adapter Paris Qualles open up the play just enough to avoid the usual stage-to-screen claustrophobia. Mervyn Warren's score is a bit more earnest and old-fashioned than would be ideal for this essentially faithful yet refreshed take on a dramatic golden oldie.\\"Harvey, Dennis. A Raisin in the Sun.\\" (film review) Variety. Tuesday January 29, 2008. James Greenberg of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"A Raisin in the Sun never totally transcends its origins on the stage and it's a long way from cutting edge cinema. But those who can relax into the leisurely pace and lush language will be rewarded with an earnest and moving night at the movies . . . As he did on stage, Leon gets the most out of his actors and with Hansberry's words, that's what carries the film. Rashad beautifully captures the wounded pride and hopes of the older generation, while the rapper and music entrepreneur Combs holds his own in his first major movie role. Balanced between her mother-in-law's idealism and her husband's pragmatism is Walter's wife Ruth, who may be getting the worst of both worlds.

The two countries nullified their earlier friendship and cooperation treaty in 1995, and in 1999, North Korea shut down their embassy in Ulan Bator on the occasion of an official visit Kim Dae-jung, the first such visit by a South Korean president. Mongolia had previously expelled two North Korean diplomats for attempting to pass counterfeit United States one-hundred dollar bills.Halbertsma, Tjalling H. F. ‚ÄúMongolia and the DPRK at Sixty-Five: Ulaanbaatar's Changing Relations with Pyongyang.‚Äù North Korean Review, vol. 10, no. 2, 2014, pp. 23‚Äì38., doi:10.3172/nkr.10.2.23.Subsequently, Mongolia began to intensify its policy of engagement with North Korea, with the aim of improving relations. In 2002, Paek Nam Sun became the first North Korean foreign minister to visit Mongolia in 14 years. The most recent high-level visit occurred in July 2007, when Kim Yong-nam, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made his third visit to the country; he had previously made two trips to Mongolia, in 1985 and 1988. Unofficially, North Korean visitors show significant interest in studying Mongolia's economic reforms; according to the Mongolian side, North Koreans see them as non- threatening because they are a fellow non-Western country and went through similar experiences under communism. Mongolia's efforts to introduce free- market capitalism to North Korea also have a component of self-interest. The Trans-Siberian Railway, an essential link in the potential continuous rail transit route from South Korea to Europe, passes through Mongolia; North Korean economic liberalisation which allowed South Korean shipping to pass through its borders would remove the major stumbling block to such a route, providing economic benefits for Mongolia. North Korean refugees are a delicate issue between the two governments. In 2005, South Korean charity groups received from the Mongolian government an allocation of 1.3 square kilometres of land at an unspecified location 40 kilometres outside of Ulan Bator to establish a refugee camp. However, as of November 2006, Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, Mongolia's prime minister, officially denied the existence of such camps. One scholar estimated that 500 North Korean refugees enter Mongolia each month, along with some legal migrant labourers who come under an inter-governmental agreement to work in light industry and infrastructure projects. In 2013, the Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj visited North Korea, and the two countries expanded economic ties, particularly with regard to oil refining.http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/what-do-north-korea-and-mongolia-have- in-common/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/mongolia-north-korea- special-relationship In October 2018, North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un received an official invitation to pay the visit to Mongolia by President Khaltmaagiin Battulga.

She was the wife of both Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford and 5th Earl of Gloucester and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall (son of King John of England). With the former, she was a great grandmother of King Robert the Bruce of Scotland. Family Born at Pembroke Castle, Isabel was the seventh child, and second daughter, of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare. She had 9 siblings: 4 sisters and 5 brothers, who included the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Earls of Pembroke; each of her brothers dying without a legitimate male heir, thus passing the title on to the next brother in line. Her last brother to hold the title of Earl of Pembroke died without legitimate issue, and the title was passed down through the family of Isabel's younger sister Joan. Her sisters married, respectively, the Earls of Norfolk, Surrey, and Derby; the Lord of Abergavenny and the Lord of Swanscombe. First marriage On her 17th birthday, Isabel was married to Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford and 5th Earl of Gloucester, who was 20 years her senior, at Tewkesbury Abbey. The marriage was an extremely happy one, despite the age difference, and the couple had six children: * Agnes de Clare (b. 1218) * Amice de Clare (1220‚Äì1287), who married the 6th Earl of Devon * Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford (1222‚Äì1262) * Isabel de Clare (2 November 1226 ‚Äì 10 July 1264), who married the Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale; through this daughter, Isabel would be the great grandmother of Robert the Bruce * William de Clare (1228‚Äì1258) * Gilbert de Clare (b. 1229), a priest Isabel's husband Gilbert joined in an expedition to Brittany in 1229, but died 25 October 1230 on his way back to Penrose, in that duchy. His body was conveyed home by way of Plymouth and Cranborne, to Tewkesbury, where he was buried at the abbey. Second marriage Isabel was a young widow, only 30 years old. She had proven childbearing ability and the ability to bear healthy sons; as evidenced by her six young children, three of whom were sons. These were most likely the reasons for both the proposal of marriage from Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and Isabel's acceptance of it, despite the fact that her husband had been dead for only five months. The two were married on 30 March 1231 at Fawley Church, much to the displeasure of Richard's brother King Henry, who had been arranging a more advantageous match for Richard. Isabel and Richard got along well enough, though Richard had a reputation as a womanizer and is known to have had mistresses during the marriage. They were the parents of four children, three of whom died in the cradle. * John of Cornwall (31 January 1232 ‚Äì 22 September 1233), born and died at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, buried at Reading Abbey * Isabella of Cornwall (9 September 1233 ‚Äì 10 October 1234), born and died at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, buried at Reading Abbey * Henry of Almain (2 November 1235 ‚Äì 13 March 1271), murdered by his cousins Guy and Simon de Montfort, buried at Hailes Abbey. * Nicholas of Cornwall (b. & d. 17 January 1240 Berkhamsted Castle), died shortly after birth, buried at Beaulieu Abbey with his mother Death and burial Isabel died of liver failure, contracted while in childbirth, on 17 January 1240, at Berkhamsted Castle. She was 39 years old. When Isabel was dying she asked to be buried next to her first husband at Tewkesbury Abbey, but Richard had her interred at Beaulieu Abbey, with her infant son, instead. As a pious gesture, however, he sent her heart, in a silver-gilt casket, to Tewkesbury.

Organization The organization of National Defence Training Association of Finland is decreed in the \\"Act on Voluntary Defence Activities\\" (). It is constituted as a voluntary association, the members of which are the main NGOs active in the field of Finnish total defence. The members are *Kadettikunta (Corps of Cadets, the voluntary ideological organization of career officers) *Maanpuolustuskiltojen liitto (League of the National Defence Guilds) *Maanpuolustusnaisten liitto (League of the National Defence Women) *Naisten valmiusliitto (League for Women's preparedness) *Reservil√§isliitto (Reservists' Association) *Reservil√§isurheiluliitto (Reservists' sports Association) *Sininen Reservi (The Blue Reserve, a naval reserve association) *Sotilaskotiliitto (Soldiers' Home Association, a non-profit association that upkeeps Soldier's Homes (Sotilaskoti in Finnish), kind of Canteens in all of regular military garrisons in Finland, serving food, sweets and soft drinks, they often have also TV, pool table as well as magazines and books for customers) *Suomen Mets√§st√§j√§liitto (Finnish Hunters' Association) *Suomen Tarkk'ampujakilta (Finnish Guild of Snipers) *Suomen Rannikkoj√§√§k√§rikilta (Finnish Guild of Coastal Rangers) i.e. Marines *Suomen Rauhanturvaajaliitto (Finnish Peace-Keeping Veterans' Association) *Suomen Reserviupseeriliitto (Finnish Reserve Officers' Association) The purpose of the association is to pursue the advancement of national defence by training, education and emission of information. The government has delegated to the association the public duty to organize voluntary military training and other training serving the military preparedness. To ensure the political control of this activity, five of nine members of the board of the association are selected by the Finnish government, the remaining four being elected by member associations. As an organization, the association is divided into 21 districts corresponding to the Regions of Finland. After the Defence Forces structural reform of 2008, the voluntary national defence district also corresponds the military district of the Defence Forces. Each district works closely with the military authorities in the area. Training The National Defence Training Association of Finland organizes four types of training. Safety training is non-military training aimed at the general public with the objective of increasing first aid skills and overall crisis preparedness. Preparedness training is also non-military but offered mostly to the persons in municipal or church administration. The objective of the preparedness training is to increase the capability of the civil organizations to remain active in different crisis scenarios ranging from nature disasters to military crises. About one half of all training given by the association is safety and preparedness training. The military training offered by the association is organized as short courses, which the Finnish Defence Forces or the Finnish Border Guard orders and pays. The association organizes the courses ordered by the Defence Forces using its voluntary training personnel. The law states that the association may not organize exercises for units larger than a company. The purposes of the training courses are *to maintain skills and knowledge learned during conscription *to train personnel for more demanding duties *to familiarize reservists with changes in national defence structures and activities *to train units in their war-time composition In contrast to the refresher exercise of the Finnish Defence Forces, the military courses of the association may be participated not only by military reservists but also by non-reservist men and women. These persons may serve in non-combat duties. All persons serving in a military course ordered by the Defence Forces and organized by the National Defence Training Association are subject to military criminal law during the duration of the course. The courses where weapons or other Defence Forces equipment are not used are less military in nature, although even they are meant to enhance the capabilities of participants to work in different areas of national defence.

Heady headstone The cemetery dates back to the early 19th century and has headstones for many members of the Heady family in it. According to a legend surrounding Heady Lane Cemetery there are spirits along the Hollow at 126th Street in Fishers at Allisonville Road. Conner Prairie keeps the legend alive every Halloween by telling of how a ghost of a tormented grave-robber traded in cadavers, until one night he dug up his own son's body, haunts the woods that line the roadway. Another version on the Heady Hollow Legend describes a fire that burned down a schoolhouse and killed several children run by the Heady family in the late 19th century. The legend goes that the ghosts of children come out on foggy nights not far from Heady Lane Cemetery at Heady Hollow, in Fishers where Allisonville Road intersects at 126th Street a very dark and wooded area prone to fog. An article explaining the legend of Heady Hallow by Georgianne Neal appeared in the Noblesville Ledger, June 4, 1979. According to the Hamilton County Historical Society records, there was no known school at the location of Heady Hollow. In contrast, an 1866 map of Delaware Township located on the Hamilton County Surveyors page clearly shows a school (School No. 2) located on the northeast corner of 126th & Allisonville Rd. This is likely the school attributed to the legend. No further information about the fire has been found thus far.

He committed these crimes with his 12-year-old son Michael.  Early life  Kallinger was born on December 11, 1935 as Joseph Lee Brenner III at the Northern Liberties Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Joseph Lee Brenner, Jr. and his wife Judith. In December 1937, the child was placed in foster care after his father had abandoned his mother. On October 15, 1939, he was adopted by Austrian immigrants Stephen and Anna Kallinger. He was abused by both his adoptive parents so severely that, at age six, he suffered a hernia inflicted by his adoptive father. The punishments Kallinger endured included kneeling on jagged rocks, being locked inside closets, consuming excrement, committing self-injury, being burned with irons, being whipped with belts, and being starved. When he was nine, he was sexually assaulted by a group of neighborhood boys. As a child, Kallinger often rebelled against his teachers and his adoptive parents. He dreamed of becoming a playwright, and had played the part of Ebenezer Scrooge in the local YWCA's performance of A Christmas Carol in the ninth grade. When Kallinger was 15, he began dating a girl named Hilda Bergman, whom he met at a theater which he was allowed to visit on Saturdays. His parents told him not to see her, but he married her and had two children with her. She later left him because of the domestic violence she suffered at his hands. Kallinger was hospitalized at St. Mary's on September 4, 1957 due to severe headaches and loss of appetite which doctors believed was a result of stress surrounding his divorce. Kallinger remarried on April 20, 1958 and had five children with his second wife. He was extremely abusive towards his family, and often inflicted the same punishments on them that he had suffered from his adoptive parents. Throughout the next decade, Kallinger would spend time in and out of mental institutions for amnesia, attempted suicide and committing arson.  Criminal career  Kallinger was arrested and imprisoned in 1972 when his children went to the police. While in jail, he had scored 82 on an IQ test and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and state psychiatrists recommended that he be supervised with his family. The children later recanted their allegations. Two years later, one of his children, Joseph, Jr., was found dead in an abandoned construction building, two weeks after Kallinger took out a large life insurance policy on his sons. Though Kallinger claimed that Joseph, Jr. had run away from home, the insurance company, suspecting foul play, refused to pay out the claim. Beginning in July 1974, Kallinger and his 12-year-old son Michael went on a crime spree spanning Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. Over the next six weeks, they robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused four families and murdered three people, gaining entrance to each house by pretending to be salesmen. On January 8, 1975, they continued their spree in Leonia, New Jersey. Using a pistol and a knife, they overpowered and tied up the three residents. Then, when others entered the home, they were forced to strip and were bound with cords from lamps and other appliances. This culminated in the killing of 21-year-old nurse Maria Fasching, the eighth person to arrive, when she refused to follow Kallinger's orders he responded by stabbing her in the neck and back. Another of the residents, still bound, managed to get outside and cry for help. Neighbors saw her and called the police. By the time they arrived the Kallingers had fled, using the city bus as their getaway vehicle and dumping their weapons and a bloody shirt along the way.  Arrest and imprisonment  Police investigated Kallinger after gathering the bloody shirt and eyewitness testimony that he and his son had been seen in the area. They soon found out about Kallinger's history of domestic violence, Joseph Jr.'s unsolved death, and a series of arsons targeted against buildings he owned. Kallinger and his son were arrested on kidnapping and rape charges, and eventually charged with three counts of murder in New Jersey state courts. Kallinger pleaded insanity, claiming God had told him to kill.\\"Experts in Murder Trial Say Shoemaker is Schizophrenic\\", The New York Times, 30 January 1984. He was found sane and sentenced to life in prison on October 14, 1976. Michael, meanwhile, was judged to be under his father's control. He was sentenced to a reformatory. Upon his release at 21, he moved out of state and changed his name. While in prison, Kallinger made several suicide attempts, including attempting to set himself on fire. Because of his suicidal and violent behavior, he was transferred to a mental hospital in Trenton, New Jersey. He was transferred to a mental hospital in Philadelphia on May 18, 1979. Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of the bestselling book, Sybil, interviewed Kallinger in jail in 1976. The interview was the basis for a book on the case which was published by Simon & Schuster under the title, The Shoemaker: The Anatomy of a Psychotic in 1983. This book was later part of a Son of Sam lawsuit brought by one of the victim's families as Kallinger received royalties for the book. A judge awarded the family earnings from not only Kallinger, but Schreiber and Simon & Schuster as well, leaving Schreiber nearly $100,000 in personal debt due to expenses of the book's research, including phone calls to Kallinger in prison which totaled $1200 per month for several years. A later appellate panel awarded only Kallinger's royalties to the families. Michael Korda, editor at Simon & Schuster, said that for many years he received a Christmas card from Kallinger from jail. Schreiber herself grew very close to Kallinger during the writing process, and the two exchanged regular letters and phone calls until Schreiber's death in 1988. Death Joseph Kallinger died of heart failure on March 26, 1996 at SCI Cresson. He spent the last 11 years of his life on suicide watch.

Over the past 30 years, government assistance has involved a mixture of government support, distributor/ broadcaster involvement and private investment. To a significant extent, government policies have shaped the form and scale of financing. Since 1995/96, 25-30% of funding for Australian feature films (local films and co-productions) has come from government sources. This was mainly from the Film Finance Corporation (FFC), until 2008 when the FFC merged with the Australian Film Commission and Film Australia to become Screen Australia. However, this group includes a number of films, such as Moulin Rouge (2001) and Happy Feet (2006), that were substantially financed by Hollywood studios. For independent Australian films, the proportion of government support is much higher. Meanwhile, TV drama has received about half of its financing from the industry itself and about 15% from government sources, while foreign investment has also been significant, reaching a peak of 49% in 1999/2000. In 2007, the Australian Government introduced the Australian Screen Production Incentive, a package of tax incentives designed to encourage private investment in Australian-produced films, television shows and documentaries.  History of Government support  At a number of times since the inception of the Australian film industry, the Australian government has experimented with quota-based support models, largely without success. At the same time, direct financial support for the industry was less forthcoming. The Government of New South Wales gave minor financial assistance to a number of productions in the 1930s. In 1945 the federal government created the Australian National Film Board, with a brief to produce documentaries. It was later known as the Commonwealth Film Unit and ultimately as Film Australia. Feature filmmaking in Australia, however, did not receive comprehensive government support until the 1970s. =1970s= During the 1970s, most Australian features were funded by the Australian Film Commission (established 1975) and its state government counterparts. John Gorton was Prime Minister of Australia from 1968‚Äì1971 and initiated several avenues of Government support for film and the arts, establishing the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the National Film and Television Training School.In office - John Gorton - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers Prime Minister Gough Whitlam continued to support Australian film. The South Australian Film Corporation was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the Australian Film Commission was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films. =1980s= In the 1980s, private financing increased as a result of tax incentives for Australian-made film and television productions. Division 10BA (1981) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 allowed investors a 150% tax concession on their investment at risk. 10B (1978) applied to a wider selection of project categories, and offered a concession spread over two financial years once the project was generating income. These concessions were whittled away throughout the 1980s, as the government became anxious about lost taxation revenue. By 1989, 10BA had become a flat 100% write-off. =1990s= During the 1990s, direct government support once again became the dominant source of feature film funding. The Australian Film Finance Corporation (FFC), established in 1988/89, became the main instrument of this support. It has funded 1,079 projects since then, to a budget value of $2.58 billion. Projects certified under 10BA were also eligible for direct investment from the FFC, while 10B projects were not. =Recent developments= The Australian Film Commission (AFC), once the government's main vehicle for production funding, was now focussed primarily on development, marketing and research activities. Recently proposed legislation has united the AFC and FFC, along with Film Australia, in a new entity, which is now known as \\"Screen Australia.\\" Another recent support mechanism was the Film Licensed Investment Company (FLIC) scheme. Each FLIC would invest in a slate of Australian-made productions, thus spreading the risk across a portfolio. Investors who bought shares in a FLIC would receive a 100% tax concession. The FLIC scheme was introduced in 1999 and renewed in 2005, but no further licences will be granted due to the introduction of the Producer Offset in 2007 (see below). A refundable film tax offset (RFTO), designed to attract large-budget overseas productions to shoot in Australia, was introduced in 2001. It covered feature films, mini-series, telemovies and TV series. It is to be superseded by the new Location Offset (see below). State agencies The state agencies, listed by their current titles, are: *Film Victoria *Create NSW/Screen NSW (New South Wales) *Screen Queensland (formerly Film Queensland, subsequently the Pacific Film and Television Commission) *ScreenWest/Western Australian Regional Film Fundhttps://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/05/Western- Australia-launches-Regional-Film-Fund.aspx (Western Australia; formerly the West Australian Film Corporation) *The South Australian Film Corporation *Screen Territory (Northern Territory) *Screen Canberra (Australian Capital Territory) *Screen Tasmania (Tasmania)  Australian Screen Production Incentive  The Australian Screen Production Incentive was introduced in 2007 to replace all the previous schemes. The key elements of the scheme include: A producer offset of 40% of ‚Äúeligible Australian expenditure‚Äù for production of Australian feature films, and 20% for television productions (projects may include series, telemovies, mini-series and documentaries). Qualifying Australian production expenditure (QAPE) covers expenditure made on goods or services provided in Australia, or provided overseas by Australian residents. QAPE on ‚Äòabove the line‚Äô costs (development costs and fees paid to key cast and creative personnel) will be capped at 20% of the production budget. To be eligible for the producer offset, feature films require a guaranteed cinema release and QAPE in excess of $1m. Minimum QAPE for documentaries is $250,000 per hour (no minimum total spend), television series $1 million (and $500,000 per hour), telemovies $1 million (and $800,000 per hour) and short form animation $250,000 (and $250,000 per quarter-hour). Screen Australia took over the certification process from the FFC in July 2008. Note: The incentive is officially classified as an offset by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA), and Australian popular media and the industry at large commonly refers to it as the 'producer rebate'. A location offset replaced the Refundable Film Tax Offset (RFTO). All eligible productions (including feature films, telemovies, and television mini-series and series) that spend at least $15 million in qualifying Australian production expenditure have access to a 15% offset (increased from the RFTO's 12.5%). Where qualifying expenditure is between $15 million and $50 million, 70% of total expenditure must be spent on production activity in Australia. Films which spend over $50 million in QAPE automatically qualify for the offset. A new post, digital and visual (PDV) offset of 30% is available for PDV projects that spend at least $5 million in qualifying PDV production spent in Australia, whether or not the production is shot in Australia. This offset can be used an alternative to, but not in conjunction with, the location offset. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA) administers the location and PDV offsets.  Private investment  Private investment in the Australian screen content industry peaked in 2001/02 and 2002/03, mainly as a result of the pilot Film Licensed Investment Company (FLIC) scheme. The 2004/05 year saw a further peak, owing to the production of the Australian feature film Jindabyne, which was majority funded by private investors. Financing from overseas sources has supported a number of feature films with internationally-known Australian directors. Examples include George Miller‚Äôs Happy Feet (financed by Warner Bros.) and Babe: Pig in the City (Universal Studios), Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs Moulin Rouge! (Fox), and European-financed films such as Rolf de Heer‚Äôs Dance Me to My Song (Italy) and Paul Cox‚Äôs Innocence (Netherlands).  Co-productions  The Australian Government has co-production agreements with nine countries. Official co-productions are eligible for nationally available benefits or programs of assistance. In Australia, this has included the 10B and 10BA schemes, the 12.5% Refundable Film Tax Offset (RFTO) and FFC funding. Australian feature film co-productions have increased from 13 in the 1990s to 14 between July 2000 and July 2006. The most common partners for Australian feature films have been (in descending order) the United Kingdom, Canada, France and New Zealand. In television drama, the main partners have been Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and France. Unofficial co-productions are not eligible for the same benefits as official co-productions. Examples include Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles and Farscape, are both unofficial Australian/US co-productions.

The Mission Revival-style station north of Rose Avenue, which served the California Zephyr until 1970, is no longer extant. The now-abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad Niles Subdivision was constructed by a different Western Pacific Railroad through downtown Pleasanton in 1869. The first station burned on July 26, 1873; the Central Pacific Railroad replaced it with a one-story station, which was expanded in 1881. A larger station was constructed in 1895; the older station was moved to Second Street, where it remains as a private home. Passenger service ended in 1941; the newer station is now a restaurant. A new station southwest of the former Western Pacific station site opened with the start of the Altamont Commuter Express service on October 19, 1998.

Life Born in Rochester, New York, he was raised with the combination of his grandparents' traditional Jewish piety and his father's modernist socialism. He graduated as valedictorian of his class at DeWitt Clinton High School and then majored in Classics at City College of New York which he graduated from summa cum laude in 1924. Steinberg received his doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University in 1928 and then entered the Jewish Theological Seminary of America where he was ordained. In seminary, he was strongly influenced by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881‚Äì1983), the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. After five years in a pulpit in Indiana, he was invited by the Seminary to assume the pulpit of Manhattan's Park Avenue Synagogue, then a small congregation with a Reform orientation. In his sixteen years at the congregation, he grew it from 120 to 750 families. In 1943 he had a near fatal heart attack. While a disciple of Kaplan who considered himself a Reconstructionist, Steinberg was critical of Kaplan's dismissal of metaphysics. Steinberg's works included Basic Judaism, The Making of the Modern Jew, A Partisan Guide to the Jewish Problem and As A Driven Leaf, a historical novel revolving around the talmudic characters Elisha ben Abuyah and Rabbi Akiva. In his final years, he began writing a series of theological essays. This project, which he had hoped would conclude in a book of theology, was cut short by his death at age 46. An unfinished second novel, The Prophet's Wife, about the Tanakh characters Hosea and Gomer, was published in March 2010.

It is just outside Hemet in Reinhardt Canyon, within the Lakeview Mountains, in Riverside County, California. On April 16, 1956, it was donated, along with of land, to Riverside County, by Mr. and Mrs. Rodger E. Miller. It is California Historical Landmark No.557. The government has installed two perimeter chain link fences around the petroglyph landmark, making direct appreciation, study or an unobstructed picture difficult. The surrounding land has been set aside for the protection of native plants and animals (with a warning that the ‚Äúnatural features may be hazardous‚Äù), and is at the end of California Avenue to the north of Highway 74 and several miles east of Interstate 215, near Hemet, California.

File:Hemet Maze Stone Complex Structures 2016-09-06.pngDiagram showing two possible block-like walled structures or spaces derived from the pattern carved into the Hemet Maze Stone. Features Closeup of the Maze Stone The \\"maze\\" consists of two rectangular boxes‚Äîone large and containing the other; centered. If one traces the patterns with different colored markers, one would find that between the boxes are two contiguous geometric patterns that resemble a maze. One \\"maze\\" is contained by the other on the left hand side. The swastika that appears in the lower left hand corner is not part of the original work as evidenced by a 1930s era photo featured in the Hemet Centennial calendar (featured photo of July 2010; available from the Hemet Museum located at the old train depot on the northwest corner of State and Florida). The stone and its surrounding land became a California state landmark in 1956, and sometime thereafter a vandal added a counter-clockwise swastika to one corner of the carving. This is not the same swastika that the Nazis in Germany appropriated after WWI; the Nazis used the clockwise version of the swastika. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hemet-maze-stone Swastikas were used in Oriental and Native American art long before the symbol became associated with Adolf Hitler. The stone is now protected by a pair of chain-link fences. The maze petroglyph, depending upon interpretation, could show four walled structures or areas, consisting of two simple objects and two ‚Äúmaze-like‚Äù complex objects. There is an inner and outer object for each type of simple or complex object. To reference the diagram called ‚ÄúConceptual Approximation of the Maze Stone near Hemet, California,‚Äù the \\"simple\\" objects are denoted by the square/rectangular black (outer) and gray/beige (inner) lines. The gray/beige area is filled in and appears as a rectangular object. What the computer considers a gray color, other people say is the color beige. The \\"complex\\" objects are blue (outer) and purple (inner). Notice how the purplish complex object is completely surrounded by the blueish complex object. The inner objects are completely surrounded in the space created by the outer objects. The blueish object seems to surround the simple gray object in the center, but is unable to completely do so, and the gray/beige object is either directly attached and is completely surrounded by the space associated with the outer black boundary wall that surrounds the whole ‚Äúmaze.‚Äù Taking away or adding the blue and purple areas makes no difference to the relationship between the inner gray/beige object and the outer black boundary line, as the space between them is still connected. The space inside the black line was left white/blank. Be aware the diagram was created with visual guesswork from multiple pictures using a computer graphics program to draw straight, colorized lines without measurements. The petroglyph appears to be a square, although the attempt to redo the diagram by computer produced better results when slightly elongated into a rectangle. Also the original is on the slightly curved surface of a stone, although there were flatter stones that could have been chosen in the region. Whether the maze can be recreated in a square while attempting to keep all the lines uniformly separated on a flat surface is a question that arose while creating the conceptual approximation diagram. Since there are ten lines to be crossed on the top, bottom, left and right of the original petroglyph, it stands to reason the idealized version of the ‚Äúmaze‚Äù could fit into a square. The original design constraints and reasoning behind the prehistoric design remain unclear even today, but show in the choices made while creating the ‚Äúmaze.‚Äù To give a few examples, at any given spot in the blueish space, there are up to three possible directions to follow, not the four directions possible when 90 degree line segments join together. The outside edge of the outer complex object shows the outline of the inner complex object three times. There are three ‚Äúdead ends‚Äù (in maze terminology) to the blueish-object‚Äôs area. If one looks at the spot where two of the blueish ends meet before reaching the inner complex object on the left side, one would have to transverse six straight segments to reach that point ‚Äì from either end point. The analysis discussion can also be changed by switching the walls to pathways and the pathways to be impassable areas, but the ‚Äúmaze‚Äù has design features that have nothing to do with a conventional ‚Äúmaze‚Äù where the objective is to go from a starting point to an ending point through a confusing set of passageways. The Maze Stone is certainly not what might be considered a regular maze, even though it may look like one. Without knowing the original intent of the creator, it is difficult to know if the maze represents an engineering drawing, a symbol, an artistic concept or something else. This petroglyph is classified as California Engraved, within the California Tradition of rock art.The Art of the Shaman: Rock Art of California, by David S. Whitley. 2000, University of Utah Press.

The album was released on October 23, 2007 as a double LP and as a single CD. The album name references Chrome Dreams, a legendary Neil Young album from 1977 that had originally been scheduled for release but was shelved in favor of American Stars 'N Bars. The album debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at number 11, selling about 54,000 copies in its first week. In addition, the song \\"No Hidden Path\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards, 2009. Production Chrome Dreams II was produced by The Volume Dealers (Neil Young & Niko Bolas), and features the ensemble of Crazy Horse drummer Ralph Molina, pedal steel guitarist and dobro player Ben Keith (Harvest, Comes A Time, Harvest Moon) and bassist Rick Rosas (Freedom, Living With War, This Note's for You). A horn section, The Blue Note Horns, appear on one track, \\"Ordinary People,\\" while the Young People‚Äôs Chorus of New York City appear on \\"The Way.\\" Most of the recording was done live with few overdubs at Feelgood's Garage studio near Redwood City, California, with two vintage gas pumps out front and vintage studio gear inside.

The first three songs of Chrome Dreams II date from the 1980s. \\"Beautiful Bluebird\\" was first recorded for the original version of Old Ways that was shelved by Geffen Records; \\"Boxcar\\" was a track on the unreleased Times Square album, which was scrapped in favor of the more commercially viable Freedom; and \\"Ordinary People,\\" which was recorded in summer 1988 for what became the Freedom album, was highly regarded as one of Young's greatest unreleased songs, and was often played live during the \\"Sponsored By Nobody\\" tour with The Bluenotes to promote the album. This was the album's first single, and was sent to radio on Monday, September 10. The length of this track (clocking in at 18:13) makes it hard to program into today's limited radio playlists, so it was initially heard on radio web sites.

He was key in developing Singapore's infrastructural and financial framework, including the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, Singapore Changi Airport and public housing. In 1984, during his term as Minister for Health, to address issues raised by a greying population, he made the controversial proposal to raise the age for the withdrawal of Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings from 55 to 60 years in order that Singaporeans might have more money to live on in their old age. Howe, who graduated from the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1953, also served as a senior civil servant, holding the posts of CEO of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) (1960‚Äì1970); Chairman of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office and Head of the Singapore Civil Service (1970‚Äì1979); Minister of Defence (1979‚Äì1982); and Minister of Health (1982‚Äì1984). In addition, he served as Chairman of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) (1970‚Äì1979, 1985‚Äì1990), Great Eastern Life Assurance (1992‚Äì2000) and The Straits Holding Company (1992‚Äì2007). Biography =Early life and education= Born in Singapore on 12 August 1923 of Chinese origin, Howe Yoon Chong was the son of a liquor shop owner who migrated to Malacca, British Malaya. Howe received his early education at St. Francis Institution in Malacca from 1933 to 1940, and was once a schoolmate of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew at Raffles Institution in Singapore. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Economics from the University of Malaya in Singapore (now the National University of Singapore) in 1953. =Civil service career= Howe worked in the civil service for almost thirty years. He began his career as a teacher, then was a broadcaster for a period before taking the post of an administrative officer in the British Colonial Secretariat. Later, Howe was appointed as a police magistrate and then secretary to Singapore's Public Service Commission. In 1960, Howe became the first chief executive officer (CEO) of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). From 1970 to 1979, he was the chairman and President of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the first Chairman of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), the Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, and the head of the Singapore Civil Service. During his tenure as a senior civil servant, Howe played the leading role in several of Singapore's iconic infrastructural projects like the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Singapore Changi Airport and public housing. Known by his civil service's colleagues as a fierce, tough- talking man, Howe debated vehemently with former Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee over whether to build the MRT system in Singapore. Howe was strongly in favour of the MRT as the backbone of Singapore's public transport system, while Goh proposed a more economical all-bus alternative. Howe fought strongly against the extension plans for a second runway at Paya Lebar Airport, and advocated the building of a new international airport in Changi. This was despite the Cabinet's decision for the go-ahead in 1972, based on a British expert's report that it would cost less to expand Paya Lebar Airport and that there was not enough time to get Changi built up to meet increasing traffic needs. Howe gathered a team to reclaim land, widened and extended the old Royal Air Force airstrip to take Boeing 747s and build the terminal. In August 1981, operations stopped overnight at Paya Lebar Airport and restarted the next morning at Changi Airport. Howe's role in setting up Changi Airport won him credit in Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs. Howe also fast-tracked the public housing programme while serving as the HDB's CEO under then-chairman Lim Kim San in the early years, solving the chronic housing shortage in the 1960s. He undertook the politically and technically arduous task of starting up Toa Payoh New Town, and faced organised opposition to the resettlement of Toa Payoh and the removal of squatters. As Chairman of PSA, now known as PSA Corporation, Howe went against the advice of professionals to build Singapore's first container terminal in the early 1970s. =Political career= Howe's first call to enter politics came as early as 1953 from Lee Kuan Yew, then a practising lawyer. However, he declined Lee's invitation as he believed that Singapore needed civil servants in light of the repatriation of British forces during the post-World War II period. In 1979, Howe was again persuaded by then Prime Minister Lee and then-Minister for Finance Goh Keng Swee to enter politics, and he eventually agreed. In 1979, upon being named as a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate in by-elections called in seven constituencies, Howe said he hoped to serve no more than five years. After submitting his nomination papers in the by-election, Howe dismissed the opposition candidates, including independent Chiam See Tong, as \\"court jesters\\" who had come out \\"to provide comic relief\\". Howe eventually beat Chiam with almost 67% of the votes to win the Potong Pasir seat. In the 1980 general election, Howe again defeated Chiam for Potong Pasir, and duly served as the Member of Parliament for the constituency until 1984. On 12 February 1979, Howe was sworn into the Cabinet as Minister for Defence. Directness being his hallmark, just six months after becoming Defence Minister Howe said that those who dodged national service ought to be looked upon as \\"pariah\\" in the community. Howe relinquished his defence post to become the Minister for Health from 1982 to 1984. There, Howe became best remembered by Singaporeans for his controversial proposal in 1984 to raise the age for the withdrawal of Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings from 55 to 60 years. At a news conference on 26 March 1984, Howe reasoned that Singaporeans could not depend only on their children in their old age. That suggestion, part of the 54-page report of the Committee on the Problems of the Aged which he chaired, was eventually dropped. However, the report that took 20 months to finalise remains an important document with its forward-looking strategies to support Singapore's greying population. Taking up the suggestions in the report, the Singapore Government subsequently introduced the Minimum Sum scheme. This allows workers to withdraw some of their CPF funds at age 55, setting aside a certain minimum sum which can only be withdrawn at retirement age, currently at 62 years. To encourage the employment of aged workers, the CPF contribution rates for both employer and the aged employee were cut in July 1988. In 1993, the government raised the retirement age to 60. Howe did not contest the general election in 1984. As a result of Howe's controversial report, the PAP lost 12% of the overall votes in that election, and conceded the Potong Pasir ward to Chiam. Howe retired from politics that year. In a letter of appreciation to Howe on his retirement, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said he was indebted to Howe for the devoted work he had put in for the people. Lee also predicted that when workers in their 20s and 30s reached their 60s, they would see how difficult it was for children to stretch their salaries to support aged parents. They would then be grateful to Howe for the furore he had stirred by the report on the problems of the aged. =Later years= After leaving politics, Howe returned to DBS as chairman and CEO in 1985 and served until 1990. In 1991, he helped to set up a managed fund, the Mendaki Growth Fund, for the Malay self-help group Mendaki, the Council for the Development of Singapore Muslim Community. From 1992 to 2000 he was the Executive Chairman of Great Eastern Life Assurance, and from 1992 to 2007 the President and CEO for The Straits Holding Company, an investment holding firm. He was also Chairman of the Rendezvous Hotel Singapore and Rendezvous Hotels & Resorts International. On 21 August 2007, Howe died in Singapore from a stroke after having been hospitalised for three weeks. Several of Singapore's leaders, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, attended Howe's wake. Howe's funeral was held at Mandai Crematorium on 24 August. Honours In 1963, Howe received a Malaysia Medal and a Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal). For his contributions to Singapore, Howe was awarded a Distinguished Service Order in 1968. In 1971, the National University of Singapore awarded him with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (LL.D.). Howe was also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, and an Honorary Life Member of the Young Men's Christian Association of Singapore. Personal life Howe was married to Wan Fook Yin. They had three children; two sons, Tet Sen and Tze Sen and a daughter, Hwee Siew and two grandchildren at the time of his death.

In 1981, he started Public Advocate of the United States, a conservative activist group known for its street theater, tax protests, and anti-LGBTQ+ efforts. He represented the Sterling District on the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, Virginia, from January 2000 to January 2016. In 2002, The Washington Post said, \\"Delgaudio has become a leader in the nation's anti-gay rights movement\\". A 2003 book called him \\"one of the key leaders\\" in the conservative view of \\"moral health\\". Anti-gay and other political actions Delgaudio was a board member of the youth group Young Americans for Freedom. His group, Public Advocate of the United States, which he has lead since its founding, was designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in March 2012. In addition to his activities through the Public Advocate group, Delgaudio has a history of individual public actions, against gay rights, against immigrants, and for other conservative causes. His protests outside the U.S. Supreme Court and U.S. Capitol included a \\"Perverts for Cellucci\\" rally opposing the nomination of Paul Celucci as ambassador to Canada, a man-donkey wedding to support the Federal Marriage Amendment, and a \\"Kennedy Sobriety Checkpoint\\" to draw attention to Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy's (D-RI) car accident. In October 2005, Delgaudio appeared on Fox News, opposing the Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers, suggesting Ann Coulter instead. In 2007, Delgaudio has asked Muslims if they \\"come in peace\\" and whether they pledge allegiance to the United States. Delgaudio attracted media attention in February 2010 when he claimed that the Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa, Florida, was being infiltrated by \\"radical homosexuals\\" seeking to exploit unsuspecting college students. Delgaudio has made numerous public claims regarding the policy of Transportation Security Administration full-body airport security scans. In November 2010 he wrote, \\"It's the federal employee's version of the Gay Bill of Special Rights ... That means the next TSA official that gives you an 'enhanced pat down' could be a practicing homosexual secretly getting pleasure from your submission.\\" Loudoun Board of Supervisors  Delgaudio was first elected to the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in 1999, running unopposed, and was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2011. In his November 2015 re-election bid, he was defeated by Koran Saines. = Positions on county issues = Delgaudio was an outspoken critic on the board of anti-growth groups (consisting mostly of large estate owners in the western half of the county) and an advocate of homebuilders in Loudoun. Delgaudio also has been opposed to expanding government services to undocumented immigrants as well as the school budget on nonessential programs. With regard to social justice issues, he has repeatedly expressed vehement opposition toward expanding marital rights to include same-sex partnerships. In August 2007, Delgaudio introduced a resolution asking the county administrator to determine which county services could be denied to undocumented immigrants. He has proposed that alternatives to anti-bullying programs be used in Loudoun County schools. = Investigation = In September 2012, a former county aide to Delgaudio, Donna Mateer, accused him of instructing her to fund raise for Public Advocate while on company time. When asked about the allegations, Delgaudio said that while it was true that his employees were asked to spend up to 60 percent of their time on fundraising, the fundraising activities were to benefit a local boys' football league. On October 3, 2012, the Board of Supervisors voted to begin an independent investigation of the allegations made against Delgaudio in the Post article. Delgaudio spoke before the board prior to the vote, saying, \\"The suicide bombers of the political left pull their own rings on their detonation devices as they advance on me, and Sterling, and all honest-to-God conservatives... I stand as a small David against the foul-smelling, decaying corpse of the Washington Post.\\" On November 8, 2012, at the request of Loudoun Commonwealth's Attorney Jim Plowman, a special prosecutor was appointed by the Loudoun County Circuit Court to investigate Mateer's complaint. On June 24, 2013, a grand jury declined to support an indictment, noting that the alleged behavior occurred outside the one-year statute of limitations. They recommended changes to County laws. On July 17, 2013, the all-Republican Loudoun County Board of Supervisors voted 8-1 to censure Delgaudio and make permanent earlier committee assignment removals. The Board also voted 6-3 to take away Delgaudio's staff aides and defund the Sterling District office. Earlier that day, Delgaudio had unsuccessfully petitioned the Loudoun County Circuit Court to prevent the Board from taking action. Post-Board of Supervisors politics After losing his bid for re-election in November 2015, Delgaudio began campaigning to become a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention, supporting Donald Trump for President of the United States. He was instead selected as an alternate.10th District selects Cruz delegates for GOP convention, Loudoun Now, April 18, 2016. Retrieved February 12, 2018. At the convention, he grabbed the spotlight when he \\"clucked like a chicken\\" referring to the unwillingness of losing candidate Ted Cruz, to endorse nominee Donald Trump. \\"He needed to toughen up like every other Republican loser of any nomination battle in the last 100 (sic) years since Abraham Lincoln and just suck it up, be a man and back the nominee that he was beaten by, fair and square.\\"Why Ted Cruz was booed at the Republican convention, Christian Science Monitor, Thomas Beaumont and Steve Peoples (AP), July 21, 2016.

Biography Chilton was born on 27 September 1860 at Little Marstone, Pencombe (near Leominster, Herefordshire, England) but emigrated with his family to New Zealand in 1862. They settled on a farm at East Eyreton, North Canterbury. He was troubled by his hips from an early age, and had his left leg amputated, using an artificial leg and a crutch thereafter. He entered Canterbury College in 1875 as an unmatriculated student, and matriculated three years later. In 1881, he gained a Master of Art with first class honours, having been taught by Frederick Hutton, who inspired him to take up biology, especially the study of crustaceans, which had been little studied in New Zealand up to that time. Chilton's first scientific publication followed that same year, when he described three new species of crustacean (two crabs and one isopod) from Lyttelton Harbour and Lake Pupuke. He surprised the scientific world later that year by describing four species of amphipod and isopod from groundwaters at the family farm in Eyreton. He went on to discover the isopod Phreatoicus typicus in the same location, the first example ever described of the suborder Phreatoicidea, the \\"earliest derived isopod[s]\\". Chilton gained the first BSc degree from the University of New Zealand in 1887, and married in 1888. In 1893, he gained the first D.Sc. awarded in New Zealand, but in 1895, the family moved to Edinburgh, where Chilton studied medicine in an attempt to improve his career. He specialised in ophthalmic surgery, working at The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, before travelling to study at Heidelberg, Vienna and London in 1900. In 1901, he returned to New Zealand and in 1903 took on the Chair of Biology at the University of Canterbury. From 1904 to 1911, the Chilton family lived at Llanmaes, a house built by Francis Petre in central Christchurch. In 1907 Chilton was selected to be a member of the 1907 Sub- Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition. The main aim of the expedition was to extend the magnetic survey of New Zealand by investigating Auckland and Campbell Islands but botanical, biological and zoological surveys were also conducted. The voyage also resulted in rescue of the castaways of the shipwreck the Dundonald in the Auckland Islands. Chilton was the editor of the subsequent scientific reports resulting from the expedition. Charles Chilton and students at Cass Field Station, 1920 Chilton was instrumental in establishing the Cass Field Station (formerly Canterbury College Mountain Biological Station), the building of which was completed in 1914. In 1915, Frank Chilton, the couple's only child, a second-year medical student and a lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was killed in the Battle of Gallipoli. Charles Chilton became rector of Canterbury University College in 1921, the first time such a post had been granted in Australia or New Zealand. He was a member of the Board of Governors of Canterbury Agricultural College in Lincoln (now Lincoln University), and chairman of the Board in 1927. Chilton died on 25 October 1929 of a sudden attack of pneumonia, before he could collect his life's work into a single monograph. He had published 130 papers on crustaceans, mostly amphipods, isopods and decapods, from all around the world, but especially from New Zealand, subterranean and sub-Antarctic waters.

It is part of a worldwide effort to directly detect gravitational waves. Note that these are a major prediction of the general theory of relativity and are not to be confused with gravity waves, a phenomenon studied in fluid mechanics. It is operated by the Australian International Gravitational Research Centre (AIGRC) through the University of Western Australia under the auspices of the Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy (ACIGA). The current aim of the facility is to develop advanced techniques for improving the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO. A study of operational interferometric gravitational wave detectors shows that AIGO is situated in almost the ideal location to complement existing detectors in the Northern hemisphere. Current facilities Current facilities (AIGO Stage I) consist of an L-shaped ultra high vacuum system, measuring 80 m on each side forming an interferometer for detecting gravitational waves. LIGO-Australia LIGO-Australia was a proposed plan (AIGO Stage II) to install an Advanced LIGO interferometer at AIGO, forming a triangle of three Advanced LIGO detectors.Reaching Still Higher by Going Down Under: the LIGO-Australia Concept, by Dave Beckett, 10/11/2010, LIGO Laboratory News. It was to consist of an L-shaped interferometer, measuring 5 km on each side, with vacuum pipes about 700 mm in diameter. A 2010 developmental roadmap issued by the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC) for the field of gravitational-wave astronomy recommended that an expansion of the global array of interferometric detectors be pursued as a highest priority. In its roadmap, GWIC identified the Southern Hemisphere as one of the key locations in which a gravitational-wave interferometer could most effectively complement existing detectors. The AIGO facility in Western Australia was well-located to work with the existing and planned components of the global network, and already possessed an active gravitational-wave community. The LIGO-Australia plan was approved by LIGO's US funding agency, the National Science Foundation, contingent on the understanding that it involved no increase in LIGO's total budget. The cost of building, operating and staffing the interferometer would have rested entirely with the Australian government.http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;329/5995/1003, article from Science magazine, 27 August 2010. After a year-long effort, the LIGO Laboratory reluctantly acknowledged that the proposed relocation of an Advanced LIGO detector to Australia was not to occur. The Australian government had committed itself to a balanced budget and this precluded any new starts in science. The deadline for a response from Australia passed on 1 October 2011. The proposal was then moved to India, where the Indian Initiative in Gravitational-wave Observations obtained government support and is constructing LIGO-India. India is not quite as good a location as Australia, but provides most of the benefit. Co-located Facilities AIGO is on the same grounds as the Gravity Discovery Centre and the GDC Observatory, of which are educational and instructional facilities open to the general public. It is also the site of the Geoscience Australia Gingin Magnetic Observatory, one of a network of nine for monitoring the Earth's magnetic field.

All types of educative approaches are not ethical for youth work, examples for unethical forms of education are indoctrinating, inculcating, and brainwashing. Youth workers can work in many contexts and according to the roles they are known as enablers, facilitators, emancipators, animators or could be known by the set of activities they use to reach out to youth. The validity of youth work approaches are based on whether they are educational, participative, empowering, promotes equality of opportunities, etc. The basic principles of youth work are respecting young people, providing accessible and value oriented opportunities (genuinely useful) for voluntary participation, accountability, being anti-oppressive (e.g. social model of disability, unconscious bias training) in processes, confidentiality, reliability, trustworthiness, and being ethical in keeping boundaries. In the UK and elsewhere, the main distinction is usually made between statutory, those who work as part of a government run initiative, and non-statutory, those that work in any other context. See the article Youth work for a full explanation, and the article History of youth work for a brief time line. In some circumstances, the term should be carefully distinguished from Child and Youth Worker which refers to therapeutic work in the USA and Canada. Tasks and duties of direct youth work practice Engaging youth in participation and aiding youth in locating self is an important aspect of youth work practice. A youth worker needs to identify an \\"opening\\" for practice and be willing to make that opening into an \\"opportunity\\" by find resources to meet the needs of the work through various stakeholders. When the needs are met an \\"obligation\\" should be made to delivering the services and enabling participation of youth at a specific level, this obligation then becomes a part of the macro-system of services. Through participation the youth should be able to locate themselves, their strengths and limitations. Through participation the youth would be able to learn the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values that they have through the relational experience and reflective observation, this leads them to further their growth opportunities. Main tasks and duties of direct practice's are: * Establish contact and build relationships. * Bring contacted youths together in groups/ open events and shared activities. * Enable participation of youth in activity planning (e.g. sports, arts, outdoors, etc.), project developing (community, educational, etc.), evaluation and review of activities. * Address, advocate, and educate about youth issues, influences, and interests. * Provide guidance (in locating self and growth opportunities), instruction (teaching & directing), personal & social education, mentoring and support. * Collaborative development of community resources, facilities, and services. * Manage and develop community programs and resources of an organization. Functions of youth work Merton, et al. in 2004 through a research report delineated the following as primary functions of youth work. * Integrative: It is concerned with socialization of youth and introducing them to norms and expectations of society for directing them to social fitness, this has a preparation to adult world function. * Reflexive: It is concerned with ensuring inclusion of youth perspectives in social institutions, this has an anti-oppressive function. * Redistributive: It is concerned with ensuring social justice to youth and developing social capital for youth empowerment.

It was carried out by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam (also known as Kalaivani Rajaratnam or Dhanu), a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). At the time, India had just ended its involvement, through the Indian Peace Keeping Force, in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Subsequent accusations of conspiracy have been addressed by two commissions of inquiry and have brought down at least one national government. Assassination Known as the \\"Path of Light\\", this was the path that Gandhi took before being assassinated Rajiv Gandhi was campaigning for the upcoming elections in southern states of India. On 21 May, after campaigning in Visakhapatnam, his next stop was Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. About two hours after arriving in Madras (now Chennai), Rajiv Gandhi was driven by motorcade in a white Ambassador car to Sriperumbudur, stopping along the way at a few other election campaigning venues.\\"Assassination in India; Rajiv Gandhi is assassinated in bombing at campaign stop\\", by Barbara Crossette, The New York Times, 22 May 1991.

Along the way, he was garlanded by many well-wishers, Congress party workers and school children. The assassin, Dhanu (Thenmozhi Rajaratnam), approached and greeted him. She then bent down to touch his feet and detonated an RDX explosive-laden belt tucked below her dress at exactly 10:10 PM.

Gandhi also defended the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord in the same interview. The LTTE decision to kill him was perhaps aimed at preventing him from coming to power again. Thereafter, the Justice J S Verma Commission was formed to look into the security lapses that contributed to the killing. The final report, submitted in June 1992, concluded that the security arrangements for the former PM were adequate but that the local Congress party leaders disrupted and broke these arrangements. The Narasimha Rao government initially rejected Verma's findings but later accepted it under pressure. However, no action was taken on the recommendations of the commission. Despite no action, the findings raised vital questions that have previously been consistently raised by political analysts. Sources have indicated that Gandhi was repeatedly informed that there was a threat to his life and that he should not travel to Tamil Nadu. In fact, the then governor of Tamil Nadu Bhism Narayan Singh, broke official protocol and twice warned Gandhi about the threat to his life if he visited the state. Dr Subramanian Swamy said in his book, Sri Lanka in Crisis: India's Options (2007), that an LTTE delegation had met Rajiv Gandhi on 5 March 1991. Another delegation met him around 14 March 1991 in New Delhi. Journalist Ram Bahadur Rai wrote that: > The message conveyed to Rajiv Gandhi by both these delegations was that > there was no threat to his life and that he can travel to Tamil Nadu without > fearing for his life. I did a series of articles after his assassination > that pointed out how, after these meetings, Rajiv became complacent about > his security and broke security rules in more than 40 rallies. Funeral Following his assassination, Rajiv Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to New Delhi. From the Palam airport, his body was sent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for an autopsy, reconstruction and embalming. A state funeral was held for Rajiv Gandhi on 24 May 1991. His funeral was broadcast live nationally and internationally, and was attended by dignitaries from over 60 countries. He was cremated on the banks of the river Yamuna, near the cremation spot of his mother, brother and grandfather. Today, the site where he was cremated is known as Veerbhumi. Investigation Immediately after the assassination, the Chandrasekhar government handed the investigation over to the CBI on 22 May 1991. The agency created a Special Investigation Team (SIT) under D. R. Karthikeyan to determine who was responsible for the assassination. The SIT probe confirmed the role of the LTTE in the assassination, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of India. The interim report of Justice Milap Chand Jain, looking into the conspiracy angle to the assassination, indicted the DMK for colluding with the LTTE. The report concluded that the DMK had provided sanctuary to the LTTE, which made it easier for the rebels to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi. The Commission report stated that the year 1989 signified \\"the perpetuation of the general political trend of indulging the Tamil militants on Indian soil and tolerance of their wide-ranging criminal and anti-national activities\\". The report also alleged that LTTE leaders in Jaffna were in possession of sensitive coded messages exchanged between the Union government and the state government of DMK. \\"There is evidence to show that, during this period, some of the most vital wireless messages were passed between the LTTE operatives based in Tamil Nadu and Jaffna. These messages, which were decoded later, are directly related to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi\\", the report stated. The Congress subsequently brought down the United Front (UF) government of I K Gujral after the report was leaked in November 1998. The party also demanded the removal of DMK from the UF government, arguing that it had played a key role in the death of Rajiv Gandhi. Perpetrator Thenmozhi Rajaratnam The assassination was carried out by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu, also known as Kalaivani Rajaratnam. She was a member of the Sri Lankan Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers). Thenmozhi was the daughter of a Sri Lankan Tamil man named Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam had predeceased Thenmozhi by sixteen years. Thenmozhi was survived by her mother, brother Sivavarman and two sisters. Thenmozhi was 17 years old when she carried out the assassination. Court convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, the seven persons who facilitated the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. They are currently undergoing life imprisonment in prisons in India. Their respective names are given below. Santhan alias T. Suthenthiraraja - a Sri Lankan national. Nalini - an Indian citizen. Nalini is the wife of Murugan (alias Sriharan). Murugan alias Sriharan - a Sri Lankan national. A.G. Perarivalan Robert Pious - a Sri Lankan national. Jayakumar - the brother in law of Robert Pious. Ravichandran - a Sri Lankan national.https://www.firstpost.com/india/rajiv- gandhi-murder-who-are-the-7-convicts-the-tn-govt-wants-to-free-1398193.html Supreme Court judgment As per the Supreme Court of India judgment, by Judge K. T. Thomas, the killing was carried out due to personal animosity of the LTTE chief Prabhakaran towards Rajiv Gandhi. Additionally, the Rajiv Gandhi administration had antagonised other Tamil militant organisations like PLOTE for reversing the military coup in Maldives back in 1988. The judgement further cites the death of Thileepan in a hunger strike and the suicide by 12 LTTE cadres in a vessel in October 1987. The judgment while convicting the accused, four of them to death and others to various jail terms, states that absolutely no evidence existed that any one of the conspirators ever desired the death of any Indian other than Rajiv Gandhi, though several people were killed. Judge Wadhwa further states there is nothing on record to show that the intention to kill Rajiv Gandhi was to overawe the Government. Hence it was held that it was not a terrorist act under TADA (Act). Judge Thomas further states that conspiracy was hatched in stages commencing from 1987 and that it spanned several years. The Special Investigation team of India's premier special investigation agency CBI was not able to pinpoint when the decision to kill Rajiv Gandhi was taken. Trial The trial was conducted under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA). On 28 January 1998, the designated TADA court in Chennai gave death sentences to all the 26 accused. This created a storm in India. Legal experts were divided. Human rights groups protested that the trial did not meet the standards of a free trial.India: The Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Past abuses revisited  Amnesty International The trial was held behind closed doors, in camera, and the identity of witnesses was not disclosed. Ms A. Athirai, an accused, was 17 years old when she was arrested. Under the TADA an accused can appeal only to the Supreme Court. Appeal to the High Court is not allowed as in normal law. Confessions given by the accused to the Superintendent of Police are taken as evidence against the accused under TADA. Under TADA the accused could be convicted on the basis of evidence that would have been insufficient for conviction by an ordinary court under normal Indian law. In the Rajiv Gandhi case, confessions by the accused formed a major part of the evidence in the judgement against them which they later claimed was taken under duress. On appeal to the Supreme Court, only four of the accused were sentenced to death and the others to various jail terms. S Nalini Sriharan is the lone surviving member of the five-member squad behind the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and is serving life imprisonment. Arrested on 14 June 1991, she was sentenced to death, along with the other 25 accused. However, the court confirmed that the death sentence was given to only four of the convicts, including Nalini, on 11 May 1999. Nalini, who is the wife of an LTTE operative known as V Sriharan alias Murugan, another convict in the case who had been sentenced to death, later gave birth to a girl, Harithra Murugan in prison. Upon the intervention of Rajiv Gandhi's widow and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who petitioned for clemency for the sake of Nalini's daughter in 2000, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Nalini was treated as a class 'A' convict from 10 September 1999 till the privilege was withdrawn in May 2010 after a mobile phone was allegedly recovered from her cell during a surprise check. She \\"regrets\\" the killing of the former Prime Minister and claims that the real conspirators have not been booked yet. The President of India rejected the clemency pleas of Murugan and two others on death row, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan and A G Perarivalan alias Arivu in August 2011. The execution of the three convicts was scheduled for 9 September 2011. However, the Madras High Court intervened and stayed their execution for eight weeks based on their petitions. Nalini was shifted back to Vellore prison from Puzhal prison amidst tight security on 7 September 2011. In 2010, Nalini had moved the Madras High Court seeking release as she had served more than 20 years in prison. She argued that even life convicts were released after 14 years. However, the state government rejected her request. Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan, the three convicts condemned to death, claimed that they were not ordinary criminals but political prisoners. Controversies In a report published on 30 October 2012 in DNA, K Ragothaman, former chief investigator of the CBI, talks about his new book Conspiracy to Kill Rajiv Gandhi: From the CBI Files and tells the reporter that while the CBI had started a preliminary inquiry in which MK Narayanan, former West Bengal Governor and former Intelligence Bureau director, was named a suspect in hiding evidence, the case was buried by the CBI SIT Chief, D.R. Karthikeyan. In an interview in 2017, Justice K.T. Thomas had said that \\"there were serious flaws\\" in the CBI's investigation in case, particularly related to the seizure of Rs 40 lakh in cash from the convicts, which led him to believe that the probe exposed \\"an unpardonable flaw\\" in the \\"Indian criminal justice system\\". Jain Commission and other reports In the Jain report, various people and agencies are named as suspected of having been involved in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. Among them, the cleric Chandraswami was suspected of involvement, including financing the assassination.outlookindia.com One of the accused, Ranganath, said Chandraswami was the godfather who financed the killing. Sikh Militants were also suspected.Jain Commission Report Chapter Ii Jain Commission Report Chapter Viii The interim report of the Jain Commission created a storm when it accused M.

The Northern Railway arrived at Cue from Mullewa, a distance of , in 1894. In 1895 the Day Dawn Associated Gold mine, Kinsella, Trenton and the Day Dawn South mine were all operating ten head stamp mills close to the town for processing ore. An important strike was staged there for nine weeks in 1899 when local miners protested against the use of Italian immigrant contract workers and Great Fingall's attempt to reduce miners' wages by five shillings per week. Great Fingall Consolidated Gold Mining Company operated the mine from 1898 until 1918, when it was closed. By October 1921, shorings at the abandoned mine, which had been known as the 'Great Fingall mine', had collapsed and the town had disappeared altogether by the 1930s. All of the town's buildings are now in ruins with the exception of the Great Fingall Mine office, which is on state and federal heritage registers. Various mining companies have operated the mine from the early 1990s using the open cut method and by reprocessing the tailings from past activities at the Big Bell gold processing plant. The last owners, Harmony Mining, have recently halted production and have sold the mine to Monarch Gold along with the Big Bell Mine and the Hill 50 Gold Mine at Mount Magnet.

Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n (È†ÜÂ§©, Heaven's Will) was the mythical sword of the Vietnamese King L√™ L·ª£i, who liberated Vietnam from Ming occupation after ten years of fighting from 1418 until 1428.Th·∫ø D≈©ng H√†n L√™ L·ª£i: ti·ªÉu thuy·∫øt l·ªãch s·ª≠ 2002 Page 17 \\"ƒê·ªá nh√¨n k·ªπ th√¨ nh·∫≠n ra ƒë√≥ l√† l∆∞·ª°i ki·∫øm, hai ch·ªØ Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n n·ªïi l√™n m√†u v√†ng r·ª±c r·ª°.\\" L√™ L·ª£i then proclaimed himself king of the newly established L√™ Dynasty. According to legend, the sword possessed magical power, which supposedly made L√™ L·ª£i grow very tall. When he used the sword it gave him the strength of a thousand men, and the legend is often used to justify L√™ L·ª£i's rule over Vietnam. The sword has been associated with L√™ L·ª£i since the early phase of the L√™ Dynasty. Name The Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n sword was used to affirm the legitimacy of L√™ L·ª£i as the Vietnamese leader in the revolution against the Ming occupation and associated with L√™ L·ª£i the rightful sovereignty of Vietnam. In Vietnam, the legitimacy of the monarch is known as the mandate of heaven. Legend A 14th century single edged curved blade called \\"g∆∞∆°m\\"- Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n may belong to this class of sword L√™ L·ª£i revolted in 1418 against the Ming Dynasty, who had invaded and occupied Vietnam in 1407. Initially the military campaign against the Chinese was only moderately successful. While L√™ L·ª£i was able to operate in his home province of Thanh H√≥a, for the first 2‚Äì3 years, he was unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the Ming army in battle. As a result, he waged a guerrilla campaign against the large and well organized Chinese army. According to legend, to help L√™ L·ª£i, a local God, the Dragon King (Vietnamese: Long V∆∞∆°ng) decided to lend his sword to L√™ L·ª£i. But there was a catch; the sword did not come straight to him in one piece. It was split into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh H√≥a province, there was a fisherman named L√™ Th·∫≠n, who was not related to L√™ L·ª£i in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something heavy. Thinking of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and not knowing what to do with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, L√™ Th·∫≠n joined the rebel army of L√™ L·ª£i, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited L√™ Th·∫≠n's home. L√™ Th·∫≠n's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of L√™ L·ª£i, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. L√™ L·ª£i held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n (Will of Heaven). With L√™ Th·∫≠n's endorsement, L√™ L·ª£i took the blade with him. One day, while on the run from the enemy, L√™ L·ª£i saw a strange light emanating from the branches of a banyan tree. He climbed up and there he found a hilt of a sword, encrusted with precious gems. Remembering the blade he found earlier, he took it out and placed it into the hilt. The fit was perfect. Believing that the Heaven had entrusted him with the great cause of freeing the land, L√™ L·ª£i took up arms and rallied people under his banner. For the next few years, the magic sword brought him victory after another. His men no longer had to hide in the forest, but aggressively penetrated many enemy camps, captured them and seized their granaries. The sword helped them push back the enemy, until Vietnam was once again free from Chinese rule. L√™ L·ª£i ascended the throne in 1428, ending his 10-year campaign, and reclaimed independence for the country. A statue of L√™ L·ª£i and his sword in Thanh H√≥a, Vietnam One year after ascending the throne, L√™ L·ª£i was on a dragon boat cruising around H·ªì L·ª•c Th·ªßy (Green Water Lake), directly in front of his palace. When they came to the middle of the lake, a giant turtle with a golden shell (Kim Qui) emerged from under the water surface. L√™ L·ª£i ordered the captain to slow down, and at the same time looked down to see that the magic sword on his belt was moving on its own. The golden turtle advanced toward the boat and the king, then with a human voice, it asked him to return the magic sword to his master, Long V∆∞∆°ng (Dragon King), who lived under the water. It suddenly became clear to L√™ L·ª£i that the sword was only lent to him to carry out his duty, but now it must be returned to its rightful owner, lest it corrupt him. L√™ L·ª£i drew the sword out of its scabbard and lobbed it towards the turtle. With great speed, the turtle opened its mouth and snatched the sword from the air with its teeth. It descended back into the water, with the shiny sword in its mouth, and for a long period a flickering light was said to have been seen from beyond the muddled depths of the lake. From then on, people renamed that lake to H·ªì G∆∞∆°m (Sword Lake) or H·ªì Ho√†n Ki·∫øm (Lake of the Returned Sword). Historical analysis  A few historians believe that the Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n sword was an expedient of L√™ L·ª£i's strategist Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i, regarding it as a ploy to gain legitimacy for L√™ L·ª£i to lead an uprising against the Chinese. The expedient was successful, as the sword's legend quickly spread across the country, leading the populace to regard L√™ L·ª£i as the rightful ruler of Vietnam, especially among those with high levels of antipathy towards the Chinese, who were longstanding historical enemies of Vietnam.

Carter would later claim his father had been in the British Consular Service (his father was the British Honorary Consul). Carter grew up in the United Kingdom, and enlisted in the Royal Air Force at the age of 15, serving with the RAF's Coast Patrol for eighteen months. He attended Tonbridge School from 1918 to 1921, and would later claim to have attended Christ's College in Cambridge. He arrived in the United States on September 25, 1921, after his father was assigned to Mexico. Career Carter worked at the Philadelphia Daily News as a journalist. He entered broadcasting as a news commentator with WCAU in Philadelphia in 1930, initially as the announcer for a rugby game, getting the job by default as he was the only person WCAU's director knew who was familiar with the sport. In 1931, he became the narrator for Hearst- Metrotone newsreels. He rose to fame as a broadcast journalist when he covered the Lindbergh kidnapping trial, beginning in 1932. He continued to work for WCAU, with his broadcasts distributed through the CBS network. After achieving fame, he was a familiar radio voice, but his commentaries were controversial, notably his criticisms of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and the powerful Congress of Industrial Organizations. Carter was an accomplished salesman for the sponsor of his program from 1933-1938, Philco Radios, blending his reporting and commentary with plugs for the company's sets. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1934.U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791‚Äì1992 (Indexed in World Archives Project) In 1936, he had more listeners than any other radio commentator. He also appeared in a Life advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes. He published several books in the 1930s, and began writing a widely syndicated column (by the Ledger Syndicate) in 1937. But by 1937, the Roosevelt White House already had three federal agencies investigating him. In 1938, under pressure from Roosevelt's allies, he lost his WCAU job, was barred from CBS, and lost his General Foods sponsorship that had replaced Philco. With his removal, there was no longer any popular radio commentator who opposed Roosevelt's foreign policy. That year, Carter went on a speaking tour throughout the States. In 1939, he returned to radio with a thrice-weekly evening commentary on the Mutual Broadcasting System, adopting a pro-Roosevelt stance. Mutual gradually moved his broadcasts to less prominent time slots.https://www.nbcnews.com/id/6243014/ns/msnbc- countdown_with_keith_olbermann/?#041015 A newspaper article by Carter, published in The Cleveland News on March 25th, 1939, claimed that \\"responsible statesmen of the world do not expect the recent events in Europe [e.g., the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland by Nazi Germany] of themselves will produce a general European war .... despite all the scare headlines in America from day to day.\\" He may have been right about those statesmen's expectations, but he (and they) were horribly wrong. In the early 1940s, Carter was drawn into a 'British Israelite' cult led by a Moses Guibbory.

Several other acquisitions followed in 2002 and 2003. the firm recognized a trend with corporate customers outsourcing all aspects of an employee relocation to relocation service providers, including household goods relocation. As a result, the firm acquired the relocation services businesses of Cooperative Resource Services (CRS) in May 2002. Another relocation services provider acquisition, Rowan Simmons in the UK, followed later that year. The firm opened an office in Hong Kong in 2003 and acquired another relocation services provider, PRS Europe of Belgium, in 2003. SIRVA is unique in the industry in that it contains both relocation companies and moving companies under its aegis; its main competitors are one or the other. On February 11, 2002 Allied Worldwide was renamed to SIRVA, Inc. The company announced its initial public offering, and its common shares became listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"SIR\\". During its first year as a public company in 2003, it reported operations in 40 countries with over 7,700 employees. Its network of service providers operated in 175 countries. It had revenue of $2.35 billion and assets of $1.55 billion. It provided services to 38% of the Fortune 500 companies, among 2,500 corporate clients worldwide. It had 760 moving agents; these agents had a fleet size of 7,800 vehicles.SIRVA 2003 Annual Report-SEC Form 10K During February 2008, the company entered bankruptcy and re- organized, emerging in May 2008 as a private company. During 2011, the firm acquired Peninsular Properties in Hong Kong, a real estate company providing a full range of destination services. During 2012, it acquired Concept Mobility Services, a S√£o Paulo, Brazil-based relocation and move management company. During 2013, it opened an office in Doha, Qatar under the brand Allied Pickfords.SIRVA Website-News & Events-Retrieved February 2014 History of SIRVA brands =Allied and North American Van Lines= SIRVA, Inc. is a combination of businesses with a long history. Allied Van Lines (AVL) was founded in 1928 and North American Van Lines (NAVL) was founded in 1933. Beginning in late 1964, NAVL created its STI (Specialized Transportation Inc.)High Value Products Division (HVPD), which later was bought out from SIRVA and taken private as an independent company named Specialized Transportation Inc. On November 21, 1999, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice also completed their acquisition of Allied Van Lines and merged it with North American Van Lines to create 'Allied Worldwide, although each former company maintained its own profile names. Valued at approximately US$450 million in the merger, the combined entity became the world's largest relocation and van line logistics company. =Other events= On October 11, 2004, a group of 43 North American Van Lines' agents, named the Specialized Transportation Agent Group Inc., purchased NAVL's High Value Products Division from SIRVA. The buyers renamed the new company Specialized Transportation Inc. (STI). On August 1, 2005, SIRVA sold its warehouse operation business to Lake Capital, a banking company. The business was named NAL Worldwide, a limited liability company in order to be a familiar sound to previous customers and anyone familiar with the old North American Logistics. NAL is chiefly involved in warehousing operations and logistics.

They combine features of the finite element and the finite volume framework and have been successfully applied to hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic and mixed form problems arising from a wide range of applications. DG methods have in particular received considerable interest for problems with a dominant first- order part, e.g. in electrodynamics, fluid mechanics and plasma physics. Discontinuous Galerkin methods were first proposed and analyzed in the early 1970s as a technique to numerically solve partial differential equations. In 1973 Reed and Hill introduced a DG method to solve the hyperbolic neutron transport equation. The origin of the DG method for elliptic problems cannot be traced back to a single publication as features such as jump penalization in the modern sense were developed gradually. However, among the early influential contributors were Babu≈°ka, J.-L. Lions, Joachim Nitsche and Milo≈° Zl√°mal. DG methods for elliptic problems were already developed in a paper by Garth Baker in the setting of 4th order equations in 1977. A more complete account of the historical development and an introduction to DG methods for elliptic problems is given in a publication by Arnold, Brezzi, Cockburn and Marini. A number of research directions and challenges on DG methods are collected in the proceedings volume edited by Cockburn, Karniadakis and Shu. Overview Much like the continuous Galerkin (CG) method, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a finite element method formulated relative to a weak formulation of a particular model system. Unlike traditional CG methods that are conforming, the DG method works over a trial space of functions that are only piecewise continuous, and thus often comprise more inclusive function spaces than the finite-dimensional inner product subspaces utilized in conforming methods. As an example, consider the continuity equation for a scalar unknown rho in a spatial domain Omega without \\"sources\\" or \\"sinks\\" : : frac{partial rho} {partial t} + abla cdot mathbf{J} = 0, where mathbf{J} is the flux of rho. Now consider the finite-dimensional space of discontinuous piecewise polynomial functions over the spatial domain Omega restricted to a discrete triangulation Omega_h , written as : S_h^p(Omega_h)={v_{Omega_{e_i}}in P^p(Omega_{e_i}),   forallOmega_{e_i}in Omega_h} for P^p(Omega_{e_i}) the space of polynomials with degrees less than or equal to p over element Omega_{e_i} indexed by i. Then for finite element shape functions N_jin P^p the solution is represented by :rho_h^i = sum_{j=1}^{text{dofs}} rho_j^i (t)N_j^i (boldsymbol{x}), quad forall boldsymbol{x} in Omega_{e_i}. Then similarly choosing a test function :varphi_h^i(boldsymbol{x})=sum_{j=1}^{text{dofs}} varphi_j^i N_j^i(boldsymbol{x}), quad forall boldsymbol{x}inOmega_{e_i}, multiplying the continuity equation by varphi_h^i and integrating by parts in space, the semidiscrete DG formulation becomes: : frac{d}{dt}int_{Omega_{e_i}}rho_h^ivarphi_h^i , dboldsymbol{x} + int_{partialOmega_{e_{i}}} varphi_h^i mathbf{J}_h cdotboldsymbol{n} , dboldsymbol{x} = int_{Omega_{e_i}}mathbf{J}_hcdot ablavarphi_h^i , dboldsymbol{x}.  Scalar hyperbolic conservation law  A scalar hyperbolic conservation law is of the form : begin{align} partial_t u + partial_x f(u) &= 0 quad text{for} quad t>0,, xin R  u(0,x) &= u_0(x),, end{align} where one tries to solve for the unknown scalar function u equiv u(t,x) , and the functions f,u_0 are typically given. = Space discretization = The x -space will be discretized as : R = bigcup_k I_k ,, quad I_k := left( x_k, x_{k+1} right) quad text{for} quad x_k Furthermore, we need the following definitions : h_k :=  I_k  ,, quad h := sup_k h_k ,, quad hat{x}_k := x_k + frac{h_k}{2},. = Basis for function space = We derive the basis representation for the function space of our solution u . The function space is defined as : S_h^p := leftlbrace v in L^2(R) : vBig_{I_k} in Pi_p rightrbrace quad text{for} quad p in N_0 ,, where {v}_{I_k} denotes the restriction of v onto the interval I_k , and Pi_p denotes the space of polynomials of maximal degree p . The index h should show the relation to an underlying discretization given by left(x_kright)_k . Note here that v is not uniquely defined at the intersection points (x_k)_k . At first we make use of a specific polynomial basis on the interval [-1,1] , the Legendre polynomials (P_n)_{ninN_0} , i.e., : P_0(x) = 1 ,,quad P_1(x)=x ,,quad P_2(x) = frac{1}{2} (3x^2-1) ,,quad dots Note especially the orthogonality relations : leftlangle P_i,P_j rightrangle_{L^2([-1,1])} = frac{2}{2i+1} delta_{ij} quad forall , i,j in N_0 ,. Transformation onto the interval [0,1] , and normalization is achieved by functions (varphi_i)_i : varphi_i (x) := sqrt{2i+1} P_i(2x-1) quad text{for} quad xin [0,1],, which fulfill the orthonormality relation : leftlangle varphi_i,varphi_j rightrangle_{L^2([0,1])} = delta_{ij} quad forall , i,j in N_0 ,. Transformation onto an interval I_k is given by left( bar{varphi}_{ki}right)_i : bar{varphi}_{ki} := frac{1}{sqrt{h_k}} varphi_i left( frac{x-x_k}{h_k} right) quad text{for} quad xin I_k,, which fulfill : leftlangle bar{varphi}_{ki},bar{varphi}_{kj} rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} = delta_{ij} quad forall , i,j in N_0 forall , k ,. For L^infty -normalization we define varphi_{ki}:= sqrt{h_k} bar{varphi}_{ki} , and for L^1 -normalization we define tilde{varphi}_{ki}:= frac{1}{sqrt{h_k}} bar{varphi}_{ki} , s.t. :  varphi_{ki} _{L^infty (I_k) } =  varphi_i _{L^infty ([0,1]) } =: c_{i,infty} quad text{and} quad  tilde{varphi}_{ki} _{L^1 (I_k) } =  varphi_i _{L^1 ([0,1]) } =: c_{i,1} ,. Finally, we can define the basis representation of our solutions u_h : begin{align} u_h(t,x) :=& sum_{i=0}^p u_{ki}(t) varphi_{ki} (x) quad text{for} quad x in (x_k,x_{k+1})  u_{ki} (t) =& leftlangle u_h(t, cdot ),tilde{varphi}_{ki} rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} ,. end{align} Note here, that u_h is not defined at the interface positions. Besides, prism bases are employed for planar-like structures, and are capable for 2-D/3-D hybridation. = DG-scheme = The conservation law is transformed into its weak form by multiplying with test functions, and integration over test intervals : begin{align} partial_t u + partial_x f(u) &= 0  Rightarrow quad leftlangle partial_t u , v rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} + leftlangle partial_x f(u) , v rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} &= 0 quad text{for} quad forall , v in S_h^p  Leftrightarrow quad leftlangle partial_t u , tilde{varphi}_{ki} rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} + leftlangle partial_x f(u) , tilde{varphi}_{ki} rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} &= 0 quad text{for} quad forall , k ; forall, i leq p ,. end{align} By using partial integration one is left with : begin{align} frac{mathrm d}{mathrm d t} u_{ki}(t) + f(u(t, x_{k+1} )) tilde{varphi}_{ki}(x_{k+1})  f(u(t, x_k )) tilde{varphi}_{ki}(x_k)  leftlangle f(u(t,,cdot,)) , tilde{varphi}_{ki}' rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} =0 quad text{for} quad forall , k ; forall, i leq p ,. end{align} The fluxes at the interfaces are approximated by numerical fluxes g with : g_k := g(u_k^-,u_k^+) ,, quad u_k^pm := u(t,x_k^pm) ,, where u_k^{pm} denotes the left- and right-hand sided limits. Finally, the DG-Scheme can be written as : begin{align} frac{mathrm d}{mathrm d t} u_{ki}(t) + g_{k+1} tilde{varphi}_{ki}(x_{k+1})  g_k tilde{varphi}_{ki}(x_k)  leftlangle f(u(t,,cdot,)) , tilde{varphi}_{ki}' rightrangle_{L^2(I_k)} =0 quad text{for} quad forall , k ; forall, i leq p ,. end{align}  Scalar elliptic equation  A scalar elliptic equation is of the form : begin{align} -partial_{xx} u &= f(x) quad text{for} quad xin (a,b)  u(x) &= g(x),quadtext{for},quad x=a,b end{align} This equation is the steady- state heat equation, where u is the temperature. Space discretization is the same as above. We recall that the interval (a,b) is partitioned into N+1 intervals of length h. We introduce jump [{}cdot{}] and average {{}cdot{}} of functions at the node x_k: : [v]Big_{x_k} = v(x_k^+)-v(x_k^-), quad {v}Big_{x_k} = 0.5 (v(x_k^+)+v(x_k^-)) The interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) method is: find u_h satisfying : A(u_h,v_h) + A_{partial}(u_h,v_h) = ell(v_h) + ell_partial(v_h) where the bilinear forms A and A_partial are : A(u_h,v_h) = sum_{k=1}^{N+1} int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}partial_x u_h partial_x v_h -sum_{k=1}^N { partial_x u_h}_{x_k} [v_h]_{x_k} +varepsilonsum_{k=1}^N { partial_x v_h}_{x_k} [u_h]_{x_k} +frac{sigma}{h} sum_{k=1}^N [u_h]_{x_k} [v_h]_{x_k} and : A_partial(u_h,v_h) = partial_x u_h(a) v_h(a) -partial_x u_h(b) v_h(b) -varepsilon partial_x v_h(a) u_h(a) + varepsilonpartial_x v_h(b) u_h(b) +frac{sigma}{h} big(u_h(a) v_h(a) + u_h(b) v_h(b)big) The linear forms ell and ell_partial are : ell(v_h) = int_a^b f v_h and : ell_partial(v_h) = -varepsilon partial_x v_h(a) g(a) + varepsilonpartial_x v_h(b) g(b) +frac{sigma}{h} big( g(a) v_h(a) + g(b) v_h(b) big) The penalty parameter sigma is a positive constant. Increasing its value will reduce the jumps in the discontinuous solution. The term varepsilon is chosen to be equal to -1 for the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method; it is equal to +1 for the non-symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method. Direct discontinuous Galerkin method The direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) method is a new discontinuous Galerkin method for solving diffusion problems. In 2009, Liu and Yan first proposed the DDG method for solving diffusion equations.Hailiang Liu, Jue Yan, The Direct Discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) Methods For Diffusion Problems,SIAM J. NUMER. ANAL. Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 675‚Äì698.Hailiang Liu, Jue Yan, The Direct Discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) Method for Diffusion with Interface Corrections, Commun. Comput. Phys. Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 541-564. The advantages of this method compared with Discontinuous Galerkin method is that the direct discontinuous Galerkin method derives the numerical format by directly taking the numerical flux of the function and the first derivative term without introducing intermediate variables. We still can get a reasonable numerical results by using this method, and the derivation process is more simple, the amount of calculation is greatly reduced. The direct discontinuous finite element method is a branch of the Discontinuous Galerkin methods.Mengping Zhang,Jue Yan, Fourier Type Error Analysis of the Direct Discontinuous Galerkin Method and Its Variations for Diffusion Equations, Journal of Scientific Computing,2012,52(3). It mainly includes transforming the problem into variationally form, regional unit splitting, constructing basis functions, forming and solving discontinuous finite element equations, and convergence and error analysis. For example, consider a nonlinear diffusion equation, which is one-dimensional: : U_t - {(a(U)cdot U_x)}_x = 0   in  (0,1) times (0,T), in which U(x,0) = U_0(x)  on (0,1) = Space discretization = Firstly, define left { I_j =left ( x_{j-frac{1}{2}}, x_{j+frac{1}{2}} right ), j=1...Nright }, and Delta x_j=x_{j-frac{1}{2}}-x_{j-frac{1}{2}}. Therefore we have done the space discretization of x. Also, define Delta x=max_{1leq j< N} Delta x_j. We want to find an approximation u to U such that forall tin left [ 0,T right ], u in mathbb{V}_{Delta x}, mathbb{V}_{Delta x} := left { vin L^2left ( 0,1 right ):{v}_{I_j}in P^kleft ( I-j right ),  j=1,...,N right }, P^kleft ( I-j right ) is the polynomials space in I_j with degree at k and lower than k.  Formulation of the scheme  Flux: h:= hleft ( U,U_x right )=aleft ( U right )U_x. U : the exact solution of the equation. Multiply the equation with a smooth function vin H^1left (0,1 right ) so that we obtain the following equations: int _{I_j} U_tvdx- h_{j+frac{1}{2}}v_{j+frac{1}{2}}+h_{j-frac{1}{2}}+int aleft ( U right )U_xv_xdx=0 , int _{I_j} Uleft ( x,0 right )vleft ( x right )dx=int _{I_j}U_0left ( x right )vleft ( x right )dx Here v is arbitrary, the exact solution U of the equation is replaced by the approximate solution u, that is to say, the numerical solution we need is obtained by solving the differential equations. =The numerical flux= Choosing a proper numerical flux is critical for the accuracy of DDG method. The numerical flux needs to satisfy the following conditions: ‚ô¶ It is consistent with h={bleft ( u right )}_x=aleft ( u right )u_x ‚ô¶ The numerical flux is conservative in the single value on x_{j+frac{1}{2}}. ‚ô¶ It has the L^2-stability; ‚ô¶ It can improve the accuracy of the method. Thus, a general scheme for numerical flux is given: :widehat{h}=D_xb(u)=beta_0frac{left [ bleft ( u right ) right ]}{Delta x}+overline{{bleft ( u right )}_x}+sum_{m=1}^{frac{k}{2}}beta_m{left ( Delta x right )}^{2m-1}left [ partial _x^{2m}bleft ( u right ) right ] In this flux, k is the maximum order of polynomials in two neighboring computing units. left [cdot right ] is integral function. Note that in non- uniform grids, x should be left ( frac{Delta x_j+Delta x_{j+1}}{2} right ) and frac{1}{N} in uniform grids. =Error estimates= Denote that the error between the exact solution U and the numerical solution u is e= u-U . We measure the error with the following norm: left  left  left  v(cdot ,t) right  right  right  ={left (int_{0}^{1}v^2dx+left ( 1-gamma right )int_{0}^{t}sum_{j=1}^{N}int_{I_j} v_x^2 dxdtau +alpha int_{0}^{t}sum_{j=1}^{N} {left [ v right ] }^2/Delta xcdot dtau right )}^{0.5} and we have left  left  left  U(cdot ,T) right  right  right leq left  left  left  U(cdot ,0) right  right  right ,left  left  left  u(cdot ,T) right  right  right leq left  left  left  U(cdot ,0) right  right  right  See also *Galerkin method References * D.N.

It ran into many editions and was the standard text for generations of economics students. Writing Marshall began writing the Principles of Economics in 1881 and he spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought; the first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim that established him as one of the leading economists of his time. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and collectivism, was never published at all. Over the next two decades he worked to complete his second volume of the Principles, but his unyielding attention to detail and ambition for completeness prevented him from mastering the work's breadth.

Marshall summarises how wealth is distributed through society. > \\"The efficiency as compared with the cost of almost every class of labour, > is thus continually being weighed in the balance in one or more branches of > production against some other classes of labour: and each of these in its > turn against others. This competition is primarily \\"vertical\\": it is a > struggle for the field of employment between groups of labour belonging to > different grades, but engaged in the same branch of production, and > inclosed, as it were, between the same vertical walls. But meanwhile > \\"horizontal\\" competition is always at work, and by simpler methods: for, > firstly, there is great freedom of movement of adults from one business to > another within each trade; and secondly, parents can generally introduce > their children into almost any other trade of the same grade with their own > in their neighbourhood. By means of this combined vertical and horizontal > competition there is an effective and closely adjusted balance of payments > to services as between labour in different grades; in spite of the fact that > the labour in any one grade is mostly recruited even now from the children > of those in the same grade. The working of the principle of substitution is > thus chiefly indirect. When two tanks containing fluid are joined by a pipe, > the fluid, which is near the pipe in the tank with the higher level, will > flow into the other, even though it be rather viscous; and thus the general > levels of the tanks will tend to be brought together, though no fluid may > flow from the further end of the one to the further end of the other; and if > several tanks are connected by pipes, the fluid in all will tend to the same > level, though some tanks have no direct connection with others. And > similarly the principle of substitution is constantly tending by indirect > routes to apportion earnings to efficiency between trades, and even between > grades, which are not directly in contact with one another, and which appear > at first sight to have no way of competing with one another.\\" - VI.XI.6-7 *XII General Influences of Economic Progress. Marshall discusses the causes of economic development. > \\"But after all the chief cause of the modern prosperity of new countries > lies in the markets that the old world offers, not for goods delivered on > the spot, but for promises to deliver goods at a distant date.\\" - VI.XII.3 > \\"The key-notes of the modern movement are the reduction of a great number of > tasks to one pattern; the diminution of friction of every kind which might > hinder powerful agencies from combining their action and spreading their > influence over vast areas; and the development of transport by new methods > and new forces. The macadamized roads and the improved shipping of the > eighteenth century broke up local combinations and monopolies, and offered > facilities for the growth of others extending over a wider area: and in our > own age the same double tendency is resulting from every new extension and > cheapening of communication by land and sea, by printing-press and telegraph > and telephone.\\" - VI.XII.10 *XIII Progress in Relation To Standards of Life. =Appendices.= *Appendix A The Growth of Free Industry and Enterprise. *Appendix B The Growth of Economic Science. *Appendix C The Scope and Method of Economics. *Appendix D Uses of Abstract Reasoning in Economics. *Appendix E Definitions of Capital. *Appendix F Barter. *Appendix G The Incidence of Local Rates, With Some Suggestions As To Policy. *Appendix H Limitations of the Use of Statical Assumptions in Regard To Increasing Return. *Appendix I Ricardo's Theory of Value. *Appendix J The Doctrine of the Wages-Fund. *Appendix K Certain Kinds of Surplus. *Appendix L Ricardo's Doctrine As To Taxes and Improvements in Agriculture. Contribution Marshall's influence on modifying economic thought is difficult to deny. He popularized the use of supply and demand functions as tools of price determination (previously discovered independently by Cournot); modern economists owe the linkage between price shifts and curve shifts to Marshall. Marshall was an important part of the \\"marginalist revolution;\\" the idea that consumers attempt to adjust consumption until marginal utility equals the price was another of his contributions. The price elasticity of demand was presented by Marshall as an extension of these ideas. Economic welfare, divided into producer surplus and consumer surplus, was contributed by Marshall, and indeed, the two are sometimes described eponymously as 'Marshallian surplus.' He used this idea of surplus to rigorously analyze the effect of taxes and price shifts on market welfare. Marshall also identified quasi-rents.

Rizal. Notable graduates of the institution include former Senate presidents Neptali Gonzales and Senator Jovito Salonga, former Senator Rene Saguisag, Maestro Lucio San Pedro, and National Artist Carlos ‚ÄúBotong‚Äù Francisco to mention a few. History =Pasig Secondary School= The first secondary school in the province of Rizal known as the Pasig Secondary School was established in 1902 during the incumbency of Governor Ambrosio Flores with an enrollment of 28 pupils. The students came from five neighboring towns including Pasig. The enrollment increased to 45 pupils in November, 65 in December and 88 in January and February in 1903, all intermediate pupils. The pupils were taught in a room of a rented building, 30 meters by 30 meters. The cost of the rent was $15, local currency, the amount paid from the provincial fund. At the beginning, the Provincial Board was against the establishment of a provincial school in Pasig, which is near Manila. The increase in American financial support by the provincial government was subject to the condition that the pupils from adjoining towns would attend classes in the provincial school rather than seeking enrollment in Manila. Immediately after the military post occupied by American soldiers was vacated, it was turned over to the provincial government for the use of the Pasig Secondary School in November 1903. The building, although quite spacious, was old and dilapidated with a badly damaged roof. The teachers assigned to this school were all Americans, namely, Messrs. Laughlin, Click and Scruton. The Superintendent of Schools was Charles Rummel. The military post was vacated when a new building was constructed in 1902 during the administration of Governor Jose Tupas. The basement of the building was used as a woodworking shop. This was the time when a first year class was organized. In 1913 a site of ten lots, of 63,700 square meters, was acquired through expropriation proceedings from landowners. The estimated value of the site was P38,540. It was surveyed on November 8, 1928 and registered on October 27, 1931 under Certificate of Title No. 4553. Soon, after the acquisition of the site, a modern, reinforced concrete and modified Standard Plan No. 20 school building was constructed. This was in 1914 during the tenure of Governor Mariano Melendres. The building was completed and occupied in 1915. =Change of Name= The name of Pasig Secondary School was changed to Rizal High School when a first year class of eleven pupils was organized and when the province was already putting up the greater bulk of the financial support for the school. The change to the present name Rizal High School was made in 1914 when the new building was completed and occupied by the school. For many years since its establishment in 1902, the intermediate classes were under the supervision and administration of the secondary school principal. These classes were considered a preparatory department of the secondary school. The gradual change in administration started with the school year 1902‚Äì1921. The complete separation of the intermediate classes as a preparatory department to the high school took effect in 1924. The first graduating class was in 1918. Of the 30 fourth year students for the month of March, 27 qualified for graduation. Two of the graduates who later distinguished themselves in their chosen professions were U.P. Professor Cecilio Lopez and Dr. Elpidio Alcantara. The first principal of the Pasig Secondary School was Steward Laughlin who also served as one of its earliest teachers. The first Filipino principal was Marcelino Bautista who served during the school year 1929‚Äì1930, followed by Ricardo Castro in 1930‚Äì1935, Aquilino Carino in 1935-1935, Eufrocino Malonzo in 1936‚Äì1939. The years preceding the Second World War saw Eliseo Tayao as principal of the Rizal High School (1939‚Äì41). The school was closed for sometime and was reopened with Cesario Bandong. =Classes after Liberation= The carpet-bombing employed by the American Liberation Forces destroyed the high school building and grounds. Classes therefore were reorganized in 1945 at the Pasig Elementary School by Paterno Santiago (later to become principal of Morong High School). He took charge of the administration of the Rizal High School for about a month when he gave way to Cesario Bandong who served as principal until 1950. The reconstruction of the Rizal High School was started on February 4, 1948 out of the War Damage Fund in the amount of P101,445.49 during the incumbency of Governor Sixto Antonio. The reconstruction was completed on August 15, 1949. Demetrio M. Suguitan took over from Bandong (1950‚Äì1960). Modesta T. Javier became the principal in 1960‚Äì1974; Cesar S. Tiangco came in 1975 up to January 1980. Diana C. Santos became principal from 1980 until 1999. Josephine M. Cruz, who was then the Schools Division English Supervisor for the secondary level, was installed as Santos' replacement in 1999. Josephine M. Cruz was principal until 2012. Now the school is under the management of Virginia R. Membrebe, a former Social Studies teacher of Rizal High School prior to her elevation to the principalship of Santa Lucia High School.

The type species of Erpetosuchus is E. granti. It was first described by E. T. Newton in 1894 for remains found in northeastern Scotland, including four specimens from the latest Carnian Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation. Additional remains of Erpetosuchus have been found in the New Haven Formation of Connecticut in the eastern United States, although they were not attributed to the species E. granti. The relationship of Erpetosuchus to other archosaurs is uncertain. In 2000 and 2002, it was considered a close relative of the group Crocodylomorpha, which includes living crocodylians and many extinct relatives. However, this relationship was questioned in a 2012 analysis that found the phylogenetic placement of Erpetosuchus to be very uncertain. Material Erpetosuchus. The first remains of Erpetosuchus were found in the Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation in Scotland, dating back to the late Carnian stage of the Late Triassic. The holotype specimen is BMNH R3139 and consists of a skull and a partial postcranial skeleton. During a field trip in 1995 to the lower part of the New Haven Formation in Connecticut, American palaeontologist Paul E. Olsen discovered a partial skull that, after preparation and description in 2000 (Olsen et al. 2000), was referable to Erpetosuchus. This was the first record of Erpetosuchus outside Scotland. The specimen has been given the number AMNH 29300, and besides the right side of the skull, also has some vertebrae and indeterminate bones associated. Dating of the lower portion of the New Haven Formation indicates a Norian age. Systematics Erpetosuchus granti was originally assigned to Thecodontia, but that name is no longer considered valid in scientific literature because it is a paraphyletic group of early archosaurs. A more recent phylogenetic analysis by Olsen et al. (2000) found E. granti to be the sister-taxon to the Crocodylomorpha. These were united in a clade by the following synapomorphies: *Medial contact of the maxillae (upper jaw bones) to form a secondary bony palate *Absence of a postfrontal bone at the top of the skull *Parietal bones fused without a trace of a suture between them Benton and Walker (2002) found the same sister-group relationship and proposed the name Bathyotica for the clade containing Erpetosuchus and Crocodylomorpha. Nesbitt and Butler (2012) included Erpetosuchus within a more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and found it to group with the archosaur Parringtonia from the Middle Triassic of Tanzania. Both were part of the clade Erpetosuchidae. Nesbitt and Butler did not find support for the sister-group relationship between Erpetosuchus and Crocodylomorpha. Instead, erpetosuchids formed a polytomy or unresolved evolutionary relationship at the base of Archosauria along with several other groups. It could take many positions within Archosauria, but none were as a sister taxon of Crocodylomorpha.

For instance, a generic property of a class of functions is one that is true of \\"almost all\\" of those functions, as in the statements, \\"A generic polynomial does not have a root at zero,\\" or \\"A generic square matrix is invertible.\\" As another example, a generic property of a space is a property that holds at \\"almost all\\" points of the space, as in the statement, \\"If f : M ‚Üí N is a smooth function between smooth manifolds, then a generic point of N is not a critical value of f.\\" (This is by Sard's theorem.) There are many different notions of \\"generic\\" (what is meant by \\"almost all\\") in mathematics, with corresponding dual notions of \\"almost none\\" (negligible set); the two main classes are: * In measure theory, a generic property is one that holds almost everywhere, with the dual concept being null set, meaning \\"with probability 0\\". * In topology and algebraic geometry, a generic property is one that holds on a dense open set, or more generally on a residual set, with the dual concept being a nowhere dense set, or more generally a meagre set. There are several natural examples where those notions are not equal. For instance, the set of Liouville numbers is generic in the topological sense, but has Lebesgue measure zero.  In measure theory  In measure theory, a generic property is one that holds almost everywhere. The dual concept is a null set, that is, a set of measure zero. = In probability = In probability, a generic property is an event that occurs almost surely, meaning that it occurs with probability 1. For example, the law of large numbers states that the sample mean converges almost surely to the population mean. This is the definition in the measure theory case specialized to a probability space.  In discrete mathematics  In discrete mathematics, one uses the term almost all to mean cofinite (all but finitely many), cocountable (all but countably many), for sufficiently large numbers, or, sometimes, asymptotically almost surely. The concept is particularly important in the study of random graphs.  In topology  In topology and algebraic geometry, a generic property is one that holds on a dense open set, or more generally on a residual set (a countable intersection of dense open sets), with the dual concept being a closed nowhere dense set, or more generally a meagre set (a countable union of nowhere dense closed sets). However, density alone is not sufficient to characterize a generic property. This can be seen even in the real numbers, where both the rational numbers and their complement, the irrational numbers, are dense. Since it does not make sense to say that both a set and its complement exhibit typical behavior, both the rationals and irrationals cannot be examples of sets large enough to be typical. Consequently, we rely on the stronger definition above which implies that the irrationals are typical and the rationals are not. For applications, if a property holds on a residual set, it may not hold for every point, but perturbing it slightly will generally land one inside the residual set (by nowhere density of the components of the meagre set), and these are thus the most important case to address in theorems and algorithms. = In function spaces = A property is generic in Cr if the set holding this property contains a residual subset in the Cr topology. Here Cr is the function space whose members are continuous functions with r continuous derivatives from a manifold M to a manifold N. The space Cr(M, N), of Cr mappings between M and N, is a Baire space, hence any residual set is dense. This property of the function space is what makes generic properties typical.  In algebraic geometry  =Algebraic varieties = A property of an irreducible algebraic variety X is said to be true generically if it holds except on a proper Zariski-closed subset of X, in other words, if it holds on a non-empty Zariski-open subset. This definition agrees with the topological one above, because for irreducible algebraic varieties any non-empty open set is dense. For example, by the Jacobian criterion for regularity, a generic point of a variety over a field of characteristic zero is smooth. (This statement is known as generic smoothness.) This is true because the Jacobian criterion can be used to find equations for the points which are not smooth: They are exactly the points where the Jacobian matrix of a point of X does not have full rank. In characteristic zero, these equations are non-trivial, so they cannot be true for every point in the variety. Consequently, the set of all non-regular points of X is a proper Zariski-closed subset of X. Here is another example. Let f : X ‚Üí Y be a regular map between two algebraic varieties. For every point y of Y, consider the dimension of the fiber of f over y, that is, dim f‚àí1(y). Generically, this number is constant. It is not necessarily constant everywhere. If, say, X is the blowup of Y at a point and f is the natural projection, then the relative dimension of f is zero except at the point which is blown up, where it is dim Y - 1. Some properties are said to hold very generically. Frequently this means that the ground field is uncountable and that the property is true except on a countable union of proper Zariski-closed subsets (i.e., the property holds on a dense GŒ¥ set). For instance, this notion of very generic occurs when considering rational connectedness. However, other definitions of very generic can and do occur in other contexts. = Generic point = In algebraic geometry, a generic point of an algebraic variety is a point whose coordinates do not satisfy any other algebraic relation than those satisfied by every point of the variety. For example, a generic point of an affine space over a field is a point whose coordinates are algebraically independent over . In scheme theory, where the points are the sub varieties, a generic point of a variety is a point whose closure for the Zariski topology is the whole variety. A generic property is a property of the generic point. For any reasonable property, it turns out that the property is true generically on the subvariety (in the sense of being true on an open dense subset) if and only if the property is true at the generic point. Such results are frequently proved using the methods of limits of affine schemes developed in EGA IV 8. = General position = A related concept in algebraic geometry is general position, whose precise meaning depends on the context. For example, in the Euclidean plane, three points in general position are not collinear. This is because the property of not being collinear is a generic property of the configuration space of three points in R2.  Genericity results  * Sard's theorem: If fcolon M to N is a smooth function between smooth manifolds, then a generic point of N is not a critical value of f ‚Äì critical values of f are a null set in N. * Jacobian criterion / generic smoothness: A generic point of a variety over a field of characteristic zero is smooth. * Controllability and observability of linear time-invariant systems are generic both in the topological and measure theory sense.

Fink attended a grammar school in Konstanz where he succeeded with his extraordinary memory. After his graduation exam in 1925, he studied philosophy, history, German language and economics, initially at M√ºnster and Berlin and then in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl. Philosophy As Husserl's assistant, he was a representative of phenomenological idealism and later a follower of Martin Heidegger. He approached the problem of Being as a manifestation of the cosmic movement with Man being a participant in this movement. Fink called the philosophical problems pre-questions, that will lead to the true philosophy by the way of an ontological practice.

Bai'at or Bay'ah (; pledge, initiation; literally a \\"sale\\" or a \\"transaction\\") is an Islamic practice of declaring on oath, one's allegiance to a particular leader. In an Islamic religious context, this oath is the standard procedure of pledging allegiance to a religious leader. It is known to have been practiced by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his successors (caliphs) after him with those wishing to join the Islamic community. Within the Sufi tradition the term is used to refer to the process of initiation into a Sufi order with the idea of commending oneself to a spiritual master in exchange for the spiritual and moral guidance imparted by him. The Bay'ah is a practice that also forms a notable feature within Ahmadiyya Islam. Following the death of a Caliph, the leader of the Community, a pledge of allegiance is taken by the newly chosen Caliph from members of the Community based upon this prophetic model and the bay'ah is the standard procedure for formally joining the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Since 1993, a large Bay'ah is held on an international scale every year during the annual gathering of the Community. The Bay'ah is taken by the caliph at whose hand new converts pledge their allegiance and old members of the Community can reaffirm their pledges. The Bay'ah comprises the shahadah, prayers of repentance and a promise to abide by the Ten Conditions stipulated by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad for joining the Community.  Bay'ah (Ahmadiyya)  Khalifatul Masih V at the International Bay'ah Ceremony 2007 wearing the green coat of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. The concept of bay'ah is considered very important to Ahmadi Muslims. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, after claiming to be divinely appointed as the renewer of Islam, took the first bay'ah in 1889 at Ludhiana. After this, many individuals travelled long distances to Qadian to be initiated in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The practice was continued by his successors. The tradition was originally started by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and continued by the 4 Caliphs after him. = International Bay'at = In 1993 Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth Ahmadiyya Caliph, internationalised the Bay'ah through Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International (MTA) by which people from all over the world were now able to partake in this pledge which would be simultaneously translated into 12 different languages. Since then, The international oath of allegiance has taken place every year at the annual gatherings. Ahmad often claimed that this was the historical fulfillment of the Pentecost that was destined to occur at the time of the Second Coming.First International Baiat, Jalsa Salana 1 August 1993 .  Distinctive features  Since the first International Bay'ah, some acts have become part of the tradition during the ceremony. Foremost, the caliph wears a green coat of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad at the ceremony. This coat was lent to the fourth caliph for this ceremony by his sister. However, the coat was given to the caliphate at the request of the fifth caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad. The members of the community form five or seven lines in front of the caliph at the ceremony to represent the five/seven continents of the world. Officials of the community organisation and other people who have worked for the community or are otherwise selected for this ceremony are present in these lines. The lines proceed to some extent in an orderly manner after which other members are present. Members of the community all over the world join the ceremony live through TV coverage by the community's own satellite channel MTA. The members and those who want to become members place their hands on the back of the person in their front, as is known from the tradition of the early Muslims at the time of Muhammad, and so form chains of physical contact with the caliph. This physical contact is seen necessary only for those present at the ceremony. The oath of allegiance or Bay'ah is taken by the caliph in the following way: first he reads a sentence or a part of a sentence from the oath in Arabic and then in Urdu or English, which the members of the community repeat after him. The wording contains the shahadah, prayers of repentance and involves a promise to abide by the Ten Conditions of Bai'at as stipulated by Ghulam Ahmad. Then the same sentence or part of the sentence is repeated by translators in many languages of the world simultaneously and repeated by the members of the community. After having gone through the whole text of the oath of allegiance in this manner, the caliph leads the members in silent prayers. At the end, all members of the congregation, which includes those participating around the world, prostrate themselves as an expression of gratitude towards God. This prostration is not directed in any particular direction and is performed in whichever direction one finds suitable but it is led by the caliph,.

Early life Gabriela von Habsburg was born in Luxembourg, the fourth child of the German politician Otto von Habsburg, head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and erstwhile heir apparent to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and Regina (n√©e Prinzessin von Sachsen-Meiningen). She was baptised with the names Gabriela Maria Charlotte Felicitas Elisabeth Antonia. The name in her birth certificate is Gabriela von √ñsterreich-Ungarn. Gabriela von Habsburg was raised at her parents' home in exile, Villa Austria, in P√∂cking, Bavaria. As a result of the Habsburgs' banishment from Austria, she feels that she grew up devoid of any sense of pride of country and thus identifies as European.Gelber, David, Financial Times, The art of diplomacy, 29 April 2011, access date 21 May 2011 She believes that her dynasty's role in history shaped her upbringing, noting that her family \\"never spoke about anything at mealtimes except politics\\". A granddaughter of the last Austrian emperor, Charles I, she does not use the traditional Habsburg-Lorraine titles (\\"Princess Imperial and Archduchess of Austria, Princess Royal of Hungary and Bohemia\\", with the style of Imperial and Royal Highness). After graduating in 1976, Gabriela von Habsburg studied philosophy for two years at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. From 1978 to 1982, she studied art at the Munich Academy of Arts with Robert Jacobsen and Eduardo Paolozzi. Career Since 2001, she has been an art professor at the Academy of Arts of Tbilisi, Georgia while also teaching at the Summer Academy of Arts in Neuburg an der Donau, Germany until 2005. She found the creativity and cheerfulness of her students in the face of the adversity then prevalent in Georgia inspiring. During her tenure there she was granted Georgian citizenship. Her five hectare vineyard in Georgia produces wine. In November 2009, Georgia appointed Gabriela von Habsburg as its ambassador to Germany, and since March 2011 she has maintained a flat in Berlin. Believing that Georgian history served as a crucible for European culture, she has maintained that the liberalizing reforms of President Mikheil Saakashvili have been welcome and invigorating for Georgia's people and economy, which has prompted her to work for Georgia's membership in the European Market. She was dismissed from her position in January 2013, after the change of government in Georgia in October 2012. Since March 2010 Gabriela von Habsburg has represented Georgia at the International Council of the Austrian Service Abroad.

He also earned two caps with the U.S. national team in 1992 and 1996. High school and college Leonetti attended Gladstone High School where he was the 1987 Oregon State High School player of the Year as a senior. He scored a total of 123 goals during his prep career. After high school, he attended the University of Portland where he played from 1988-1991 under coach Clive Charles. In 1988, his freshman year, he was part of the Portland team which went to the NCAA Final Four only to lose to champion Indiana. During his four seasons with the Pilots, Leonetti scored thirty-seven goals, and is fourth on the school‚Äôs all-time scoring list. He tops the school‚Äôs season and career assists records with 14 and 36, respectively. He was a third team All- American in 1989. He graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology. He was inducted into the University of Portland Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. WSA/APSL In 1988, while still in college, Leonetti spent the 1988 Western Soccer Alliance season with F.C. Portland, a local semi-pro team. Following his graduation from the University of Portland in 1992, Leonetti signed with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) which had been formed by the merger of the WSA and American Soccer League in 1990. While he played in only eight games, scoring two goals, during league play, he added another three goals in CONCACAF Champions' Cup play as the Blackhawks went to the semifinals, only to fall to eventual champions Club Am√©rica. He also scored a goal for the Blackhawks in the first round of the Professional Cup. He played with the national team in September 1992, but then tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which kept him from playing for nearly a year. In 1993, Leonetti joined the local Portland Pride of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, a summer indoor league. He played in Portland through the 1995 season. In February 1996, the Los Angeles Galaxy drafted Leonetti in the 10th round (94 overall) of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. The Galaxy cut him in pre-season and Leonetti moved north to sign with the Seattle Sounders of the A-League (renamed APSL). That season, the team won the league title and Leonetti was named the playoff MVP. In 1997, Leonetti decided to try out for MLS again. He attended the MLS combine, but tore the ACL in his left knee, putting him out of action for several months. That summer, he re-joined the Portland Pride for the team‚Äôs last season. The Pride and its league, the CISL, folded at the end of the 1997 season. However, the team‚Äôs ownership decided to re-create the team as the Portland Pythons and entered it into the indoor Premier Soccer Alliance in 1998. Leonetti remained with the Pythons through the end of the season. In 1999, he played his final year of soccer, this time with the Willamette Valley Firebirds of the fourth division USL Premier Development League. The Firebirds went to the PDL semifinals that season. Leonetti left soccer in 2000 to work for Fluid Logic, but he decided to return to the field in 2001 with the Portland Timbers. During a pre-season game against the University of Portland, he blew out his Achilles tendon. While he again tried out for the team in 2002, he was cut and retired from playing professionally.

Background The de Trafford family can trace their ancestry back to the 12th century. They family took their name from their manor of Trafford, now part of Greater Manchester. The 14th century was important for these manorial lords, in receiving acclaim from the Crown. Henry Trafford died in 1395, holding the manors of Trafford and Stretford, together with part of the manor of Edgeworth, and leaving a son and heir Henry, six years of age. This son died in 1408, the manors going to his brother Edmund, known as the Alchemist, from his having procured a licence from the king in 1446 authorizing him to transmute metals. Sir Edmund, at Eccles in 1411, married Alice daughter and co-heir of Sir William Venables of Bollin, and thus acquired a considerable estate in Cheshire, which descended in the Trafford family for many generations. Cecil Trafford was made a knight at Hoghton Tower in 1617. He was at first, like his grandfather, a Protestant and a persecutor, but afterwards, about 1632, became a Catholic. As a recusant family, they faced persecution and, in 1638, accordingly, the king seized a third of his estates and granted them on lease to farmers. Siding with the king on the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was seized and imprisoned by Roundheads and his estates were sequestered. His sons are mentioned as serving some of the English Interregnum at Rome and Douay. In 1653 Sir Cecil begged leave to transact under the Recusants Act relating to the sequestered two-thirds of his estates. Sir Cecil died in 1672. His eldest son Edmund died twenty years later, and was followed by a brother Humphrey, who was accused of participation in the fictitious plot of 1694, and sympathized with the rising of 1715. Around this time the family left their original home, which they occupied since 1017, moving to Whittleswick Hall, which they renamed Trafford Hall. Humphrey was succeeded by his son and grandson, also both named Humphrey. The last of these died in 1779 and was succeeded by his relative John Trafford of Croston, who died in 1815. During this time, owing to the laws concerning religion, all offices of state were closed to Catholics, who had therefore to dwell quietly on their estates. The family's prospects improved after the Catholic Emancipation, and in 1841 John Trafford was created a Baronet by Queen Victoria. Sir John later obtained royal licence to change the family name from \\"Trafford\\" to \\"de Trafford\\", thus restoring it to its original mediaeval form. Coat of arms Armorial display from the bookplate of the third Baronet, showing his full twenty quarterings impaling the arms of his wife The arms of the family consist of a red griffin on a silver background, blazoned argent, a griffin segreant gules. Their crest is a man in the act of threshing a wheatsheaf with a flail. This refers to a legend in which a member of the family escaped the Roundhead army by pretending to be a thresher. They have two mottoes: \\"Now Thus\\", and \\"Gripe Griffin Hold Fast\\". In addition to their original family arms, the de Traffords have amassed a collection of nineteen quarterings, an unusually large amount even for an old family. The Baronet's full achievement is blazoned: Quarterly of twenty: 1st argent, a griffin segreant gules (de Trafford); 2nd argent, two bars, and in chief two mullets pierced azure (Venables); 3rd argent, on a bend azure three garbs proper (Tritten); 4th quarterly gules and or, in the first quarter a lion passant argent (Massey); 5th paly of six argent and gules, a chief vair (Whitney); 6th argent, on a bend gules three escarbuncles sable (Thornton); 7th vert, a cross engrailed ermine (Kingsley); 8th or, a saltire sable (Hellesby); 9th azure, a chevron argent between three garbs proper (Hatton); 10th bendy barry gules and argent (Crispen); 11th argent, a chevron gules between three chaplets (Ashton); 12th argent, three bars sable (Legh); 13th gules, two lions passant guardant in pale argent (De la Mere); 14th argent, on a chevron quarterly gules and sable, between three birds of the second, as many bezants (Kitchen); 15th argent, three garbs proper banded or (Aughton); 16th argent, a fesse sable, in chief three torteaux (Mason); 17th argent, on a child proper wrapped in swaddling clothes gules, and banded or, an eagle sable (Culcheth); 18th argent, a griffin segreant azure (Culcheth); 19th argent, a griffin segreant sable ducally crowned or (Risseley); 20th azure, a hind trippant argent (Hindley). Upon the escutcheon, which is charged with his badge of Ulster as a Baronet, is placed a helmet befitting his degree, with a Mantling gules and argent; and for his Crest, upon a wreath of the colours, a thresher proper, his hat and coat per pale argent and gules, his breeches and stockings of the third and second, holding in both hands a flail or, uplifted over a garb on the dexter side, and over the crest upon an escroll the Motto, \\"Now Thus\\"; and below the arms the Motto \\"Gripe Griffin, Hold Fast\\".

Penallta RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Newport Gwent Dragons. History Penallta Rugby Football Club is based in Ystrad Mynach. The rugby club was inaugurated by a group of miners from Penallta colliery in 1952 and moved from a number of different social addresses until it settled at Ystrad Fawr, hosting both its club and playing ground there. On 1 November 1991 Penallta Colliery shut down but the RFC continued to play under its name. In 2008 Penallta moved from Ystrad Fawr to their new headquarters across the road at Trinity Fields; Ystrad Fawr, its surrounding playing fields and listed buildings were bulldozed to make way for the new Ystrad Mynach Hospital. The club colours are blue and gold and the first team are known as the Pitmen, the club being immensely proud of its mining heritage. Penallta became a full Welsh Rugby Union member in 2004 and since then it has won Divisions 3, 4 and 5 South East, plus the Silver Ball trophy in 2005. During the 2007/08 season Penallta were promoted to Division 1 East. One of Penallta's biggest Junion Union achievements was winning the Worthington Welsh 'Brewers' Cup in 2001. It was the only time the club won the cup in its junior union history. In 2012 Penallta returned to the Millennium Stadium and won the Swalec Plate against North Wales side Nant Conwy. Captain Kieran Mahoney lifted the trophy to cap a season during which Penallta embarked on an 18-match unbeaten run, narrowly finishing runner-up to rivals Ystrad Rhondda in the league. To complete a hat- trick of successful Millennium Stadium visits since the turn of the century, Penallta Youth won the Welsh Youth Cup in 2014 against Gilfach Goch. The Youth Cup was one of an amazing seven trophies amassed by the youth squad during an unbeaten season. Mike Voyle, a resident of Ystrad Mynach, is the only Penallta player to have represented Wales. He won 21 caps as a tight forward between 1997 and 2001. Penallta's most capped player is Lee Acreman, with over 600 1st team appearances for the club. The most successful player in Penallta's history is Craig Phillips who captained the 1st team on six occasions and won the Player of the Year award on no less than five occasions, his career lasting between 1976 and 1992. Current ex Penallta players who are thriving for higher placed clubs include Dai Flanagan (Cardiff Blues/Ospreys/Llanelli RFC), Gareth Davies (Wales 7s/ Cardiff Blues/Cardiff RFC), Steffan Jones (Dragons/Crosskeys RFC/Bedford Blues), Elliot Dee (Dragons), Scott Matthews (Dragons/Crosskeys RFC), Jack Condy (Scarlets), Arwel Robson (Newport RFC / Dragons), Ellis Shipp Dragons, Wales U20s) and Shaun Powell (Cardiff RFC). Penallta is also known for its excellent matchday programmes, written by Mike Guilfoyle and Martyn Rowe.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, where it was inactivated on 1 April 1966. History =World War II= Memorial to the 73rd Bomb Wing near Saipan International Airport. 497th Bomb Group B-29 Formation The 73d Bombardment Wing was activated as part of Second Air Force on 17 February 1943. Its original mission was to process personnel assigned to Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator Replacement Training Units (RTU) based in the midwest. It was inactivated on 15 October 1943 with the drawdown of heavy bomber training. The wing was reactivated and redesignated as the 73d Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) on 20 November 1943 at Smoky Hill Army Air Field, Kansas. The new Boeing B-29 Superfortress wing was assigned four newly organized groups (the 497th, 498th, 499th and 500th Bombardment Groups), which were training in New Mexico and Arizona with B-17s and B-24s, due to a lack of B-29 aircraft. In April 1944, the groups were brought to several airfields in Kansas (Great Bend Army Air Field, Smoky Hill Army Air Field and Walker Army Air Field) where they were equipped with new B-29s manufactured by Boeing at their Wichita, Kansas plant. By August the wing's groups had completed their training and their aircraft were readied for deployment. Originally assigned to Twentieth Air Force's XX Bomber Command in India, the wing was instead assigned to the new XXI Bomber Command in the Pacific Theater. The 73d Wing deployed to newly constructed airfields on Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. The 73d Bomb Wing was the first B-29 wing to be assigned to the Marianas, and the first B-29 of the 497th Bomb Group arrived at Isely Field, Saipan on 12 October 1944. The 498th arrived shortly after, with the 499th and 500th Bomb Groups arriving in early November. By 22 November, over 100 B-29s were on Saipan. The XXI Bomber Command was assigned the task of destroying the aircraft industry of Japan in a series of high-altitude, daylight precision attacks In late October and early November 1944, a series of tactical raids were carried out as training exercises for the crews. From Saipan, the groups of the 73d Bomb Wing flew several bombing missions against Truk to gain combat experience. Aware that there was now a new threat, Japanese aircraft based on Iwo Jima staged a low- level raid on Isely Field on 2 November, damaging several B-29s on the ground. Retaliatory strikes were ordered on Iwo Jima on 5 and 11 November. In November 1944, the groups of the 73rd began bombing Japan, with only moderate success. Poor weather, the lack of precision radar bombing equipment, and tremendous winds encountered at high altitudes over Japan made accuracy difficult. The initial raids against Japan had taken place at high altitudes in order to stay above anti-aircraft fire and the effective altitude of defending fighters. Tactics were changed and high-altitude, daylight attacks be phased out and replaced by low-altitude, high-intensity incendiary raids at nighttime. The aircraft would attack individually, which meant that no assembly over the base at the start of the mission or along the way would be needed. Consequently, it turned to devastating low altitude incendiary attacks. The Division continued attacking urban areas until the end of the war in August 1945, its subordinate units conducted raids against strategic objectives, bombing aircraft factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, and other targets in Japan. The wing flew its last combat missions on 14 August when hostilities ended. Afterwards, the wing's B 29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria. The 73d and its subordinate units demobilized rapidly after V-J Day, and the wing's four bomb groups were all returned to the United States, with their B-29s either being flown to Clark Field for scrapping, or to storage facilities in Texas or Arizona. The 73d Bomb Wing was reassigned to the United States in December 1945, where it was assigned first to Continental Air Force's Fourth Air Force, then to Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 21 March 1946. However demobilization was in full swing and few SAC units were actually equipped and manned. The 73d wing was inactivated on 31 March. =Air Force Reserve= In 1947, the 73d Bomb Wing was reactivated with the 338th and 351st Bombardment Groups being assigned to it, both reserve B-29 Superfortress organizations. A third group, the 381st Bombardment Group was added in 1948. However SAC was having enough difficulties keeping its front- line active duty B-29 bomb units in the air to maintain even minimal pilot proficiency in the late 1940s. The wing and its bomb groups were all inactivated in 1949. =Air Defense Command= The organization was reactivated as part of Air Defense Command (ADC) in 1957 as the 73d Air Division. As part of ADC, it evaluated, upgraded, and determined the proficiency of the Air Defense Command fighter-interceptor and missile squadrons, 1 July 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1966. The division developed and tested Air Defense Command tactics, equipment, aircraft, guided missiles, and related equipment and armaments. It also maintained active contact with Army, Navy, and other Air Force commands to assure coordinated military effort in the use of rocket and missile ranges, defense plans, air sea land rescue, and airspace and airways directly concerned with the operations of the Air Defense Command Weapons Center. The 73d Air Division was inactivated on 1 April 1966.

He was instrumental in developing conservative Victorian British taste in a modernist European direction; much of his work is frequently characterised as art deco. Early life Born in Camberwell, London, Bernard was the son of Charles Bernard, (d.1894), a theatre manager, and his wife, Annie Allen, an actress. Oliver Bernard experienced an unhappy childhood in London and, on the death of his father in 1894, left for Manchester to take a job as a stage hand in a theatre. There, he took on his own education by reading John Locke, John Ruskin and others. He ultimately took a series of menial jobs at sea, before returning to London to take up scene painting with Walter Hann. In 1905, Bernard went to New York to work as principal scenic artist for Klaw & Erlanger, and then as assistant artist at the new Boston Opera House in 1909. He returned to London where he was resident scenic artist for the Grand Opera Syndicate Ltd., managers and lessees of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.Powers (2004) At the beginning of World War I in 1914, Bernard was rejected for active military service owing to deafness. He became frustrated at his inability to serve in the war,Wang (2003‚Äì2005) and by the conservatism of the London theatre. He travelled to the Americas where he stayed for a short period before returning to England on the RMS Lusitania in 1915; he survived its sinking. Whilst on board the ship he completed a series of sketches which were published in The Illustrated London News.Reproduced in Sauder & Marschall (1993) pp46‚Äì47 In 1916, he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a camouflage officer, serving in France, Italy and Belgium, reaching the rank of captain. For his services, he was awarded the Military Cross and OBE, respectively. Post-war In 1919, Bernard continued his theatrical work, designing sets for Sir Thomas Beecham's Ring Cycle at Covent Garden. By the 1920s, he began to display an interest in trade and industry, new materials and techniques and adopted a populist approach to decoration. He became a consultant to the Board of Overseas Trade, overhauling the lighting and stage management at the Admiralty Theatre of H. M. Government Pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, where he also designed displays.The raid on Zeebrugge an illustrated souvenir of the model display in the Admiralty Theatre of H.M. Government Pavilion, British Empire Exhibition 1924 and 1925 HMSO, (1924). (National Archives.) Retrieved 10 September 2017. The following year, he became a consultant to the British government for the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. J. Lyons and Co. Bernard was consultant artistic director to J. Lyons and Co., defining much of their later house style and designing interiors for their Oxford Street, Coventry Street, and Strand Corner Houses. In 1934 he remodelled the interiors of the Regent Palace Hotel, including the basement bars, restaurants, and the ground-floor coffee room, since named the Titanic Room and worked on the Cumberland Hotel in 1932. Later work Bernard wrote on design and architecture and championed the exploitation of engineering expertise. He worked on furniture design and, from the late 1930s, designed a number of industrial buildings, most notably the Supermarine works in Southampton and the IMCO building on Dublin's south coast built for a dry- cleaning firm, now since demolished. He was involved in founding PEL (Practical Equipment Ltd) and designed the S.P.4 chair for them.Powers (2007)Parker (1984) In print Bernard's work and writing feature in a small number of anthology publications on architecture and design including Benton, Charlotte et al. Art Deco 1910‚Äì1939, (V&A; Publications, 2003) and Le Corbusier and Britain: An Anthology, edited by Irena Murray and Julian Osley (Routledge, 2009). His IMCO building was the subject of a 2012 film by the Irish artist Gavin Murphy, and formed part of a subsequent publication On Seeing Only Totally New Things, that also includes the first comprehensive and illustrated account of Bernard's life and work. Personality and family His former secretary described him as \\"amusing, utterly impossible, kind, and a bully\\". He was a cousin to the actor Stanley Holloway\\"He was the nice one: farewell to Oliver Bernard\\", London Evening Standard, 4 June 2013 (Bernard's father Charles was a brother to Holloway's maternal grandmother), to Holloway's son, the actor Julian Holloway and Julian's daughter, the author and former model Sophie Dahl.Holloway and Richards, pp. 74‚Äì75 Bernard was married twice; first to the singer Muriel Theresa Lightfoot in 1911 (the marriage dissolved in 1924) and then to Edith Dora Hodges (1896‚Äì1950), an opera singer whose stage name was Fedora Roselli, in 1924.

It is a successor to the body of the same name established by an earlier Act of Parliament in 2002. The original KNCHR became operational in July 2003, and following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in August 2010, was legally reconstituted as the Kenya National Human Rights and Equality Commission (under Article 59 of the Constitution). The 2011 legislation restructured the body, assigning the equality function to a new National Gender and Equality Commission and reestablishing the name of the KNCHR. The main mission of the KNCHR, in its successive legal embodiments, has been to investigate and provide redress for human rights violations in Kenya, to research and monitor the compliance of human rights norms and standards, human rights education and training and campaigns, advocate, and collaborate with other stakeholders in Kenya. The KNCHR has six programmes to implement its strategic goals. The KNCHR is led by a Chairperson and four other Commissioners appointed by the President of Kenya after nomination by a selection panel consisting of governmental and non- governmental interests. The current Acting Chairperson is Dr Samuel Kipng'etich arap Tororei who took over from Florence Simbiri-Jaoko whose term of office expired on January 9, 2012. Under the earlier legislation the KNCHR had nine Commissioners, four of whom also left the Commission on January 9, 2012, at the expiry of their terms of office. A new substantive Chairperson is expected to be appointed in November 2012. A Secretariat headed by the Commission Secretary runs the KNCHR's programmatic areas. The mandate of the KNCHR is to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights in Kenya. Although established by the Government, the KNCHR is independent. The KNCHR is a watchdog body. It monitors Government institutions, carries out investigations on alleged human rights violations, and in appropriate cases provides redress to those whose rights have been violated. KNCHR is also an advisory body. The Commission gives advice to the Kenyan Government on how to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights. It also monitors the enactment of legislation in Kenya and recommends existing legislation for review to ensure they comply with human rights standards. The KNCHR's main office is at CVS Plaza, Kasuku/Lenana Road in Nairobi with two regional offices, one in Wajir in the North Eastern province and another in Kitale in the Rift Valley Province launched in September 2007. International status The KNCHR aims to comply with the United Nations-approved Paris Principles on the establishment and functioning of independent national human rights institutions. The Commission has been accredited as an 'A status' institution by the International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC), which is based in Geneva and is supported by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This means that the Commission has been evaluated by its peers as generally in compliance with the Principles. The KNCHR is a member of the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions (NANHRI), the ICC's regional grouping for Africa.

The Nom was formed by a great warlord, Noman, to protect their God, The All and Only. The All and Only has many other names: the Lost Child, the Loving Mother, the Wounded Warrior and the Wise Father. The God lives in the Garden, located on the island of Anacrea, until it is destroyed, when we find that there are multiple gardens. The Noble Warriors do not use weapons or armour; they use only true strength, which is also called Lir. The vow of the noble warriors (which Noman wrote) says they cannot fight wars or conquer land or empires. They cannot love any person above all others, build a lasting home, or possess anything, but can only use their powers to bring freedom to the enslaved and justice to the oppressed. Plot summary Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realises the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.

Produced by Company Pictures for the ITV network, it was created by Tom Grieves and follows a fictional British Royal Family in the aftermath of the death of King James III and the succession of his 24-year-old son, King Richard IV, played by Rupert Evans. It also stars Jane Asher and Zoe Telford. The series was filmed on location in Lithuania in 2007 and broadcast from 14 January to 3 March 2008. It was cancelled after one series due to low viewing figures. Plot On the sudden death of King James III, his 24-year-old elder son, Richard IV, inherits the throne. This causes resentment with his elder sister, Princess Eleanor (Sophie Winkleman), who wants the throne for herself. Her Private Secretary, Major Simon Brooks (David Harewood), helps her in trying to discredit the new king. Richard's younger brother, Prince George (Sebastian Armesto), is a party-animal, while the younger daughter, Princess Isabelle (Nathalie Lunghi), is an A-Level student. Their mother is the now- widowed Queen Charlotte (Jane Asher). Abigail Thomas (Zoe Telford) is Richard's secretary who plans to write a tell-all book about her life in the Palace. Richard's Private Secretary is Sir Iain Ratalick (Roy Marsden). Other staff featured in the series are Abigail's personal assistant Lucy Bedford (Fiona Button) and the Press Secretary Jonty Roberts (Lorcan Cranitch).

Episode!! style=\\"width:120px;\\"Writer !! style=\\"width:120px;\\"Director !! style=\\"width:120px;\\"Ratings !! style=\\"width:120px;\\"Original airdate } Production Tom Grieves initial pitch centred on \\"a woman operating within the shadow of power\\". Ideas for the \\"power\\" included the Prime Minister, Sir Mick Jagger, and Rupert Murdoch before he settled on a fictional royal family. The relationship between the woman and the royal family was modelled on that seen in The West Wing between Jed Bartlet and his staff; Grieves desired to mimic The West Wing \\"talky, aspirational, sophisticated\\" style in his own series. The earliest summaries of the plot placed the focus of the series on a woman who is working undercover at Buckingham Palace with the intent of writing an expos√© of the King's life. The woman (later named \\"Abigail\\") \\"goes native\\" and cancels her book because she falls for the King. The series was written by Grieves, Chris Lang, Charlotte Jones and Toby Whitehouse. Grieves was influenced in his writing by Hamlet; he explored how Richard deals with the \\"ancient, ritualistic institution\\" that he inherits after James dies. The writers deliberately avoided making comparisons to the real royal family, despite the links made by media between Richard and George to Princes William and Harry. Patrick Jephson, the former private secretary to Diana, Princess of Wales, was consulted extensively during production, working with the writing team for over a year. The series was greenlit by ITV in January 2007. Sets were designed by Taff Batley. Batley scouted production locations in Hungary, due to the expense a production the size of The Palace would have if filmed in the UK. A site was eventually found near the dock in Vilnius, Lithuania. Exterior sets of Buckingham Palace were scaled down from their true counterparts because of the length of time full-sized replicas would take to create; the scale sets alone took ten weeks to build. Red gravel for the palace courtyard was mimicked using clay that was bound for a new tennis court under construction nearby. Interior sets were built in an ice skating rink on the other side of the city. They used plasterboard instead of the lighter, cheaper plywood that would have been used on a British-based set. Batley referred to documentary footage to find a basis for his designs of bedrooms and other private areas of the palace that would otherwise not be available for public viewing. The first block of four episodes was directed by Metin H√ºseyin and the second by Maurice Phillips. Reception Prior to the broadcast of the series the pressure group Mediawatch UK called it \\"tawdry and offensive\\", suggesting that viewers would confuse the scripted television characters with the real British royal family. Lord St John of Fawsley called it \\"very near to the bone\\" and Penny Junor, the biographer of Charles, Prince of Wales, suggested ITV is exploiting the royal family by presenting fiction as fact. The Guardian previewed it as one of the top 50 shows (including film, theatre and television) to watch over the Christmas period. After the first episode aired, Nancy Banks-Smith said in The Guardian that The Palace \\"is the TV equivalent of balloon modelling. It feels like being shot to death with popcorn.\\" She also said that \\"I never fail to be amazed when decent actors - Walter, Marsden, Cranitch, Shrapnel - bob up in tosh like this.\\" Andrew Billen said in The Times \\"I am delighted that, as with The Palace, the channel is setting before us something other than a grim regional detective or a comedy drama about suburban adultery. The Palace inhabits an incredible world all of its own. In that respect it is believable: the real palace undoubtedly does, too.\\" James Walton for The Daily Telegraph wrote that for \\"sheer weirdness\\" there \\"was no match at all for The Palace\\". Keith Watson wrote in the Metro said that The Palace \\"pitched itself just right, its tongue-in-cheek study of a faction-riven upstairs clan contrasting with the bitching and backbiting of the downstairs footmen.\\" He concluded his review by saying \\"Much of The Palace may be playing for laughs but it promises a sting in its blue-blooded tale\\". The day after the series ended, Watson wrote \\"I know I'm in a minority here, but I shall miss the Dynasty-style antics of King Rich and his nemesis Princess Eleanor, with Rupert Evans and Sophie Winkleman top hole as scheming royal siblings.\\" Rupert Evans played a very convincing, young King, with all the right flares. Watson called the series a victim of \\"ITV1‚Äôs ratings-crazy drama cull\\", referring to its impending cancellation. In April 2008, ITV announced that The Palace would not be renewed for a second series, due to low viewing figures. The last episode had been watched by 3.1 million people. DVD release The Palace was released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) on 17 March 2008. Notes 1. Ratings for these episodes fell below the Top 30 most-viewed programmes; BARB does not publicly release these figures.

Family A Christian and a scion of the powerful Anician family from Verona, he married Anicia Faltonia Proba, the daughter of his first cousin Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius, by whom he had two sons, Anicius Probinus and Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius. Through his sons, Probus was the paternal grandfather of two Emperors, Petronius Maximus and Olybrius. According to the family tree published by Mommaerts and Kelley, Probus was a son of Petronius Probinus, consul in 341, and \\"Claudia\\"/\\"Clodia\\", a sister of Clodius Celsinus Adelphus. Faltonia Betitia Proba, a Christian poet, was sister to this Probinus and wife of Adelphus. Hermogenianus was a son of Proba and Adelphus.T.S. Mommaerts and D.H. Kelley, \\"The Anicii of Gaul and Rome\\", in John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, Fifth-century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity? (1992), p. 112. The elder Probinus and Proba were children of Petronius Probianus, consul in 322. Mommaerts and Kelley consider his wife to be an \\"Anicia\\", a sister to Amnius Anicius Julianus. Claudia and Adelphus were children of Clodius Celsinus and Demetrias. The eldest Probianus was a son of Petronius Annianus, consul in 314. Mommaerts and Kelley consider his wife to be \\"Proba\\", a daughter of Probus. Probus was married to her first cousin once removed on her father's side Anicia Faltonia Proba (ca 365 - 410-432), daughter of Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius and wife Turrenia Anicia Juliana or Anicia Faltonia Proba, by whom he had three sons, Anicius Probinus, Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Petronius Probus.  Career  Probus' career was one of the most noteworthy in his age. He began as quaestor, and then became praefectus urbanus. He was Proconsul of Africa in 358 and then Praetorian prefect four times: of Illyricum in 364, of Gaul in 366, of Italy, Illyricum, and Africa in 368-375 and again in 383-384; in the meantime, he held the consulship in 371, with Emperor Gratian as colleague. In 372 he defended Sirmium against barbarian attack and in that same year he proclaimed Ambrose governor of Aemilia et Liguria. In 375 Probus was accused of corruption and oppression in extorting taxes for Valentinian I. He served under Emperor Valentinian II, following him at the Eastern court when Magnus Maximus rebelled in the West. His date of death is unknown, though he was still living in 390 when, according to the Vita Ambrosii of Paulinus of Milan, two Persian noblemen presented themselves before Theodosius I at Mediolanum but departed the next day for Rome in order to see for themselves Petronius Probus, the pride of the Roman aristocracy, a legend in his own lifetime.  Tomb  Petronius Probus was buried in a mausoleum built for him by his wife Anicia Faltonia Proba on the Vatican Hill. As the most prestigious burial place beside Saint Peter's tomb in Old St Peter's Basilica had already been occupied by the sarcophagus of Probus's predecessor, the consul and praefectus urbanus Junius Bassus, Probus's mausoleum was constructed immediately outside the western apse of the basilica. Probus was interred at St Peter's many decades before the first pope buried there ‚Äì Pope Leo I ‚Äì was interred in 461, and in a position closer the apostle's tomb than was possible for the imperial Mausoleum of Honorius, attached to the basilica's southern transept in the early 5th century for the burials of the Theodosian dynasty.  Fame  On various inscriptions, Probus is described as \\"the summit of the Anician house\\" (Aniciae domus culmen), \\"most learned in all subjects\\" (omnibus rebus eruditissimus) and \\"the acme of the nobility, the light of literature and eloquence\\" (nobilitatis culmen, litterarum et eloquentiae lumen). These phrases suggest he was a patron of literature, including of the poet Ausonius. His two sons Probinus and Olybrius continued the tradition by being the patrons of Claudian, who paints a flattering picture of Probus in his Panegyricus dictus Probino et Olybrio consulibus written to celebrate his sons' joint consulship in 395. Ammianus Marcellinus portrays him as a vain and rapacious man who \\"owned estates in every part of the empire, but whether they were honestly come by or not is not for a man like me to say\\".Ammianus Marcellinus, History, Book 27, ch.11; The Later Roman Empire selected and translated by Walter Hamilton (Penguin, 1986), p.345). Ammianus adds that Probus was one who was benevolent to his friends and a pernicious schemer against his enemies, servile to those more powerful than him and pitiless to those weaker, who craved office and exercised enormous influence through his wealth, always insecure and petty even at the height of his power.

She was built as MS Silvia Regina in 1981 by W√§rtsil√§ Turku, Finland for Rederi AB Svea for use in Silja Line traffic. The ship joined Stena Line fleet in 1991, originally with the name MS Stena Britannica.  Concept and construction  In the late 1970s Effoa and Rederi AB Svea, two of the owners of the Baltic Sea ferry operator Silja Line, made the decision to order two new, large car/passenger ferries for Silja Line's Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service. The ships were designed to be much larger than the ships that were at the time sailing on the route (built in 1975) and they would be Silja Line's first genuine cruiseferries. During the 70s the French Dubegion-Normandie shipyard in Nantes had been Silja Line's shipyard of choice, with both previous generations of ferries for the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service built there. M/S Aallotar (1972) at Fakta om Fartyg, retrieved 23 August 2007 M/S Svea Corona (1975) at Fakta om Fartyg, retrieved 23 August 2007 However for the new ships, the decision was made to build them in Finland at W√§rtsil√§ Turku shipyards, that was at the time building several large ferries for Silja's main rival Viking Line. Externally the new ships were quite typical ferries of the early 1980s, with large boxlike superstructures. An unusual feature on the ships was a two-deck high panorama window on the front of the superstructure, offering views over the ship's bow. On 21 October 1980, the second of Silja's new ships was launched at W√§rtsil√§'s Perno shipyard. Subsequently, she was towed to W√§rtsil√§'s Turku shipyard where the construction was finished. On 28 April 1981 the ship was named MS Silvia Regina by HM Queen Silvia of Sweden. Twelve days later the ship left on a two-day trial voyage, and on 10 June 1981 she was delivered to her new owners. Instead of being delivered directly to Rederi AB Svea, the ship's new owners were Suomen Yritysrahoitus, who chartered the ship immediately to Svea Line (Finland). M/S Silvia Regina (1981) at Valkeat Laivat Due to this arrangement the ship was registered in Helsinki and not Stockholm, the usual homeport of Rederi AB Svea's ships.  Service history  = 1981‚Äì1991: Silvia Regina= On 12 June 1981, the brand new Silvia Regina was set in Silja Line's Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service, joining her sister MS Finlandia that had been completed some four months earlier. M/S Finlandia (1981) at Fakta om Fartyg The ship carried Rederi AB Svea funnel colours for only a few months, as the company was absorbed into its parent company Johnson Line in the end of 1982. As a result the Silvia Regina had received Johnson Line's blue/yellow funnel colours already before the refit.Valkeat Laivat ‚Äì a photograph of the Silvia Regina with original bow construction but Johnson Line funnel colours, retrieved 11 September 2007 Soon after entering service a major design flaw was discovered in the ships. In order to maximise car carrying capacity, they had been designed with very wide bows that made the ships very difficult to control, especially in poor weather conditions. As a result, both ships were docked at W√§rtsil√§'s Perno shipyard during the winter 1981‚Äì82 and rebuilt with new bows that were notably sleeker along the waterline. The Silvia Regina was docked for bow reconstruction from 13 January onwards. After this was completed, she was again taken to W√§rtsil√§'s Turku shipyard where new cabins were built and repairs were carried on in the ship's restaurants. Following completion of the reconstruction the ship re-entered service in Turku on 3 February, from where she made a crossing to Stockholm, after which she continued on her normal traffic. In 1984 the ship's homeport was changed from Helsinki to Mariehamn. On 21 March 1985 while outside Helsinki the ship's rear on top of the heavy sea ice during a turn, as a result of which the ship listed slightly and a truck trailer overturned on a second truck on the cardeck. There were no other casualties and the ship was able to continue sailing normally. There was a more serious threat to the ship made on 17 August 1986 when a bomb threat was made against the ship in Stockholm. The passengers and crew were evacuated, and to ensure passenger safety they were taken to Turku onboard MS Svea instead of sailing to Helsinki as planned. Later the Silvia Regina departed Stockholm without passengers and resumed normal traffic in Helsinki the following day. In January 1987 Johnson Line purchased the Silvia Regina from Suomen Yritysrahoitus with the cost of 189,862,839 Finnish markka, and moved her under Swedish flag. However the following year Johnson Line sold the ship to Stena Line who chartered her back to Johnson Line until Silja Line's new Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm ships (then still in planning stages) were completed. In the end the new ships were severely delayed, and it was not until the end of May 1991 that the ship stopped sailing for Silja Line. For the last months of her service with Silja she received Silja Line's new funnel colours, with the blue seal that had up until that point been painted to the side of the ship next to the name moved to the funnel.Silvia Regina ‚Äì Stena Britannica ‚Äì Stena Saga at Simplon Postcards, retrieved 23 August 2007 = 1991‚Äì1994: Stena Britannica = After the end of her service with Silja the Silvia Regina sailed from Stockholm to Bremerhaven, Germany where she was taken over by Stena Line on 2 June 1991 and subsequently rebuilt for her new service at Schichau Seebeckswerft AG. During docking the ship was renamed MS Stena Britannica, and on 19 June she entered service on Stena Line's Hoek van Holland ‚Äì Harwich service. = 1994 onwards: Stena Saga = MS Stena Saga in Fredrikshavn, 2019. The ship was not economic to use on the Hoek van Holland ‚Äì Harwich route, and in March 1994 she was moved to the Oslo‚ÄìFredrikshavn route, taking over the route and, confusingly, the name of MS Stena Saga, which in turn took over the Hoek van Holland ‚Äì Harwich route. Initially during winter months the route was extended to Oslo‚ÄìFredrikshavn‚ÄìGothenburg. On 9 August 1995, while en route from Fredrikshavn to Oslo the ship's engines stalled for two hours, during which she lay at anchor to stop the ship drifting towards land. In January 2000 the ship was rebuilt at G√∂taverken Cityvarvet, Gothenburg with amongst other things rear sponsons added. In August 2000 the ship stopped taking passenger cars onboard on the Fredrikshavn‚ÄìGothenburg portion of the route. For the weekend 12‚Äì13 May 2001 the ship was chartered to a music festival in Copenhagen. Between December 2002 and January 2003 the ship was again rebuilt at Cityvarvet. In June 2003 the ship was chartered to the Norwegian football union for a cruise from Oslo to Copenhagen. On 14 June 2005, after departing Frederikshavn for Oslo the smoke detector in one of the generator rooms gave an alarm, and the ship returned to Frederikshavn. Following this, she was kept off service for a week. Between December 2005 and January 2006 the ship was once again rebuilt at Cityvarvet. In early 2008 she was docked at Cityvarvet once again. During this docking the large \\"spoiler\\" was removed from the funnel, reportedly to improve stability, while altering the ship's appearance and causing some dismay from ship enthusiasts in the Nordic Countries. In March 2020 Stena Line announced that it would withdraw the vessel from the Oslo-Fredrikshavn route and terminate the route, citing lack of traffic and missing the important summer season due to the Coronavirus border closures as the main reason. The fate of the vessel remains uncertain and is currently stored in the port of Uddevalla.

It is also used to treat adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. The most common side effect in people with type 2 diabetes is hypoglycaemia, especially when used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin. The most common side effect in people with type 1 diabetes is genital infection, especially in women and a common side effect is diabetic ketoacidosis. It is of the gliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) class. It was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb in partnership with AstraZeneca. In 2017, it was the 259th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Dapagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among adults with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease or other risk factors. It appears less useful than empagliflozin. In the US, it is also indicated for the treatment of adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. In the European Union it is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise * as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. * in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. and for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI ‚â• 27 kg/m2, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. One study found that it had no benefit on heart disease risk or overall risk of death in people with diabetes. Another study found that in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening of heart failure or progression to death from cardiovascular causes, irrespective of diabetic status. Adverse effects Since dapagliflozin leads to heavy glycosuria (sometimes up to about 70 grams per day) it can lead to rapid weight loss and tiredness. The glucose acts as an osmotic diuretic (this effect is the cause of polyuria in diabetes) which can lead to dehydration. The increased amount of glucose in the urine can also worsen the infections already associated with diabetes, particularly urinary tract infections and thrush (candidiasis). Rarely, use of a SGLT2 drug, including dapagliflozin, is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene. Dapagliflozin is also associated with hypotensive reactions. There are concerns it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Dapagliflozin can cause dehydration, serious urinary tract infections and genital yeast infections. Elderly people, people with kidney problems, those with low blood pressure, and people on diuretics should be assessed for their volume status and kidney function. People with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis (acid buildup in the blood) should also be assessed. Dapagliflozin can cause serious cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene) in people with diabetes and low blood sugar when combined with insulin. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA has approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before, and ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. Mechanism of action Dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2) which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminated through the urine. In clinical trials, dapagliflozin lowered HbA1c by 0.6 versus placebo percentage points when added to metformin. Regarding its protective effects in heart failure, this is attributed primarily to haemodynamic effects, where SGLT2 inhibitors potently reduce intravascular volume through osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. This consequently may lead to a reduction in preload and afterload, thereby alleviating cardiac workload and improving left ventricular function. =Selectivity= The IC50 for SGLT2 is less than one thousandth of the IC50 for SGLT1 (1.1 versus 1390 nmol/L), so that the drug does not interfere with intestinal glucose absorption.Schubert- Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, Neue Arzneimittel 2008/2009 Names Dapagliflozin is the International nonproprietary name (INN), and the United States Adopted Name (USAN). There is a fixed-dose combination product dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release, called Xigduo XR. In July 2016, the fixed-dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was approved for medical use in the European Union and is sold under the brand name Qtern. The combination drug was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2017, where it is sold under the brand name Qtern. In May 2019, the fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin hydrochloride as extended-release tablets was approved in the United States to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes when used in combination with diet and exercise. The FDA granted the approval of Qternmet XR to AstraZeneca. The combination drug was approved for use in the European Union in November 2019, and is sold under the brand name Qtrilmet.  History  In 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion on the drug. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Dapagliflozin was found effective in several studies in participants with type 2 and type 1 diabetes. The main measure of effectiveness was the level of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well blood glucose is controlled. In two studies involving 840 participants with type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin when used alone decreased HbA1c levels by 0.66 percentage points more than placebo (a dummy treatment) after 24 weeks. In four other studies involving 2,370 participants, adding dapagliflozin to other diabetes medicines decreased HbA1c levels by 0.54-0.68 percentage points more than adding placebo after 24 weeks. In a study involving 814 participants with type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin used in combination with metformin was at least as effective as a sulphonylurea (another type of diabetes medicines) used with metformin. Both combinations reduced HbA1c levels by 0.52 percentage points after 52 weeks. A long-term study, involving over 17,000 participants with type 2 diabetes, looked at the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease. The study indicated that dapagliflozin's effects were in line with those of other diabetes medicines that also work by blocking SGLT2. In two studies involving 1,648 participants with type 1 diabetes whose blood sugar was not controlled well enough on insulin alone, adding dapagliflozin 5 mg decreased HbA1c levels after 24 hours by 0.37% and by 0.42% more than adding placebo. Dapagliflozin was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2012. It is marketed in a number of European countries. Dapagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2014. In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indications for dapagliflozin to include treatment for adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. It is the first in this particular drug class, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, to be approved to treat adults with New York Heart Association's functional class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Dapagliflozin was shown in a clinical trial to improve survival and reduce the need for hospitalization in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The safety and effectiveness of dapagliflozin were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4,744 participants. The average age of participants was 66 years and more participants were male (77%) than female. To determine the drug's effectiveness, investigators examined the occurrence of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a once-daily dose of either 10 milligrams of dapagliflozin or a placebo (inactive treatment). After about 18 months, people who received dapagliflozin had fewer cardiovascular deaths, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits than those receiving the placebo. In July 2020, the FDA granted AstraZeneca a Fast Track Designation in the US for the development of dapagliflozin to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death in adults following a heart attack. In August 2020, it was reported that detailed results from the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial showed that AstraZeneca‚Äôs FARXIGA¬Æ (dapagliflozin) on top of standard of care reduced the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of cardiovascular (CV) or renal death by 39% compared to placebo (p<0.0001) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church dates from the 14th century with later additions and restorations. It contains one of the few surviving aumbries in Cheshire and a number of memorial boards painted by the Randle Holme family. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Wirral South. Its benefice is combined with that of Holy Trinity Church, Capenhurst. From March 2018 this benefice shares a Vicar with All Saints, Saughall. History The first mention of a church on this site is in the 13th century. Soon after this it was given by the barons of Dunham Massey to the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead. At the dissolution of the monasteries the advowson was passed to the Diocese of Chester. The chancel dates from the 14th century, and the tower from the 15th century. The nave was rebuilt in 1728‚Äì31 and it was remodelled in 1877‚Äì79 by Ewan Christian. A reredos designed by John Douglas was added in 1892. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in sandstone with a slate roof. The tower is in Perpendicular style with a battlemented parapet, crocketted finials and gargoyles. Its west front has a doorway with a three-light window above it. The belfry windows have two lights. The plan of the church consists of a three-bay nave, a chancel, a north vestry and a south porch. In the chancel there is some 14th-century masonry, and the east window dates from about 1375. The windows in the south wall are Perpendicular. The nave had been in the classical style until it was replaced in the 19th century in Gothic revival style. =Interior= The church contains one of the few surviving aumbries in Cheshire. In the nave is a chained bible dated 1617, which has been in the church since the 17th century. An oak chest dating from the early 17th century is made of wood from Chester Cathedral. Over the chancel arch is a painting depicting the Creation. Elsewhere are older wall paintings, including some by Edward Frampton. In the church are six wooden memorial boards painted by members of the Randle Holme family of Chester. Some memorial boards painted by Randle Holme III hanging in this church and elsewhere were executed without the permission of the College of Arms. Between 1667 and 1670 its head, Sir William Dugdale, travelled to the north on at least three occasions to destroy them. However the boards hanging in this church were not located by him and they survive. The parish registers begin in 1562. A monument to Samuel Griffiths who died in 1796 is by E. Spencer of Chester, and a memorial to Baskervyle Glegg, who died in 1843, is by Sanders of London. The two-manual organ is by Franklin Lloyd, to which additions were made by Harry Moulding of Chester around 1970. There is a ring of six bells. Three of these were cast by Richard Sanders in 1714 and the other three by John Taylor and Company are dated 1887, 1889 and 1974. External features In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating possibly from the 18th century. It is a Grade II listed building. Also listed Grade II are the churchyard walls and the gateway to the church, and a table tomb. A doorway in the churchyard dating from Georgian times gives access to the grounds of Backford Hall.

The south fork of San Pedro Creek became a trout farm, operated by John Gay, until 1962, when storm rains washed out the entire operation. Today the south fork is a seasonal water source for the City of Pacifica. San Pedro Creek is also notable as the only major steelhead trout habitat for between San Francisco and Half Moon Bay, supporting fish of up to two feet in length. More recently, the Middle Valley has been used for grazing on its hillsides and commercial farming in the meadows, with crops of pumpkins and artichokes. San Pedro Creek Watershed The river has eight sources and three major tributaries, the Mid Fork, North Fork and South Fork. Draining a watershed of , the lower portions of the stream were modified according to the local land uses, initially agriculture, and in the 1950s, suburban development. This involved straightening of the stream and elimination of wetlands and the reclamation of the former Lake Mathilda at the lower western zone with landfill. These changes, coupled with an increase of impermeable surface in the watershed has caused an increase in peak runoff levels, flooding and erosion of deeply incised channels up to deep. Most of the upper watershed is protected by San Pedro Valley County Park a park which has three perennial creeks, the south and middle forks of San Pedro Creek, and Brooks Creek. During the rainy, winter months, a special attraction is the beautiful Brooks Falls, which has a drop of in three tiers. Ecology Fog drip is a key to the rich diversity of species in the San Pedro Valley, most likely providing up to one-third of the annual available moisture in this ecosystem and keeping the cool, clear forks of San Pedro Creek running all year. Montara Mountain and Sweeney Ridge are not cloaked in the dense Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) typical of the rest of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the immediate south. The early Spanish settlers described the ridges of the headwaters as without tall trees. The only tall trees were planted recently and include eucalyptus, Monterey pine and Monterey cypress. The area from Montara Mountain north to the Golden Gate represent a unique bio-geographic unit dubbed the \\"Franciscan Landscape\\" which is primarily Coastal Scrub dominated by Coyote Brush and also sheltering unique endemic species found nowhere else. The Hazelnut Trail in San Pedro Valley County Park is a good place to see these unusual species which include Giant Golden Chinaquapin, Montara Manzanita, Fetid Adders-tongue, and California Hazelnut. These and other plants such as Wake robins, Coast and Giant trillium, Slender false solomon's seal, and Fetid adder's tongue blossom between clustered stems of shrubs and clumps of sword fern. Fetid adder's tongue‚Äîwith its mottled green leaves, brown-purple striped flowers, and odor of rotting flesh‚Äîis particularly abundant. The fact that these species normally grow in the shady understory of redwood and Douglas fir forests, has led to speculation that prior to the 5,000 year occupation of the Ohlone Indians, who likely burned off the area to promote the growth of natural food sources, that the upper San Pedro watershed may have been host to primordial conifer forests. Creek Dogwood, Arroyo Willow, Watercress, and several species of ferns are common in the middle and lower creeks. In the springtime, the meadows of the Middle Valley show off an array of wildflowers: California Poppies, Suncups, Buttercups, Wild Radish and Wild Mustard. Wildlife is abundant at San Pedro Valley. Park inhabitants often seen are red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Quail, Scrub Jays, and Garter Snakes. Those observed less frequently include Deer, Bobcats, Grey Fox, Raccoons, Rabbits and Gopher Snakes. The three forks of the San Pedro and its Brooks Creek tributary provide critical spawning areas for steelhead trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). The steelhead spawning season is normally from December to February. Pollution In 1999, a group Pacifica residents formed the nonprofit San Pedro Creek Watershed Coalition, with the goal of protecting and enhancing the health of the San Pedro Creek and watershed. Their activities include monitoring, restoration, adaptive management, and education programs. The monitoring program has joined with a monitoring program of the Environmental Protection Agency, started in 1998, to track and identify sources of pollution in the creek. A year 2000 comprehensive study, in cooperation with the San Francisco State University Masters program reviewed the in-stream chemical, physical and biological qualities of the creek. A key finding of the study was that fecal bacteria levels in the North Fork and Main Stem of San Pedro Creek significantly exceeded the acceptable levels of exposure for recreation per the State of California and the EPA. The recreation use level is pertinent due to beach closures for recreational uses, including surfing, near the creek's mouth on the Pacific Ocean. The highest pollution levels were found during the wet season and were located at downstream sites during the highest during runoff events. The dominated pollution was E. coli traced to avian sources, but also significant association with dogs, human, horse, raccoon and deer. During the dry season the ratio of sources still was primarily avian, but raccoons and dogs become more dominant. Restoration Projects In 2005, the City of Pacifica completed a Capistrano Fish Passage restoration of the of stream bed, including the restructuring of the Capistrano Bridge culvert. The improved culvert, in addition to a system of weirs and pools restored the ability of juvenile fish to travel upstream through this portion of the creek in 2005. In light of the historical problem of flooding, with large damaging floods occurring in 1962, 1972 and 1982 the City of Pacifica completed an ambitious five million dollar five year reconstruction project for the lower segment of San Pedro Creek in May 2005. This San Pedro Creek Flood Control Project which, in conjunction with the renovation adjacent stretches of the Pacifica State Beach, won the top national award from the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association for the year 2005.

After academic studies, he studied the craft of stained glass for eight years under Max Ingrand, along with his cousin Jean Gourmelin. He then started drawing cartoons and became an illustrator for many French journals, including Plexus, Planet, Hara-Kiri, Lui, Pariscope and La Vie Electrique. He also began illustrating books. The first was Asunrath, a work of fantasy, published by Losfeld. He incorporated his interest in the fantastic into many of his early lithographs, which were published, sometimes exclusively, in many countries including Japan and Germany. He also participated in both group and solo exhibitions. In 1969 he met Jack Claude Nezat, and they became friends. Nezat wrote numerous articles devoted to his art and his work and organized two exhibitions in Germany in 1975 and 1976-1977 that met with great success. This relationship also allowed Serre to work with the magazine Pardon. Serre, meanwhile, started drawing cartoons on such topics as medicine, sports, automobiles and DIY, and his first book of cartoons, Black Humor and Men in White, satirising medical professionals, was published in 1972 by Editions Gr√©sivaudan. The book won the Black Humor prize. A number of similar themed books in the same vein were published by Gl√©nat of Grenoble. He also continued to work as an illustrator and worked in particular on books by Francis Blanche and Frederic Dard, author of the San Antonio series.

He was regarded as a formidable ruckman and is well remembered for his physical clashes with other players, especially Graham Moss. Boucher was nicknamed \\"Roo\\" by his team mates and wore the number 5 guernsey for his career at Swan Districts. He debuted for Swan Districts in 1971 and retired in 1984. Originally from the North Albany Football Club, Boucher moved to Perth in 1971 to begin his playing career. During the first five years at Bassendean Boucher was regarded as a gentle giant who rarely used his strength to his advantage and after a disappointing 8 game season he left the club in 1976 to play football in the Swan Valley. John Todd was appointed as the senior coach at Swan Districts in 1977 and enticed Boucher back to the club in 1978 to be developed further as a ruckman. During this time Boucher became more aggressive on the field and could dominate as a knock ruckman and as a strong marking forward. Swan Districts were transformed during this period and went on to play in the 1980 Grand Final (losing to South Fremantle) in which Boucher played an outstanding game. The team then won the WAFL Grand Final in 1982 and 1983. Boucher won the fairest and best award at Swan Districts Football Club in 1982 and was selected in the Swan Districts Team of the Century.

Biological pacemakers are indicated for issues such as heart block, slow heart rate, and asynchronous heart ventricle contractions. The biological pacemaker is intended as an alternative to the artificial cardiac pacemaker that has been in human use since the late 1950s. Despite their success, several limitations and problems with artificial pacemakers have emerged during the past decades such as electrode fracture or damage to insulation, infection, re-operations for battery exchange, and venous thrombosis. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature newborn babies, where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem. A more biological approach has been taken in order to mitigate many of these issues. However, the implanted biological pacemaker cells still typically need to be supplemented with an artificial pacemaker while the cells form the necessary electrical connections with cardiac tissue. History The first successful experiment with biological pacemakers was carried out by Arjang Ruhparwar 's group at Hannover Medical School in Germany using transplanted fetal heart muscle cells. The process was first introduced at the scientific sessions of the American Heart Association in Anaheim in 2001, and the results were published in 2002. A few months later, Eduardo Marban's group from Johns Hopkins University published the first successful gene-therapeutic approach towards the generation of pacemaking activity in otherwise non-pacemaking adult cardiomyocytes using a guinea pig model. The investigators postulated latent pacemaker capability in normal heart muscle cells. This potential ability is suppressed by the inward-rectifier potassium current Ik1 encoded by the gene Kir2 which is not expressed in pacemaker cells. By specific inhibition of Ik1 below a certain level, spontaneous activity of cardiomyocytes was observed with resemblance to the action potential pattern of genuine pacemaker cells. Meanwhile, other genes and cells have been discovered, including heart muscle cells derived from embryonic stem cells, \\"HCN\\" genes which encode the wild type pacemaker current I(f). Michael Rosen's group demonstrated that transplantation of HCN2-transfected human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) leads to expression of functional HCN2 channels in vitro and in vivo, mimicking overexpression of HCN2 genes in cardiac myocytes. In 2010, Ruhparwar's group again demonstrated a type of biological pacemaker, this time showing that by injection of the \\"Adenylate Cyclase\\" gene into the heart muscle a biological cardiac pacemaker can be created. In 2014, a gene called TBX18 has been non-invasively applied to speed up heart rates caused by heart block. More recent studies in 2015, has been experimented optogenetic approach in the rats heart, where a light sensitive transgene (Channelrhodopsin-2) injected to several sites of rat's ventricular, which, furthermore, can simultaneously stimulate the injection sites by a blue light irradiation.

It was elevated as a metropolitan archdiocese on April 28, 1934, with the dioceses of Dumaguete, Maasin, Tagbilaran, and Talibon as suffragans. Before being raised as a primatial church in Cebu, the church was one of the first churches in the Philippines (besides the Basilica del Santo Ni√±o) dedicated to St. Vitalis and built near the fort in April 1565 by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, Fray Andr√©s de Urdaneta and Fray Diego de Herrera.Astrid Sala-Boza, ‚ÄúThe Contested Site of the Finding of the Holy Child: Villa San Miguel or San Nicolas (Cebu El Viejo),‚Äù Philippine Quarterly of Culture Society 34, (2006): 232. www.jstor.org/stable/29792595 Construction of the cathedral took many years due to frequent interruptions, brought about by lack of funds and other unexpected events.\\"Cebu Cathedral\\" At one time, funds meant for the building of the cathedral were diverted to the Moro wars. The death of an incumbent bishop who spearheaded the construction/reconstruction and vacancies in the office were also factors. The architecture of the church is typical of Spanish colonial churches in the country, namely, squat and with thick walls to withstand typhoons and other natural calamities. The facade features a trefoil-shaped pediment, which is decorated with carved relieves of floral motifs, an IHS inscription and a pair of griffins. The Spanish Royal Coat of Arms is emblazoned in low relief above the main entrance, reflecting perhaps the contribution of the Spanish monarch to its construction. During World War II, much of the cathedral was destroyed by Allied bombings of the city. Only the belfry (built in 1835), the fa√ßade, and the walls remained. It was quickly rebuilt in the 1950s under the supervision of architect Jose Ma. Zaragosa, during the incumbency of Archbishop Gabriel Reyes. In 1982, a mausoleum was built at the back of the sacristy at the initiation of Archbishop Julio Cardinal Rosales.http://cebuheritage.net It serves as a final resting place for the remains of Cebu's bishops and clergy. Cardinal Rosales, who died three months after inauguration of the mausoleum, is interred there along with Archbishop Manuel Salvador, a coadjutor archbishop of Cebu, Archbishop Mariano Gaviola, the archbishop of Lipa (1981‚Äì1993), and most recently, Cardinal Rosales' successor, Ricardo Cardinal Vidal. The remains of Bishop Juan Bautista Gorordo, the first Filipino and Cebuano bishop of Cebu, are also interred there. The cathedral was renovated for the 75th anniversary celebration on April 28, 2009, of the elevation of Cebu into an archdiocese. An application is pending at the Vatican for the cathedral's elevation into a minor basilica in honor of St. Vitalis, an early Christian martyr. His feast day coincides with the day the image of the Sto. Ni√±o de Cebu was found almost 450 years ago, as well as the anniversary of the elevation of Cebu into an archdiocese. The present cathedral rector and moderator of the team of pastors is Reverend Monsignor Ruben C. Labajo, P.C., who was appointed in 2014. He succeeded Msgr. Roberto F. Alesna, P.A., who was named moderator of the team of pastors of the Archdiocesan Shrine and Parish of Saint Therese in Barangay Lahug, Cebu City. Endowed with the status of a full-fledged parish, the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral comprises the civil barangays of Tinago, San Roque, Santo Ni√±o, T. Padilla, Day-as, Tejero, and Parian, all located in the southeastern and downtown area of Cebu City. History =Church of Saint Vitalis= Before dispatching to the Philippines, Legazpi was mandated to build a church near the assigned fort by the Spanish crown.The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803, vol. 2, eds. Emma Helen Blair, James Alexander Robertson (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1903), 98 [Hereafer cited as The Philippine Islands]. When the Spaniards landed in Cebu, it was the feast of Saint Vitalis (April 28, 1565) and ‚Äú[t]hey honored the saint as their patron and advocate. His feast is kept every year, and his day observed.‚ÄùJuan de Medina, OSA, Historia de la Orden de San Agustin de estas Islas Filipinas, in The Philippine Islands, vol. 23, eds. Emma Helen Blair, James Alexander Robertson (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1903), 159 [Hereafer cited as Medina's Historia]. On May 8, 1565, ‚Äú'[t]he sites for the Spanish quarters and the church [of St. Vitalis] were chosen' and the site of the house where the Sto. Ni√±o was found 'as the site of the Monastery of the Name of Jesus [now Basilica del Santo Ni√±o] . . . and from the said house the child Jesus was brought to the... church in solemn procession, and with the great devotion, rejoicing, and gladness of all the men. Arriving at the church, they all adored it, and placed it on the principal altar, and all vowed to observe, sanctify, and celebrate solemnly as a feast day each year, the day on which it had been found.'‚ÄùThe Philippine Islands, 121. Juan de Medina, prior of the Sto. Ni√±o convent (circa 1603), alluded to the days of discovery of the Sto. Ni√±oMedina's Historia, 170. and said the tradition was continued that the image was ‚Äútaken out, and carried in procession to the cathedral, after a paper has been signed, by decree of the justice, that it will be given back to the same religious.‚Äù Medina's Historia, 159. It is known that the first church is the cathedral now because by 1598 there were two churches besides it in Cebu: San Nicolas (founded in 1584) and the Sto. Ni√±o convent to which the two churches would administer the natives, while the first Cebu bishop Pedro de Agurto would cater to the Spaniards in the St. Vitalis Church chosen as the cathedral.‚ÄúConvento del Santo Ni√±o de Cebu (Datos para su Historia),‚Äù in Archivo Historico Hispano-Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provencia del Smmo. Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas, Vol. 6, 172. When Cebuana anthropologist Astrid Sala-Boza effectively settled the controversy of the site where the image of the Holy Child was found, she also showed the metropolitan cathedral as the first erected church. Many times the church was destroyed and rebuilt, even being raised as cathedral it suffered many destruction. =Cathedral of Saint VitalisJose Eleazar Bersales, = 1598. Bishop Pedro de Agurto (1591‚Äì1608), an Augustinian, arrives in Cebu from Mexico, following his appointment as the Diocese of Cebu's first Bishop. He starts to reside in the cathedral. 1665. Bishop Juan Lopez writes the King of Spain requesting that an encomienda with an annual income of 2,000 pesos be assigned to the diocese to subsidize construction of a new cathedral. It is approved five years later. A royal grant of 10,000 pesos is also added, to be given on a staggered basis over the next 10 years. 1689. Having accumulated 17,718 pesos from the encomienda and royal grant, Bishop Diego de Aguilar (1680‚Äì92) begins the construction of a cathedral. A typhoon soon destroys the incomplete structure. His successor, Bishop Miguel Bayod (1696‚Äì1700) decides to build the foundations for another cathedral. 1692. The annual encomienda income of at least 2,000 pesos assigned to the diocese of Cebu is withheld, putting a heavy toll on the cathedral construction project. 1699-1700. Following a decree, the governor-general sends Juan Antonio de Ayco (reportedly the only mason in Cebu) and master-carpenters Jeronimo Quibon and Jacinto Caba to assess the construction project to estimate how much it would cost to finish it. Probably due to the absence of a competent assessor, the accounting is very confused, with no correct estimate as to how much had already been spent. What is known is that materials for the construction were reportedly already in place, like stones for the pavement, molave beams and posts, and various timbers. 1700. Following the death of Bishop Bayod, the construction of the cathedral is halted. 1719. Bishop Sebastian de Foronda (1723‚Äì1728) describes the cathedral as \\"nothing but a barn overrun by plants and grasses.\\" He sees the futility of continuing the old construction due to its dimensions. He later orders the demolition of the old cathedral. 1719. Juan de Ciscara, a military engineer in Cebu (probably at the invitation of the bishop), draws up plans for a new cathedral. The Ciscara plan shows a rectangular form with three naves and two collateral chapels, suggesting the arms of a transept, and twin bell towers flanking the fa√ßade. 1720. With the appointment of a new alcade mayor of Cebu appreciative of the Bishop's concerns over the cathedral, preparations for the fourth attempt at construction, now estimated at 70,523 pesos begins. Materials are gathered and laborers contracted when the new mayor receives an order from Manila to use all disposable funds for the Moro-suppression effort in Mindanao, thus causing the abandonment of the new project. At this time, the alcadia of Cebu owes the diocese 35,336 pesos from the suspended encomienda subsidy. 1733. Bishop Manuel de Osio y Ocampo (1733‚Äì1737) commences the fifth attempt at construction of the cathedral begins under the direction of Lazaro Buyco, a master-builder based in Cebu. Some 40,000 blocks of stones are gathered and cut as 10,000 cavanes of lime are stored. The project does not see much headway and progress is slowed down because the foundations of the new cathedral had to be dug deeper as the area on which it stands is far too soft and wet, requiring more time and more money. The new cathedral is now estimated to cost P50,000 to P60,000 more in order to be finished. 1737. Bishop Ocampo dies and construction ceases. The diocese is once again placed under the administration of the Manila Archdiocese while awaiting the appointment of a new bishop. Fr. Miguel Angel Rodriguez, now assigned to oversee the project deems the planned Cebu cathedral as too big for the diocese and decides to cease its construction altogether. 1741. Bishop Protasio Cabezas (1741‚Äì1752) assumes as the eleventh bishop of Cebu. He resumes the construction of the cathedral which, against all odds, continues until 1784. April 28, 1767. Bishop Miguel Lino de Espeleta (1759‚Äì1771) sends a letter to the King of Spain informing him of the need for 90,000 pesos to build the cathedral. The bishop also reminds the king of a promise made by his predecessors, apparently referring to the stalled amortizations on payments accrued from the income of the encomienda. As a final appeal, the bishop requests if funds could obtained from Mexico as well as the other islands under the Diocese of Cebu. June 7, 1785. Bishop Joaquin de Arevalo (1776‚Äì1787), successor to Espeleta, informs the king that the amount of 8,000 pesos left by his predecessor to continue work on the cathedral was not enough. The construction, however, is now not only plagued by lack of funds but also by the near-absence of available labor in the city to work on the church. 1786. The fa√ßade and principal portions of the new cathedral is finished. Construction now takes on a much more regular pace. Ruins purportedly from a previous construction attempt beside the southern part of the existing cathedral fronting D. Jakosalem St., (formerly Calle del Norte America) circa 1903 1815. Bishop Joaquin Encabe de la Virgen de Sopetran (1805‚Äì1818) consecrates the cathedral which he dedicates to the Holy Angels of Custody even as construction never comes to completion and deterioration due to the elements creeps gradually. 1829. Bishop Santos Gomez Mara√±on (1829‚Äì1840) begins his term of office. He deems the cathedral far too deteriorated to be useful and begins plans for a reconstruction. The bishop, better known as priest-builder, supervises the construction of the churches of Oslob and Naga, the Episcopal Palace across the cathedral, the bell tower of Argao and the convent of Sibonga (and most probably the cathedral convent) during his reign. 1863 Following a letter by Bishop Romualdo Jimeno (1846‚Äì1872) to Governor General Rafael Echague on the urgent need to repair the cathedral, an architect, Don Domingo de Escondrillas, who is connected with the Office of Public Works based in Cebu is ordered to do a plan for the widening of the cathedral. In his plan, Escondrillas proposes tearing down of the walls of the cruceros and the main altar in order to follow the Greek cross style. The arches are also extended so that it can accommodate 1,400 people more than the 4,300 residents that can be accommodated inside the church. The altar mayor is moved so that it can be seen from any point inside the church. Included in the plan is the renovation of the sacristy. All these would cost 33,298 pesos which Escondrillas describes as economical and will make the church worthy of the honor of being the seat of the Diocese of Cebu. December 11, 1865. The Administracion Central de Rentas Estancadas de Filipinas authorizes the release of 66,546 escudos for the enlargement of the cathedral by authority of Queen Isabella. 1878-1879. The demolition of the Parian church nearby increases the number of churchgoers (and proceeds from offerings) to the cathedral. The church has had a strained relationship with the cathedral due to its patronage by the local mestizo Chinese elite who lived in and around Parian district, making the church the richest in the diocese. 1886. The cleric Felipe Redondo y Sendino publishes Breve Rese√±a de lo que fue y de lo que es la Diocesis de Cebu en Islas Filipinas and provides a description of the cathedral in the book: ‚ÄúThe Cathedral has thick and strong walls made of mamposteria (rubblework) of 3 varas; it‚Äôs crucero measures 73.91 meters in length and its sacristy 17.67 meters in width with the interior part having 12.35 meters in length and its front walls with 21.36. The roofing is made of clay tiles; there is also a spacious sacristy which keeps paintings of the Bishops of the Diocese and a wide ante-sacristy with a room on the upper portion where the religious vessels are kept. Its belfry is also made of mamposteria in three levels reaching 28 meters in height and decorated with a clock.\\" December 7, 1891. Bishop Martin Garcia Alcocer consecrates the first stone of the new cathedral of Cebu, probably the seventh construction-reconstruction attempt. The project proceeds in earnest but is halted with the onset of the Revolution of 1898. 1904. Bishop Thomas Hendrick (1904‚Äì1909), the only American bishop of Cebu, continues the cathedral rebuilding project started by his predecessor. 1909. Bishop Juan Bautista Gorordo (1909‚Äì1932) begins his ministry marked by the completion of the cathedral construction. 1933. Following the elevation of the diocese into an archdiocese and the consecration of the new archbishop Msgr. Gabriel Reyes (1932‚Äì1950), the cathedral undergoes renovation. The project is supervised by Chinese Cebuano engineer Gavino Unchuan based on plans made by Cebu and Manila architects Eulogio Tablante Jr., Felino C.T. Lepon and Julio Ancheta. During the renovation, the retablo of the 1860s is torn down and replaced with a simple altar made of Carrara marble imported from Italy. Above the marble altar are placed three stained glass windows portraying the archangels Michael and Gabriel with the Lord in the center. The fa√ßade is extended to the camarin delos campaneros or the enclosed passageway to the belfry which used to be the bell-ringer's quarters, thus making the church look even bigger. The entire church is also plastered with cement covering the walls which are painted later. 1940. The newly renovated cathedral is consecrated by Archbishop Gabriel Reyes. September 12, 1944.
