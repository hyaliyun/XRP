It consists of fine particles of carbide cemented into a composite by a binder metal. Cemented carbides commonly use tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC), or tantalum carbide (TaC) as the aggregate. Mentions of \\"carbide\\" or \\"tungsten carbide\\" in industrial contexts usually refer to these cemented composites. Most of the time, carbide cutters will leave a better surface finish on the part, and allow faster machining than high-speed steel or other tool steels. Carbide tools can withstand higher temperatures at the cutter-workpiece interface than standard high-speed steel tools (which is a principal reason for the faster machining). Carbide is usually superior for the cutting of tough materials such as carbon steel or stainless steel, as well as in situations where other cutting tools would wear away faster, such as high-quantity production runs. Composition Cemented carbides are metal matrix composites where carbide particles act as the aggregate and a metallic binder serves as the matrix (like gravel aggregate in a matrix of cement makes concrete). Its structure is thus conceptually similar to that of a grinding wheel, except that the abrasive particles are much smaller; macroscopically, the material of a carbide cutter looks homogeneous. The process of combining the carbide particles with the binder is referred to as sintering or hot isostatic pressing (HIP). During this process, the binder eventually will be entering the liquid stage and carbide grains (much higher melting point) remain in the solid stage. As a result of this process, the binder is embedding/cementing the carbide grains and thereby creates the metal matrix composite with its distinct material properties. The naturally ductile metal binder serves to offset the characteristic brittle behavior of the carbide ceramic, thus raising its toughness and durability. By controlling various parameters, including grain size, cobalt content, dotation (e.g., alloy carbides) and carbon content, a carbide manufacturer can tailor the carbide's performance to specific applications. The first cemented carbide developed was tungsten carbide (introduced in 1927) which uses tungsten carbide particles held together by a cobalt metal binder. Since then other cemented carbides have been developed, such as titanium carbide, which is better suited for cutting steel, and tantalum carbide, which is tougher than tungsten carbide. Physical properties The coefficient of thermal expansion of cemented tungsten carbide is found to vary with the amount of cobalt used as a metal binder. For 5.9% of cobalt a coefficient of 4.4 ¬µm¬∑m‚àí1¬∑K‚àí1 is found, whereas the coefficient is around 5.0 ¬µm¬∑m‚àí1¬∑K‚àí1 for a cobalt content of 13%. Both values are only valid from to , but more data is available from Hidnert. Applications=Inserts for metal cutting= Tungsten-carbide inserts Carbide is more expensive per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide cutting tip itself is often in the form of a small insert for a larger tipped tool whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon tool steel. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many lathe tools and endmills. In recent decades, though, solid- carbide endmills have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above). Insert coatings To increase the life of carbide tools, they are sometimes coated. Five such coatings are TiN (titanium nitride), TiC (titanium carbide), Ti(C)N (titanium carbide-nitride), TiAlN (titanium aluminium nitride) and AlTiN (aluminium titanium nitride). (Newer coatings, known as DLC (diamond-like carbon) are beginning to surface, enabling the cutting power of diamond without the unwanted chemical reaction between real diamond and iron.) Most coatings generally increase a tool's hardness and/or lubricity. A coating allows the cutting edge of a tool to cleanly pass through the material without having the material gall (stick) to it. The coating also helps to decrease the temperature associated with the cutting process and increase the life of the tool. The coating is usually deposited via thermal CVD and, for certain applications, with the mechanical PVD method. However, if the deposition is performed at too high temperature, an eta phase of a Co6W6C tertiary carbide forms at the interface between the carbide and the cobalt phase, which may lead to adhesion failure of the coating. =Inserts for mining tools= Mining and tunneling cutting tools are most often fitted with cemented carbide tips, the so-called \\"button bits\\". Artificial diamond can replace the cemented carbide buttons only when conditions are ideal, but as rock drilling is a tough job the Cemented Carbide button bits remain the most used type throughout the world. =Rolls for hot- roll and cold-roll applications= Since the mid-1960s, steel mills around the world have applied cemented carbide to the rolls of their rolling mills for both hot and cold rolling of tubes, bars, and flats. =Other industrial applications= This category contains a countless number of applications, but can be split into three main areas: * Engineered components * Wear parts * Tools and tool blanks Some key areas where cemented carbide components are used: Spinning blade of a table saw cutting wood at an angle * Automotive components * Canning tools for deep drawing of two-piece cans * Rotary cutters for high-speed cutting of artificial fibres * Metal forming tools for wire drawing and stamping applications * Rings and bushings typically for bump and seal applications * Woodworking, e.g., for sawing and planing applications * Pump pistons for high-performance pumps (e.g., in nuclear installations) * Nozzles, e.g., high-performance nozzles for oil drilling applications * Roof and tail tools and components for high wear resistance * Balls for ball bearings and ballpoint pens =Non-industrial uses=Jewellery Tungsten carbide has become a popular material in the bridal jewellery industry, due to its extreme hardness and high resistance to scratching. Given its brittleness, it is prone to chip, crack, or shatter in jewellery applications. Once fractured, it cannot be repaired. History The initial development of cemented and sintered carbides occurred in Germany in the 1920s. ThyssenKrupp says [in historical present tense], \\"Sintered tungsten carbide was developed by the 'Osram study society for electrical lighting' to replace diamonds as a material for machining metal. Not having the equipment to exploit this material on an industrial scale, Osram sells the license to Krupp at the end of 1925. In 1926 Krupp brings sintered carbide onto the market under the name WIDIA (acronym for = like diamond).\\" Machinery's Handbook gives the date of carbide tools' commercial introduction as 1927. Burghardt and Axelrod give the date of their commercial introduction in the United States as 1928. Subsequent development occurred in various countries. Although the marketing pitch was slightly hyperbolic (carbides being not entirely equal to diamond), carbide tooling offered an improvement in cutting speeds and feeds so remarkable that, like high-speed steel had done two decades earlier, it forced machine tool designers to rethink every aspect of existing designs, with an eye toward yet more rigidity and yet better spindle bearings. During World War II there was a tungsten shortage in Germany. It was found that tungsten in carbide cuts metal more efficiently than tungsten in high-speed steel, so to economise on the use of tungsten, carbides were used for metal cutting as much as possible. The name became a genericized trademark in various countries and languages, including English (widia, ), although the genericized sense was never especially widespread in English (\\"carbide\\" is the normal generic term). Since 2009, the name has been revived as a brand name by Kennametal, and the brand subsumes numerous popular brands of cutting tools. For the sake of clear communication, the reviving of the Widia brand may naturally further discourage use of the generic sense.. Uncoated tips brazed to their shanks were the first form. Clamped indexable inserts and today's wide variety of coatings are advances made in the decades since. With every passing decade, the use of carbide has become less \\"special\\" and more ubiquitous. Regarding fine-grained hardmetal, an attempt has been made to follow the scientific and technological steps associated with its production; this task is not easy, though, because of the restrictions placed by commercial, and in some cases research, organisations, in not publicising relevant information until long after the date of the initial work. Thus, placing data in an historical, chronological order is somewhat difficult. However, it has been possible to establish that as far back as 1929, approximately 6 years after the first patent was granted, Krupp/Osram workers had identified the positive aspects of tungsten carbide grain refinement. By 1939, they had also discovered the beneficial effects of adding a small amount of vanadium and tantalum carbide. This effectively controlled discontinuous grain growth. What was considered 'fine' in one decade was considered not so fine in the next. Thus, a grain size in the range 0.5‚Äì3.0 Œºm was considered fine in the early years, but by the 1990s, the era of the nano-crystalline material had arrived, with a grain size of 20‚Äì50 nm. =Pobedit= Pobedit () is a sintered carbide alloy of about 90% tungsten carbide as a hard phase, and about 10% cobalt (Co) as a binder phase, with a small amount of additional carbon. It was developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, it is described as a material from which cutting tools are made. Later a number of similar alloys based on tungsten and cobalt were developed, and the name of 'pobedit' was retained for them as well.the free dictionary: pobedit Pobedit is usually produced by powder metallurgy in the form of plates of different shapes and sizes. The manufacturing process is as follows: a fine powder of tungsten carbide (or other refractory carbide) and a fine powder of binder material such as cobalt or nickel both get intermixed and then pressed into the appropriate forms. Pressed plates are sintered at a temperature close to the melting point of the binder metal, which yields a very tight and solid substance. The plates of this superhard alloy are applied to manufacturing of metal-cutting and drilling tools; they are usually soldered on the cutting tool tips. Heat post-treatment is not required. The pobedit inserts at the tips of drill bits are still very widespread in Russia.

The port is located at Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, which is operated by Indonesian state owned PT Pelindo II. The port loaded and unloaded 6.2 million, 6.92 million, and 7.8 million TEUs of cargo during 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, out of a total capacity of about 8 million TEUs. The container port ranked as 22nd busiest in the world by Lloyd's One Hundred Ports 2019. History The earliest record mentioning Jakarta as a coastal settlement and port can be traced to the Indianized kingdom of Tarumanagara as early as the fourth century. In AD 39, King Purnawarman established Sunda Pura as a new capital city for the kingdom, located at the northern coast of Java. Purnawarman left seven memorial stones with inscriptions bearing his name spread across the area, including the present-day Banten and West Java provinces. The Tugu Inscription is considered the oldest of all of them. After the power of Tarumanagara declined, all of its many territories, including Sunda Pura, became part of the Kingdom of Sunda. The harbour area were renamed Sunda Kelapa as written in a Hindu monk's lontar manuscripts, which are now located at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University in England, and travel records by Prince Bujangga Manik. By the 14th century, Sunda Kelapa became a major trading port for the kingdom. The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 when the Portuguese were looking for a route for spices, especially black pepper. A new harbor was needed for Dutch East Indies to replace the Sunda Kelapa harbor to the west that was too small for the increased traffic resulting from the opening of the Suez Canal. Construction on the Port of Tanjung Priok began in 1877 along with Tanjung Priuk railway station and other supporting facilities. The construction of the new harbor was started by Governor General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge (1875-1881). The new harbor was named Tandjong Priok. Several facilities were built to support the function of the new harbor, such as the Tanjung Priuk Station (1914).Cobban, James L. 1985. \\"The ephemeral historic district in Jakarta\\".

Port extension (New Priok Terminal) A ship docking at the port The port was among the least efficient in all Southeast Asia, with turn-around times 6 times that of Singapore, and severely congested due to slow customs handling, as well as limited port capacity. In regard to the port capacity, two-phase \\"New Priok\\" extension project is currently ongoing, which is expected to be fully operational in 2023. When fully operational this New Priok Port (which is also known as Kalibaru Port) will increase annual capacity of Tanjung Priok more than triple. Annual capacity will increase from five million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers to 18 million TEU and the port will be able to facilitate triple-E class container ships (with an 18,000 TEU capacity) in a 300 meters wide two- way sea lane. The first phase of the project was completed in 2016, which has helped to improve the performance of the port. The dwelling time in the port, which was once seven days, was reduced to almost three days. With eight cranes that can move 30 containers per hour and berths that can dock ships with a draft of as much as 16 meters, the new terminal which is known as NPT 1, can accommodate container ships with capacity up to 15,000 TEUs. The terminal has a land area of 32 hectares and the length of the dock is 450 meters. A joint venture between state-run port operator Pelindo II and a Japan-Singapore consortium handled the project under PT New Priok Container Terminal 1 ( NPCT1 ). Description MS Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft docked at Port of Tanjung Priok in the early-1930s. The Port of Tanjung Priok has 20 terminals: general cargo, multipurpose terminal, scraps terminal, passenger terminal, dry bulk terminal, liquid bulk terminal, oil terminal, chemicals terminal and three container terminals, 76 berths, a quay length of 16,853 metres, a total storage area of 661,822 m2 and a storage capacity of 401,468 tonnes. Marunda terminal PT Karya Citra Nusantara (KCN) operates Marunda port, which is built to reduce burden of bulk handling of Tanjung Priok port terminals. Pier 1 of this port has been operating since 2018. Another two pier is under- construction. Once completed the port will be able to handle about 30 to 35 million tons of bulk per year from 50 ships. The port will have three pier/docks with total length of 5,350 meters and a supporting area spreading over 100-hectares of land.

Cobb \\"Judge Priest\\" short stories featured in The Saturday Evening Post in the 1910s, specifically \\"The Sun Shines Bright\\", \\"The Mob from Massac\\", and \\"The Lord Provides\\". Ford had adapted some of the same material in 1934 in his film Judge Priest. That film originally had a scene depicting an attempted lynching of Poindexter (and Priest‚Äôs condemnation of the act), but it was cut by 20th Century Fox. The omission was one of the reasons Ford loosely reshaped the Cobb stories two decades later as The Sun Shines Bright for Republic Pictures, this time including Judge Priest's defusing of the mob determined to lynch a young black character named Woodford. In both films, Stepin Fetchit plays the part of Judge Priest's assistant, Poindexter. Ford often cited The Sun Shines Bright as his favorite among all his films, and in later years, it was championed by critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum and Dave Kehr, who called it \\"a masterpiece\\". Plot In post-reconstruction United States, Black sheep Ashby Corwin returns to his native Kentucky on a steamboat. He encounters young Lucy Lee, ward of Dr. Lake, and is struck by her beauty. In court, Judge Billy Priest, who is a candidate for reelection to his post, adjudicates a number of cases, including finding a job for \\"Uncle Plez\\" Woodford's idle nephew, U. S. Grant Woodford. Ashby learns that while old General Fairfield is said to be the grandfather of Lucy, he denies it. On the street, after Lucy is the subject of insults by Buck Ramsey about her true heritage, Ashby gets into a whip fight with Buck before the judge comes by and puts a stop to it. Lucy eventually discovers who her real mother is: a prostitute recently returned to town. Meanwhile, the daughter of Rufe Ramsuer is assaulted and young Woodford is blamed and arrested, causing racial tensions to rise and a large lynch mob to form. Violence seems imminent until Judge Priest confronts the mob at the jailhouse and defuses the confrontation with an eloquent and brilliant argument. Later, Rufe's daughter points to Buck as being her true attacker. It is election day. Those in the lynch mob realize that Judge Priest has saved them from themselves, and they vote for him en masse, producing a tie with the other candidate, Horace K. Maydew (played by Milburn Stone). It is pointed out to the judge that he hasn't yet remembered to cast a ballot himself, so he wins reelection by a single vote: his own.

In large part it is covered by the tundra, although in the immediate vicinity of the Sermersuaq ice sheet it gradually becomes exposed, barren, and largely devoid of life. The climate is polar continental, with the area receiving very little rainfall.Allmetsat Isunngua is a calving site for reindeer.  Geography  Isunnguata Sermia glacier forming the northern boundary of the Isunngua highlands Meltwater canyon in Isunngua Isunngua is notable for a gravel road which leads through it towards the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet, located east of Kangerlussuaq, and due to trivial approach it remains a popular tourist target, although very few hikers make the journey on foot, or explore the neighboring glaciers. The highland is bounded from the north by the Isunnguata Sermia glacier, from the south by Russell Glacier and Aajuitsup Tasia lake, and from the west by Sanningasoq twin lake. Both glaciers flow to the west from the ice sheet, which constrains Isunngua from the east. The average height of the highland hills is approximately . The highland is dotted with freshwater lakes, kettles, and meltwater outflow lakes saturated with glacial silt.  Road to the ice sheet  In the spring of 2000 the Swedish construction group Skanska's Greenlandic subsidiary completed six months' work in establishing a road for the testing company Nausta, which operates a testing site in northern Sweden. The road runs through the glacial valley of Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua, from Kangerlussuaq to the edge of the permanent inland ice in Isunngua. A road stretching was laid on the inland ice. Nausta built the facility to complement the winter testing done by Volkswagen in northern Sweden and Finland.Explore North, Volkswagen Testing Cars in Greenland The site at Kangerlussuaq was primarily used in the summer half of the year, from April through October. The entire testing ground was used to test cars' performance in extreme cold and conditions of near-zero friction. The cars were flown from Europe to Kangerlussuaq, and then driven to the proving grounds after last-minute checks. This project was abandoned and from 2006 the road leading to the edge of the ice cap is maintained for tourist purposes only, though access to the last segment of the road is limited and requires a key to open the padlocked gate. Ice activity has demolished the inland ice segment of the road, and it now ends in Isunngua, on the edge of the ice sheet.

Before the Second World War Henry was built in 1907 for the Swedish company √Öngfartygs-A/B Nornan of Gothenburg. She sailed for her original owner until she was sold to Egil Krogh in Norway in 1925. After she was sold to the Norwegian company her tonnage was changed from 604 to 628 gross tons. Following the German invasion of Norway in 1940 she came under German overall control, continuing to sail along the coast of occupied Norway. Sinking In the evening of 13 February 1944 Henry was sailing along the coast near Hustadvika Bay by Hestskj√¶r Lighthouse off the port of Kristiansund in M√∏re og Romsdal county. She was carrying a cargo of rocks from the Aust-Agder town of Ris√∏r northwards along the coastline. In addition to the Norwegians on board Henry she carried four German Army Gefreiters.Hegland 1989: 154 At 1837hrs the SS Irma, a Hurtigruten passenger ship that had just overtaken Henry, was struck and sunk by what later turned out to be torpedoes fired from MTB 627, a Royal Norwegian Navy Motor Torpedo Boat. As Henry launched two of her lifeboats she too was torpedoed, by the other Royal Norwegian Navy Motor Torpedo Boat present, MTB 653. One of the two lifeboats were brought ashore at Hestskj√¶r Lighthouse by the lighthouse keeper and later brought into Kristiansund. Two of Henrys crewmen were lost in the ship's sinking, her captain John Olav Gustav Dommersnes and the stoker Johan W√•ge Larsen. The loss of the two civilian Norwegian ships were utilised heavily in propaganda by the Germans and the Norwegian national socialist collaborator party Nasjonal Samling. One of the main uses of the incident in Nazi propaganda was in a recruitment drive aimed at convincing Norwegian sailors to join the German Kriegsmarine.Hegland&Lilleheim; 1998: 97 The Nazi propaganda machinery blamed the British Royal Navy for sinking Henry and Irma, it only becoming known after the war that Royal Norwegian Navy vessels were behind the operation that sank the two ships. Controversy The sinking of Irma and Henry has been controversial ever since the Second World War, with disagreements over the exact nature of the events. The Royal Norwegian Navy remains adamant that Irma and Henry were without lights or national markings and were sailing as a convoy escorted by a German naval trawler.Hegland 1989: 153Voks√∏ 1994: 402 This has been disputed by the survivors of Irma and Henry. The MTB crews also claimed that Henry took evasive action after Irma was hit, while the survivors claimed that she had stopped to launch two of her lifeboats to assist the survivors from Irma when she herself was hit and sunk. One explanation for the presence of the naval trawler reported by the crews of MTB 627 and MTB 653 has been fronted by several researchers. In the Hustadvika area was a small tugboat, the Hopplafjord, which rescued survivors after the sinking of the two ships. Hopplafjord, being similar to a naval trawler in size and profile, may have been misinterpreted as an escort vessel by the MTB commander. Post-war memorial Henry was honoured together with Irma 16 September 2002 when King Harald V of Norway unveiled a monument to the people lost on the two ships, and led a memorial ceremony at sea near the site of the 1944 sinking of the two vessels.

Ltd. in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England. She was delivered to the Norwegian passenger ship company Det Bergenske Dampskibsselskab of Bergen in 1905. Irma sailed for the company until she was attacked and sunk by two MTBs belonging to the Royal Norwegian Navy on 13 February 1944. Before the Second World War pack ice off Svalbard sometime in the 1920s After delivery, Irma served on the Bergen-Newcastle route until she was transferred to Norway in the autumn of 1921 to carry out tourist voyages to the North Cape and Spitsbergen in the summer seasons. In 1927, she was put on the Norway-Hamburg route, replacing SS Neptun and SS Mira. A new heating system was installed in 1913 and wireless radio in 1914. Irma had a new streamlined rudder put in place in 1928. In 1931, she joined the Hurtigruten route in Norway, replacing SS Hera after the latter's shipwreck in March that year.Bakka 1993: 57 Irma was rebuilt that year and once again the year after that. In a series of upgrades she received a refrigeration system in 1933, improved navigational equipment in 1938 and an echo sounding device in 1939. Irma was a very popular ship amongst her passengers, with her smoking salon receiving particular praise. She had only one serious accident in the pre-war years, which occurred when she hit a reef off Kabelv√•g in the Lofoten islands in 1937. Although suffering leaks in her port side, Irma managed to make port in Kabelv√•g and put ashore all of her 120 passengers. Repairs were carried out at a shipyard in Bergen. Second World War=Troopship duties= Following the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet Winter War in late November 1939 Norway reinforced her northern border forces and Irma was dispatched from the Nordland port of Mosj√∏en on 11 December 1939, transporting a load of Norwegian troops to the border with the Soviet-occupied Finnish district of Petsamo. The troops transported on Irma belonged to the first battalion of Infantry Regiment 14. Initially the orders from the military had been that the entire battalion was to board Irma for the journey to Finnmark, even though the ship was only certified to carry less than half the number of people involved. After vivid protests from both soldiers and officers over safety concerns and overcrowding, the original plan was abandoned and only half the battalion shipped off on Irma, the other half transported days later on the fellow Hurtigruten steamer .Skogheim&Westrheim; 1984: 106-108 The incident with Norwegian conscripts being subjected to attempts at forcing them to board an overcrowded ship led to a public outcry in Mosj√∏en. The Mosj√∏en- based newspaper Helgeland Arbeiderblad published an article shortly after the incident criticizing the Norwegian military leadership's handling of the troop transport. When the German invasion of Norway was initiated on 9 April 1940, Irma was at Bergen,Bakka 1993: 65 one of the Norwegian cities captured by German forces that day. She continued to sail along the Norwegian coast with passengers and freight during the German occupation of Norway. =Last voyage= On 13 February 1944 Irma was sailing northwards from Bergen to Trondheim under the command of Captain Sofus Str√∏mberg.Hegland 1989: 154 That day she had a 43 strong crew and was carrying 40 Norwegian passengers as well as probably seven Germans.Voks√∏ 1994: 402 Her cargo consisted of freight, mail and 1,800 tons of herring. Sinking At 1837hrs Irma, sailing in Hustadvika Bay by Hestskj√¶r Lighthouse off the port of Kristiansund in M√∏re og Romsdal, was attacked by and . She suffered a large explosion in the bow area. The initial explosion, which caused massive damage, was followed by another amidships shortly thereafter, the ship immediately starting to sink. During the incident Irma was in the same area as the 1907 Norwegian cargo ship SS Henry. Henry was sunk shortly after Irma. In addition to what turned out to be torpedo strikes the two ships were subjected to in total 2,034 rounds of heavy machine gun fire. Sixty-one civilian Norwegians died on Irma, another two on Henry. Only 25 people survived the sinking of Irma and for days afterwards dead bodies washed ashore on the Norwegian coast as far north as Namsos. Before Henry was sunk she had been able to launch two of her lifeboats and these first saved several of their own crewmen before moving to the location where Irma had gone down and rescuing some survivors from floating rafts. About an hour into the incident the tugboat Hopplafjord passed the scene and rescued further survivors from rafts. The fishing boat Svegg√∏y also rescued 12 survivors from a raft after the sinking. Irmas sinking constituted the last major loss for the Hurtigruten service during the Second World War, with numerous coastal passenger ships having up to that point been lost to mines, air and submarine attacks since the April 1940 German invasion of Norway. The wreck of Irma was discovered by a geological survey vessel on 3 November 1999 north of Aver√∏y at a depth of . Reactions to the sinking of Irma and Henry Haakon VII to the sinking of civilian Norwegian ships. The first official word to come out about the sinking of Irma and Henry in Norway was from the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk on 15 February 1944. The national socialist newspaper used the word Skjendselsd√•d () in the headline. The next day, 16 February, Fritt Folk stated that British Motor Torpedo Boats had been responsible for the attack. Only after the end of the Second World War did it become known that the ships responsible belonged to the Royal Norwegian Navy, MTB 627 sinking Irma and MTB 653 sending Henry to the bottom. The two warships had been towed from Shetland to Hustadvika by the converted whaler HNoMS Molde, departing Shetland on 11 February, and were on a mission to intercept German and German-controlled shipping. The loss of Norwegian lives in the incident was exploited by the Nasjonal Samling propaganda machine, Thorleif Fjeldstad of the party's naval arm calling for Norwegians to join the ranks of the Kriegsmarine.Hegland&Lilleheim; 1998: 97Sivertsen 2001: 48 As was also the case with the Hurtigruten ship SS Sanct Svithun sunk the previous year, and SS Bar√∏y sunk in 1941, Irma was depicted on one of the three postage stamps commemorating war-related shipwrecks released on 20 May 1944 by the Norwegian Postal Service. Irma was portrayed on the 20 √∏re stamp. The shipwreck stamps were designed by German-born Norwegian pro-Nazi propaganda artist and war reporter Harald Damsleth.Engdal 2006: 200 Controversy The sinking of Irma and Henry has been controversial ever since the Second World War, with disagreements over the exact nature of the events. The Royal Norwegian Navy remains adamant that Irma and Henry sailed without lights or national markings and were sailing as a convoy escorted by a German naval trawler.Hegland 1989: 153 This has largely been disputed by the survivors of Irma and Henry. All Allied forces were under strict orders not to attack Norwegian coastal liners travelling alone on the Norwegian coast. The MTB crews also claimed that Henry took evasive action after Irma was hit, while the survivors claimed that she had stopped to launch two of her lifeboats to assist the survivors from Irma when she herself was hit and sunk.

Post-war memorials The sinking of Irma and Henry received an official memorial on 16 September 2002 when King Harald V of Norway first attended a church service in Bremnes Church together with bishop Odd Bondevik, and then unveiled a memorial monument at R√∏eggen on the island Sveggen in Aver√∏y listing the names of the 65 Norwegians who lost their lives in the incident. The day's events concluded with the King leading a ceremony with around 180 invited guests on board the Hurtigruten ship MS Midnatsol at the site of the shipwrecks. Two Royal Norwegian Navy Motor Torpedo Boats participated in the ceremony by lowering a flower wreath into the water.

In the forum, the Foreign Minister of Kenya had stated that \\"Kenya values its friendship with Pakistan\\" and that \\"Kenya expresses the desire for further deepening of economic and commercial ties between the two countries.\\" The High Commissioner of Kenya, Mishi Mwatsahu, also appealed to Pakistani businessmen that \\"they should consider Kenya an attractive country to tap for investment, as Kenya is a gateway for Pakistani investors to enter the big market of 38 African states, which are landlocked to Kenya that has an international seaport of Mombasa.\\" She also further said that \\"Kenya would fully support Pakistani investors in exploring the potential areas of investment in Kenya. She said Kenya has established the ‚ÄòOne Stop Window‚Äô facility for foreign investors to facilitate them and making business processes easier for them.\\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=156211 In response, the Commerce Minister of Pakistan welcomed Kenya's aims to strengthen its ties with Pakistan and further stressed the need for exchange of information, business delegations and regular participation in each other's trade fairs. He also pointed out that both the countries should lower down the tariff and non- tariff barriers to expand the trade. In this respect, he hoped that both the countries would be able to make progress in their negotiations on the Preferential Tariff Agreement (PTA). There are also at least 2,000 Pakistanis who reside in Kenya. In other areas of contention, Pakistan disputed Kenya's claim on the disputed region of the Sudanese border conflicts. But since South Sudan gained independence in 2011 Islamabad changed her stance and supported Kenya instead and rejected Juba's claims.

Biography=Early life= Charles Harper was born on 15 July 1842 at Nardi, near Toodyay in Western Australia. His father was Reverend Charles Harper, a Church of England minister, and his mother, Julia Gretchem Harper n√©e Lukin. He was educated privately. =Pastoral career= He took up farming in Beverley, Western Australia. In 1861 and again in 1864, he explored with other pioneers in the Yilgarn district. From 1866, he was heavily involved in the pastoral industry. He was a pastoralist in the north-west of the state until 1868, overlanding to Geraldton in 1867 to secure provisions for Roebourne. From 1868 to 1870, he was involved in the pearling industry. He then briefly farmed at Beverley, before returning to the north west in 1871. He went into partnership with McKenzie Grant and Edgar in a de Grey sheep station, and was involved in the pearling industry until 1879. =Political career= On 28 March 1878, he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council for the North District, in a by-election occasioned by the resignation of Thomas Burges. He held the seat until the election of 12 March 1880, which he did not contest. On 1 March 1879, he married Fanny de Burgh, thereby becoming brother-in-law to Henry Brockman and James Morrison. They would have six sons and four daughters. In 1880, he partnered with Alexander McRae in a pastoral venture on the Ashburton. That year, he also became a newspaper proprietor for the first time, becoming part owner of The Western Australian Times with John Winthrop Hackett. On 18 November 1879, the newspaper was renamed The West Australian. On 19 December 1885, they launched publication of the Western Mail. On 27 October 1884, he entered parliament for the second time, having won the seat of York. In 1885, he built a home in Guildford, which he named Woodbridge House; the house still stands and is now part of the National Trust. In 1887, he was a member of the Agricultural Commission. He held his Legislative Council seat until 21 October 1890, at which time the Legislative Council became fully nominative. He then contested and won the seat of Beverley in the Legislative Assembly. From June 1894, he was Father of the House in the Legislative Assembly. In 1895 he opened a school at Guildford, which would later be taken over by the Church of England as Guildford Grammar School. He was appointed Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Assembly on 24 August 1897, holding the appointment until 2 December 1903, when he took up an appointment as Speaker. He stepped down as Speaker on 28 July 1904, and from his seat on 27 October 1905. In 1905, he was chairman of the Immigration Commission. =Death= He died at Woodbridge on 20 April 1912, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

Brazil maintains an embassy in Baghdad and Iraq maintains an embassy in Bras√≠lia. Both countries are full members of the Group of 77. Brazil was the first Latin American country to reopen its embassy in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War. History Brazil first established diplomatic relations with Iraq in 1967, and in late 1973, Brazil opened an embassy in Iraq and signed cooperation agreements with Iraq. In 1975, because of the deepening petroleum crisis and in search of petrodollar investments, Brazil favoured its foreign policy towards the Arab cause in three crucial votes in the UN. Brazil's military government upgraded its representation in Iraq by appointing a succession of four-star generals as ambassadors to Baghdad. Brazil and Iraq had been major trading partners since the late 1970s. Brazil needed oil to run its industrial machine. Iraq needed food, technical support, appliances, automobiles and, perhaps most important, the \\"defensive\\" weapons made by Brazil. Brazil's relations with Iraq were downgraded during the Gulf War, when Brazil supported the U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed against Iraq. However, since 2001, both countries resumed relations, in which the Brazilian government wanted to promote closer commercial ties with Baghdad and announced the re-activating of its embassy in Baghdad. In the 1980s, Brazil was an important supplier of industrialized products to Iraq, and it imported significant volumes of oil from Iraq. At that time, trade between the two countries reached up to 4 billion U.S. dollars per year. When the Iran‚ÄìIraq War broke out in 1980, nearly 35 percent of Brazil's oil imports were coming from Iraq. In 1981 it had been reported that Brazil had sold low-grade uranium ore to Iraq. The Brazilian newspaper Jornal da Tarde reported that about 40 Brazilian scientists were in the Osirak power plant during the 1981 Israeli bombing.Brazil Uranium Sales To Iraq Stir Debate =The Iraq‚ÄìKuwait conflict= The Gulf War, which resulted in Operation Desert Storm in early 1991, placed Brazil in a very delicate position. United States congressional subcommittees accused Brazil of exporting technology and expertise to Iraq to develop a missile based on the Piranha missile (MAA-1). Retired Air Force Brigadier Hugo Oliveira Piva had taken a private group of Brazilian technicians to Baghdad to complete this project; under pressure, the Collor government ordered the group's return to Brazil. During Operation Desert Storm, a Brazilian construction company, Mendes J√∫nior, had several hundred workers and technicians, as well as several million dollars worth of equipment, in southern Iraq working on railroad and irrigation projects. Thus, Brazil, unlike Argentina, did not participate in the Allied operation. The Brazilian government had to dispatch its key negotiator, Ambassador Paulo de Tarso Flecha de Lima, from his post in London to negotiate the release of the Mendes J√∫nior personnel from Iraq and the disposition of the equipment. Brazil was awarded a US$5 billion price and performance in supplying its Os√≥rio tank to Saudi Arabia in 1990, but the Kuwait conflict changed the decision in favor of the United States Abrams tank. =Iraq War 2003= Brazilian Ambassador Bernardo de Azevedo Brito to Iraq said although Brazil did not support the U.S.-led military invasion of Iraq in 2003, which deposed former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, does not mean it does not wish to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq.

He was born into a wealthy and noble family of Split, as a descendant of Croaticised Italian family of Cavagnini. Kavanjin rose to prominence at the same time as Ignjat ƒêurƒëeviƒá: at the beginning of the 18th century. He was married to the sister of John Peter Marchi. In 1703 Kavanjin became a member of the Illyrian Academy Marchi founded in 1703. In his summer mansion on Sutivan, on the island of Braƒç, where he retired after military and legislative career, Kavanjin wrote the most voluminas poetical work in the whole Croatian literature (approx. 32 500 verses): Poviest vanƒëelska bogatoga a nesretna Epuluna i ubogoga a ƒçestita Lazara, usually referred to by the later editors, according to the subtitle in the original, as Bogatstvo i ubo≈°tvo. This religious-philosophical epic is poetically inconsistent but stylistically marked (it is written, beside Split ƒåakavian, in Ijekavian‚ÄìIkavian ≈†tokavian). Expressing the spirit of philosophical movements of the 17th and 18th centuries, this \\"encyclop√¶dia in verses\\" (Josip Aranza) directs its Baroque spirituality towards the cogitation on life and human essentiality in the dual nature of the human and the divine. Beside the classical humanistic, Latinate and Italian literatures (Dante), the Bible and other religious writings, and beside the historical authors (Constantine Porphyrogenitus, priest of Duklja, Mavro Orbini), writings of the Old Dubrovnik have constituted the basic Kavanjin's reading list, above others Junije Palmotiƒá and Ivan Gunduliƒá. Kavanjin identified with Slavs and Dalmatia, and John Fine interprets his pan-Slavism and Dalmatianism close to have been an ethnic notion.When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods. University of Michigan Press, 2006. P. 287. Besides this pan-Slavism, which produced in him the identity that came closest to being ethnic, Kavanjin exhibited the noted \\"Dalmatianism\\". This local \\"Dalmatian\\" identity was the only competitor \\"Slavic\\" had. And, after all, as he said, Dalmatia was his homeland. And two such identities could easily co- exist and both could have \\"ethnic\\" ingredients. Kavanjin died in Split, aged 73.

They currently record under the name R. Missing.  Formation and early work  Shy and Toppy founded the Ropes as a duo in 2005 after meeting as interns at a record label. According to Shy, \\"While most people seem to bond over things they both like, I think it was a very long shared list of dislikes that kept our initial conversations going.\\" They briefly began performing with a full band in 2006, but after describing working with other band members as ‚Äúa living hell,‚Äù they chose to officially be a duo in early 2008.

The Ropes toured throughout the US and UK, opening for acts such as Crocodiles, Innerpartysystem,The Bravery, Chapel Club and Sunday Girl. The band's second and final LP as the Ropes was Post-Entertainment, released in February 2013. In an IndieRay interview, the duo explained the title: \\"Post-entertainment is an examination of artist vs. entertainer. They are not one and the same. They are mutually exclusive.

In response to the National Debate, Ministers established a Curriculum Review Group in November 2003 to identify the purposes of education for the 3-18 age range and to determine key principles to be applied in a redesign the curriculum. Its work resulted in the publication in November 2004 of the document A Curriculum for Excellence.

In Scotland, councils and schools both have some responsibility for what is taught in schools and they must also take national guidelines and advice into account. A review was undertaken by the OECD, having been commissioned by the Scottish Government to look at the broad general education. Qualifications New qualifications were set out in 2014 by the Scottish Qualifications Authority to meet with the Curriculum for Excellence. The new qualifications are National 1, National 2, National 3, National 4, National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher which replaced the former Standard Grade. Criticism Before its introduction, many within the Scottish teaching profession, including the teachers' trade union The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) and its members, believed that the Curriculum for Excellence was vague, in particular regarding its supposed 'outcomes and experiences'. There existed a fear that this imprecision would result in a lack of clarity in what was expected of teachers in the classroom and in the assessment of pupils' progress and attainment. The original concerns led one of the most educationally successful Scottish local authorities, East Renfrewshire, to delay implementation of the secondary school phase of the new curriculum by one year. Some Scottish independent schools, including St Aloysius' College, in Glasgow, chose to do likewise.

Stambolian was a key figure in the early gay literary movement that came out of New York during the 1960s and 1970s. He was best known as the editor of the Men on Men anthologies of gay fiction. Stambolian graduated from Dartmouth College and carried out graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, earning a Ph.D. in 1969 with a dissertation that was subsequently published as Marcel Proust and the Creative Encounter (1972). From 1966 until his retirement in 1991, Stambolian was a professor in the Department of French at Wellesley College, where he taught courses on French language and literature. He wrote and edited Twentieth Century French Fiction: Essays for Germaine Br√©e (1975) and, with Elaine Marks, Homosexualities and French Literature (1979). Men on Men: Best New Fiction, edited by Stambolian and including an introduction he wrote, was published by New American Library (Plume) in 1986. The anthology featured the work of some prominent gay authors of that period as well as others less well established. The critical acclaim accorded this volume and its popular success led to the publication of three sequels which Stambolian likewise edited and introduced. He was awarded the 1990 Lambda Literary Award in the category Gay Men's Anthologies for editing Men on Men 3. The fourth of these anthologies was released after his death in December 1991 from complications of AIDS at the age of 53. Stambolian's parents were Armenian immigrants, and he explored his Armenian heritage in a short story entitled \\"In My Father's Car\\" in the third volume of Men on Men. He inspired the gay Armenian American character in Armistead Maupin's Maybe the Moon.

After its limited release five years later in the United States, it was one of five films to win the 1956 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. Plot The film, based on pre-Christian Finnish mythology and Sami shamanism, is set in Finnish Lapland and centers on a young woman, Pirita. In the snowy landscape, Pirita and reindeer herder Aslak meet and soon marry. Aslak must spend time away for work, leaving his new bride lonely. In an effort to alleviate her loneliness and ignite marital passion, Pirita visits the local shaman, who indeed helps her out; but in the process turns her into a shapeshifting, vampiric white reindeer.

Panaad is the Hiligaynon word for \\"vow\\" or \\"promise\\" coming from the root-word saad; the festival is a form of thanksgiving to Divine Providence and commemoration of a vow in exchange for a good life. The celebration is held at the Panaad Park, which also houses the Panaad Stadium, and is participated in by the 13 cities and 19 towns of the province.

Hershberger (December 3, 1896 - December 29, 1989) was an American Mennonite theologian, educator, historian, and prolific author particularly in the field of Mennonite ethics. Life Born in Johnson County, Iowa, to Ephraim D. and Dorinda Kempf Hershberger, Hershberger was one of nine children. He was baptized in 1909 at his home congregation of East Union Amish Mennonite Church, where Sanford Calvin Yoder was pastor. He began work as an educator immediately out of high school in 1915 as a teacher in rural schools, where he remained for five years until his marriage to Clara Hooley on 1 August 1920. They had two children who survived into adulthood; Elizabeth (Bauman), born in 1924, and Paul, born 1934. Hershberger then pursued further education, first in the form of an undergraduate degree at Hesston College and then a MA and PhD at the University of Iowa, where his dissertation was on Quaker Politics in Colonial America. All the while he worked first as a teacher at Heston Academy (1923‚Äì24) and then began his long career as a professor of history, sociology, and ethics at Goshen College (1925‚Äì1966). In addition to his work as an educator, Hershberger served as chairman of the (Mennonite Church) Committee on Economic and Social Relations (Industrial Relations) from 1939-1965. In 1959, he joined the Mennonite Church's Peace Problems Committee. He played a pivotal role in founding Mennonite Mutual Aid and the Mennonite Community Association. He helped to found The Mennonite Quarterly Review where he was an editor from 1963‚Äì1965 and was on the board of the Mennonite Historical Society, The Mennonite Quarterly Review, and Studies in Anabaptist and Mennonite History. Hershberger was the preeminent Anabaptist-Mennonite historian of his generation. After spending part of his retirement in Phoenix, AZ, Hershberger returned to Goshen where he died in 1989. He was survived by his wife, Clara and two children, Elizabeth and Paul. Thought and legacy Throughout his work, Hershberger maintained a strict biblicalism. It was in part due to Jesus' call to love one's enemies that Hershberger made one of his most foundational distinctions. He called for Mennonites to practice nonresistance, which is separate from nonviolent resistance. While some would argue for pacifism as a method of combating injustice, Hershberger thought that most nonviolent resistance went too far. He rejected violence but was also deeply skeptical about utilizing coercion. According to Hershberger, strikes, boycotts, and demonstrations often lacked love for one's enemies. However he also believed that the individual and the church had to put their beliefs into practice to validate them. it was important to note that in this way, his committee work and church responsibility were the embodiment of his ethical theology. Hershberger added an academic legitimacy to Mennonite thought. Along with Harold S. Bender, he was important in promoting Mennonite Historical Studies and establishing a scholarly Mennonite ethical conversation. His personal records are held at the Mennonite Church USA Archives.

The magazine was headquartered and published in Honolulu, Hawaii. Pacific Magazine was published bi-monthly from 1976 until July 2008, when it transitioned to a completely online magazine. The magazine remained the oldest continuously published regional magazine in the Pacific Islands region at the time of its suspension of publication on January 1, 2009. The magazine's readership grew to include subscribers outside of the Pacific Islands region, including Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East.  History  Pacific Magazine was founded in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1976. The magazine was purchased by TransOceanic Media, a subsidiary of the AIO Group, from its former publisher, Bruce Jensen, in May 2000. Pacific Magazine distributed approximately 7,500 copies throughout the Northern Pacific region, and an additional 7,500 copies through a former competitor based in Fiji as of July 2001. TransOceanic Media expanded the magazine's monthly readership to a circulation of more than 35,000 following its acquisition. TransOceanic Media also launched Pacific Magazine's web-based news service. The Pacific Magazine site took news stories from across the Pacific Islands and Asia-Pacific region. The site published stories from other Pacific news services, such as Tahitipresse and Oceania Flash, as well as from regional or national newspapers from across the Pacific. Pacific Magazine published its last print edition to date in July 2008. The magazine's editors and staff began to focus exclusively on its web site, which included an archive of past stories and an almanac of important Pacific Island people. Giff Johnson, the magazine's foreign correspondent based in Majuro, Marshall Islands, was named the interim managing editor in 2008 to supervise Pacific Magazine's transition from print to a strictly online magazine. The Pacific Magazine web site continued to draw over 50,000 unique visitors per month in 2008. On October 1, 2008, Fijian journalist Ulamila Kurai Wragg was appointed the new managing editor of Pacific Magazine. She replaced interim editor, Giff Johnson. Wragg, who was previously the Cook Islands correspondent for Pacific Magazine, worked as the managing editor from her home base in Rarotonga. As part of the 2008 editorial leadership shake-up, Pacific Magazine publisher Floyd Takeuchi became the magazine's \\"Publisher- Editor\\", working in conjunction with Wragg to develop the magazine's new editorial direction. The senior management team which Wragg joined also included Florence Betham, the magazine's associate publisher who hailed from Tafuna, American Samoa. Still, the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009, which hit hardest towards the end of the 2008, apparently continued to decrease the advertising revenue collected by Pacific Magazine. = Suspension of publication = Pacific Magazine suspended all operations on January 1, 2009 after 32 years of continuous publication, either in print or online. The magazine's publisher, Floyd Takeuchi, cited the ongoing global financial crisis for the suspension. Takeuchi stated that he expected the financial crisis to continue for the foreseeable future, making the company unable to continue publication \\"at the same level of quality.\\" Pacific Magazine's correspondents and journalists, who are based throughout the Pacific Islands region, were informed of the magazine's planned suspension in early December 2008. The suspension of operations left open the possibility that Pacific Magazine could be relaunched in the future once economic conditions improve.

The cartoon was released on October 14, 1967, and introduced the series' final star, Cool Cat. It marked a major change of direction for the then recently reformed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Animation, as the first cartoon in a long time to introduce a major new character (virtually every Looney Tunes cartoon made in the previous three years had been ones featuring Daffy Duck versus Speedy Gonzales, or Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, the latter were gone in 1966), who would go on to be the studio's most prolific character between then and the studio's final shutdown in 1969. It was also the first cartoon to feature the redesigned opening and closing titles with the \\"W7\\" logo, and a new version of the opening theme. Synopsis A big game hunter named Colonel Rimfire is visiting an African jungle in his robotic elephant, Ella, but bemoans the fact that he hasn't seen anything worth shooting since he arrived. Shortly afterwards he comes across the title character, Cool Cat, a beret-wearing cool-looking tiger, who is walking through the jungle with a parasol. Seeing Cool Cat, Rimfire remarks \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat! A tiger- type puddy tat!\\" and pursues him while hidden inside Ella. He eventually blasts Cool Cat with a shotgun hidden in Ella's trunk, but Cool Cat bends over to sniff some flowers right as the shotgun fires, and Rimfire only succeeds in destroying his parasol. Cool Cat mistakes Ella for an actual elephant and warns \\"her\\" that someone's shooting at them and that they should flee, which Cool Cat proceeds to do. Rimfire misinterprets this as Cool Cat warning him that someone else is attacking both of them, and tries to pilot Ella to safety, only to drive over the edge of a cliff and fall into a chasm. Rimfire irately pushes Ella up the edge of the chasm back up to the jungle above, and Cool Cat helps Ella up to the top, not noticing Rimfire's presence, and accidentally knocks the hunter back into the chasm. Still thinking that Ella is a real elephant, Cool Cat leads her away by her trunk to demonstrate some survival skills, while Rimfire climbs out of the chasm for a second time. As Cool Cat leads Ella through the jungle, an amorous male elephant gives chase to Ella, but is then caught by Rimfire who makes the opposite mistake to Cool Cat and assumes that the male elephant is in fact Ella. After yanking at the elephant's skin (angering it in the process) looking for an entry hatch, Rimfire finally realizes that he is in fact dealing with a real elephant, who he then apologizes to, though this does not save him from being battered into the ground by the angry elephant's trunk. After recovering from his beating, Rimfire notices Cool Cat looking for food, and decides to throw him \\"an exploding pineapple\\" in the form of a hand grenade. Instead of yanking the grenade's pin out with his teeth however, Rimfire unknowingly pulls his dentures out of his mouth with the pin, and then tosses the unarmed grenade at Cool Cat. The tiger does mistake it for a pineapple and offers it to Ella, but after the mechanical elephant fails to react to it he tosses the grenade away, causing it to end up back with Rimfire. In turn, Rimfire mistakes the chattering dentures for a tarantula and whips out his shotgun to blast it, detonating the grenade and destroying his dentures. Rimfire then decides to hide in an abandoned bongo that he finds in the jungle and blast Cool Cat when he comes near, but Cool Cat plays Ella a tune on the bongo when he finds it, which leaves Rimfire dazed. He repeats his plan with a large bush, but Cool Cat decides to demonstrate some \\"Jungle Judo\\" on the bush, battering Rimfire in the process, then pushes Ella into the bush so that she can try the same thing, only for her to pass clean through the bush, then smash Rimfire on the side of a cliff. Exasperated, Rimfire finally gives up and tells Cool Cat that he's going to leave the jungle, only to discover that Ella has run out of petrol, and begins the 2000-mile journey to the nearest gas station. Cool Cat then opens Ella's rear hatch and checks the engine, and then remarks that \\"they're not making elephants like they used to.\\" See also *List of American films of 1967 ReferencesExternal links 1967 films 1967 animated films Looney Tunes shorts 1960s American animated films American films Films scored by William Lava Films directed by Alex Lovy American animated short films Animated films about animals Films about hunters Films about tigers ","title":"Cool Cat (film)"},{"id":"21236629","text":"Marintoumania is a village and commune in the Cercle of Kayes in the Kayes Region of south-western Mali.

Since 1804 he considered himself Patriarch with the name of Joseph V and from 1812 to his death he actually governed both the patriarchal sees of Alqosh and Amid of the Church of the East. Life The See of Amid of the Church of the East was since 1681 in Full Communion with the Holy See and formed a little patriarchate including a few towns on the North-West mountains of Assyria, like Amid itself and Mardin, now in Turkey. The patriarchs that ruled over it are usually known as Josephine line, because all of them took the name of Joseph. Augustine Hindi was a nephew of Joseph IV Lazar Hindi, the patriarch since 1759. In the 18th century this patriarchate suffered a great financial crisis due to over taxation from Turkish authorities, and the patriarch had to travel all over Europe trying to raise funds. Returning to Amid without success, after a few years Lazare Hindi resigned in August 1780Charles A. Frazee, Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453-1923, Cambridge University Press, 2006 and appointed his nephew Augustine Hindi as patriarchal administrator, without consecrating him bishop. Rome did not recognize the appointment of Augustine but only the resignation of Lazare Hindi, that was soon withdrawn. Lazare Hindi was imprisoned by Turkish authorities in 1789 and escaped to Rome in 1791 where he died in 1796.David Wilmshurst, The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913, Peeters Publishers, 2000 The hope of the Vatican was to enter into Communion with the larger patriarchate of the Church of the East, the one with see in Alqosh, at that time divided between the two cousins Eliya Isho'yahb and Yohannan Hormizd, the second of whom considered himself a Catholic. Thus in 1791 the Vatican appointed Yohannan Hormizd, already metropolitan of Mosul and claiming the patriarchate, also as patriarchal administrator of Amid. The vehement complaints of Lazare Hindi, then in Rome, forced Rome to reach an agreement: in 1793 Yohannan Hormizd withdrew from the see of Amid but Augustine Hindi could not be appointed Patriarch of the Chaldean Church. In the next years Augustine gained respect for his reliability and endeared himself to the supporters of the Roman cause. Also in the area Yohannan Hormizd ruled, and was his competitor to the title of patriarch. On 15 January 1802 Augustine Hindi was formally appointed metropolitan of Amid and patriarchal administrator and he was consecrated bishop on September 8, 1804 by Isho'yahb Isha'ya Yohannan Gabriel (or Jean Guriel), then Chaldean bishop of Salmas. As Augustine gained respect, Yohannan Hormizd was opposed by the Latin missionaries and by the abbot of the revitalized monastery of Rabban Hormizd, the monk Gabriel Dambo of Mardin. After the suspension of Yohannan Hormizd as bishop of Mosul in 1812 because of his clashes with the monks of Rabban Hormizd, Augustine Hindi actually governed almost all the territory of both the patriarchal sees of Alqosh and Amid up to his death with the title of apostolic delegate for the Patriarchate of Babylon. In 1818 Yohannan Hormizd was suspended also by his office of bishop (for about eight years) and on October 2 of the same year Augustine Hindi received from Rome the pallium. Probably in good faith, Hindi believed that the pallium was the recognition of his title of Patriarch under the name of Joseph V, claimed by him from 1804, and most Chaldeans called him patriarch. Even if never formally confirmed patriarch by Rome, Rome never publicly objected to such a title. In 1824 and 1825 Augustine appointed and consecrated some of his supporters as bishops, such as Joseph Audo on March 25, 1825. Augustine died on April 3, 1827.The date of 1828 as death date listed by some sources is fault.

Early EtherDrives: (Top) 2.5 PATA Blade (Bottom) 3.5 PATA Blade Figure 2. SR EtherDrive Cluster These 60 Units can hold over 780 TeraBytes at RAID5 with 60 hot spares. EtherDrive is a brand name for storage area network devices based upon the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) protocol. It was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2004.United States Patent and Trademark Office; Serial Number 76315854 The word was invented by Brantley Coile as a portmanteau of the words Ethernet and disk drive. EtherDrive was a trademark by Coraid from 2002 until 2015 when it was purchased by The Brantley Coile Company as part of the purchase of Coraid's software copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in May 2015.  History  The first commercial transaction involving interstate commerce of an EtherDrive branded product was to Geoff Collyer. Some of the first EtherDrive products were embedded Z80 based boards that acted as AoE converters. These boards were attached like a daughterboard to PATA disk drives mounted and connected to a backplane that provided only power and an RJ-45 jack. These original PATA blades were aligned in a single row per shelf and addressed by over Ethernet with a shelf:slot address. The slot component eventually became referred to as a LUN. Today, EtherDrive devices provide RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, and JBOD. These use AoE to talk to the initiator but provide a hardware RAID close to disk. The device also provides a block scrubbing mechanism called RAIDShield that systematically checks every block on every disk for potential failures. When a bad block is encountered, the block is reconstructed from parity and written to another part of the disk. EtherDrives have been used as storage for high altitude atmospheric research and aeronautical applications. Combined with SSD disks the technology is an easy solution to data acquisition in the embedded space. Since it uses AoE the device is presented to the host OS as block storage, and thus the EtherDrive requires minimum overhead from the host system. In April 2015, Coraid was foreclosed on by its creditors. In May 2015, The Brantley Coile Company acquired the trademark and the IP and is now marketing the ATA over Ethernet storage appliance software based on the SRX and VSX products.

Fourth State Finance Commission Report The fourth State Finance Commission chaired by Dr M A Oommen with S M Vijayanand and Ms Ishita Roy as members, submitted its report on 22 January 2011 as the second Indian State (Bihar submitted in September 2010 as the first) to submit the fourth report, with a recommendation that 25-30 per cent or more of state plan funds need to be devolved to local governments. The general purpose grant had been fixed at 3.5 per cent and the maintenance grant at 4.5 per cent. These components would be enhanced in the coming years. This amounted to a five-fold increase from that recommended by the first State Finance Commission. The second commission, headed by Prabhat Patnaik, economist, institutionalised devolution of funds and fixed it at 25 per cent. The third commission upset the entire system. Much more than the commission's recommendations, it was due to the intervention of the Finance Ministry and a reflection on the then United Democratic Front government's stance.The Fourth Kerala State Finance commission Report Part I The deplorable condition of rural roads could be attributed to the cut in grants recommended by the third commission. The Oommen commission had set things in the right course and ratified the recommendations of the third commission by asserting that the allocation should not dip beyond 25 per cent, While launching the People's Plan Campaign, the then government had taken an ad hoc decision to devolve 30 per cent funds to the civic bodies. The local self-government institutions in the state will get Rs.4,160 crore in 2011-12, a one-third increase from the allocation for 2010-11, following the recommendations of the fourth State Finance Commission. The recommendations had come as a major boost to decentralised governance. While launching the People's Plan Campaign, the then government had taken an ad hoc decision to devolve 30 per cent funds to the civic bodies. This amounted to a five-fold increase from that recommended by the first State Finance Commission. The second commission, headed by Prabhat Patnaik, economist, institutionalised devolution of funds and fixed it at 25 per cent. The third commission upset the entire system. Much more than the commission's recommendations, it was due to the intervention of the Finance Ministry and a reflection on the then United Democratic Front government's stance. The fourth State Finance Commission has recommended the government to allocate the special grant worth Rs.12.07 crore to the panchayats from the development fund for 2011-12 depending on their backwardness. Instead of gauging backwardness merely on the basis of SC/ST population in each panchayat, the commission has worked out a deprivation index for providing the special grant to the rural civic bodies which are lagging much behind others in terms of development. Substantial devolution to local governments prior to State Finance Commissions Kerala‚Äôs decentralisation shows the provision of substantial untied funds for local prioritisation and local resource allocation to identified priority areas. This was not recommended by any State Finance Commission but was a policy decision taken by the State Government at the beginning of the 9th Five Year Plan. While the State has been able to go beyond what is strictly essential (as per SFC reports) and has been able to consolidate Centrally Sponsored schemes in some cases leading to welcome increase in the untied grants recently, there has unfortunately a drop in the statutory grants which is wholly unwelcome. Also, it has been noticed that restriction of actual flows to PRIs get aggravated every time there is a glitch in the state finances. Thus, even when credited to their Treasury accounts, the panchayats are not able to use the funds because the finance department will not release them. The performance audit shows up some lacunae which have to mostly do with the outmoded accounting and record keeping. However all this should not detract from the many positive features in Kerala case such as transparency especially in beneficiary selection, RTI, social audit which need to be further encouraged, strengthened and emulated by other states.

Life Hocking was born at St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall, to James Hocking, part-owner of a tin mine, and his wife Elizabeth. In 1884, he was ordained as a Methodist minister. Working in different parts of England over the next few years, he wrote his first novel, Harry Penhale - The Trial of his Faith, while in London in 1887. He regarded fiction as a highly effective medium for conveying his Christian message to the public, and combined his writing with his church duties, until ill health forced him to resign from the ministry in 1909. His last pastoral charge was the large and important United Free Church at Woodford, Essex, which he was instrumental in having rebuilt by the advanced arts and crafts architect, Charles Harrison Townsend. On his recovery, he found himself a much sought-after preacher across Britain, and he travelled extensively in the Middle East. He continued to write, and over the course of his career, he was the author of nearly 100 books. Although largely forgotten now, he was tremendously popular in his day. He died in St Ives, Cornwall, and was survived by his wife, Annie, who he had married in 1887, and four daughters, three of whom become published novelists in their own right (Anne Hocking, Elizabeth Nisot and Joan Shill). A son, Cuthbert, was killed in World War I]. Through his mother he was related to the biblical scholar John Kitto. His brother was Silas Hocking (1850‚Äì1935), a novelist and Methodist minister, and his sister, Salome Hocking (1859‚Äì1927), was also a novelist. Hocking features as one of the main characters in the 2009 play Surfing Tommies by Cornish playwright, Alan M. Kent. Joseph Hocking's ashes were buried in the churchyard of St Stephen-in-Brannel.

A right-hander, he was listed as tall and . He was born in Long Beach, California, and attended Long Beach City College and California State University, Los Angeles. Cox entered baseball in 1962 as a member of the Cincinnati Reds' organization, then was drafted in successive years by the Cleveland Indians (1963) and Senators (1964). In the majors, he was essentially a relief pitcher, coming out of the bullpen in all but 59 of his 308 career MLB games pitched. In , as a rookie, he appeared in a career-high 66 games and was credited with seven saves, also a personal best. His finest season was ‚Äîthe 1961‚Äì1971 Senators' only winning campaign in 11 seasons in Washington. Working in 52 games, with 13 starts, he set career marks in games won (12) and earned run average (2.78, in 171 innings pitched). He handled 32 chances in the field without an error, leading all American League pitchers in fielding percentage. He also threw a career- high four complete games. The following season, , Cox was almost exclusively a starting pitcher. But he won only eight of 20 decisions and his ERA climbed to 4.45, as Washington faltered and finished last in the American League East. In he returned to the Senator bullpen and tied his career-best with seven saves, but Washington struggled again on the field and at the turnstiles, and the franchise was moved to Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth as the Texas Rangers during the offseason. In , Cox appeared in 45 games for the first edition of the Rangers before his trade on August 31 to the Yankees. He would pitch in only six total games for the Yankees, five at the tail end of 1972, and then on Opening Day at Fenway Park, when he worked three innings of mop-up relief in a 15‚Äì5 Red Sox victory that marked the first game in which a designated hitter was used in the American League.Retrosheet box score: 1973-04-06 He retired from baseball after the 1973 campaign.

The production of the controlled round feed Mauser 98 bolt action system for the German military ceased at the end of World War II in 1945. The new Mauser M 98 and M 98 Magnum rifles for civil users are in production since 1999 in Isny im Allg√§u, Germany by Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbHMauser Jagdwaffen GmbH (Mauser Hunting Weapons Ltd.), according to original drawings of 1936 and the respective Mauser patents. Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH is a subsidiary of SIG Sauer. The Mauser M 98 series rifles are practically a civilian version of the Karabiner 98k, which was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser 98 military rifles of World War II. Vaguely similar to the latter rifle in appearance, the M 98 is offered in many different hunting chamberings, not like the original service rifle. Design details As a modern civilian offspring of the Karabiner 98k service rifle, the new Mauser M 98 series offers several features and factory options, that are also typical for sporterised Mauser Karabiner 98k ex-service rifles, ranging from various technical departures from the basic Mauser service rifle it was based on to luxury wood grades, gold inlays, engravings and surface treatments like plasma-based nitriding to protect metal parts against corrosion in aggressive environmental conditions or color case hardening. Some of the available options were originally developed and introduced by John Rigby & Co. on Rigby Mauser hunting rifles. =Operating mechanism= The M 98 controlled round feed bolt action system is a simple, strong, safe, and well-thought-out design that was originally patented by Paul Mauser on 9 September 1895 and inspired other military and hunting/sporting rifle designs that became available during the 20th and 21st century. A drawback of the M 98 system is that it can not be cheaply mass-produced very easily. Some other bolt action designs (e.g. the Lee‚ÄìEnfield) also offer trained operators a significantly faster rate of fire. The basic Mauser M 98 version retails (2009) for approximately EUR 6,800, but the addition of (luxury) options can make these rifles much more expensive. For the Mauser M 98 series the M 98 bolt action system is machined out of one solid piece of high-grade steel. It also features a double square bridge for mounting a telescopic sight. =Features= Mauser M 98, bolt-action. Mauser M 98, bolt and firing pin and safety mechanism field stripped. The M 98 system consists of a receiver that serves as the systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three locking lugs, two large main lugs at the bolt head and a third safety lug at the rear of the bolt which serves as a backup in case the primary locking lugs failed. This third lug is a distinctive feature and was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs. The two main locking lugs display a locking surface of 56 mm¬≤, whilst the third safety lug normally plays no part in locking the action to avoid asymmetric and hence unbalanced bolt thrust forces. The diameter of the receiver was also enlarged compared to previous Mauser receivers for additional strength and safety. The bolt handle is permanently attached to the bolt and on the Mauser M 98 series is turned-down for use with optical sights. Another distinctive feature of the M 98 system is the controlled round feed mechanism, consisting of a large, non-rotating claw extractor that engages the cartridge case rim as soon as the round leaves the magazine and firmly holds the cartridge case until the round is ejected by the ejector, mounted inside the receiver. Combined with a slight bolt retraction at the last stage of the bolt opening cycle, caused by the cammed surface on the rear receiver bridge, this results in a positive cartridge case extraction. The M 98 bolt action will cycle correctly irrespective of the way the rifle is moved or positioned during the bolt cycling action or if the cartridge has been fired or not. Only if the bolt is not brought back far enough, sharply enough, in a controlled round feed bolt action the cartridge case may not be cleanly ejected and a jam may result. The bolt houses the firing pin mechanism that gets cocked when the bolt is opened and the cocking piece protrudes visually and tactilely from the rear of the bolt to indicate the action is cocked. This bolt sleeve lock was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs and reduced firing pin travel and lock time. The action features large gas relief holes and a gas shield on the bolt sleeve designed to protect the users head in case of a primer or cartridge rupture or detonation. When the action suffers a catastrophic failure it is designed to deflect the debris away from the operator's face. The Mauser M 98 bolt mechanism can be easily removed from the receiver simply by pulling out the bolt stop, located at the left wall of the receiver, and then by rotating and pulling the bolt out. =Safety= As standard the Mauser M 98 rifle features the traditional Mauser 98 three-position safety attached at the rear of the bolt which operating lever can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire) but only when the rifle is cocked, otherwise the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety can only be released by firing the rifle with the safety set in the ready to fire position or by closing the cocked bolt with a previously pulled trigger that must be kept pulled back during the closing operation. Disengaging the safety by closing the bolt is only possible with the safety set in the ready to fire position. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights very low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch leaver. The Mauser M 98 rifle series can also be ordered with an optional Mauser horizontal 3-position safety with locking lever to ensure good operability of the safety catch leaver with low mounted aiming optics. =Barrel= The standard barrel length is 600 mm (23.62 in) for the M 98 and 620 mm (24.41 in) for the M 98 Magnum variant. Other barrel lengths are available upon request for the M 98 and M 98 Magnum variant, subject to availability. As an option the rifles can be ordered with an integral barrel. This is a barrel with a quarter rib, sight bases and a sling swivel mounting machined out of a solid barrel blank. =Ammunition feeding= The internal magazine of the M 98 system consists of an integral box machined to match the cartridge for which the rifle was being chambered, with a detachable floorplate, that can hold up to 5 standard sized rifle cartridges. The magazine can be loaded with single rounds by pushing the cartridges into the receiver top opening. The magazine can be unloaded by operating the bolt (the safety should for safety reasons be set to the middle position for this) or in case of mechanical problems by opening the magazine floorplate. The Mauser M 98 internal magazine has a 5+1 magazine capacity in standard calibers and 4+1 in magnum calibers. =Sights= An express iron sight line with one standing and two folding leaves zeroed for 50, 100 and 150 meters are standard. A Rigby-style diopter sight is also available. The M 98 rifle system is factory prepared for swing-off telescopic sight mounts (bases in square bridge). =Stock= The standard hand-rubbed oil-finished walnut wood stock has a straight comb with Rigby-style cheekpiece, a rubber recoil pad, steel pistol grip cap and ebony forend tip. These stocks come in quality walnut wood grade 5 and higher wood grades are also available. Besides these options further customizing options like Rigby-style peep sight, and engraving on action and floorplate are also available. Chamberings The Mauser M 98 Standard is available in 7x57mm Mauser, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, 8x57 IS, and 9.3x62mm. Variants The Mauser M 98 Magnum is a currently (2019) produced magnum variant of the modern M 98 line intended for big-game safari hunting. This Magnum variant exploits the fact that throughout the design's history, standard and enlarged versions of the Mauser M 98 system have been produced for the civil market. John Rigby & Co. commissioned Mauser to develop the M 98 magnum action over a hundred years ago. It was designed to function with the large sized cartridges normally used to hunt Big Five game and other dangerous game species. For this specialized type of hunting, where absolute reliability of the rifle under adverse conditions is very important, the controlled-feed M 98 system remains the standard by which other action designs are judged.https://www.mauser.com/en/m98.html The currently (2019) produced Mauser M 98 Magnum rifles are offered in .375 Holland & Holland Magnum with a 5+1 magazine capacity, .416 Rigby, and .450 Rigby with a 4+1 magazine capacity.https://www.mauser.com/en/m98/m98-magnum.html References Bolt-action rifles Rifles of Germany Hunting rifles Mauser rifles ","title":"Mauser M 98"},{"id":"21236925","text":"Immaculate Conception Church The Church of Immaculate Conception of Bangkok (, ), also known as Wat Khamen (, ), is the oldest Catholic church in Thailand. Its name Immaculate Conception comes from the Catholic belief that by the will of God the Virgin Mary was conceived free from original sin. The Church's history and construction is an example of the religious tolerance of the Thai people.  History  The first Portuguese missionaries arrived in Thailand in 1567. Bangkok, at that time, was still a transit port along the Chao Phraya river on the way to Ayutthaya. In 1674, during the Ayutthaya era, King Narai the Great granted land in Bangkok to the Portuguese community to build the Church of Immaculate Conception. The French had attempted under several expeditions to Thailand to try to convert King Narai to Catholicism, despite his refusal, he allowed both French and Portuguese missionaries to continue their work in spreading their faith. During the building of the church the city of Ayutthaya was captured by the Burmese and this halted progression for a while however construction soon continued. During the Bangkok era King Rama I invited the Portuguese traders to return in order to stimulate the economy and the church was rebuilt in 1785. The Church was rebuilt on two other occasions in 1832 and 1847 by an influential French missionary Monsignor Pallegoix. The building from 1847 remains today.  The Church and refugees  The Church has a long history associated with refugees. In 1785 the Portuguese came with Cambodian refugees who had fled the civil war of their country. They were the main contributors in rebuilding the church. During this period 500 Cambodians took refuge in the church and it was later renamed Bot Ban Khamen or Cambodian Village Church. Vietnamese immigration increased in Thailand due to religious persecution in Vietnam. In 1832 Thailand waged a war with Vietnam and many prisoners of war taken to Thailand refused to return to Vietnam and preferred to stay in Bangkok. They rebuilt the Church in 1832 and it was called Bot Ban Yuan or Vietnamese Village Church.  Location  Soi Mitrakham, Samsen, Bangkok, Thailand.

Her full name was Annie Caroline Pontifex Fernhout-Toorop. Life Charley Toorop was born in Katwijk. She was the daughter of Jan Toorop and Annie Hall. She married the philosopher Henk Fernhout in May 1912, but they divorced in 1917. Her son Edgar Fernhout (1912‚Äì1974) also became a painter. Her other son, (1913‚Äì1987), became a filmmaker, and often worked together with Joris Ivens. As a filmmaker he sometimes used the name John Ferno. Charley's daughter in law was the well-known Jewish photographer Eva Besny√∂ (1910‚Äì2003), who married John in 1933. In the on-line biography of the Dutch poet Hendrik Marsman on the website of the Charley Toorop is mentioned as one of the women who had a relationship with Marsman before he married in 1929 his wife Rien Barendregt. Work Charley Toorop and Maurits Uyldert in 1953 Charley Toorop became a member of the group of artists called Het Signaal (The Signal) in 1916. The group aimed at depicting a deep sense of reality through the use of colours and heavily accentuated lines and through fierce contrasts of colours. This is one of the reasons why Toorop is seen as adherent to the Bergense School. Toorop befriended other artists, among them Bart van der Leck and Piet Mondriaan. In 1926 Charley Toorop went to live for two years in Amsterdam, where her painting became influenced by film. Frontally depicted figures stand isolated from each other, as if lit by lamps at a movie set. Her still lifes show kinship to the synthetic cubism of Juan Gris. From the 1930s onwards, she painted many female figures, as well as nudes and self-portraits in a powerful, realistic style. Well-known is her large painting Three Generations (Drie generaties) (1941‚Äì1950; in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam), which is a self-portrait, a portrait of her father and of her son Edgar, in which she unites both realism and a sense of symbolism. Her ruthless realism has a magic touch. \\"Is the natural appearance reality,\\" she wondered in 1917, \\"or can we sense in its form only the most unreal that appears before us? This unreal, which is the most real.\\" Toorop had lived at many different places, but from 1932 on she resided in Bergen, North Holland, a town she'd previously had her home between 1912-1915 and 1922-1926. There she designed and commissioned a house called \\"De Vlerken\\", situated at the Buerweg 19. The house is still there, although after a fire its thatched roof has been replaced by a tiled roof. Charley Toorop died in Bergen on November 5, 1955. Her works are in many public collections, notably in the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum in Otterlo.

Biography  Pieros Kezou was born in Paralimni, Cyprus on 15 November. Growing up in the first difficult years of the islands (Cyprus) recent turbulent history, Pieros showed early signs of maturity and a high interest in music. Œóe would lock himself in his room with a voice recorder and a small synthesizer, composing and singing his first musical pieces. His teachers, recognizing his talent, would very often give him the chance to present his work at school shows and productions. At the age of 18, he moved to Nicosia for his studies. He lives there since and works as a music teacher in primary education. During his studies he was again given the chance to compose and perform. It was very clear to him that he didn't want to follow the usual musical norms in both the music and the lyrics, thus he's trying to create a more pioneer and authentic sound for his work. He took part in various competitions as a performer, including The Laiki Bank Song Contest For Young Cypriot Artists, The Lions of Cyprus Song Contest and as a backing vocalist for the local Eurovision Song Contest preselections. Aiming to discover a new musical performing approach he decided to follow lessons in classical singing and musical with soprano Tiziana Sojat.

He took part in the CYBC series \\"Artos kai Theamata\\", performing songs from the Cypriot Theatre and Operetta.

The relations remains friendly and bonded throughout its history as both countries shares similar religious identities, cultural links, particularly their Islamic heritage. The bilateral relations were established in the 1950s when King Idris agreed to provide financial aid to the then impoverished Pakistan. History of foreign relations=Relations during Cold war=1960s‚Äì70s: OIC conference in Lahore After staging a coup d'√©tat against king Idris in 1969, Muammar Gaddafi grew his relations with the Marxist circle of Pakistan. During the height of the war with India in 1971, Libyan leader Gaddafi personally directed a strongly worded letter to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accusing her of aggression against Pakistan in 1971, which endeared him to all Pakistanis. The foreign relations of Libya and Pakistan began to grow in the 1970s when the Pakistani populace began to notice Gaddafi who paid his first state visit to Pakistan to attend the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) held in Lahore, in 1974. In a televised speech given by Gaddafi at the meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, he declared his support for Pakistan to pursue development of nuclear technology, an issue which had been made a hot-topic by the United States.http://www.blurtit.com/q756120.html When he came to Pakistan to attend the second Islamic Summit Conference in 1974, he stated, \\"Pakistan is the fort of Islam.\\" On Pakistan's Left-wing sphere specifically the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Gaddafi was respectable and a popular figure who had many inter-personal relations with Pakistan's Marxist circle. According to the American political correspondent, the Time, Gaddafi was one of many financial supporter of Pakistan's clandestine atomic deterrence projects. In his honour, the Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had named the Gaddafi cricket stadium in Lahore, the largest in the country, after him. At many instance of Gaddafi, Bhutto decided to delegate Libya in its efforts to build its nuclear program, roughly based on Pakistan's motivation.Stengel, Richard (Monday, Jun. 03, 1985). \\"Who has the Bomb?\\". Time magazine. pp. 7/13. Archived from the original on Jun. 03, 1985. Retrieved February 23, 2011 The general elections held in 1977 saw the overwhelming victory of Left-wing sphere. At an instance of rightist alliance, PNA, a violent civil disobedience movement led the successful imposition of martial law, under codename: Operation Fair Play, at midnight on 4 July 1977. This martial law led by Chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq immediately removed the Marxist influence in the government. Periodically, all ties built with the Gaddafi was limited in 1977; eventually cutting off all ties and military assistance with Libya in 1978. 1980s‚Äì90s: Reluctance, rift, and downfall Before the atomic quest was completed, the Libyan delegation to participate in nuclear projects was sent back to Libya in 1978 and all military advisers of Pakistan Armed Forces were immediately called back to Pakistan in 1979. Such initiatives revealed that President General Zia had strongly hated and distrusted Gaddafi, therefore he immediately cut all the military aid to Libya. Gaddafi sent many appeals of clemency to spare Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's life and sent his personal plane with dispatching his Prime Minister, Abdessalam Jalloud, to fly Bhutto out from Pakistan. In spite of Gaddafi's initiatives, the air transport was sent back to Tripoli and after a week, Zulfikar Bhutto was hanged per the orders of the Supreme Court. After learning the incident, Gaddafi lashed out at President Zia and began hosting as well as providing military training to far-left terrorist organization, the Al-Zulfiqar, which was established by Bhutto's children. However, the plan was thwarted by the ISI in 1980 when it had discovered and placed a mole in the Libyan embassy. In retaliation, Gaddafi signed a secret decree which called for the expulsion of all the 150,000 Pakistanis residing in Libya. The children and wife of Bhutto were given asylum by Gaddafi in the 1980s, despite the agitation of President Zia. During this time, Libya suspected attempted to make a deal to share knowledge of nuclear projects with senior scientists working in atomic deterrence projects; all efforts were thwarted by ISI. In 1983‚Äì85, Libya restored its ties with India and acceded with a nuclear treaty with India as opposed to Pakistan.See more details on foreign assistance on Libyan nuclear program =Relations after Cold war=1990s‚Äì2000s: Normalizing relations After President Zia's death and state funeral, the foreign relations began to normalized. The general elections held in 1988 resulted in left-wing coming to power and appointing Benazir Bhutto as Pakistan's first female Prime minister. The ties continued until Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was removed from power after amid corruption charges by President Ghulam Ishaq, in 1990. In 1990, the new general elections oversaw the conservatives coming to power under Navaz Sharif, for the first time in the history through a democratic transition. Immediately after being sworn in as the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif soon paid a state visit to Libya. In 1991, Sharif visit and met with Gaddafi. Gaddafi traditionally opposed Sharif's conservatism, and during the meeting, Gaddafi demanded Sharif to sell him a nuclear bomb as Gaddafi suspected that Pakistan had developed years later. Whilst, Prime Minister Sharif reputedly denying his request and urging Gaddafi to continue the economical relations with Pakistan. Gaddafi insulted the Prime minister Nawaz Sharif and labeled him as \\"Corrupt politician\\", which dismayed the Pakistan delegation. The Prime minister's delegation members and journalists were initially shocked and troubled with Gaddafi's attitude. Therefore, Sharif cancelled the talks and immediately returning to Pakistan and soon expelled Libyan Ambassador. The ties were again restored in 1993 following the resignation of conservative Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq. The new general elections in 1993 revived the comeback of PPP under Benazir Bhutto who was immediately sworn in as Prime Minister. In 1994‚Äì95, there are reports indicated that the nuclear information was given to Gaddafi to provide aid in Libyan nuclear program. In 2001, Pakistan via ISI, passed intelligence about Gulf States and the nuclear ambitions of Iran and Libya, whose programs Pakistani scientists had helped to build.Journalist and author George Crile's book, Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History (Grove Press, New York, 2003) Pakistan began providing details of Libyan nuclear programme to Israel's Mossad. These evidence were made public by the United States but concealed the names of sources. In 2003, Gaddafi announced his intention to rolling back the nuclear program and ultimately handed over the information given by the various sources to IAEA. This turned out to be a \\"political nightmare\\" for Pakistan when Gaddafi turned over the centrifuge designs to the IAEA in return for legitimacy causing Pakistan international isolation. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz's foreign expertise later helped Pakistan out of international isolation in 2004 due to the quick economic boom. The PPP made its notable comeback during the general elections held in 2008. The PPP restarted its relations with Gaddafi, which paved way for President Asif Ali Zardari's state visit to Libya in 2009. During his visit, President Zardari termed Libya as his \\"second home\\". 2010s‚ÄìPresent: Libyan Civil War After the start of the civil war in Libya, Pakistan immediately adopted the policy of \\"non-belligerent\\" in 2011. In February 2011, following the protests in other Arab countries, widespread riots broke out against Gaddafi's 42-year rule resulting in loss of government control over most of eastern Libya. In a press conference on 3 March 2011, the Foreign ministry of Pakistan spokesperson stated: \\"As far as the internal political situation of Libya is concerned, the Government of Pakistan would not like to offer any comment at this point in time\\". She stated that the current focus of the Pakistani government is on the safe repatriation of Pakistanis in Libya. Defending his crackdown against the revolt during a lengthy speech, Gaddafi passed controversial remarks about the current situation of Pakistan. He also compared his crackdown to India's counterinsurgency in Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan's Media did not welcome Gaddafi's speech, and Pakistan's Television channels heavily criticized Gaddafi's remarks, and accused Gaddafi of interfering in Pakistan's matters. During the civil war in Libya, the Pakistan Government initiated a cross-border operations, involving the Navy and the PAF to assure the safety of and safe evacuation of Pakistani community in Libya. During the same time, the Arab media circulated news reports alleging involvement of Pakistan military in the events of civil war in Libya, the Foreign Office emphatically stated that these were mischievous and totally baseless. There are no presence of any Pakistan military contingent forces in Libya. During the Abu Salim prison massacre remembrance, the Pakistan Embassy in Tripoli was attacked and bombed by the unknown Libyan terror group. No group claimed the responsibility of the act.http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/29/hand-grenade-attack-on-pakistani- embassy/ =Economic and trade relations= Pakistan received economic assistance from Libya in the 1970s, aiding in the country's recovery after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. More recently, Libya has provided assistance to Pakistan to fight against floods, infections, disease, and other natural calamities in Pakistan. In 1976, The Libyan Central Bank provided a loan of US $50 million to the Habib Bank of Pakistan as a form of aid. In the same year, an economic and cultural agreement was also signed, in which a combined shipping company was established. There are around 30,000 Pakistanis who are residents of Libya. In 2009, the Pakistani government pledged to send 50,000 skilled workers to Libya by the end of the year under a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two countries during a visit of the President of Pakistan to Libya.0528story_28-5-2009_pg5_9 References Pakistan Libya Africa‚ÄìPakistan relations ","title":"Libya‚ÄìPakistan relations"},{"id":"21237163","text":"Line laser with interchangeable lenses A line laser is a device that employs a laser and an optical lens to project the laser beam as a line rather than a point (e.g. laser pointer).

ALCTS membership represents over forty countries, and it comprises librarians, library support staff, students of library and information science, and commercial vendors whose professional interests lie within these areas of practice. ALCTS meets the needs of its members through educational programming, publications, professional development opportunities and information exchange. ALCTS also promotes and has significant input into the development of standards and best practices, including NISO standards and cataloging standards such as RDA.ALCTS: Getting the Word Out  History and organizational structure  ALCTS (pronounced uh-lex) was one of several ALA divisions created in 1957, upon the merger of several ALA units related to technical services. The division was originally known as the Resources and Technical Services Division (RTSD). The original four sections of the division were Acquisitions, Cataloging and Classification, Copying Methods, and Serials. The current name of the division is the result of a 1989 division membership vote.http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alcts/about/misshist/history.cfm ALCTS consists of five sections:http://www.ala.org/alcts/mgrps/sections Acquisitions; Cataloging and Metadata Management; Collection Management; Preservation and Reformatting; and Continuing Resources. The current Acquisitions (AS) and Collection Management (CMS) Sections emerged over time from the original AS. The Cataloging and Metadata Management Section (CaMMS) has the longest history, having begun as a section of ALA in 1900. The Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) is a result of a 1994 merger of the Reproduction of Library Materials Section (which started as the Copying Methods Section) and the Preservation of Library Materials Section (which was created in 1980). The Continuing Resources Section (CRS) started as a round table of ALA in 1929, and was renamed in 2007. The work of these sections, as well as the entire division, is supported through regular committee meetings. ALCTS also makes available to its sections online options for communication and collaboration, including discussion lists, online communities, and wikis. These sections are joined by the Affiliate Relations Committee (ARC) which replaced the Council of Regional Groups (CRG) in 2011. The role of ARC is to maintain contact with groups similar to ALCTS that serve specific geographic regions, and they host an Affiliates Showcase at the ALA Annual conference.  Publications  ALCTS has created and maintains a wide variety of publications that provide guidelines and policies for the work of its constituents; serve as educational resources, and keep the membership informed of current developments and trends with the division and the profession.http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alcts/resources/index.cfm The guidelines and policy documents are often used in an advisory role for technical services, collection development, and preservation decisions. These resources are generally available on the ALCTS website. The division also publishes a series of books (ALCTS Monographs). ALCTS publishes two serials ‚Äì ALCTS News, which reports on the happenings of the division and the people within it; and Library Resources and Technical Services (LRTS), a quarterly, peer-reviewed journal.  Programming  At the ALA Annual Conference, ALCTS sponsors programming both at the division level and through its sections. At the ALA Midwinter Meeting, ALCTS hosts a forum on a major topic of interest to its constituency. At both annual events, ALCTS sponsors symposia and preconference workshops that get in depth on specific concepts. Both events also feature interest groups (many of which were formerly discussion groups). The IGs are not official programs, but they allow people working or interested in specific roles to gather for discussion and/or plan future programming. Outside of conferences, ALCTS also offers online educational opportunities and a series of online discussions via discussion groups. In 2007, to celebrate its 50th anniversary, ALCTS held a special conference just prior to the ALA Annual Conference. ALCTS sponsors the annual Preservation Week program.

He is the President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. He previously served as President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. Early life and ordination Born in Codogno in the province of Lodi and baptized with the name Salvatore, Fisichella studied classics at St. Francis College in Lodi. He received a degree in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and was ordained a priest for the diocese of Rome on 13 March 1976 by Ugo Poletti, Papal Vicar of Rome. After ordination, he held a number of positions including Professor of Fundamental Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Lateran University, consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, member of the Central Committee of the Great Jubilee Year 2000 and Vice President of the Historical-Theological Commission of the same Committee. He was appointed a Chaplain of His Holiness in 1994. He has served as a chaplain to the Italian parliament. He is a specialist in the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, on whom he did extensive research in 1980. Bishop He was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Rome with the titular see of Vicohabentia on 3 July 1998 and was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Camillo Ruini on 12 September 1998. He was president of the diocesan commission on ecumenism and interfaith relations. He worked in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and in the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. He was said to have collaborated in the publication of Fides et Ratio in 1998. He was named rector of the Lateran University on 18 January 2002. On 8 September 2002, he was named a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. During the Muhammad caricature controversy of 2005, Fisichella said that the freedom of the press was not absolute and not meant to be used against others. He was a friend of Oriana Fallaci. In 2005, he celebrated the 100th anniversary of the catechism of Saint Pius X. When asked in 2005 if he would give Communion to Italian politicians Romano Prodi and Pier Ferdinando Casini, Fisichella responded that he \\"did not see a reason\\" for refusing Communion to Prodi, whereas Casini \\"knows well the rules of the Church\\" and does not present himself for Communion. Archbishop Rino Fisichella in Lodi in 2006. Pontifical Academy of Life On 17 June 2008, he was given the title of archbishop and named President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. In December 2008, he wrote to the members of Luxembourg's legislature, which was considering legislation to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, saying a Catholic legislator has \\"the clear obligation to oppose any legislation that is an attack on human life\\" and that Catholic voters could not vote in good conscience for a legislator who voted for such a law. Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker criticized him for interfering. On 24 January 2009, he urged US President Barack Obama to listen to all voices in America without \\"the arrogance of those who, being in power, believe they can decide of life and death.\\" When Obama ended the ban on U.S. funding of organizations that discuss and perform abortion in the developing world, he said: \\"Among the many good things that he could have done, Barack Obama instead has chosen the worst. If this is one of the first acts of President Obama, with all due respect, it seems to me that the path toward disappointment has been very short.\\" In a case that attracted international attention in 2009, when Brazilian Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho said that an abortion performed on a nine-year-old girl pregnant with twins, reportedly fathered by her stepfather, had resulted in excommunication for the mother who arranged for the abortion and the doctors who carried it out, Fisichella defended the doctors in a statement addressed to the girl: \\"There are others who deserve excommunication and our forgiveness, not those who permitted you to live and who will help you to regain hope and faith.\\" He wrote: \\"Her life was in serious danger because of the pregnancy in progress. How to act in these cases? An arduous decision for the physician and for the moral law itself. The conscience of the physician finds itself alone when forced to decide the best thing to do. A choice like that of having to save a life, knowing that one puts a second at serious risk, never comes easily.\\" L'Osservatore Romano published Fisichella's essay critical of Sobrinho on its front page. Several members of the Academy wrote a letter protesting Fisichella's intervention in the case. In July, L'Osservatore Romano published a document issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith called \\"Clarification on procured abortion\\", which declared that church teaching on abortion had not changed and will not change. Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation On 30 June 2010, Fisichella was appointed as the first President of the planned Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.Press Office of the Holy See He was replaced as President of the Pontifical Academy for Life by Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, who had served as chancellor of the academy. At the same time, Archbishop Fisichella resigned his position as Rector of the Pontifical Lateran University, and Enrico dal Covolo, S.D.B., was appointed as his successor. Shortly after his appointment, Archbishop Fisichella called for an investigation into who covered up for the Legion of Christ's disgraced founder, Marciel Maciel (\\"those who took his appointments, those who kept his agenda, those who drove him around\\"). Fisichella suggested that the Vatican look inside the Legion. \\"We must be able to verify how well- covered up it was inside his congregation, not outside it\\". Fisichella's task is to reawaken the faith in traditionally Christian parts of the world, particularly Europe and North America. The idea is that, while the countries within Christendom today were first \\"evangelised\\", or converted to Christianity, many centuries ago, today it stands in need of a \\"new evangelisation\\" because of a decline of faith in the West. His first, declared project was a celebration in 2012 of the 20th anniversary of the publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. During the press conference on the release in October 2010 of the motu proprio authorizing the setting up of the new Council, the members of which were appointed in January 2011, Archbishop Fisichella stated that his new office did not yet have an internet connection, or even a computer: \\"Right now, I'm just hoping to get a computer in my office so I can get on the internet myself.\\"Office for evangelising cyberspace does not have internet access, says official In February 2011, following public controversies with respect to Bishop Richard Williamson's denial of the Holocaust and the Regensburg lecture's impact on Christian-Muslim relations, Fisichella dismissed as premature the idea of assessing the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI. He said: \\"We're still at the beginning of a pontificate, and in my opinion it's always difficult to make judgments or offer a far-ranging analysis at the beginning. ...A sense of history should make us prudent and cautious from this point of view.\\" In August 2011, Fischella unveiled the Mission Metropolis which was to start in Lent 2012. The plan was to revive Christianity in Europe. The cities that would take part were: Barcelona, Budapest, Brussels, Dublin, Cologne, Lisbon, Liverpool, Paris, Turin, Warsaw and Vienna. The plan emphasized ordinary pastoral care activities, particularly in the field of formation for the priesthood, and the implementation of activities such as reading of the Gospel and the Confessions of St Augustine. On 10 December 2011, he was appointed to a five-year renewable term as a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture.NOMINA DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO DELLA CULTURA On 29 December 2011, he was appointed to a similar term as a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.NOMINA DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO DELLE COMUNICAZIONI SOCIALI On 7 March 2012, he was named a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. In March 2012, when former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Catholic since 2007, expressed support for same sex marriage, Fisichella said: \\"If the stories in the press about Blair's thinking are true, I think he should examine his conscience carefully\\". In May 2017, he said he would not use the title \\"Pope emeritus\\", \\"which theologically creates more problems rather than solving them\\". He praised Benedict XVI's decision to retire, but said he hoped another title could be found.

The library provides free resources for residents of Gallatin County, Montana. Description There were several small libraries serving Bozeman beginning with the Young Men's Library Association in 1872, which was housed above a drug store on East Main Street. A tax-supported city library opened in 1891 on the second floor of the City Hall and Opera House. In 1903-1904, the Bozeman Carnegie Library was built on North Bozeman Avenue, also downtown. That building served as a library until 1980, when a new building was constructed several blocks away on East Lamme Street. This building was then renovated for use as one of the several city government office buildings in Bozeman. The current building on East Main Street was made possible after taxpayers passed a four million dollar bond referendum in 2001. With this funding, 14.3 acres that had belonged to the Milwaukee Railroad (\\"Milwaukee Road\\") was purchased, and construction began in April 2005. The current site of the library is the former location of the old Bozeman \\"Milwaukee Road\\" passenger and partial freight terminal. This railroad was electrified (3,000 volts DC) from Harlowton, Montana, through Butte, Missoula, and Spokane, to Seattle-Tacoma; and so, it is fitting that the current library is notably eco-friendly. The new building of the Bozeman Public Library was opened in November, 2006 and is well-known locally, nationally, and internationally for its use of \\"green\\" architecture. It has 53,000 square feet of space and is the first public building in Montana to have Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver level certification. Some of the \\"green\\" architectural features include the use of natural light, reduced waste in construction, and the use of local building materials. The Bozeman Public Library also has a coffee shop and public space where users can study or read with beverages or food. Views from the windows of the building include the local Bridger Mountain Range. The library offers a full range of services including computer access, an extensive newspaper and periodical section, a young reader area, and comfortable reading chairs and work tables. The library is one of several full-size libraries in the Gallatin Valley, which also include the Montana State University Renne Library, Montana State University Art Library, and Montana State University Educational Resources Library. Awards and honors In 2003, the Institute of Museum and Library Services honored the Bozeman Public Library with the National Award for Library Service.

Ross's sedge grows in a variety of habitats throughout much of western North America, from Alaska to Ontario, south to New Mexico and California. It flowers in May and June. Taxonomy Carex rossii was first described by Francis Boott in Hooker's Flora Boreali- Americana (1839). The type locality was listed as \\"Hab. N. W. Coast. Douglas. Rocky Mountains. Drummond\\" (sic)\\". Description Carex rossii produces a dense clump, or solid mat of slender stems up to about from a shallow network of rhizomes. The pale to dark green leaves are usually longer than the stems. The inflorescences contain one or more staminate flower spikes above more rounded pistillate spikes. The fruit is three-sided, and covered in a greenish or brownish perigynium. Distribution and habitat Carex rossii is native to, and sometimes abundant in, Alaska and subarctic Canada (Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon Territory); western Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan); and the contiguous U.S. (Arizona, California, Colorado, the Dakotas, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.) It is found only sporadically in Ontario, Michigan, and Nebraska. It grows in many habitat types, including wet and dry areas in forest, sagebrush, prairie, and alpine meadows.

Barrett is the discoverer, mentor and first manager of the singer now known as Shakin' Stevens during the 1960s and 1970s, but has also represented and promoted many more of the genre's greats during a long and varied career. Early years Barrett was born in Blackwood, Monmouthshire, in 1940 but moved to Penarth near Cardiff, at an early age, where he has lived ever since. His father was a brass moulder and his mother was a housewife and author. His parents named him Paul after Paul Robeson the black American singer, actor and radical activist, and Francis after Sir Francis Drake. However Barrett always disliked his middle name and formally changed it in 1961 to Franklyn, because he preferred the name and admired Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Earl Fuggle (Barrett) and the Electric Poets in 1966 He was educated at Cogan School, King's College, Cardiff and Victoria Road School, Penarth. On leaving secondary school Barrett had several mundane jobs including photographer's assistant, market barrow- boy, door-to-door salesman, council labourer, brewery worker, warehouseman, plastics-moulder, potato-packer, railway-signalman, shop assistant, grassmower, hospital porter and hotel receptionist. During the 1950s he developed a passion for American rock and roll music. In his spare time he started acting as agent and manager for Penarth's first rock group, the Backbeats. He began promoting teenage dances at the local venue, the Paget Rooms, that would continue until the early 1980s. Barrett was active in promoting events during the annual Penarth Holiday Fortnight each July. A supporter of American Rock and Roll DJ Alan Freed, Barrett also organised film nights at the Paget Rooms. He also opened a specialist rock and roll record shop on Glebe Street. To cash in on the 1960s psychedelic movement in British music the Backbeats briefly shifted to performing as the 'flower power'-style \\"Earl Fuggle and the Electric Poets\\". Barrett himself took the persona of Earl Fuggle on lead vocals. The idea developed into a performance group named \\"The 98% mother and Apple Pie West Coast Rock and Roll Band\\". Shakin' Stevens Cardiff teenager Michael Barratt (later Shakin Stevens) was a fan of the Backbeats, and sometimes performed a guest vocal with the band. He became referred to as 'Rockin' Louie II'.Barrett, Paul; Hayward, Hillary (1983). Shakin' Stevens. W. H. Allen (London). By the mid 1960s however, Barratt had formed his own rock band, named the Olympics, then the Cossacks, then finally the Denims, who became a support act to the Backbeats. When the Denims broke up, Barratt formed a new group named the Rebels. Paul Barrett reluctantly went to see the Rebels after a recommendation early in 1969. Although unimpressed with the band, Barrett saw something in their young singer. He offered to manage Michael Barratt on the condition that he left the Rebels and, secondly, find a new stage name. Barratt agreed, left the Rebels and renamed himself Shakin' Stevens.Heatley, Michael (2005). Shaky. Michael O'Mara Books (London). Barrett (right) singing with Shakin' Stevens and The Sunsets in 1974 Barrett would manage Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets until 1977, even appearing on stage with them as a vocalist. When Shaky began rehearsals for Elvis!-The Musical, the Sunsets used Rockin' Louie as their frontman, until Stevens was free from his commitment to the show. This worked okay until one night at the Rock Garden, London when the audience became disappointed by the non- appearance of Shakin' Stevens and nearly rioted. The venue's management used this to negotiate a rebate from Paul Barrett, a suggestion which nearly ended in a violent confrontation. The Sunsets persisted for a few more years with Barrett arranging tours of the Netherlands and Ireland as well as many one night gigs in the UK. Barrett negotiated Rockin' Louie's recording of an album titled 'It Will Stand' for Charly records that became a minor seller in European markets and a minor hit in the Southern US states. When Louie finally left the Sunsets and reformed the Backbeats, Barrett decided the time had arrived to sever his association with the Sunsets. Several years later the Sunsets started performing again with original members, but with no further association with Barrett. Stevens signed a new management deal with Freya Miller in 1979 and went on to national and international success. Barrett became embroiled in litigation for twenty years over unpaid royalties from several albums that had been written and produced under his guidance, but later rereleased to commercial success. In 1993 after 16 years of negotiations Shakin' Stevens found himself in Cardiff High Court alongside record producer Dave Edmunds facing charges of non-payment of royalties from former Sunsets Rockin' Louie, Carl Petersen, Steve Percy and Paul Dolan. The prosecution claimed that the former band members were due a share of royalties which Shaky and his management had received from the reissue of the album A Legend in the early 1980s. The judge agreed and, while the unpaid royalties only amounted to around ¬£70,000 to be divided amongst all of them, the court costs ended up costing Shaky and Dave Edmunds ¬£500,000. Shaky was willing to call a truce after that court case, Paul Barrett was still angry about the non-payment of royalties from the I'm No J.D. and Rockin' And Shakin' albums. Barrett reissued both albums on a single CD in 2005 under the uncompromising title of How To Be Awarded Two Gold Records And Not Be Paid A Penny in Royalties, complete with sleeve notes issuing a challenge to both Sony and Universal (who now officially own the rights to the two records) to sue him if they believed their rights had been breached. Later career=Manager and agent= Barrett pictured with Bill Haley's Original Comets during 1980 UK filming of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" Ever since first managing Shakin' Stevens in 1969, Barrett has continued to be a professional agent, manager and promoter of 1950s style rock and roll artists including Wee Willie Harris, Bill Haley's original Comets, the Jets, Matchbox, Crazy Cavan and the Rhythm Rockers and Linda Gail Lewis (sister of all time rock great Jerry Lee Lewis). He has promoted and organised weekend long rock and roll themed events and major concerts all over the UK and on mainland Europe. Paul Barrett Rock and Roll Enterprises is now recognised as the principal agency for the genre. =Performing= Barrett's spoken and bass vocals were featured on several early Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets albums, on tracks such as \\"Oh Baby\\" and \\"At the Hop\\", he also spoke the commentary on the track \\"Superstar\\". The album \\"I'm no J.D.\\" was re- released as \\"Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets\\" in the 1980s and was awarded a Gold Record. Barrett also sang live on stage with the band, adding his vocals to the Sunset's mix. =Acting= Since the 1970s Barrett has regularly appeared as an extra in several feature films, the most notable being his major featured appearance as the \\"Table Monster\\" in the kitsch horror film 'Bloody New Year' (aka Horror Hotel (UK), aka Time Warp Terror (US))Bloody New Year at IMDB directed by cult film-maker Norman J.Warren. Barrett was also featured in the rock 'n' roll movie Blue Suede Shoes and appeared in the 1987 TV drama mini-series Sins that starred Joan Collins. =Author= During the 1980s Barrett collaborated with Hilary Heywood in writing the book \\"Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets\\" published by Star Books and W. H. Allen (London). . Barrett originally wanted to call the book \\"Rocky Road Blues ‚Äì The Story of a Rock 'n' Roll Band\\". However the book was subsequently renamed and heavily promoted as a pop biography, becoming a short-lived best seller. Barrett's book was more a humorous 'warts and all' tale of many behind-the-spotlights events during the band's history and quite different to the several other official biographies.

The next morning, Melissa goes about her day but as time passes, slowly becomes aware that those around her have changed since the meteorites fell. It's as if their minds are no longer their own. For example, Melissa's supervisor Samantha seduces her into a passionate lesbian encounter, even though Samantha had never shown any signs of being a lesbian. Melissa soon realizes that the townsfolk have been replaced by a race of aliens known as Pod People. The aliens grow in large seed pods and gradually take the form of a particular person, eventually taking over their bodies once the growth process is complete.

Most are sulfonamides. Tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway In bacteria, antibacterial sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, DHPS. DHPS catalyses the conversion of PABA (para-aminobenzoate) to dihydropteroate, a key step in folate synthesis. Folate is necessary for the cell to synthesize nucleic acids (nucleic acids are essential building blocks of DNA and RNA), and in its absence cells will be unable to divide. Hence the sulfonamide antibacterials exhibit a bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect. Uses Folate is not synthesized in mammalian cells, but is instead a dietary requirement. This explains the selective toxicity to bacterial cells of these drugs. These antibiotics are used to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and shigellosis.

Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher is a philosophical dialogue by the 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley wherein Berkeley combated the arguments of free-thinkers such as Mandeville and Shaftesbury against the Christian religion. It was first published in 1732. The dialogue is primarily between four characters, the free-thinkers Alciphron and Lysicles, Berkeley's spokesman Euphranor, and Crito, who serves as a spokesman for traditional Christianity. The mostly-silent narrator of the dialogue is given the name Dion.  Contents  The work contains two especially notable sections: * Dialogue IV, in which Berkeley presents a novel teleological argument for the existence of God based on Berkeley's theory of visual language, defended in the Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision (first published in 1709, and included with the first edition of Alciphron).See David Kline, \\"Berkeley's Divine Language Argument\\" in Ernest Sosa, ed., Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1987), repr. in David Berman, ed., Alciphron in Focus (London: Routledge, 1993). * Dialogue VII, in which Berkeley presents a novel theory of language which has been compared with the theory of language advocated by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Philosophical Investigations.Anthony Flew, \\"Was Berkeley a Precursor of Wittgenstein?\\" in W. B. Todd, ed. Hume and the Enlightenment: Essays Presented to Ernest Campbell Mossner (Edinburgh: The University Press, 1974), repr. in Berman, ed., Alciphron. In a later work, The Theory of Vision Vindicated and Explained (first published in 1733), Berkeley adduced the work of Alberto Radicati as evidence that the views advocated by the character Lysicles were not overly exaggerated (para. 5). The work expressed Berkeley's opposition to Catholicism. In it, he suggested that freethinking, by damaging Protestantism, would leave England open to conversion by Roman Catholic missionaries. In 1742, the Catholic Church responded to the work's anti-Catholic views by placing it on the Index of Forbidden Books, where it remained until the abolition of the Index in 1966.  Publication  It was originally published anonymously under the full title Alciphron: or, the minute philosopher. In seven dialogues. Containing an apology for the Christian religion, against those who are called free-thinkers, printed in London by J. Tonson in 2 volumes. The second volume contains his An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision and so it was not very anonymous.WorldCat https://www.worldcat.org/title/alciphron-or-the-minute-philosopher-in-seven- dialogues-containing-an-apology-for-the-christian-religion-against-those-who- are-called-free-thinkers/oclc/833957138 The posthumous 1755 edition was the first to include Berkeley's name as author. The book was begun while Berkeley was living at Whitehall Farm, Rhode Island, and then finished when he came back to London in 1731.David Berman, ed., Alciphron in Focus (London: Routledge, 1993).  Reception  The book was criticised by a letter in the Daily Postboy (September 1732) to whom Berkeley replied in his Theory of Vision (1733). Peter Browne, Bishop of Cork, responded to Berkeley in his Divine Analogy (1733). Bernard Mandeville replied in a pamphlet entitled A Letter to Dion (1732). Lord Hervey protested against Alciphron's rationalism in his Some Remarks on the Minute Philosopher (1732). Francis Hutchenson's philosophical criticism appeared in the fourth edition of his Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1738). The American clergyman Samuel Johnson wrote a more sympathetic review in the Elementa Philosophica (1752).David Berman, ed., Alciphron in Focus (London: Routledge, 1993).

He is recognized as a pioneer of special effects photography that predates digital imaging. Early life Horowitz was born in Krak√≥w, Poland on May 5, 1939. Four months later, Ryszard's entire family were forced into concentration camps following the German invasion of Poland. From September 1944 he was imprisoned at Auschwitz and later became known as being among the youngest known people to survive Auschwitz concentration camp and to be listed on Schindler's list. At the war's end, five-year old Ryszard was reunited with his family after his mother found him in an orphanage, and they were amongst the few Jewish families to re-establish themselves in Krakow.Martin, Douglas. \\"When Holocaust Lives With Parents\\", The New York Times, April 29, 1995. Accessed February 2, 2009. Horowitz began taking pictures at the age of fourteen. For a brief period of time during his childhood he grew up alongside Roman Pola≈Ñski with whom he created his first photographic enlarger from cardboard. Career In 1956, the Polish government began awarding subsidies to encourage new and original art forms and Krak√≥w suddenly emerged as a center of avant-garde jazz, painting, theater and filmmaking. For two years, beginning in 1959, Ryszard studied art at the High School of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w and then went on to major in painting at the Academy of Fine Arts. It was at this time that he became interested in photography, particularly the work of American photographers. Jazz music was of particular interest to Horowitz as a photography student. He photo documented the birth of Polish Jazz and in 1958 photographed jazz legends such as Dave Brubeck, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Sonny Rollins at the Newport Jazz Festival. Ryszard immigrated to the United States in 1959 and enrolled at New York's Pratt Institute in the commercial and advertising graphic design department. Here he encountered his mentors, Richard Avedon and Alexey Brodovitch. Horowitz took part in weekly seminars led by Brodovitch and worked as an assistant for Avedon in 1963, including at his famous portrait session with Salvador Dali. After graduating from Pratt in 1962, Horowitz began working in film and television and graphic design companies, including a stint as Art Director for Grey Advertising. In 1967, he opened his own photography studio in New York City. He has developed a successful career in both fine art and commercial photography, but is most well known for creating complex photographic composites, which have been compared to the surrealist artworks of Magritte and Dali. Early in his career, to obtain such effects he used a multitude of photographic techniques such as darkroom retouching, multiple film exposures and manipulation of his camera. In popular culture Horowitz was depicted as a child in Steven Spielberg's epic drama Schindler's List - a film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives over thousand Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Horowitz, along with other Schindlerjuden, appears in the final scene as mourners at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. Horowitz's photographs appear on the cover of both Dot Hacker's 2014 How's Your Process albums. Because of his unique style he was asked to produce the cover for the premier issue of Nuestro magazine in 1977. Personal life In 1974, Horowitz married Anna Bogusz, an architect. They have two sons, Daniel and Emil.

Born to a working-class family in the north of England, and a full-time art student on scholarship at 13, Clarke came to prominence in the late 1970s as a painter and figure of the Punk movement and designer of ecclesiastical stained glass, and by the early 1980s had become a major figure in international contemporary art, the subject of several television documentaries and a caf√© society regular known for his architectonic art, prolific output in various media, friendships with celebrities and key cultural figures, and polemical lectures and interviews. His practice in architectural and autonomous stained glass, often on a monumental scale, has led to successive innovation and invention in the development of the medium, including the creation of stained glass without lead and the subsequent pioneering of a 'dramatically enhanced Pointillism', and the creation of sculptural stained glass works, analogous to collage, made primarily or entirely of lead. The latter two advances are described as having taken stained glass as an artform to its zero-point in each direction: absolute transparency, and, conversely, complete opacity. A lifelong exponent of the integration of art and architecture, his architectural collaborations include work with Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster, Arata Isozaki, Oscar Niemeyer, I. M. Pei, C√©sar Pelli and Renzo Piano. He served a 7-year term as chairman of The Architecture Foundation, and served on the Design Review Committee of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. His artistic collaborations have included work with David Bailey, Hugh Hudson, Malcolm McLaren, Linda McCartney, Paul McCartney and Ivor Abrahams. Biography=Early life= Brian Clarke was born in Oldham, Lancashire, to Edward Ord Clarke, a coal miner, and Lilian Clarke (n√©e Whitehead), a cotton spinner. Raised in a family familiar with spiritualism, his maternal grandmother a notable local medium, Clarke attended a Spiritualist Lyceum through his childhood and, considered a ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô, gained a reputation locally as a 'boy medium'. In 1965, aged 12, he applied for a place as the last intake of an education scheme existing in the North of England to enable artistically promising children to leave their secondary school and become full-time art students,. and was awarded a scholarship to the Oldham School of Arts and Crafts. In place of a standard curriculum, he principally studied the arts and design, learning drawing, heraldry, pictorial composition, colour theory, pigment mixing and calligraphy among other subjects. Considered a prodigy, by the age of 16 Clarke had mastered the orthodoxies of academic life drawing. In 1968 he and his family moved to Burnley and, too young at 15 to gain entrance to Burnley College of Art, he lied about his age and was accepted on the strength of his previous work. =1970s= F. X. Velarde's 1932-1934 Art Deco church of St Gabriel, Blackburn. In 1970 Clarke enrolled in the Architectural Stained Glass course at North Devon College of Art and Design, from which he graduated two years later with a first class distinction in their Diploma in Design. In 1971, aged 17, he received his first commission, for a series of windows in the Grade II* listed Southcott Barton, a 17th- century residential home, and the following year received his first ecclesiastical commission, for a memorial window in Preston Minster. In August 1972, he married his fellow art student Liz Finch, the daughter of a local vicar, opened a stained glass studio in Preston, and began to take on work including painting restoring, designing lamps, repairing damaged ecclesiastical glass, as well as working independently as a painter. This was followed by a commission for a new window for Coppull Church, Lancashire, in 1973, and further secular stained glass commissions, for which he painted, fired, leaded, assembled and installed the windows and panels himself, transporting them on a local bus. Further local ecclesiastical commissions followed. In 1974 Clarke was awarded the Winston Churchill Memorial Travelling Fellowship to study medieval and contemporary stained glass in Italy, France and West Germany. That same year he received a commission for a suite of 20 windows for the Church of St Lawrence, Longridge, considered to be his first mature work, and in 1975 was awarded the Churchill Extension Fellowship to study art in architecture in the United States. Later in 1975 Clarke moved to Birchover, Derbyshire, renting a vicarage as home and studio from the local church authorities ‚Äì he later designed and gifted a suite of windows to the parish church, St Michael and All Angels. A travelling exhibition of secular, autonomous stained glass panels inspired in part by Oriental landscape painting, Glass Art One, was shown at venues in Derbyshire and Lancashire, including Derby Cathedral and Manchester Cathedral. An internationally notable commission from the University of Nottingham to produce 45 paintings, vestments, and a series of stained glass windows for a multi-faith chapel in the Queen's Medical Centre followed, the process of which was filmed by the BBC as material for a documentary. The research from the two Churchill Trust Fellowships led to the Arts Council of Great Britain-funded exhibition of stained glass GLASS/LIGHT, co-curated by Clarke, British war artist John Piper and art historian Martin Harrison, with the collaboration of Marc Chagall, and produced the book Architectural Stained Glass. GLASS/LIGHT, part of the Festival of the City of London, was the most extensive exhibition of stained glass of the 20th century. In 1978, Clarke controversially appeared on the cover of the journal Architectural Review with a work titled Velarde is Not Mocked. Clarke had been commissioned to design and fabricate two windows for the notable 1930s Art Deco church of St Gabriel‚Äôs, Blackburn, by F. X Velarde, which was to be restored, and the windows were designed to complement and respond to the architecture, making reference to the elements of the original design. The building, considered one of the milestones in the development of English church architecture towards modernism, was changed significantly by the restoring architect and the interior and exterior elements were unsympathetically altered. Clarke's public attack on the treatment of the architecture by the restoring firm marked the end of his working in the church. In 1979 he undertook a polemical lecture tour of British universities on the subject of art and architecture, and was the subject of an hour-long BBC Omnibus documentary, Brian Clarke: The Story So Far, which followed a year in his life. Seen by millions of viewers, at a time when the UK had only 3 television channels, the programme received multiple complaints and propelled him into the public eye. Later in 1979, Clarke became a presenter on the BBC2 arts programme Mainstream, and the BBC Radio 4 programme Kaleidescope, conducting interviews with figures including Brassa√Ø, Andy Warhol, John Lennon, and Elisabeth Lutyens, and giving Sheffield band The Human League, of whom he‚Äôd been an early supporter, their first television appearance. =1980s= Oil painting by Clarke from the Via Crucis series, titled And He is Condemned (1983), exhibited at the reopening of the Robert Fraser Gallery At the start of 1980, Clarke began to paint in oils again after a period of working primarily graphically and in acrylic, and created his first constructions, in wood and steel, and designs for furniture. Clarke accepted a proposal to design stage sets for Kraftwerk, and collaborated on unrealised projects with David Bailey, with Brian Eno, and with Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood as designer of the aborted zine Chicken, whose creation was funded by EMI and filmed by BBC's Arena. Noticing the similarity between the reticular, Constructivist-derived symbols that dominated his work and the light-metering computergrams from the Olympus OM System cameras, he produced a series of technology-related paintings, including one titled Time Lag Zero for the headquarters of Olympus Optical (UK). Its unveiling at Langan's Brasserie by Patrick Lichfield for the fifth anniversary of Olympus UK was filmed by Granada Television as part of a documentary on Clarke and his work, released by ITV as Time Lag Zero: Impressions of Brian Clarke. Later that year, a major commission for paintings, a wooden construction, and a suite of stained glass windows for the Olympus European Headquarters Building in Hamburg was executed, for which Clarke was given 'complete freedom of the design of the entrance hall for the new building', and, starring in a series of adverts for Olympus and for Polaroid, he became a household name in the UK and the United States. The complexity of the stained glass designs for Hamburg necessitated the development of special diamond cutting and sandblasting techniques to accommodate the graphic, non-structural role of the lead in places, and marked the start of Clarke's manufacturing his windows in Germany rather than England, a major break with tradition. The Royal Mosque at King Khalid International Airport, completed in 1982 as the largest stained glass project of the modern era In 1981, Clarke was invited to teach as a visiting artist at Pilchuck Glass School in Washington, with Patrick Reyntiens and Dale Chihuly, for the summer education programme. Clarke introduced all-day life-drawing classes, intensively teaching academic drawing from the life in place of glass painting techniques with the aim of opening up 'new ways of looking at glass design'. Later that year, receiving a commission from the Government of Saudi Arabia for the Royal Mosque of King Khalid International Airport, Clarke studied Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez. A portfolio of screenprints, dedicated to his friend C. P. Snow and titled 'The Two Cultures' (after Lord Snow's influential 1959 Rede Lecture on the perceived gulf between the humanities and sciences of the same name) was published, and he became the first artist to have an exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects, with a solo show of his paintings, constructions and prints. That year, the first monograph on his work, Brian Clarke by Martin Harrison, was published, and the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired a large-scale stained glass triptych, executed by him in 1979, and an oil painting titled Trial and Error. The Royal Mosque, completed in 1982 and containing 2,000 square metres of stained glass, was considered to be the largest and technically most advanced stained glass project of the modern period, requiring the full staff of 4 stained glass factories and 150 craftsmen, taking a year to fabricate. Urged by his art dealer Robert Fraser to leave Britain to avoid the gossip columns and paparazzi, Clarke moved to live and work in D√ºsseldorf and Rome. In 1982, Clarke produced the cover painting for Paul McCartney's solo album Tug of War, designing the cover together with Linda McCartney. In 1983 the Tate acquired an edition of The Two Cultures and Fraser, a key figure of the Swinging Sixties who first brought to Europe the work of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, reopened his gallery on Cork Street in London with a show of Clarke's paintings and with the aid of funding from him. The opening night received significant press coverage, and public interest and celebrity attendance led to the opening party spilling out into the street, necessitating its closure by police cordon. Before its closure following Fraser's death in 1986, the gallery went on to exhibit and introduce to the British public the works of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Ellsworth Kelly, both of whom Clarke exhibited with, and Keith Haring. In 1984, Clarke was commissioned to contribute to the refurbishment of Joseph Paxton's Thermal Baths on the Royal Crescent in Buxton; his scheme, designed in 1984 and completed in 1987, was for a landmark barrel-vaulted stained glass ceiling to enclose the Grade II-listed former baths, creating the Cavendish Arcade. In 1989 a second project with Derek Latham and Co, for the regeneration of an inner-Leeds district, saw the Leeds Victoria Quarter created through the pedestrianising and covering-over of Queen Victoria Street. Clarke's proposal was to cover the length of the street with stained glass; the design, installed in 1990, was at the time the largest stained glass work in the world. In 1988, architect Arata Isozaki approached Clarke to collaborate with him on the Lake Sagami Building in Yamanishi. Clarke designed a composition of stained glass for the central lantern and a series of interrelated skylights that internally referenced elements of Isozaki‚Äôs building and early designs, for which Isozaki in turn designed a lighting system that turned the work and building into a beacon at night. The same year, Clarke and Norman Foster proposed a major stained glass artwork for the new terminal building of Stansted Airport, by Foster + Partners. The collaboration, the first time in the history of stained glass that computer-assisted design had been utilised in the creative process, would have seen the east and west walls of the High-tech building clad in two sequences of traditionally mouth-blown, leaded stained glass. For technical and security reasons, the original scheme, which Clarke considered to be his magnum opus, couldn't be executed. The stained glass windows and dome, and ceramic and carved wood Torah ark of the New Synagogue, Darmstadt, designed by Clarke =1990s= In 1991, the British Airports Authority commissioned a second, smaller stained glass project from Clarke for Stansted Airport in place of his and Sir Norman Foster's original 1988 proposal. The artist designed two friezes and a 6-metre high tower of stained glass for a circulation area in centre of the terminal which, in their composition, echoed elements of Foster's structure; by 1994 the tower had been removed to 'allow greater flow of traffic through the space', and later the friezes were likewise removed. In 1992, Clarke first collaborated with architect Will Alsop, on Le Grand Bleu, the H√¥tel du d√©partement des Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne (the county government office of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne) in Marseille. The building, now considered a major work of late 20th century architecture and a Marseille landmark, developed its visual identity through the design process, with Clarke and Alsop's final version externally clad in Yves Klein blue glass, with one elevation formed of a 1,200 m2 artwork by Clarke screenprinted in ceramic glaze, paralleling Edwardian faience, onto the facade. In 1994, Zaha Hadid and Clarke developed an unexecuted collaborative proposal for the Spittelau Viaducts Housing Project, a waterfront redevelopment in Vienna, that incorporated integral, interrelated mosaic and stained glass. The project, which experienced delays in construction, was completed in 2006, without the artwork. In 1998, Clarke and John Edwards donated the contents of the artist Francis Bacon's studio to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin. The studio at 7 Reece Mews had remained largely untouched since Bacon's death in 1992, and the decision was taken to preserve it for posterity. A team of archaeologists, art historians, conservators and curators moved the studio, wholesale, to Dublin. The locations of over 7,000 items were mapped, survey drawings made, the items packed and catalogued, and the studio was rebuilt, including the original doors, floor, walls and ceiling. In 2001 the relocated studio was opened to the public, with a fully comprehensive database, the first computerised record of the entire contents of an artist's studio. Clarke (Executor of the Will of Francis Bacon) v Marlborough Fine Art Following the death of Clarke's friend Francis Bacon in 1992, in 1998 the English High Court severed all ties between Bacon's former gallery, Marlborough Fine Art, and his estate, and Clarke was appointed sole executor of the Estate of Francis Bacon by the High Court, on behalf of Bacon's heir John Edwards. Clarke transferred representation of Francis Bacon to the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, where a major show was mounted of 17 previously unseen Bacon paintings recovered from his studio. A court case was brought against Marlborough, Professor Brian Clarke (Executor of the Will of Francis Bacon) v Marlborough Fine Art (London), alleging that the Gallery had underpaid Bacon for his work, asserted undue influence over him, and failed to account for up to 33 of his paintings, but following John Edwards' diagnosis with lung cancer in 2002 the litigation was settled out of court, with each side paying its own costs. During the legal process an undisclosed number of Bacon's paintings were recovered from Marlborough, and \\"vast quantities of correspondence and documents relating to the life of the artist were handed over by the gallery\\". =2000s= In 2004, Clarke collaborated with Norman Foster on the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a landmark building in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, built to house the triennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. Initial designs incorporated a stained glass ramp throughout the pyramidical structure; completed in 2006, the transparent upper portion is clad in 9700 square feet of stained glass, which forms the pyramid‚Äôs apex. In 2010, Clarke was commissioned to design stained glass for the new Papal Chapel of the Apostolic Nunciature to Great Britain, the diplomatic embassy of the Holy See, for Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom, the first state visit of a Pope to Britain. Work Paintings, stained glass, screenprints, collage, constructions, ceramics, mosaic, fresco, furniture, sculpture, tapestry, jewellery and ironmongery by Clarke can be found in architectural settings and private and public collections internationally, including the Tate, Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bavarian State Painting Collections at Museum Brandhorst, Munich, the Sezon Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, and the Corning Museum of Glass, New York. Major works include the five-story stained glass wall in the lobby of the Al Faisaliyah Center in Riyadh for the King Faisal Foundation, the largest stained glass work in the world between 2000 and 2017, and Stansted Airport; 21,528 sq ft of stained glass for the Royal Mosque at King Khalid International Airport); the mosaic and stained glass ceiling of Pfizer World Headquarters in New York, for which Clarke developed new techniques for the inclusion of two colours in a single sheet of opaque glass (in 1997), and a new stained glass facade (in 2001); stained glass, mosaic, ceramics, and turf-cut chalk drawing for Beaverbrook Coach House and Spa; the Stamford Cone in Connecticut; windows for Link√∂ping Cathedral in Sweden; the world's largest stage sets (for Paul McCartney's 1993 World Tour); and both the largest stained glass work in Great Britain and Europe, and the largest in the world. Other projects include ecclesiastical commissions in churches, mosques and synagogues across Europe, the US and the Middle East (including the Holocaust Memorial Synagogue in Darmstadt, built on the site of the former Gestapo headquarters, the Heidelberg Synagogue, and the Sinai Temple, Chicago; stage sets for Wayne Eagling's Dutch National Ballet tribute to Clarke's friend Rudolf Nureyev, and sets for an opera of The Crucible (Hexenjagd) directed by Hugh Hudson at Staatstheater Braunschweig; the stained glass and mosaic of Norte Shopping, Rio de Janeiro; the Spindles Shopping Mall, Oldham; the stained glass ceiling of the Victoria Quarter Arcade in Leeds, which replaced Buxton as the largest stained glass work in the world; windows for the 13th century Cistercian Abbaye de la Fille-Dieu, Romont, Switzerland; collaborations in stained glass and cyanotypes with photographer Linda McCartney; the cover of Terence Davies‚Äô book Hallelujah Now, and EP and album covers for Paul McCartney, Jools Holland, Worldbackwards and EMI Classical. Stained glass skylight by Clarke, 120 sq metres total. Inspired by William Walton's Orb and Sceptre Coronation March and executed for The Spindles in Oldham (1993) = Unexecuted projects = Clarke's design of stained glass for the Great South Window of the grandstand at Royal Ascot Racecourse, as part of the ¬£185 million 2004-2006 redevelopment funded by Allied Irish Bank and designed by Populous and Buro Happold, was to have been the world's largest work in the medium. The project received royal approval from Queen Elizabeth II, but problems arose during the redevelopment's construction that prevented the installation of the window, as redressing them would have necessitated a delay to reopening the racecourse, leading to the project being scrapped. Commissions for two roundel windows in Derby Cathedral (1976), and for the North Transept windows of Salisbury Cathedral (2014-2019), were not approved by the Church of England. Clarke worked on designs with Norman Foster for incorporating stained glass throughout Stansted Airport, and a glass tower for the Willis Faber and Dumas Building; Renzo Piano for a public sculpture for the Shard at London Bridge; Zaha Hadid on mosaic and stained glass for a building in Spittelau, Vienna, and KAPSARC, Saudi Arabia; with Will Alsop on mosaic and stained glass for Crossrail Paddington, and stained glass for Hungerford Bridge; and stained glass for Stratford International.

In August 2019, he was revealed to be a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that he committed acts of sex abuse during the time he served as a priest in Nassau County, New York in the late 1970s.https://www.live5news.com/2019/08/14/lawsuit-accuses-bishop-catholic- diocese-charleston-sexually-abusing-minor/ Biography=Early life and education= Robert Guglielmone was born in New York City to Frank and Caroline Guglielmone. One of three children, he has two brothers, Nicholas and Tito. He was raised on Long Island and attended St. John's University in Queens, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Education. He then taught at Patchogue-Medford High School for five years while also doing his graduate work at New York University. =Ordination and ministry= Guglielmone, feeling a call to the priesthood, entered Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington and earned a Master's in Divinity before being ordained on April 8, 1978. He then served as assistant pastor at St. Martin of Tours Church in Amityville and at St. James Church in Setauket. In 1986, he was named director of pastoral formation and dean of seminarians at Immaculate Conception Seminary. He became pastor of St. Frances de Chantal Church in Wantagh in 1993, and was raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1996. In 2003, after a grand jury report on the handling of sexual abuse cases in the Diocese of Rockville Centre sparked public outrage, Bishop William Murphy named Guglielmone to be the diocesan Director of Clergy Personnel. He was later made rector of St. Agnes Cathedral in 2007. Scouting involvement Guglielmone is known for his substantial involvement in Scouting. He started his Scouting career as camp chaplain at Onteora Scout Reservation in Livingston Manor, during his time as a seminarian. As a priest, he served as Scout chaplain for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, then for New York State and then as chaplain for the National Catholic Committee on Scouting. Guglielmone served an eight-year term as chaplain of the International Catholic Conference on Scouting and the Holy See's global liaison to scouting programs. He received the Silver Beaver Award from Suffolk County Council. Guglielmone is member the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts of America's honor society. There, he was inducted as a \\"Vigil Honor\\" member, the third and final degree of membership, in 1985. \\"Vigil Honor\\" members traditionally receive a name in the Unami language, referred to in the Order as \\"Lenni Lenape.\\" Guglielmone's \\"Vigil Name\\" is \\"Nekama Auwen Allohumasin Lilenowag An Unt,\\" which was interpreted as \\"He Who Exemplifies God's Law.\\"Private Records, Buckskin Lodge, WWW, c/o Theodore Roosevelt Council, BSA, Massapequa, New York He received the Silver Antelope Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 2004.http://trcbsa.org/Honors/Silver%20Antelope%20Award.htm The National Catholic Committee on Scouting recognized Guglielmone with its \\"Brother Barnabas Founders Award\\" and in its first class of \\"Silver Saint George Emblem\\" recipients in 1998. In 2012, he received the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest award given by the National Council, Boy Scouts of America for distinguished service to youth. =Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina= On January 24, 2009, Guglielmone was appointed the thirteenth Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina, by Pope Benedict XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 25 from Cardinal Edward Egan, with Bishops Murphy and Robert Joseph Baker serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. As bishop of the diocese he has the role of shepherding the State's 195,000 Catholics. The appointment fills the vacancy left by Bishop Robert Baker, who was transferred to the diocese of Birmingham in August 2007. The state's registered Catholic population more than doubled since 1990, largely due to massive Hispanic immigration. Sex Abuse Allegations In August 2019, it was revealed that. Guglielmone was being sued in the state of New York for sex abuse he reportedly committed while serving in Nassau County, New York, whose Catholic property is supervised by the Diocese of Rockville Centre.https://www.postandcourier.com/news/bishop-of- charleston-diocese-accused-of-sexual-abuse-in- new/article_9485658c-becc-11e9-a393-5f1147683fb4.html The acts of abuse were reported to have taken place in the years 1978 and 1979 at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Amityville, New York, where Guglielmone was at this time serving as a priest.

One of these, known as the \\"old\\" or \\"ancient\\" castle, was by legend founded by Wada, a 6th-century ruler of H√§lsingland. The second castle, () caput of the feudal barony of Mulgrave, was of Norman construction and remained active until destroyed by order of Parliament in 1647. The third is a country house () which was constructed by Lady Catherine Darnley and passed in 1718 by marriage into the Phipps family, when her daughter Lady Catherine Annesley married William Phipps. The Phipps family later held the titles of Baron Mulgrave, Earl of Mulgrave and Marquess of Normanby. History=Ancient castle= The 19th-century Handbook for Travellers in Yorkshire and for Residents in the County recounts that the ancient castle was built by Wada, ruler of H√§lsingland. (Public domain.) Leland in his Itineraries, circa 1545, refers to several local legends supposing Wada to have been a giant who built many castles and roads in Yorkshire. =Second castle= Ruins of the Norman Mulgrave Castle A second castle, which occupied the entire width of the ridge, seems to have been Norman, presumably constructed by Nigel Fossard (d. about 1120), who obtained the property after the Norman Conquest. Fossard is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a tenant of 114 manors, all in Yorkshire, including under Robert, Count of Mortain of \\"Grif\\", identified as Mulgrave in the hundred of Langbaurgh.Domesday Map website He became himself a tenant-in-chief of the king in 1088, and a holder of the large feudal barony whose caput was at Mulgrave, hence known as the barony of Mulgrave, which according to the Cartae Baronum return made in 1166 comprised 33 1/2 knight's fees.Sanders, p.66 The main approach was located on the west, with two stone towers overlooking the entrance. Moats prohibited approach from the east and ensured that western approach was by means of a drawbridge.Leyland et al., 59. Differing levels of land surrounding the containing walls caused the wall to bulge outwards, which required buttressing. Some of the bricks used in the structure are clearly Roman.

The cross is apparently a boundary marker erected by the de Mauley family, possibly concerning their grazing rights as barons of Mulgrave Nigel Fossard's son Robert died c.1135, Robert's son William I d. c. 1170, leaving a son William II who died in 1195 leaving an heiress Joan, who brought the barony and castle to her husband Robert de Turnham (d.1211). Their only surviving child and heiress was Isabel de Turnham who brought the barony and castle to Peter de Mauley (or Maulay) (d.1241) to whom she had been granted in marriage by King John on the escheatment of the barony. De Mauley was a native of Poitou, whose marriage to this wealthy heiress is said to have been his reward for having murdered in 1203 Prince Arthur, the son of John's elder brother who threatened his succession to the throne.Burke, John, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerages of England, Ireland,pp.342-346, de Mauley He was governor of Corfe Castle in Dorset where he acted as jailer of Eleanor, Arthur's sister.http://www.british-towns, Mulgrave Castle Peter I's heir was Peter II de Mauley (1226‚Äì1279), who married Joan de Brus (d.1243), one of five sisters of Peter III de Brus (d.1272), feudal baron of Skelton, Yorkshire, who was his brother-in-law, having married Hilary de Mauley, Peter II's sister.Sanders, p.77, Barony of Skelton In the time of Peter II the barony was held by knight service of supplying two knights in time of war in the king's presence for 40 days per annum.Sanders, p.67, footnote 2 Peter II's heir was Peter III de Mauley (d.1308), who married Nicole de Ghent (d. before 1302), sister and in her issue co-heir (in a 1/3rd share) to Gilbert V de Ghent (d.1298), feudal baron of Folkingham, Lincolnshire.Sanders, p.46, Barony of Folkingham Peter III was summoned to parliament by writ dated 23 June 1296,Burke, op.cit. creating him Baron Mauley.www.maulefamily.com Peter III's seal can be seen as one of 72 appended to the Barons' Letter, 1301 to the Pope\\"www.briantimms.fr sealed at the Parliament of Lincoln in January 1301, and shows him on the reverse in the usual pose for early seals holding sword and shield astride his galloping war- horse, with the tails of his surcoat swept back by the wind.

The castle passed to Sir John Bigot (c.1376-1426/7) of Settrington, Yorks., on his marriage to Constance de Mauley (c.1385-15/12/1450), eldest daughter & co- heiress of Peter VII de Mauley (d.1378), whose son Peter VIII had died in 1415 without issue, when the barony of Mauley by writ became extinct. Bigot was 5th in descent from Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk (d.1225). The property passed to the Radcliffes on the marriage of Dorothy Bigot into that family, before settling in 1625 on Lord Sheffield of Butterwick, later to be titled Earl of Mulgrave by Charles I. There is evidence that the initial construction by the Fossards was updated and altered by subsequent residents.Leyland et al., 60. The castle was garrisoned by royalists during the English Civil War. Subsequently, it was dismantled by Parliamentary order in 1647; the lie of bricks from the destruction suggest that gunpowder might have been employed for this purpose. =Present manor= The third construction, a castellated mansion, was ordered by Lady Catherine Darnley, Duchess of Buckingham, illegitimate daughter of James II of England and then wife of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. The property passed to the Phipps family in 1718, when the Duchess's daughter Lady Catherine Annesley married William Phipps. A summer house was also built on the grounds, according to legend on the spot of a hermitage which William de Percy established in 1150. In 1858 Duleep Singh, the last Maharajah of the Punjab, took a lease on Mulgrave Castle. As of 2010, the property is held by Constantine Phipps, 5th Marquess of Normanby. In 2003, supermodel Elle Macpherson took out a lease on the Mulgrave estate, considered one of England's finest shooting estates, including the right to live in the Phipps family's ancestral home, Mulgrave Castle, during the four-month shooting season.

Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and many people did not survive the trip.Author –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –ö—É–∑—å–º–∏–Ω–∞: –î–∞–ª—å—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π. –ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ \\"–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –ö–æ–ª—ã–º–∞: –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –∏ –ª—é–¥–∏\\".

When the steamer –î–∂—É—Ä–º–∞ or –ö—É–ª—É entered Nagayev Bay and signaled the arrival, everybody in the city knew that a new stage of prisoners had arrived, with up to 7,000 people in the holds. A column of ragged, hungry, wearied people, who had undergone night interrogations, were led from the shore to the \\"transitka\\" (the local name of transit camp), under the escort of submachine gunners with dogs. From here stages of prisoners went to camps in Kolyma. A former captain of Djurma, who became a captain of the ship Dalstroi, was arrested in Magadan on November 6, 1937 when he was 43 years old. After six months of inquiry, he confessed to espionage in favor of Japan and was shot.

Misunderstandings=Alleged 1933‚Äì34 incident= In an account by David Dallin and Boris Nicolaevsky in their 1947 book Forced Labor in Soviet Russia, it was suggested that in the winter of 1933‚Äì34 the Dzhurma, ferrying 12,000 prisoners to Ambarchik, got trapped in the Arctic ice and was unable to move on until the spring.Bollinger, p. 65ff. The story alleged that all prisoners died from frost and starvation with later versions indicating that surviving crew members may have resorted to cannibalism to survive. The story was propagated and widely accepted.Tolstoy, p. 16.Rossi, p. 103., February 3, 2003 access date January 24, 2009 If true, this would have been among the worst ship disasters of all time. In his book Stalin's Slave Ships, Martin Bollinger examined the evidence and found that the Dzhurma did not enter service in the Dalstroi until 1935 and was not big enough to hold 12,000 prisoners. Bollinger estimated that the ship, if overcrowded, would be able to hold up to 6,500 prisoners. In addition, there are no accounts that this ship, which was not strengthened for Arctic travel, made the journey north through the Bering Strait to Ambarchik. Thus the alleged event has been proven not to be true. He suggested this could possibly be the case of a mistaken identity involving the cargo ship Khabarovsk that, if it had been carrying passengers had already had opportunity to deposit them at Ambarchik, and was trapped by ice when returning from Ambarchik in the 1933‚Äì34 winter.Often after the loss of a vessel, other new or purchased the ship was commissioned under the same name. It is Soviet reality, when some persons refreshed in own memory the same and the Soviet official sources say, that it had not place. But it is earlier to say, that this incident with 12,000 people had place. The history of this ship, or two ships, has not investigated properly still. Shining path As per Soviet Union ideology, Soviet people used \\"shining path\\" to see \\"shining future\\" and to built \\"shining life\\". The Soviet musical-comedy film Shining path was filmed in 1940. The old ship Djurma was decommissioned in 1967. The premier of the film Chief of Chukotka (1966‚Äì67) by Vladimir Valutsky and V. Viktorov was in the USSR on 17 of April, 1967. In this film the main hero says about \\"shining life\\", to see beginning of the film.

Brookdale's primary and secondary service areas together comprise 1 million residents. It serves most of Eastern Brooklyn. Brookdale is one of Brooklyn's largest voluntary nonprofit teaching hospitals and a regional tertiary care center. It provides 24-hour emergency services, numerous outpatient programs and long-term specialty care. Brookdale is one of Brooklyn's largest full service emergency departments and is a level II trauma center. It is one of 14 New York State DOH designated Stroke Centers in Brooklyn. It provides numerous outpatient Ambulatory care services in both on campus and off site facilities. Brookdale specializes in rehabilitative medicine and long-term specialty care in its Schulman and Schachne Institute for Nursing and Rehabilitation and in addition is home to 86 units of assisted living and independent housing in the Arlene and David Schlang Pavilion. History Brookdale opened on April 11, 1921 with one building housing 75 beds between Brownsville, East New York, and Canarsie. The first President of the Medical Board was Simon R. Blatteis, who was also a leading figure in organizing the development of the hospital.Samuel Philip Abelow, History of Brooklyn Jewry (1937), p. 226. Originally called the Brownsville and East New York Hospital, it was renamed Beth-El Hospital in 1932. The hospital, under the directorship of Jacob Rutstein, greatly expanded its facilities at that time. It became Brookdale Hospital in 1963, and Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in 1971. In 1993, Brookdale opened the first designated long term AIDS center in Brooklyn. It was later renamed the Treatment for Life Center. The Radutzky Emergency Care Pavilion was dedicated in 1982, and was designated a Level I Trauma Center in the same year (now it is a level II trauma center). A major expansion was completed in 2004. In 2005 Brookdale became a 911 receiving Stroke Center. Facilities Brookdale is both a treatment facility and an academic medical center, certified with 530 acute-care beds, and more than 50 specialty clinics. In addition, Brookdale and its affiliates comprise the following: * 448 skilled nursing beds located in the affiliated Schulman and Schachne Institute for Nursing and Rehabilitation. * 86 units of assisted living and independent living housing in the Arlene and David Schlang Pavilion. * A comprehensive Adult Day Care Center * A Comprehensive Health Center, an advanced 16-level, fully equipped inpatient facility. * A state-of- the art Emergency Department with a Level I Trauma Center and a full range of 24-hour emergency services. * A community mental health center, an ambulatory surgery center and a 16-chair dental suite. * OB space with Labor, Delivery, and Recovery Suites. * An Urgent Care Center * Six primary care Brookdale Family Care Centers, located in the outlying communities. * Pharmacy - The Department was the spearhead for statewide clinical services, led by the longtime New York State Board of Pharmacy President, Seymour Katz, and currently led by Johnny Ha. It has many advanced clinical programs and training in PGY-1 Pharmacy Practice and the PGY-2 Ambulatory Care residency programs each enroll 2 residents per year.  Superstorm Sandy  In late October 2012, a few days before expected arrival Hurricane Sandy in New York, Brookdale Hospital was enlisted by the New York State Department of Health in the State's emergency response efforts to the anticipated storm. Brookdale was asked to house and care for 105 acute-care nursing home residents and hospital patients at its main hospital facility. Ninety-five residents from three nursing homes in the zone of flood risk (Lawrence Nursing Home, Ocean Promenade Nursing Center, and Shore View Nursing Center). The remaining 10 patients came from Coney Island Hospital, also in the probable flood zone. Patients under the supervision of the US Public Health Service arrived on October 31, 2012 and stayed through the end of November, 2012. Preparing to accommodate these nursing home residents and hospital patients involved an emergency staff effort to retrofit two hospital floors that were being used for hospital storage. On October 10, 2013, Brookdale was awarded $2.3 million for unreimbursed operating costs to house and care for nursing home residents as well as other patients in its main building in Brooklyn, and for the expenses incurred to renovate and retrofit two floors in the hospital to make them patient-ready.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to one hundred small, yellowish green flowers arranged along the flowering stem.  Description  Microtis media are deciduous, chlorophyllous, sympodial, tuberoid terrestrial orchids with a single, tubular leaf long that encloses the lower one-third to half of the flowering stem. The flowers are green, wide, arranged around an erect flowering stem high. The dorsal sepal forms a hood over the column and the petals face forwards. The lateral sepals are curled. The labellum is thick and has a more or less rough, irregular margin and a raised callus. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 from a specimen collected at King George Sound in 1801. The description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (media) is a Latin word meaning \\"medium\\", referring to the intermediate floral structure. The plant was featured in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1825, where it was given the common name middle-sized microtis. According to Allan Cunningham it appeared from a sod of earth containing a Cephalotus, collected by Phillip Parker King from same location, and flowered to provide the source of the illustration by Franz Bauer. The description was \\"Whole plant, in general aspect, very much resembling the M. parviflora represented in our last plate, but more than twice the size. The flowers too are extremely similar, and the chief difference is to be found in the lip, which is here larger in proportion to the rest of the flower, and it is singularly wedge-shaped, truncated, and obtuse, even retuse at the extremity :‚Äìthe disk being moreover furnished with two oblong, warty callosities, and the margin of the lower half and apex, with several globose, tuberculated processes\\".Cunningham, Allan; Bauer, Franz; et al. Curtis's botanical magazine, 62 Plate 3378 =Subspecies= In 1990, Robert John Bates described two subspecies of M. media and the names have been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: * Microtis media R.Br. subsp. media has a labellum with a rough, irregular edge and a prominent callus; * Microtis media subsp. densiflora (Benth.) R.J.Bates has a labellum which is almost smooth and a reduced labellum callus. (Microtis media subsp. eremicola and M. media subsp. quadrata have been elevated to species status as Microtis eremicola and Microtis quadrata respectively.) Distribution and habitat The common mignonette orchid grow in shrubland, woodland and forest, often in seasonally wet areas and on granite outcrops. It occurs in the southwest of Western Australia between Shark Bay and Eyre. Conservation status This orchid is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

In 1951 it was converted into an industrial company whose sole shareholder was the Federal Republic of Germany through the Federal Ministry of Finance. In 1986 the company was converted to a public company and partially privatized. In 1993 IVG was full privatized though a stock market offering. In 1996, IVG was renamed IVG Holding AG and from 1997 focused on office and commercial property development and ownership.

Wall House, also known as Snowflake is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed home in Plymouth Township, Michigan. It is one of Wright's more elaborate Usonian homes. In 1941, recently married Mr. and Mrs. Carlton David Wall, who were Wright's youngest clients, approached Wright to design a house for them after Carlton Wall studied Wright's architecture in college. Its form is a series of hexagons radiating from a central chimney or service core without any true right angles, with many different wings off it for a nursery, terrace, guest room and carport. The cypress and brick house came to be known as Snowflake because of the hexagonal patterns created by the diamond grid design. This was the first use of Wright's modular diamond structure in Michigan, a technique he used elsewhere when incorporating a house into a hillside. A massive brick retaining wall supports a dramatic terrace. Floor to ceiling windows, doors without mullions, and corner windows are used throughout the house. This brings the \\"outside in\\", which is the case in all Wright houses. From 1943-44, Milton Horn collaborated with Wright on a wood relief mural for the house. In 1947, a bedroom wing was added to accommodate the Walls' growing family. It is located to the west of the original house. Snowflake was purchased by Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza, in 1983, and it was used on a rotating basis by executives of his corporation. It was to be part of Mr. Monaghan's Frank Lloyd Wright Study Center. In the late 1980s it was sold to the current owners who use it as their personal residence. References * Storrer, William Allin.

Biography Savio enrolled in the Military Academy (Colegio Militar de la Naci√≥n) on 3 March 1909, and graduated as second lieutenant in 1910. He graduated as military engineer in 1931, and was promoted to colonel in 1936, brigadier-general in 1942 and full general in 1946.Biograf√≠as Argentinas Under Savio's auspices, the Higher Technical School (\\"Escuela Superior T√©cnica\\") was created in 1930, open to members of all armed services. Even though the coup d'√©tat of September 1930 ousted and prosecuted General Enrique Mosconi, a pioneer of the Argentine petroleum industry, Savio was given free rein to pursue his projects. In time, Savio came to be perceived as Mosconi's rightful successor as the prime force behind Argentina's industrial progress.La m√≠stica militar-industrial. El general Manuel Savio y el d√≠a de la Siderurgia nacional Savio authored law number 12.709 in 1941 (under President Roberto Ortiz creating the General Directorate of Military Works (\\"Direcci√≥n General de Fabricaciones Militares\\", or DGFM) and was made its general manager. In this role, Savio was a main force in the erection of the Zapla Ironworks (Altos Hornos Zapla) in Jujuy Province, next to rich iron ore deposits. From his post in DGFM, Savio also provided strong support for heavy chemical industry. The R√≠o Tercero, Jos√© de la Quintana, and Tucum√°n plants were created under his watch. Savio established links to mechanical industries, and he supported Argentina's drive towards mining self- sufficiency. Savio also drafted plans for production of natural and synthetic rubber, and bills for ensuring the protection of raw materials. The National Metallurgy Plan (law 12.987, year 1947, under President Juan Domingo Per√≥n), which became known as the \\"Savio plan\\". That plan created SOMISA (Sociedad Mixta Sider√∫rgica Argentina), a mixed-capital society for the production of steel; Savio was SOMISA's first president. Savio died in 1948, and many of his projects were halted. His main metallurgy plan was implemented long after his death by President Arturo Frondizi in 1958 with the establishment of the Punta Argerich plant (near Ramallo, Buenos Aires), which was later named after Savio. General Savio is honored in Argentina as a pioneer of industry. Many technical schools, industrial complexes and places are named after him.

It is characterised by an expressionist style, influenced by cubism and showing a preference for darker colours. The participating artists lived and worked in or near the artist's village Bergen in the province of Noord-Holland. Origin A considerable number of artists had already been living or working in Bergen before; thus the village had become known as an 'artist colony'. A majority of painters belonging to the group lived close to each other on the Buerweg, in the neighbourhood Bergen Binnen, which is situated in between Bergen and Bergen aan Zee. The founders of this movement were the French painter Henri Le Fauconnier and the Dutch painter Piet van Wijngaerdt. They gained many adherents among young painters who agitated against Impressionism, just like Fauvism did in France and Expressionism in Germany. The art theories of the group were largely written down in the magazine 'Het Signaal' (The Signal). The art historian F.M. Huebner was the first one to write about the Bergense School.F.M. Huebner, Die neue Malerei in Holland, Arnhem: Van Loghum Slaterus & Visser 1921. Characteristics The works of the Bergense School are characterised by figurative depiction with cubist influences, an expressionist touch and in dark colours. The artists had a preference for painting Still life and the Human figure. The movement was a first original expression of a Dutch movement later to be named Expressionism. Its name refers to the village where the painters established, as is assumed because of its special light. Representatives Among the most celebrated artists belonging to this avantgardist School were Charley Toorop and John R√§decker. In particular the Amsterdam art collector Piet BoendermakerSee: Piet Spijk, De Bergense School en Piet Boendermaker. Kunstverzamelaar in Amsterdam en Bergen, Zwolle: Waanders 1997. and C.W.N. Baard contributed to the fame of the Bergense School. Other members of the School are: Else Berg, Gerrit van Blaaderen, Arnout Colnot, Dirk Filarski, Leo Gestel, Jaap Weijand, Frans Huysmans, Harrie Kuyten, Kees Maks, Jaap Sax, Mommie Schwarz, Jan Sluyters, Wim Schumacher, Matthieu Wiegman and Piet Wiegman. Painters whose works are related to the Bergense School are Jelle Troelstra, Henri ten Holt, Bernard Essers, Henk ChabotSee: Jaap Bremer et al., De vriendschap : Henk Chabot en Charley Toorop, Rotterdam: Chabot Museum 1999. and Th√© Lau. Painters like Karel Colnot, Jaap Min and Henk van den Idsert belong to a later generation, but started their careers under the influence of the Bergense School. Museum Kranenburgh in Bergen (NH) and the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar own a considerable number of works by representatives of the Bergense School. Related movements Henri Le Fauconnier had already in 1912 become a member of the Amsterdam Moderne Kunstkring (Modern Art Circle), together with Fernand L√©ger and Piet Mondriaan. A few years after the formation of the Bergense School in Groningen another School was formed in 1917-1918, called De Ploeg. Jan Wiegers was its central figure. De Ploeg also worked in an expressionist style, but its use of colour was much more exuberant. The group was notably influenced by the German Expressionism of Ernst Kirchner and its social outlook was influenced by the upcoming socialism.

Dulles, 356 U.S. 129 (1958), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a dual US/Japanese citizen who had served in the Japanese military during World War II could not be held to have lost his US citizenship unless the United States could prove that he had acted voluntarily.. Mitsugi Nishikawa, born in California to Japanese parents, went to Japan to study, and he was conscripted into the Japanese military in early 1941. After the end of the war, Nishikawa was informed by US officials that he had lost his citizenship because he had served in a foreign army. His case was eventually reviewed by the Supreme Court, which decided that the burden of proof must be on the government to prove that Nishikawa's Japanese military service was undertaken voluntarily before he could be stripped of his citizenship.  Background  Mitsugi Nishikawa was born in Artesia, California in 1916, making him a US citizen by birth. Because his parents were Japanese citizens, he also had Japanese citizenship. He resided in the United States until August 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, when he went to Japan to study. On March 1, 1941, he was conscripted into the Japanese Army, nine months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and he served as a mechanic. Japanese law provided a maximum sentence of three years for evading conscription. After the war, he applied to the US consulate in Japan for a US passport. Instead he was deprived of his US citizenship under section 401(c) of the Nationality Act 1940, which reads: He petitioned a US district court for a declaration that he was still an American citizen because he had not enlisted voluntarily. He testified that in addition to the legal penalties for draft evasion, he was afraid of the violent reputation of the Japanese secret police and had been told that the US consulate would not have assisted him if he had sought help to avoid conscription. After Pearl Harbor, when he said to other Japanese soldiers that Japan could not win the war, he was regularly beaten every day for a month. The government called no evidence of its own. Nevertheless the district judge disbelieved him and confirmed his loss of citizenship. The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nishikawa appealed to the Supreme Court.  Decision  The Supreme Court overturned the decisions of the courts below, holding that the Government bears the burden of proving not only that a citizen has enlisted in a foreign state but also that his enlistment was voluntary. = Precedents and argument = The court followed the decision of Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133 in which it had held that \\"it is settled that no conduct results in expatriation unless the conduct is engaged in voluntarily,\\" a position not challenged by the State Department in argument. The court also followed Gonzales v. Landon, 350 U.S. 920, where the court had held that the burden of proof in cases of denaturalization under section 401(j) was on the Government \\"by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\\" The court extended this rule to cases under all subsections of section 401. In Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, the court had held that in a case concerning \\"the precious right of citizenship ... we believe the facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen.\\" The State Department argued that the normal burden of proving duress is on the party relying on it. Nishikawa argued that voluntariness was an intrinsic element of the conduct required by section 401. = Majority opinion = Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the court: The court then examined the evidence on the district court record and found that there was insufficient evidence for the district judge's finding against Nishikawa: \\"Nor can the district judge's disbelief of petitioner's story of his motives and fears fill the evidentiary gap in the Government's case. The Government's only affirmative evidence was that petitioner went to Japan at a time when he was subject to conscription.\\" The Court therefore remanded the case to the district court for issuance of a declaration that Nishikawa remained a US citizen. = Dissenting opinion = Justice Harlan (joined by Justice Clark) dissented, arguing that \\"To permit conscription without more to establish duress unjustifiably limits, if it does not largely nullify, the mandate of ¬ß 401(c),\\" since by 1940 conscription had become the main way of raising armies around the world. He also believed that the burden of proving duress should remain on Nishikawa: \\"One of the prime reasons for imposing the burden of proof on the party claiming involuntariness is that the evidence normally lies in his possession.\\" He therefore thought that the Supreme Court should defer to the district judge's findings on Nishikawa's credibility.

The rebellion originated in an attempt by the republicans to reverse the establishment in 1830 of the July Monarchy of , shortly after the death of the King's powerful supporter President of the Council on 16 May 1832. On 1 June 1832, , a popular former Army commander who became a member of the French parliament and was critical of the monarchy, died of cholera. The riots that followed his funeral sparked the rebellion. This was the last outbreak of violence linked with the July Revolution of 1830. The French author memorialized the rebellion in his novel , and it figures largely in the stage musical and films that are based on the book. Background In the 1830 July Revolution, the elected Chamber of Deputies had established a constitutional monarchy and replaced Charles X of the House of Bourbon with his more liberal cousin Louis-Philippe. This angered republicans who saw one king replaced by another, and by 1832 the sentiment that their revolution, for which many of them had died, had been stolen. However, over and above the easily-provoked 'fury' or 'rage' of the Parisian population (at the differences between their poverty and the differences in income and opportunities of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy), Bonapartists for their part lamented the loss of Napoleon's empire, and the Legitimists supported the deposed Bourbon dynasty, seeking to place the man they regarded as the true king in power: Charles's grandson and designated successor Henri, Count of Chambord. Causes and catalysts General Jean Lamarque was admired by republicans for his defeat of Legitimists in the Vend√©e in 1815 and his support of international republican movements. Leading up to the rebellion, there were significant economic problems, particularly acute in the period from 1827 to 1832. Harvest failures, food shortages, and increases in the cost of living created discontent throughout the classes. In the spring of 1832 Paris suffered a widespread outbreak of cholera, which ended with a death toll of 18,402 in the city and 100,000 across France. The poor neighbourhoods of Paris were devastated by the disease, arousing suspicion of the government poisoning wells. The epidemic soon claimed two well-known victims. Prime Minister Casimir Perier fell sick and died on 16 May, and the hero of the Napoleonic wars and reformer Jean Maximilien Lamarque died on 1 June. The conservative Perier was given a grand state funeral. The funeral of the popular Lamarque‚Äîdescribed by Hugo as \\"loved by the people because he accepted the chances the future offered, loved by the mob because he served the emperor well\\"‚Äîwas an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the opposition. The monarchy of Louis Philippe, which had become the government of the middle class, was now attacked from two opposite sides at once. Before these two deaths, there had been two significant rebellions. In France's second city, Lyon, a workers' uprising known as the Canut revolt, caused by economic hardships, had occurred in December 1831. Troops were sent in after members of the local National Guard defected to the rebels. In February 1832 in Paris supporters of the Bourbons‚Äîthe Legitimists, or Carlists as they were called by their adversaries‚Äîmade an attempt to carry off the royal family in what would become known as the \\"conspiracy of rue des Prouvaires\\". This was followed by an insurrection in the Bourbon heartland of the Vend√©e led by Caroline, Duchess of Berry, mother of Henri, Count of Chambord, the Legitimist claimant to the throne as 'Henri V'. The duchess was captured in late 1832 and imprisoned until 1833. After this, the Legitimists renounced war and fell back on the press as a weapon. Insurrections The republicans were led by secret societies formed of the most determined and ferocious members of their movement. These groups planned to provoke riots similar to those that had led to the 1830 July Revolution against the ministers of Charles X. The \\"Society of the Rights of Man\\" was one of the most instrumental. It was organized like an army, divided into sections of twenty members each (to evade the law that forbade the association of more than twenty persons), with a president and vice president for each section. The republican conspirators made their move at the public funeral of General Lamarque on 5 June. Groups of demonstrators took charge of the cortege and redirected it to the , where the Revolution had begun in 1789. Parisian workers and local youth were reinforced by Polish, Italian and German refugees, who had fled to Paris in the aftermath of crackdowns on republican and nationalist activities in their various homelands. They gathered around the catafalque on which the body rested. Speeches were made about Lamarque's support for Polish and Italian liberty, of which he had been a strong advocate in the months before his death. When a red flag bearing the words (\\"Liberty or Death\\") was raised, the crowd broke into disorder and shots were exchanged with government troops. The Marquis de Lafayette, who had given a speech in praise of Lamarque, called for calm, but the outbreak spread. The subsequent uprising put the roughly 3,000 insurgents in control of much of the eastern and central districts of Paris, between Chatelet, the Arsenal and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, for one night. Cries were heard that the rioters would sup at the Tuileries Palace that evening. However, the rebellion failed to spread further. During the night of 5‚Äì6 June the 20,000 part-time militia of the Paris National Guard were reinforced by about 40,000 regular army troops under the command of the Comte de Lobau. This force occupied the peripheral districts of the capital. The insurgents made their stronghold in the Faubourg Saint-Martin, in the historic city center. They built barricades in the narrow streets around rue Saint-Martin and rue Saint-Denis. On the morning of 6 June the last rebels were surrounded at the intersection of rues Saint-Martin and Saint-Merry. At this point Louis-Philippe decided to show himself in the streets to confirm that he was still in control of the capital. Returning to Paris from Saint-Cloud, he met his ministers and generals at the Tuileries and declared a state of siege, then rode through the area of the rising, to the applause of the troops. The final struggle came at the Clo√Ætre Saint-Merry, where fighting continued until the early evening of 6 June. Total casualties in the rising were about 800. The army and national guard lost 73 killed and 344 wounded; on the insurgent side there were 93 killed and 291 wounded. The forces of the insurrection were spent. Aftermath The government portrayed the rebels as an extremist minority. Louis-Philippe had shown more energy and personal courage than his Bourbon predecessor Charles X had during the July Revolution two years before. When the king appeared in public, his supporters greeted him with cheers. General S√©bastini, the Foreign Minister, who directed government forces, stated that local citizens caught up in events congratulated him: \\"they accepted us with cries of Vive le Roi [Long live the King] and Vive la libert√© [Long live Liberty], showing their joy at the success we had just obtained\\". Subsequent identification of rebels revealed that most (66%) were working-class, a high proportion being construction workers. Most others (34%) were shopkeepers or clerks. A large number of weapons were confiscated in raids, and there were fears that military law would be imposed. The government, which had come to power in a revolution, distanced itself from its own revolutionary past, famously removing from view Delacroix's painting Liberty Leading the People, which had been commissioned to commemorate the events of 1830. According to Albert Boime, \\"after the uprising at the funeral of Lamarque in June 1832, it was never again openly displayed for fear of setting a bad example\\". A young painter, Michel Geoffroy, was charged with starting the rebellion by waving the red flag. He was sentenced to death, but a series of legal appeals led to a prison sentence. The real flag-bearer was found a month later, and imprisoned for just a month due to his obvious mental instability. Seven of the 82 trials led to other death sentences, all commuted to terms of imprisonment. Republicans used the trials to build support for their cause. Several rebels delivered republican speeches at their trial, including Charles Jeanne, one of the working-class leaders, who proudly defended his actions. He was convicted and imprisoned, and became a republican martyr. A pamphlet published in 1836 compared the last stand of the republicans to the heroic resistance of the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae: > A republican is virtue, perseverance; is devotion personified...[he] is > Leonidas dying at Thermopylae, at the head of his 300 Spartans; he is also > the 72 heroes who defended during 48 hours the approaches of the Clo√Ætre > Saint-Merry from 60,000 men and who‚Ä¶ threw themselves onto bayonets to > obtain a glorious death. Louis-Philippe's regime was finally overthrown in the French Revolution of 1848, though the subsequent French Second Republic was short-lived. In the 1848 Revolution, Friedrich Engels published a retrospective in which he analyzed the tactical errors which led to the failure of the 1832 uprising, and drew lessons for the 1848 revolt. The main strategic deficit, he argued, was the failure to march immediately on the centre of power, the H√¥tel de Ville. Victor Hugo and Les Mis√©rables The death of √âponine during the June Rebellion, illustration from Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables On 5 June 1832, young Victor Hugo was writing a play in the Tuileries Gardens when he heard the sound of gunfire from the direction of Les Halles. The park-keeper had to unlock the gate of the deserted gardens to let Hugo out. Instead of hurrying home, he followed the sounds through the empty streets, unaware that half of Paris had already fallen to the insurgents. All about Les Halles were barricades. Hugo headed north up rue Montmartre, then turned right onto Passage du Saumon (currently called Passage Ben-A√Øad), at last turning before rue du Bout du Monde (currently called rue Saint-Sauveur). When he was halfway down the alley, the grilles at either end were slammed shut. Hugo was surrounded by barricades and found shelter between some columns in the street, where all the shops were shuttered. For a quarter of an hour, bullets flew both ways. In his novel Les Mis√©rables, published thirty years later in 1862, Hugo depicts the period leading up to this rebellion, and follows the lives and interactions of several characters over a twenty-year period. The novel begins in 1815, the year of Napoleon Bonaparte's final defeat and climaxes with the battles of the 1832 June Rebellion. An outspoken republican activist, Hugo unquestionably favored the revolutionaries, although in Les Miserables he wrote about Louis-Philippe in sympathetic terms, as well as criticising him. Les Mis√©rables gave the relatively little-known 1832 rebellion widespread renown. The novel is one of the few works of literature that discusses this June Rebellion and the events leading up to it, though many who have not read the book or seen any adaptation often wrongly assume that it takes place either during the more widely known French Revolution of the 1790s or the Revolutions of 1848.

The French squadron departed from Lorient in February 1809 in an attempt to reach and resupply the island colony of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, then under invasion from a British expeditionary force. The force arrived much too late to affect the outcome of the successful invasion and took shelter from a British squadron in the √éles des Saintes, where they were blockaded by part of the British invasion fleet, led by Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Two weeks after the French ships arrived, British troops invaded and captured the Saintes, constructing mortar batteries to bombard the French squadron. With his position unsustainable, Commodore Troude decided to break out. Attempting to escape under cover of darkness on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May. The French expedition's two frigates, both only partially armed, were detached during the action and took shelter in harbour at Guadeloupe. In June, heavily laden with trade goods, they attempted to escape to Europe, but were pursued by elements of the British blockade force. F√©licit√© was overrun after four days of manoeuvre, submitting to the more powerful British frigate HMS Latona without a fight. Furieuse was able to escape immediate pursuit, but was subsequently discovered on 3 July by the smaller British ship HMS Bonne Citoyenne. In a fierce engagement two days later, the small British ship was able to defeat and capture the French vessel, which was later commissioned into the Royal Navy. Background During the Napoleonic Wars, the French Navy suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the British Royal Navy, culminating in the destruction of much of their Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Unable to compete at sea, the French were increasingly confined to their principal naval bases, especially Brest on the Biscay coast and Toulon in the Mediterranean. With British squadrons patrolling the entrances to these ports, the French found it difficult not only to conduct regular overseas trade, but also to supply and reinforce their overseas colonies.Gardiner, p. 17 As a result, the colonies faced financial collapse and the constant threat of attack by British forces, especially in the Caribbean, where by 1809 their island colonies of Martinique and Guadeloupe were surrounded by British held islands and blockaded by a strong British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane.Clowes, p. 283 During the summer of 1808, messages arrived in France from Martinique, outlining the desperate situation of their supplies, morale and economy. It was determined that reinforcements and food supplies would be sent and the frigate Th√©tis was despatched in November 1808. Within days, Th√©tis had been captured at the Action of 10 November 1808, and subsequent operations had mixed success: the frigate Amphitrite reached Martinique, but a number of smaller ships were intercepted and defeated, both in Europe and the West Indies.Gardiner, p. 78 In desperation, a major operation was planned, intended to transport substantial supplies and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on Martinique. To this end, Commodore Amable- Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux, Polonais and Hautpoult, with the frigates F√©licit√© and Furieuse en fl√ªte as armed storeships, carrying the bulk of the supplies.James, p. 161 On 21 February 1809, a large French fleet under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez attempted to escape Brest and was chased by the blockade squadron and driven to shelter under the Ile d'Aix. Shortly afterwards, three French frigates attempted to break out of Lorient, but were challenged and destroyed at the Action of 24 February 1809. These operations were the preliminaries to the Battle of Basque Roads in April, but also provided the cover required for Troude's force to escape Lorient while the British were engaged elsewhere.James, p. 96 Travelling rapidly across the Atlantic, the French encountered no British warships but were able to seize a number of lone British merchant ships, from whom Troude learned that the invasion of Martinique was already underway.Woodman, p. 242 While Troude's expedition had been preparing at Lorient, Cochrane had been preparing his own operation to Martinique, following the interception of the same despatches warning of the island's low morale and preparedness in the summer of 1808. Amassing an expeditionary force of 44 ships and 10,000 men at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, Cochrane began the invasion on 30 January 1809 and his troops rapidly overran the French defences, despite stiff resistance in the central highlands. By 10 February, the only remaining point in French hands was Fort Desaix, which held out until the magazine was breached on 24 February, at which point Governor Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse surrendered unconditionally.James, p. 209 √éles des Saintes Guadeloupe and associated islands. The Saintes are in the southwest corner Troude was wary on his arrival in the Leeward Islands on 29 March, refusing to approach Martinique and instead anchoring near the √éles des Saintes until the situation in the islands could be established. Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe, he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane, who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique. Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes, joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee, HMS York, HMS Belleisle, HMS Captain, HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate closer inshore.Clowes, p. 435 Blockading the Saintes was a difficult task: the French had three channels through which they could escape, too many to be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane's disposal. In addition, Troude's force could not be attacked directly, the width of the channels making it impossible for the British ships to attack in full strength.James, p. 162 For two weeks the British and French squadrons watched one another, the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape. In an effort to break the deadlock, Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3,000 men under Major-General Frederick Maitland. With this force he launched a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April, the amphibious operation commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties. Parties of seamen went ashore in the wake of the soldiers, working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8-inch howitzers on Morne-Russell. These guns began firing during the afternoon and by 20:00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the western channel during the night. In their efforts to monitor the French, Cochrane's squadron had become divided, so that Neptune and Pompee were the only ships within reach of Troude's squadron when they passed through the channel. Neither ship was well placed to fight the larger French force and both were taken by surprise, only alerted to the French escape by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron shortly before 22:00. Pompee was closest to the French, and Captain William Charles Fahie managed to fire two broadsides into the rearmost ship, Hautpoult before Troude's squadron pulled away from her. Neptune, Pompee and the small brig HMS Recruit took up the chase, the fast Recruit annoying the French with persistent minor attacks, while Neptune came too close to Hautpoult and was fired on, losing one man killed and four wounded. The French escape, while necessitated by the British battery, was actually a feint: the frigates F√©licit√© and Furieuse had remained hidden off the Saintes during the night and at 09:00 on 15 April, with the main combat continuing to the west, slipped away into Basse-Terre on Guadeloupe, chased in vain by HMS Intrepid under Captain Warwick Lake. French batteries drove off the British pursuit and the frigates were anchored in harbour and their stores successfully unloaded.James, p. 165 Battle During the night of 14‚Äì15 April 1809, contact was maintained with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated in the rear of a ship to fire on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier, who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoult's manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents. At 20:00, Troude ordered Hautpoult to steer to the northwest while he took Courageux and Polonais southwest in an effort to divide the pursuit. Pompee and Recruit kept with Hautpoult, while Neptune, accompanied by the brig HMS Hawk continued to follow Troude's main force. During the night however Troude outdistanced Neptune, and on the morning of 16 April Cochrane ordered all available ships to converge on Hautpoult. The lone French ship of the line had finally forced the damaged Recruit to retire, but could see Pompee and Neptune to the southeast and the newly arrived frigates HMS Latona under Captain Hugh Pigot and HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts to the northeast, with the Spanish coast of Puerto Rico directly north.Clowes, p. 436 During the day the chase continued, Neptune falling behind but Pompee remaining in sight and the frigates gaining on Hautpoult. At 17:00, Puerto Rico appeared on the horizon, the French forced to follow the coastline westwards. During the night, the British pursuers were confused by the overcast sky, which helped Hautpoult to partially obscure herself among the lights from shore.James, p. 163 At 02:45 on 17 April, Castor closed within range of Hautpoult and opened fire, exchanging broadsides with the much larger French ship for 75 minutes and slowing her sufficiently for Pompee to come within range. Sailing between Castor and the French ship, Fahie closed within and opened fire with his broadside. Within 15 minutes Hautpoult attempted to escape by pulling forward and engaging with Castor again, but the damage done to her sails and rigging hindered the manoeuvre and Pompee pulled across her stern, threatening to rake her. With defeat inevitable, the French captain surrendered, Neptune, York, Captain, Hazard, Hawk, Recruit, Polyphemus, HMS Ethalion and HMS Ringdove all coming within sight as dawn broke, joining Pompee, Castor and Latona.James, p. 164 =Aftermath= Hautpoult had fought hard during the engagement and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee and the newly captured French ship back to port, promoting Napier to command the ship of the line for his service on Recruit and despatching York and Captain to hunt for Troude's remaining squadron.Woodman, p. 243 Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. F√©licit√© and Furieuse During May 1809, the frigates F√©licit√© and Furieuse remained at Guadeloupe, taking on stores and preparing for their eventual return journey to France. Although they were both large frigates, they had been largely disarmed in France to create space for cargo: Furieuse was provided with only 20 cannon (including 12 carronades) and a crew of just 200, while F√©licit√© had even fewer defences, carrying just 14 cannon and 174 men. Watching these ships was a small British blockade force led by Hugh Pigot in Latona with a few brigs and sloops, Cochrane's invasion fleet having been dispersed. =F√©licit√©= On 14 June under the cover of darkness, the French frigates set sail, laden with colonial merchandise for sale in France. They were immediately spotted leaving Basse-Terre by the blockade squadron, but although the brig HMS Haughty managed to fire a few shots before they pulled away, only Latona and under Captain Thomas Tudor Tucker were able to maintain contact. Throughout 15, 16 and most of 17 June the chase continued, until the frigates separated: Furieuse led Cherub away from Latona and then outdistanced her, disappearing into the Atlantic. F√©licit√© was unable to escape Latona however, and on 18 June was overrun. Outgunned by his larger opponent, F√©licit√©'s captain surrendered immediately. An old and worn ship, she was not deemed worthy of purchase into the Royal Navy and was instead sold to Haiti, reappearing in 1812 as the Am√©thyste under the control of a privateer commissioned by Haitian rebels. Captain Yeo quickly attacked and captured her during the Action of 3 February 1812.Gardiner, p. 80 =Furieuse= Although Furieuse had escaped Cherub's pursuit, she still had to cross the Atlantic. Passing up the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, her commander, Lieutenant Gabriel-Etienne-Louis Le Marant Kerdaniel, raided British merchant shipping and was consequently delayed. At 15:00 on 5 July, the 20-gun sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain William Mounsey, on passage from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Quebec, spotted Furieuse to the southwest taking possession of a British merchant ship. As Bonne Citoyenne approached, Kerdaniel abandoned the merchant ship and sailed northwards, Mounsey giving chase but trailing behind throughout the day.James, p. 166 As darkness fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in the hope of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened.Clowes, p. 437 At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.James, p. 167 Due to her small size and high speed, Bonne Citoyenne suffered minimal casualties of one man killed and five wounded, although the ship itself was badly damaged. French losses were far more severe, with 35 killed, 37 seriously wounded including her captain, and 20 lightly wounded. Furieuse, built as a 40-gun frigate, had proven unable to match the speed an agility of the smaller ship and as a result her reduced armament had proven inadequate when faced with Mounsey's determined opposition. It was not until 01:30 on 7 July that temporary repairs were complete and the two ships began the long, slow journey to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The following day however, two of the Furieuse's masts collapsed and Mounsey was forced to take her in tow, both ships in constant danger of foundering.James, p. 168 After 25 days in tow, Furieuse arrived in Halifax. Mounsey and his officers were widely praised for their success and Mounsey was given command of the repaired and newly purchased HMS Furieuse several months later as a reward. His first lieutenant was also promoted and the whole crew benefitted from the award of prize money. As with the April engagement, the capture of Furieuse was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal. Subsequent operations The failure of Troude's squadron to escape the British pursuit highlights the dominance of the Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies.Gardiner, p. 79 Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had no alternative but to wait for the inevitable British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.

He moved to Paris, France in 1980 to begin a career in painting that has resulted in numerous exhibitions and increasing recognition in European, American and Russian art circles. Early life Zaborov was born in 1935 in Minsk to Abram Zaborov and Esfir Rappoport and, with his family, experienced the German invasion and occupation of Minsk in World War II. When his family returned to Minsk after the war, they found the city in ruins. In 1950 he enrolled in the Minsk Fine Arts School, leaving in 1953 for Leningrad and the entrance exams at the Academy of Fine Arts. Although he failed the exam, he was accepted the following year as a first year student. He describes his time at the Academy as a wonderfully self-contained existence, relatively isolated from the Soviet system. At the end of his second year, he participated in the obligatory painting summer in the Crimea, a summer that had little effect on his painting style but was a turning point in his personal life. Zaborov met a girl from Moscow and that autumn he entered the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow. He earned its diploma in 1961. The atmosphere in Moscow was radically different, much more engaged with the outside world. When he left, he moved back to Minsk and began to illustrate books to earn money. He found it increasingly difficult to paint according to a personal vision that fell outside of the Soviet government's approved style. =Paris= He resolved the dilemma by moving to Paris in May 1981. While free to paint what he wanted, he also found himself alone. He used this loneliness, combined with a folder of family photos brought from the Soviet Union, to create a unified artistic vision that continues to inform his work. In Paris he had his first solo art show. He has participated in numerous exhibitions in galleries and museums, in Paris and around the world.

Design and construction Thomas Birch The land where the house was located was originally owned by Robert Morris, but was seized and auctioned off in 1799. William Cramond, a wealthy merchant, purchased the house. Immediately upon acquiring the land, Cramond hired Latrobe to improve the property and build the mansion, which was to serve as Cramond's country house. The mansion was situated on a hill overlooking the river, 80 feet below. The two-story house, the first built in America in a Gothic Revival style, had a hip roof and dormers with steep roofs, and was approximately 75 ft in width and depth. Other Gothic elements included scalloped bargeboards on the eaves, and windows with label mouldings and other Gothic characteristics. The interior plan of the house was similar to the one that Latrobe used in John Harvie's home in Richmond, Virginia, and later, the John Markoe House in Philadelphia and the Pope Villa in Kentucky. The front of the house featured a portico, and a two-story entrance hall. Latrobe's design called for ashlar stone exterior walls, stone or brick window trim, and wooden construction for the piazza. Cramond did not retain Latrobe to provide on-site supervision of construction and did not entirely follow Latrobe's plan. Ownership Cramond owned the mansion for a short period, as he was forced to sell it in 1806 due to bankruptcy. Another merchant, Samuel Mifflin, bought the Sedgeley mansion, but he then sold the house in 1812 to James Cowles Fisher, a shipping merchant, who used it as a summer residence. For some period of time, Fisher left the house vacant or leased it to a tenant. Fisher sold it in 1836 to Isaac S. Loyd, a real estate speculator, who decided to subdivide the house and did not take good care of it, letting it fall into disrepair. The city of Philadelphia purchased the adjacent Lemon Hill property in 1844, which was turned into a public park. By setting aside open space along the river, Philadelphia hoped to better protect the city's water supply. A group of wealthy residents sought to expand the park to include the Sedgeley property, and they organized a fund to help achieve that. Though, the fund was short of the $70,000 needed, so through use of eminent domain, the city of Philadelphia paid the $45,000 balance and acquired the Sedgeley property in 1857. The house was demolished a short time later, and the land is now part of Fairmount Park. Porter House The Sedgeley property also included a servant's cottage (the Porter's House), designed by Latrobe, which still exists. Though Latrobe spent nearly a decade in Philadelphia, designing numerous buildings, the Sedgeley cottage is the only building of his that remains in Philadelphia.

Sabroe was born near Silkeborg, but moved to Copenhagen as a 14-year-old to take up an apprenticeship as a shoemaker. He soon became a social democrat and a member of a group of radicals called the Karl Marx Club. In 1887, he became a journalist at a provincial newspaper, in Randers, moving the next year to the paper Demokraten in the larger town Aarhus, where he eventually served as editor, from 1895 to 1908. Moving then to Kolding, he became editor of the Kolding Socialdemokrat from 1908 to 1910. He spent the rest of his life in Copenhagen, where he worked at the Social-Demokraten from 1910 to 1913. Sabroe first took an elected office in 1900, as a member of the Aarhus town council, a position he held until 1909. He also served in the Folketinget, from 1901 to 1913. As a politician, Sabroe took the part of the common man, and was perhaps the best known and most controversial left-wing legislator of his time. He often traveled around Denmark, drawing attention to the conditions in which children lived and worked. Sabroe died in the Bramminge train accident in 1913. After his death, a fund was raised in his honor, and used to maintain a children's home. Every year, a prize is awarded in his honor (the Peter Sabroe prize) to persons or institutions who have made an important contribution to improving the lives of children in Denmark.

As the eldest daughter of the deceased Despot of Serbia Lazar Brankoviƒá, the 12-year- old Helena was given in marriage to the Bosnian prince Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá in 1459. She then took the name Maria, while her husband obtained the title to Serbia through her. The country was lost to the Ottomans within a few months, and the couple fled to Bosnia. Maria's husband ascended the Bosnian throne in 1461, but two years later the kingdom too fell to the Ottomans and he was executed. The widowed queen avoided capture by fleeing to the coast. Having spent a few years in Venetian Dalmatia and possibly Hungary, Maria settled in Ottoman Greece at the court of her aunts Mara and Kantakouzene. Her string of conflicts and legal disputes with Kantakouzene, the Republic of Ragusa and Athonite monasteries earned her an ill reputation, with the monks describing her as an \\"evil woman\\".  Youth  The decline of the Serbian Despotate in the late 1450s Maria was the eldest of three children born to Lazar Brankoviƒá, son of the Despot of Serbia ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, and his wife, Helena Palaiologina. Born probably in 1447, she was christened Helena. Two sisters followed her: Milica and Irene. Lazar succeeded his father as despot on 24 December 1456, but his reign was cut short by his death on 28 January 1458. Despoina Helena and Lazar's brother Stefan seized power and began negotiating a marriage between her eldest daughter and Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá, the elder surviving son of King Thomas of Bosnia. The intent was to consolidate an alliance against the threat of the expanding Ottoman Empire, which had already reduced the Despotate of Serbia to a strip of land governed from the Smederevo Fortress. Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá arrived to Smederevo during the Holy Week of 1459, taking over the fortress and the government on 21 March. The marriage was celebrated on 1 April, the first Sunday following Easter. The bride soon afterwards joined the Catholic Church and adopted the name Maria.  Marriage  Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá's reign in Serbia was short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror regarded the arrangement as an offense to his rights as overlord of Serbia. On 20 June 1459, Ottoman forces captured Smederevo without a struggle and proceeded to annex the remnants of the Serbian state to their realm. Stephen and Maria fled to Bosnia, seeking refuge at the court of his father in Jajce. Maria carried with her the relics of Saint Luke the Evangelist, her precious family heirloom. Upon the death of King Thomas in the summer of 1461, Maria's husband ascended as King of Bosnia. Maria became the new queen consort, with her stepmother-in-law Catherine possibly retiring from the court as queen dowager. Maria's queenship did not last long either; in 1462, her husband made a fatal decision of refusing to pay tribute to the Ottomans, who started preparing an attack which ended the independent Kingdom of Bosnia. Following the Ottoman invasion in May 1463, the royal family appears to have decided to split and flee towards the neighbouring Croatia and Dalmatia in different directions to confuse and mislead the attackers. King Stephen, who had sent Maria to Dalmatia along with Saint Luke's relics, was captured and executed. The two queens, Maria and Catherine, were the only members of the royal family to escape the invaders and both eventually reached the territories of the Republic of Ragusa. The 16th century chronicler Mavro Orbini wrote that Queen Maria was captured by the Ban of Croatia, Pavao ≈†piranƒçiƒá, during her journey to the coast, but this is unlikely because Pavao himself was in Turkish captivity around that time.  Years of wandering  Maria, in her haste to avoid falling into Ottoman hands, mislaid the relics of Saint Luke. Bosnian Franciscan friars retrieved them and headed towards Ragusa, but were intercepted in Poljice by Ivani≈° Vlatkoviƒá, a local nobleman and friend of the Queen, who refused to let them pass without her permission. This angered Ragusa, which demanded that Ivani≈° surrender the relics to them. On 9 July, the republic's authorities issued a decree allowing the Queen to take refuge on one of their islands. The decree also made reference to an important issue the Ragusans wanted to discuss with her, most likely the sale of the relics. The Republic of Venice also expressed interest in Maria's heirloom, but she was gravely offended in August when Venetian authorities miserly tried to question the authenticity of the relics. The Venetians eventually succeeded in concluding a sale through her deputy, Ivani≈° Vlatkoviƒá. She regretted the transaction after the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus offered her three or four towns in exchange for the relics, but her attempt to have Ivani≈° retrieve them in late August failed. Both Ivani≈° and Maria were rewarded by Venice, with the Queen being allowed to settle in the Benedictine Monastery of St. Stephen under the Pines near Spalato. While residing in the monastery, Queen Maria received visits from Bosnians and Hungarians that made the Venetian authorities grow suspicious. They soon instructed the government of Spalato to recommend moving her to Sebenico or to an island on the grounds of poor living conditions in the monastery, with the intention of permanently removing her from their territory. Unlike her stepmother-in-law (and even the Hungarian king), the 16-year-old Queen Maria refrained from claiming the patrimony of Bosnian kings during her exile in Dalmatia and Ragusa. Possibly having spent some time in Hungary after leaving Dalmatia, Queen Maria settled in Ottoman Greece. She probably joined her paternal aunts, Mara (Mehmed's esteemed and influential stepmother) and Kantakouzene, on their estate near Serres. A conflict which erupted in 1476 between Maria and Kantakouzene led to the latter's brief imprisonment after the Queen complained to Mehmed. The strife may have caused the Queen to move to Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, where she enjoyed protection of Mehmed and his successor, Bayezid II. She spent years \\"slandering and intriguing against her closest relatives\\", as well as suing everyone from whom she could profit.  Lawsuits and frauds  In October 1484, Queen Maria approached the Sublime Porte to ask for the Sultan's help in reclaiming a third of her paternal grandfather's deposit in Ragusa, which she insisted had not been returned to her father. Bayezid wrote to Ragusa and sent an envoy to bring the gold, but the Ragusans responded with a letter proving that the deposit had been returned to Lazar. Maria, however, disputed the authenticity of her father's seal, and Bayezid sided with her. It is not known whether the Ragusans obeyed Bayezid's command to send the gold to the Queen, but there is plenty of evidence against her allegations in the letters of her father and uncle. Upon the deaths of her aunts Mara and Kantakouzene in 1487 and 1490 respectively, Maria inherited their possessions in accordance with the Sharia law. She immediately launched a claim to icons left by Mara to the monastery of Great Lavra on Mount Athos. Since her sex precluded her from accessing the holy mountain, it took Bayezid's intervention in 1492 for her to receive the icons. Shortly afterwards she called to Sharia court the monks of Xeropotamou Monastery, alleging that one of them stole money from her aunt Kantakouzene while in her service, but could not prove this. In 1495, Maria became involved in another legal dispute with Ragusa, this time concerning the tribute of Ston. The tribute had been paid by Ragusa to Serbian rulers since the reign of Stefan Du≈°an, but the income was ceded to the Monastery of Saint Archangels Michael and Gabriel in Jerusalem. Mara reclaimed the income after the monastery was closed, and after her death it was managed by Kantakouzene. Maria decided to claim it as her aunts' legal heir, but the Athonite monasteries of Chilandar and Saint Paul's cited her aunts' non-formalized bequest. Queen Maria, described straightforwardly by the monks as an \\"evil woman\\", died 1500, when Chilandar and Saint Paul's were recorded as having secured the income. She is believed to have died in √áorlu and to have been buried in a local church along with her maternal uncle, Manuel Palaiologos. It is not clear why Maria enjoyed such strong support of the sultans in her various conflicts and plain frauds. An explanation might be offered by the narrative of her relative Theodore Spandounes, who lived for some time with her aunts and whose family maintained close relations with the Brankoviƒá dynasty. He wrote that Queen Maria married a sipahi with whom she had no children, but went so far as to claim that she was captured by the Turks in Bosnia and forced into the marriage, which is evidently untrue.

It was named for Gesneria-like flower. The genus Gesneria is named in honor of 15th-century Swiss botanist Conrad Gessner. The long tubular flowers of this salvia resemble Gesneria flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant. Description In its native habitat, Salvia gesneriflora is reported to grow up to 25 ft high, though in cultivation it only reaches 5‚Äì6 ft high and 3‚Äì4 ft wide due to pruning from wind breakage and by gardeners. Hard annual pruning prevents the plant from breakage. The plant has many woody stems very heavy with foliage that break easily in wind and rain. The heart-shaped leaves are mid-green, very aromatic, and graduated in size. The large flowers grow up to 1.5 in long, and are a vivid orange-red, held in a 1.5 in yellow-green calyx tinged with purple glands. They grow abundantly in tightly spaced whorls on 8‚Äì12 in long inflorescences. It blooms in late winter and early spring, with hard annual pruning (down to leaf nodes near the ground) recommended after blooming. The plant will grow back to 6 ft in one season. Varieties In a 1970 collecting trip to Mexico by Huntington Botanical Gardens, two distinct varieties were collected‚Äîone with the more common green calyx, and one with a purple calyx and stem which was given the cultivar name 'Tequila' .

The protein is thought to be a P-type ATPase involved in calcium ion transport. Resistance to artemisinin antimalarials It was suggested in 2003 that PfATP6 is a target of artemisinin antimalarials, and also that a single amino acid mutation in the enzyme can mediate resistance to this important group of compounds. The main evidence came from a Xenopus oocyte system describing specific interactions between artemisinins and PfATP6 as well as E255L-mutated mammalian SERCA. However an independent reappraisal in the same system showed that while PfATP6 protein could be detected, it was inactive. In the independent oocyte work, mammalian SERCA and its E255L-mutated version were active but both were insensitive to artemisinin, again in contrast to the original claims. The authors suggested that the original results might have been affected by low ATPase signals, few experimental repeats and large standard deviations. The lack of artemisinin inhibition of E255L mammalian SERCA matched results from heterologous expression in mammalian and yeast cells. PfATP6 mutations clearly play no role in the reduced artemisinin susceptibility observed in southeast Asia. The consensus is that PfATP6 is not directly involved in artemisinin action or resistance.

Eventually, the organization played a role in the midterm elections of 2010. Later, it became the grassroots arm of Obama for America. After Obama's second inauguration, it was reorganized as Organizing for Action and returned to its previous mission of organizing around the President's agenda. It has since turned into a hub of the Democratic protest movement. History The formation of Organizing for America was announced by then-President-Elect Obama on January 17, 2009. The group officially began operations on the third day of the Obama administration, January 23, 2009. On the same day, it was announced that Mitch Stewart would serve as the first Director. Jeremy Bird, a former Obama for America field operative, was named Deputy Director. In mid January 2013 the organization was transformed into a nonprofit group Organizing for Action. The president's 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, was announced as the group's national chairman, and White House official Jon Carson will leave the administration and become the executive director. Campaign senior adviser David Axelrod will serve as a consultant. The organization will accept donations from individuals and corporations but not from lobbyists and political action committees. Offices will be in Washington and Chicago. Mission The organization's activities originally centered around political activism in favor of Obama's early legislative goals including the 2009 stimulus package and Democratic Party plans to reform the healthcare system. Another stated goal of OFA was alleviating perceived political apathy and increasing support for the Democratic Party. In preparation for President Obama's second term, Organization for America was turned into a nonprofit group ‚Äî funded in part by corporate money ‚Äî to mobilize support behind the president's agenda. As a tax exempt organization it will seek to harness the energy of the president's re-election campaign for future legislative fights. The group will be separate from the Democratic National Committee and advocate on key policy issues such as gun control and immigration, train future leaders and devote attention to local issues throughout the United States. Organization Organizing for America is composed of 50 different state organizations, united by a single national umbrella. The states have a high level of autonomy when it comes to deciding how to execute tasks given by the national office, but most major programs are ultimately delegated by the National directors. Under the federal tax code 501(c)(4) the group will have tax-exempt status as long as it is not primarily involved in activity that could influence an election. As a nonprofit, it can run support ads for an issue as long it is not involved in activity aimed at electing candidates for office. Political activism Organizing for America has provided logistical support to local community groups, including holding conference calls with volunteers, sponsoring events and house parties, using social networking and New Media, and providing talking points. Major campaigns=Health care reform= On October 20, 2009, OFA hosted a national phone bank event intended to encourage elected federal officials to support Obama's healthcare proposals. A stated goal of achieving 100,000 phone calls was exceeded, with 300,000 calls ultimately made. The event was considered highly successful. On February 11, 2010, OFA launched a national campaign called \\"You Fight, We Fight\\". This program enabled people to pledge a number of hours in support of healthcare reform and President Barack Obama's domestic goals. Nevertheless, OFA members were never called upon to do volunteer work in support of including a public option in the bill, despite Obama's stated preference for such a provision. After the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which completed one piece of Obama's domestic agenda, Organizing for America enabled Americans to \\"co-sign with the president,\\" creating a permanent record of the bills supporters. Those who co-signed could opt to have a certificate noting their participation sent to them for free. Over one million signatures of health care bill supporters were delivered to the president in April 2010.http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/deliverypledge?source=feature =Other issues= Except for some work on health care reform, the Obama administration has not made extensive use of OFA. This choice has been criticized by some veterans of the 2008 campaign, who believe that Obama has erred by being too ready to compromise with conservatives instead of mobilizing the OFA volunteer base. The shift to a tax-exempt politically active organization in January, 2013, may foreshadow a change in policy, especially since Jim Messina became the head of OFA later that month.

Ranulf of Chester sought the aid of the Empress's forces when he and his brother broke their agreement with King Stephen, and were joined by Madog ap Maredudd, Lord of Powys in Mid Wales, and Cadwaldr, the brother of Owain Gwynedd, ruler of Gwynedd in North Wales. A contingent from Shrewsbury and the county of Shropshire has gone to fight for King Stephen at Lincoln.  Plot summary  In February 1141 Hugh Beringar, Deputy Sheriff of Shropshire, returns with the survivors of the Battle of Lincoln, bringing news of a disastrous defeat. King Stephen has been captured, and the future of England is uncertain. Sheriff Gilbert Prestcote has been taken prisoner by Welshmen allied to Empress Maud. Two days later, Sister Magdalen, from the nearby convent at Godric's Ford, reports a raid by Welshmen returning from Lincoln. They were driven off, leaving a young man as prisoner. He pretends not to understand English but Brother Cadfael, sent to treat his wounds, easily catches him out. The prisoner identifies himself as Elis ap Cynan, a cousin to Owain Gwynedd. Hugh Beringar dispatches Cadfael into Wales to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Elis for Gilbert Prestcote. At Tregeiriog in Gwynedd, the holding of Tudur ap Rhys and where Owain holds court, Cadfael meets Tudur's daughter Cristina, betrothed to Elis, and Eliud, Elis's foster-brother. He overhears them arguing, and concludes that Cristina is jealous of the close friendship between Elis and Eliud. Back in Shrewsbury Castle, Elis meets Prestcote's daughter Melicent, and they fall completely in love. Melicent believes that her father will never consent to their marriage. Einon ab Ithel, one of Owain's captains, brings Prestcote from Wales. Eliud accompanies them, as Einon's groom and as the hostage to remain in Shrewsbury while Elis returns to Wales. Prestcote is ill and wounded, and is taken to the infirmary at Shrewsbury Abbey. While almost everyone in the Abbey is at their midday meal, Elis tells Eliud of his love for Melicent and his plan to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Elis goes to Prestcote's room, only to be ejected from the ward by Brother Edmund, the Infirmarer. As Einon prepares to leave, Eliud asks Cadfael to go with him to recover Einon's cloak, which he left behind in Prestcote's room. They find Prestcote dead, smothered in his sleep. Einon will not ransom a live man with a dead one. Eliud, Elis and six others of Einon's party must remain as suspects. After Einon departs for Wales, Melicent accuses Elis of murdering her father, as only he was known to enter the room. As Elis protests his innocence, Cadfael recalls that an ornate gold pin which had fastened Einon's cloak was missing when Prestcote was found dead. Elis does not have it, so others must have entered the room. Elis and Eliud share a cell in the Castle under their parole of honour not to leave. After her father's funeral, Melicent departs for Godric's Ford with Sister Magdalen, sorting out her own feelings. Cadfael closely examines the body of Prestcote and recovers richly-dyed woollen threads and some gold thread, which came from the cloth used to smother him. No cloth within the Abbey matches them. Suspicion next falls on Anion ap Griffri, a lay servant recovering from a broken leg. Prestcote had ordered his half-brother to be hanged for his part in a fatal brawl, providing motive. Anion flees. Hugh Beringar takes half of his armed men to join forces with Owain Gwynedd to deal with raids by Ranulf of Chester in the northern part of the county. In his absence, men from Powys gather for another raid. Cadfael takes the news to Tregeiriog, where Owain Gwynedd and Hugh Beringar will meet. There, Cristina tells Cadfael that her father has freed her to marry whom she loves. Cadfael realises his earlier mistake. Cristina and Eliud are in love with each other, but Eliud never spoke of his love from loyalty to Elis. At the evening meal, Anion appears, as his father asks that this son be recognised as his heir. He is wearing the gold pin taken from Prestcote's room. Einon accuses him of theft but Anion explains that he thought the pin was Prestcote's and gave it to his father as galanas for the half-brother Prestcote hanged. Before dawn, Hugh Beringar arrives with news that the raiders from Powys are nearing Godric's Ford. In the bustle of getting fresh horses, Cadfael sees Einon's ornate saddlecloth and realises it was the murder weapon. He now knows who the murderer is, but tells no one. He asks Owain Gwynedd whether atonement for Prestcote's murder requires another death, pleading that atonement by penitence would be preferable. Owain agrees, holding that guilt is considered in degrees. At Shrewsbury castle, Elis overhears the news of the raid on Godric's Ford. Frantic for Melicent's safety, he breaks his parole and makes his way there on foot. Hugh Beringar's lieutenant, Alan Herbard, sets out to intercept the raiders. He takes Eliud with him, under sentence of death if Elis proves false. As the raiders arrive to attack the convent, Elis confronts them in Welsh, saying that they are shameful to attack innocent holy women. A Welshman looses an arrow at him, but Eliud throws himself in front of Elis and the arrow pins them together, wounding both of them. Beringar and Herbard arrive, and the raiders are routed and flee into Powys. Eliud confesses Prestcote's murder to Cadfael. Before he met Elis at the Abbey, Eliud went to Prestcote's chamber to recover Einon's cloak, with Einon's saddlecloth on his arm. Desperate to prevent Elis returning to marry Cristina, he smothered Prestcote with it, regretting it even as he acted. It was for naught, as he learned minutes later, when Elis confessed his love for Melicent. Eliud left the cloak behind and later asked Cadfael to accompany him to the room to ensure that the death was discovered. Melicent overhears the confession. Hugh Beringar charges Eliud for Prestcote's murder. Hugh sends the six Welshmen who are still at Shrewsbury to carry Elis back to Wales. Elis and Melicent conspire to substitute an unconscious Eliud for Elis, thus removing Eliud from Hugh's jurisdiction. Cadfael and Sister Magdalen look the other way. Beringar cannot press any charge against Elis. Elis will return to Wales when he is healed, and court Melicent in proper form. Eliud and Cristina are reunited in Wales, where justice lies with Owain Gwynedd. Cadfael observes to Hugh Beringar that even God, when He intends mercy, needs tools to His hand.

Background  Like all of the Cadfael Chronicles, the book describes events in England and Wales at the time of The Anarchy, the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud for the throne of England. The Battle of Lincoln was real and took place as described in the novel, including the defeat of Stephen's forces, the capture of Stephen, and the involvement of a Welsh force under Madog and Cadwaladr. Many other real historical figures who acted in the Anarchy are mentioned in the text; for example, Ranulf of Chester, Robert of Gloucester, and William of Ypres. During the time of the story, Empress Maud connected with Bishop Henry of Winchester, who invited her to Winchester Cathedral. The Archbishop of Canterbury visited Henry's captive brother King Stephen. King Stephen is unruffled even as his brother turned his coat away from him. But the Archbishop of Canterbury did not ultimately support Empress Maud's claim in this tumultuous year of 1141. Wales at the time was not a single principality, but was divided into several small ones. Powys, under Madog ap Maredydd, intervened in England's troubles on the side of the Empress. Powys at the time held Caus Castle, only a few miles from Shrewsbury, and used it as a base from which to launch livestock-thieving raids into English territory. Gwynedd under Owain Gwynedd remained aloof from England's quarrels, but Owain Gwynedd's wayward younger brother, Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, took some men from Gwynedd to the Battle of Lincoln alongside the Powys contingent. Both historically and in later books in the Brother Cadfael series, Owain several times exiled Cadwaladr only to be later reconciled with him. Owain Gwynedd appears prominently in the novel. He is portrayed as a more statesmanlike character than the other Welsh rulers, and makes common cause with Hugh Beringar to deter Maud's ambitious allies. He must manoeuvre carefully to repair the damage done by Cadwaladr, whose men capture Gilbert Prescote, the fictional Sheriff of Shrewsbury, but lose the fictional Elis ap Cynan in the misguided raid on Godric's Ford on the way home. Although the capital of Gwynedd was at Aber, Owain Gwynedd maintained a shifting court which accompanied him as he travelled throughout the Principality to face rebellion or external threats or to dispense justice. To address the attacks to his border with Ranulf of Chester, Owain Gwynedd set up court at Tregeiriog, close to the border needing protection. The manor (maenol) of his retainer Tudur ap Rhys was convenient. The story takes place in several locations in England and Wales. The Abbey and Castle are in Shrewsbury. The resting place for the wounded Sheriff Prestcote en route to home is Montford just a few miles northwest of the Castle. Joining with Owain Gwynedd at Rhydycroesau to quell the raids by their common enemy Ranulf of Chester, Beringar and his men travelled along his northern border, fighting or leaving guards at Oswestry, Whitchurch, Whittington, Ellesmere, the castle at Chirk, then returning to Tregeiriog. When Cadfael travelled alone on his second journey to Tregeiriog, he stayed the night at Oswestry Castle, then crossed Offa's Dike on his route. The Powys Welsh raiders of Godric's Ford on their second raid left a trail of damage in Pontesbury and neighbouring Minsterley to the southwest of Shrewsbury before again losing to the Shropshire defenders. The Welsh characters are named by patronymics e.g. Elis ap (= son of) Cynan, or Einon ab Ithel, where the patronymic begins with a vowel. Cadfael himself was born in Trefriw in Gwynedd. Though not used within the Abbey, his full Welsh name is Cadfael ap Meilyr ap Dafydd, and he claims he would be ashamed if he could not trace his ancestry back five generations. The only female whose name is mentioned is Cristina merch (= daughter of) Tudur.  Continuity  Philip Corviser, son of the town Provost and like him a boot maker, attends the funeral of the Sheriff with his wife Emma. Emma Vernold was a main character in Saint Peter's Fair, set in fall 1139, the fourth novel in the series. She was left on her own by the murder of her uncle, though not short of inheritance. At the end of the story, she became attached to Philip, now her husband. The events described of the changing fortunes of King Stephen, imprisoned, and Empress Maud, welcomed in London, hoping to be crowned, set the scene for the opening of the next novel in the series, The Pilgrim of Hate, and for parts of the plot.  Reviews and critical reception  Kirkus Reviews was unusually positive about this novel, after describing the complexities of the plot. As \\"Cadfael closes in on the murderer‚Äîand brings on a denoument that combines rough justice and love triumphant.\\" They concluded that the novel is \\"For anyone with a taste for period mystery: another fine Peters performance‚Äîcharmingly inventive, textured with intriguing subplots, and as rich as ever in fresh period details.\\" Publishers Weekly summarized the key plot points of the 12th-century novel, \\"a Welsh lord captured by the English is to be exchanged for Gilbert Prestcote, sheriff of Shropshire, who is held by the Welsh. When Prestcote dies in Welsh hands, Cadfael suspects murder and reveals the motives of the captors.\\" They commented that \\"Peters's local color is at its most engaging in the tangled family trees that sprawl across a contentious border.\\" Cecily Felber, an author herself, explained how this novel inspired her to write her own, in the same era and part of the world. She described that \\"This is the book, with its mentions of Madog ap Maredudd and the contingent of Welsh soldiers who took part in the Battle of Lincoln, that is partly responsible for my own books. ... Another charming step along the journey of Cadfael!\\" In a brief review, Nick B Williams, Sr in the Los Angeles Times found this a fascinating chronicle that will hold the reader's interest. \\"Since man, as a species, first dropped down from the trees to walk on his hind legs--erect, that is--he hasn't changed so much--he still kills for profit or--well, sport. That's evident enough in Dead Man's Ransom by Ellis Peters, a fascinating chronicle of 12th-Century England. In this, we meet again the canny Brother Cadfael, apostle of survival and a sensible degree of mercy, pre-dating Sherlock Holmes by generations. What better way than this to get some notion of our Anglo- Saxon origins, along with gore enough to keep us flipping zestfully ahead through all the carnage.\\".

Famous for their big singles, Quadrant pioneered many innovations that proved important for motorcycle development but struggled after the First World War and the company was wound up in 1928. History Founded by Walter and William Lloyd in 1883 as a company to make bicycles and tricycles, Quadrant developed some of the first motorcycles in 1901. The first Quadrant motorcycle was fitted with the then very popular Minerva \\"clip-on\\" engine. They also made powered tricycles in 1902. Walter took out a patent in 1902 for an 'all-in-one' control lever to raise the exhaust valve, control the ignition switch and operate the throttle and the ignition advance. By 1902 the Quadrant Cycle Co was making their own engines, their advertMotor Cycling, 12 November 1902 claiming \\"The engine and carburettor throughout, as also the bicycle, are made in our own Works\\". These were ahead of their time as the engines were not just fixed on to a bicycle frame. Instead, the frame was purpose-built to properly hold the engine, and the Quadrant motorcycles also pioneered a suction inlet valve, hand oil pump and direct drive, contact breaker ignition replacing trembler ignition in 1902, as well as a spray carburetor in 1904 and magneto ignition in 1907. A famous long-distance motorcycle rider called Tom Silver was contracted by the company and gained them a lot of publicity through his success on Quadrant motorcycles in long distance events and in 1907 he became the managing director. The arrangement was not a success, however, and the company collapsed from internal disputes in 1907, with Silver leaving to form Silver Motors. A new company, Quadrant Motor Co Ltd, was formed after Walter Lloyd bought Quadrant and Tom Silver returned in 1909 but once again Silver was not able to get on with the new owner and left to build motorcycles under his own name. In 1911 Quadrant produced several models, including a 1129 cc V-twin and a 600 cc single. Production was halted during the First World War as the factory switched to the manufacture of aeroplane engine parts.\\"The Post-War Quadrant\\", Motor Cycle magazine, 9 November 1916, p403 In an article in 1916 they outlined that they planned for their post-war models to benefit from the aeroplane engine experience with lighter cylinders and alloy pistons. Although engaged in war work they did some development on future models, and in 1916 showed a 3.5 hp \\"After the War\\" model (smaller than their normal machines with 85mm bore and 88mm stroke).\\"The Quadrant \\"\\"After the War\\"\\" Model\\", The Motor Cycle, 3 August 1916 This was fitted with a patented paraffin vaporiser to allow it to run on paraffin after starting on petrol (petrol being in short supply). After the war the 1916 small capacity model did not appear, but instead they produced a range of 654 cc and 780 cc single-cylinder motorcycles, for which they became well known. However at the Olympia Motor Cycle show of 1919 they showed a 292 cc two-stroke scooter with a step-through frame and the compact engine assembly sited under the seat.\\"Novelties in Scooter Design\\", The Motor Cycle, 27 November 1919 This did not feature in subsequent adverts, so was presumably a prototype. In 1921 a 565cc model was available following the same general design as its predecessors. It had a three-speed Sturmey-Archer countershaft gearbox with kick-start, rear chain (as opposed to belt), Druid forks, and Amac or Senspray carburettor. 1921 565cc Quadrant Combination There were further company changes and by December 1921 adverts for the Quadrant motorcycle listed the company name as March, Newark and Co Ltd, Quadrant Works, Birmingham.Motor Cycle magazine, 23 March 1922 In 1922 Quadrant's London agent Clifford Wilson entered the International Six Days trial on his 654cc Quadrant, he got a gold medal, and best in class.The Motor Cycle, 31 August 1922 Introduced in 1922 was a side valve 490cc single (bore 70mm, stroke 100mm), earlier models having a side exhaust, and rear inlet valve. In 1924 two models were offered, the 490 cc side-valve and a hefty 624 cc side- valve with bore and stroke of 85x110. The Quadrant range included outdated side-valve motorcycles, updated in 1927 with the launch of a 490 cc overhead- valve model, but it did not sell well and the company was wound up in 1928.

Through the Undersecretariat of the Interior and its superior body, the Directorate- General for Internal Policy, the Ministry is responsible for all actions related to ensuring political pluralism and the proper functioning of electoral processes. The MIR is headed by the Minister for Home Affairs, who is appointed by the Monarch at request of the Prime Minister. The Minister is assisted by three main officials, the Secretary of State for Security, the Secretary-General for Penitentiary Institutions and the Under-Secretary of the Interior. Among the director generals, the most important are the Director- General of the Police and the Director-General of the Civil Guard. This department has historically received numerous denominations such as Ministerio de la Gobernaci√≥n (literally Ministry of the Governance), Ministerio de Orden P√∫blico (Ministry of Public Order) and Ministerio del Interior y Justicia (Ministry of the Interior and Justice) when both ministries joint in one. Spain spends around $ 25.5 billion (‚Ç¨ 22 billion) per year on security and public order, which puts it at 2% of GDP.Europa gasta un 1,8% de su PIB en seguridad History= Early period = The Ministry of the Interior responsibilities during centuries were assumed by the Royal Council of Castile (with the exception of the judicial ones). This body was composed for expert royal servants in charge of advising the Sovereign and with the passage of the time this royal servants gain more power and autonomy and they were the real governors of the Kingdom. In the 18th century, the extinction of the Habsburg dynasty and the arrival of the Bourbons brought profound institutional reforms. With King Philip V, this Council extended its jurisdiction to the territories of the Crown of Aragon and the whole country was ruled by the same institutions. Also during this time, the Councils started to lose importance and the Secretariats of State and of the Dispatch were created. Since 1621 existed in Spain the Secretariat of the Universal Dispatch, a unique government department where the sovereign delegated its power. With the new dynasty, it was necessary to divide it into several Secretariats of State that took care of the diverse administrative subjects: by means of the Decree of 11 July 1705, Philip V created a ¬´Secretariat of State for War and Treasury¬ª and another one for ¬´Everything else¬ª. But the accumulation of business and the need for a more agile body led to a system similar to that of France: the Decree of 30 November 1714, established four Secretariats of the Dispatch: of State, of War, of the Navy and of the Indies, and of Ecclesiastical business, justice and jurisdiction -, and questions of a financial nature were made to lie in the General Treasury. With slight variations, the result of various reforms, this situation will continue until the 1754-1755 biennium. With regard to the Secretariat of the Dispatch of Ecclesiastical Affairs, Justice and Jurisdiction, by Decree of 2 April 1717, it was renamed the Secretariat of the Dispatch of Justice, Political Government and Treasury of Spain and the Indies. It was commissioned to Jos√© Rodrigo. In the reform of 1720, it was named Secretariat of the Dispatch of Justice and Political Government of Spain and the Indies. = Late period = However, the direct antecedent is at the beginning of the 19th century, first created by Bonaparte in 1808 in imitation of the French model and a few years later, in 1812, the Cortes of C√°diz created it the Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Governance of the Kingdom and Islands adjacent and the Secretary of the Dispatch of the Governance of the Kingdom for Overseas. The vast majority of authors do not consider the department created by the Napoleonic Government as the original one, because of its invasor nature. With the return of Ferdinand VII, both secretaries were suppressed in 1814, restored during the Liberal Triennium and created as Ministry of the Interior in 1823, which lasted only a short time after being suppressed by King Ferdinand. In 1832 the Ministry of Development was created, which assumed security competences, fleeing from the denominations of ¬´Interior¬ª and ¬´Governance¬ª since they were reminiscent of the time of the war against Napoleon. In 1835 it was again called ¬´Ministry of the Interior¬ª. In 1847, all matters related to the services of public, economic and cultural works were disbanded from the Ministry of the Interior. The Ministry of the Interior maintained the functions of public order, municipal and provincial organization ‚Äîbeing responsible for the Civil Governors‚Äî, health, post and telegraph, and the Overseas Office was incorporated. The so-called Sections were changed by Directorates-General, whose number was changing in the following decades. During the reign of Alfonso XIII (1902-1931) the then created Institute of Social Reforms (1903), the Superior Charity Board (1908), the Internal Health Service (1909) were made dependent on the Ministry of the Interior; the Directorate-General for Security was divided into two sections, Surveillance and Security, and then called Public Order (1921); the Legal Department expanded its functions beyond the branch of charity (1913); the General Department of Charity (1919), the Health Department (1921), the Supply Department (1925) and the National Broadcasting Service (1929) were created. Already during the Second Republic, by decree of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of 16 August 1932, raised to the rank of Law on 8 September, the Directorate-General of the Civil Guard, which had been attached to the Ministry of War, and all the agencies and services of it dependents were transferred to the Ministry of the Interior, creating the Inspectorate-General of the Civil Guard. In 1933, the Health and Welfare services were transferred to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare. In 1959 the Central Traffic Office was created by Law 47/1959, of 30 July; the Technical General Secretariat by Decree 1841/1960, of 21 September, in accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Legal System of the State Administration of 26 July 1957; and the Data Processing Center by Order of 16 November 1971. = Democracy = In 1977 it was renamed ¬´Ministry of the Interior¬ª and from then until now the Ministry has maintained this denomination, except for the period between 1994 and 1996, when it was renamed the Ministry of Justice and the Interior, structured in two main higher bodies, the Secretariat of State for Justice and the Secretariat of State for the Interior. During the democratic period, the Ministry of the Interior has focused its powers on public security, losing its functions on territorial organization in favor of the Ministry for Territorial Administrations.  Structure  The Ministry of the Interior is organised in the following bodies: * The Secretariat of State for Security.  The Directorate-General of the Police.  The Directorate-General of the Civil Guard.  The Directorate-General for International Relations and Immigration. * The General Secretariat for Penitentiary Institutions.

Its head office was located at Lower Belgrave Street, close to Victoria Station in London, and the company had branch offices in Edinburgh, Manchester, the West End, Paris and (much later) in Hong Kong. SIA offered terminal services via the Post Office telephone network at speeds of 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 characters per second for Teletype-style terminals and of 1200 baud, 2400 baud and 4800 baud for Remote Job Entry terminals. Later with the release of the IBM PC, systems were developed to emulate the Remote Batch and interactive terminals. Clients could also visit the head or branch offices to submit their jobs personally or have them accepted and supervised by the production department. In 1968 the company installed a Control Data Corporation CDC 6600 mainframe computer ‚Äì the first CDC 6600 installed in the United Kingdom. It was generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, outperforming its fastest predecessor, IBM 7030 Stretch, by about three times. It remained the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600. By 1974 SIA added more processing power by installing a Control Data Cyber-72 at Victoria. SIA had assembled a comprehensive library of proven software packages drawn from all over the world. They covered a range of disciplines: electronics, management science, integrated survey and statistical, integrated cluster analysis, segmentation analysis, simulation, financial planning, production planning and control systems, civil and structural engineering, finite element stress analysis, box girder bridge design, highway engineering, business systems, business data processing, database management and many others. Client support groups SIA's client support groups included: =Technical services= Supported clients writing and running their own programs, whether written in ALGOL, BASIC, COBOL, or Fortran. They provided training in all user aspects of the Kronos-75 service and on operating various types of terminal. =Commercial team= Supported the SIA sales accounting package and the database management system SYSTEM 2000. They also developed computer systems to meet various business applications to meet the individual needs of client organisations. Applications covered included invoicing, sales ledger, sales analysis, stock control, bill of material processing, library information retrieval and a wide range of database implementations characterised by the need to store quantities of data and to retrieve from it in a number of differing ways. =Management sciences team= Supported the statistics, linear programming, depot location and financial modelling packages offered. Production scheduling, warehouse siting, cash flow modelling and survey analysis are typical applications. =Engineering= Civil and structural support packages for bridge and building design and detailing, for soil mechanics and for other civil engineering applications. =Offshore engineering= Concentrated on the business of designing structures for use in offshore oil production. Waveloading, static and dynamic analyses, towing studies and stability problems were also covered. =Advanced structural analysis= Supported clients tackling problems with the help of finite element techniques and other analyses. Examples are drawn mostly from mechanical engineering ‚Äì from nuclear power stations through aircraft and satellites to diesel engines. =Chemical engineering= Assisted process designers to use a powerful flowsheet simulator program, arguably the best in the world. =Highway engineering and mapping= Supported and developed a range of programs for use in highway design and in ground modelling and mapping. Programs developed by this team have helped British and foreign consultants to win highway design contracts in the Middle East since the design timescale is dramatically shortened by their use. =Transportation= Developed and maintained the TFA suite of programs for transportation planning studies and provided consultancy services. =Systems= The operating systems running on the Control Data 6600, Cyber-72 and later Cyber-175 included SCOPE, Kronos and later NOS. The source code was heavily modified for the business needs of the company by a team of systems programmers. Many of the ground- breaking ideas developed at SIA were incorporated in Control Data's later systems. SIA was a member of J.U.N.K (Joint Users of NOS and Kronos), a user group formed to share ideas and experiences using Control Data's software.

The short residential street gained fame for its suggestive name and was frequented by tourists who would stop to take photos by its street sign. Residents living on the street experienced issues with their address, as they were refused services due to the name and were the target of pranks and jokes. After privately raising funds for a new street sign and seeking approval from the local government, residents had the name of the street changed in 2009.  Description and popularity  Butt Hole Road was a short residential street. It extended approximately south from the A630 Sheffield Road, and intersected with two other streets, Butterbusk and Ravens Walk, prior to terminating at a dead end. The street featured four homes on its east side, numbered 1, 3, 5, and 7. It gained international notoriety for its suggestive naming, as the term \\"butthole\\" is slang for \\"anus\\" in American English. In 2004, a Reuters article widely circulated on the internet about a family who moved out of their ¬£150,000 bungalow on the street because they were embarrassed by the street's name. Doncaster Council, the local governing body, has no record of where Butt Hole Road got its name but residents of the street believe that it was named after a communal water butt that was originally located in the area. One resident living on the street initially thought the address \\"would be fun\\", but claimed that the novelty quickly wore off. After a picture of the street sign appeared online, the street became so famous that tour buses would stop at the street for American tourists to visit. The street sign was constantly stolen over time and tourists would be seen taking pictures in front of the sign with their buttocks exposed. While it was a popular destination for tourists, businesses such as delivery and taxicab services would not serve residents living on Butt Hole Road, believing that the name was a prank. Those living on the street would also receive phone calls from pranksters making a joke about the street name, and many residents eventually had their phone numbers removed from public listings. The name of the street inspired authors Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey to create the book Rude Britain, a compilation of inappropriate place names in Great Britain, after reading an article about a couple who purchased a house on the street.  Name change  The street was renamed to \\"Archers Way\\" in honour of the nearby Conisbrough Castle Residents of Butt Hole Road were determined to have the name of the street changed to deter tourists from visiting the street and to put an end to the jokes made about the street's name. Planners allowed the change as all of the residents on the street were in favour of the new name. Because Doncaster Council would only replace a street sign for free if it was damaged or in a state of disrepair, the residents of Butt Hole Road had to raise ¬£300 for a new street sign. On 22 April 2009, the street was renamed to \\"Archers Way\\", in honour of the 930-year-old Conisbrough Castle, located half a mile (0.8 km) away. Shortly after the name change, an informal Facebook petition was created to change the road back to its original name. The renaming of the street gained worldwide attention and was featured in such international publications as The New Zealand Herald, Bild (Germany), and Het Laatste Nieuws (Belgium). In 2015, in reference to the name change of Butt Hole Road, residents of the similarly-named Butthole Lane in Shepshed, Leicestershire said they planned to keep the name of their street and were not bothered by the \\"puerile humour\\" that is affiliated with it, with one resident claiming that the street is \\"part of the tradition of Shepshed\\".

Career He began his career as a journalist working for French newspapers such as France Soir. Later, he became a TV program producer as well. Music career As a director of a record company, Delphine Records, he started a new career on the basis of his passion in life: music. After writing his first song in 1962, he contributed music for songs in many movie soundtracks produced by French companies such as Universe Galaxie and Daber Films. In 1968, while managing Michel Polnareff's career, he met Olivier Toussaint, with the two later forming a successful songwriting partnership. Their songs were recorded by major French artists such as: Mireille Mathieu, Mich√®le Torr, Christophe, Herv√© Vilard, Dalida, Petula Clark and Claude Fran√ßois. This partnership accounts for over 100 million records sold internationally. Partnering with lyricist Jean-Loup Dabadie, he wrote Tous les bateaux, tous les oiseaux, a French hit recorded by Michel Polnareff. Very soon, the pair got involved in Production. They started the group Pop Concerto Orchestra, on which Toussaint sang lead. Soon after, they launched their second group Anarchic System that produced Rock & roll. Over a period of 5 years, the two groups sold millions of records.

The song reached #1 on the charts of France, Switzerland, Belgium and then in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. It reached first place in South America and later in Japan. In 1978, Paul was represented by both France and Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 by his composition, Les jardins de Monaco as a duet. In 1976, he and Olivier were nominated for the prestigious award C√©sar Award for Best Original Music (C√©sar is the French equivalent of the Oscar) for their movie scores in the film \\"Un linceul n'a pas de poches\\". He was bestowed the title of Comte ‚Äî a title of French nobility. Delphine Records In the early 1970s, Paul and Olivier set up their own record label, Delphine Records named after Paul's first daughter, Delphine Deschodt. Delphine is a leading French music exporter and specialist in instrumental music. Besides Jean-Claude Borelly, they discovered French instrumentalists such as Richard Clayderman (1976), Nicolas de Angelis (1981) and Diego Modena (1991). De Senneville and Toussaint collaborated with famous French arrangers such as: G√©rard Salesses, Herv√© Roy, Bruno Ribera, and Marc Minier.

He collects modern paintings and antique objects. He owns a horse statue made by Salvador Dal√≠. He was the owner of racehorse L'Amiral Mauzun working with Jean-Philippe Ducher. The horse won the Elitloppet in 2007 among other races. Paul de Senneville can allegedly neither read, write, nor play music. He sings into a small tape recorder at home or in his studio. Then he calls a pianist (or an arranger) to help him make an arrangement, before recording it with a larger ensemble.

About 60 versions survive, with the earliest dating to the mid-13th century. Adaptations of Geoffrey's Historia were extremely popular throughout Western Europe during the Middle Ages, but the Brut proved especially influential in medieval Wales, where it was largely regarded as an accurate account of the early history of the Celtic Britons. Geoffrey's Historia and the Brut y Brenhinedd Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae (completed by ) purports to narrate the history of the Kings of Britain from its eponymous founder Brutus of Troy to Cadwaladr, the last in the line. Geoffrey professed to have based his history on \\"a certain very ancient book\\" written in britannicus sermo (the \\"British tongue\\", i.e. Common Brittonic, Welsh, Cornish or Breton) which he had received from Walter of Oxford.Geoffrey of Monmouth, Histora Regum Britanniae: dedication and 7.11. It became one of the most popular works in the medieval West, but its impact was particularly profound and enduring in Wales, where the Historia was accepted as a largely authentic and authoritative account.Roberts, \\"Brut y Brenhinedd\\". The influence is most clearly evidenced by the existence of several translations into Welsh from the 13th century onwards, usually known as Brut y Brenhinedd. The manuscript history of these texts is a rich and long one attesting to the production of several translations and new redactions, most of which were copied many times over. The Welsh renderings are not straightforward translations in the modern sense, but by contemporary standards, they are generally close to their Latin source text, with only some commentary or additional material from bardic traditional lore (cyfarwydd) appended to the text. Importantly, several manuscripts include a version of the tale known as Lludd and Llefelys inserted in the segment about Lludd Llaw Eraint; the presence or absence of this tale has been used to classify the early versions of the Brut.Bromwich, Triads. p. 416. One notable area in which Welsh translators have corrected or adapted Geoffrey based on native traditions is that of personal names and sobriquets. Geoffrey's \\"Hely\\", for instance, was substituted for Beli Mawr, an ancestor figure who also appears in Branwen ferch Ll≈∑r and elsewhere in Middle Welsh literature.Koch, \\"The Celtic Lands\\". p. 289. See further Roberts, \\"Treatment of personal names\\" and J. T. Koch, \\"A Welsh Window on the Iron Age\\". Versions There are about sixty attestations of the Welsh Brut in the manuscripts.Griscom (ed.), The Historia regum Britanni√¶ of Geoffrey of Monmouth. pp. 585-99; Evans, Grammar of Middle Welsh. xxxiv; Koch, \\"The Celtic Lands\\". p. 288. Brynley F. Roberts, citing J.J. Parry and his own examination of the texts, places all the existing versions into six variant classes: 1) Dingestow MS., 2) Peniarth 44, 3) Llanstephan 1, 4) Peniarth 21, 5) Cotton Cleopatra B. v, and 6) the Brut Tysilio.The following overview is based on Roberts, Brut y Brenhinedd xxiv-xxxix. Some years before Roberts, Evans noted the existence of at least three separate versions, Grammar of Middle Welsh. xxxiv. =13th century= *1. The Brut in NLW, Llanstephan MS 1 (mid-13th century), is a relatively close translation of Geoffrey's Historia. *2. The Brut in NLW, Peniarth MS 44 (mid-13th century). This text becomes increasingly more condensed towards the end, omitting Merlin's prophecy in the process on stated grounds that it lacks credibility. Yet it has the distinct quality of being the first Brut to incorporate the tale Lludd and Llefelys. *3. Brut Dingestow (later in the 13th century), now in MS Aberystwyth, NLW 5266, once appears to have been in MS 6 of the Dingestow court collection, and may have originated in Gwynedd. Again, the text is a relatively faithful translation, aided by its occasional reliance on Llanstephan MS 1. Of these three texts, it is Llanstephan MS 1 and Brut Dingestow which then came to provide the textual basis for many of the copies attested in other MSS from the 13th century onwards, such as Mostyn MS 117 and NLW Peniarth MS 16. =14th century= An illustration from Peniarth MS 23(f.18), Morgan and Cunedda * Red Book of Hergest redaction. A revised version, presumably from south Wales, was produced which follows the Dingestow version up to the end of Merlin's prophecy, and continues with the Llanstephan 1 version.Roberts, B. (1971) Brut y Brenhinedd (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies), p.xxviii Copied in numerous MSS, this conflated version is most famously represented by the text in the Llyfr Coch Hergest or Red Book of Hergest. In most every manuscript, it is preceded by the Ystorya Dared, i.e. a Welsh translation of the De Excidio Troiae ascribed to Dares Phrygius, and followed by the Brut y Tywysogion. In this way, the text is made the central piece in a world history extending from the Trojan War up to events close to the redactors' own time. It seems that the Ystorya Dared, which has no independent existence in the manuscripts, was specially composed to serve as its prologue. *4. The Brut in NLW Peniarth MS 23 and elsewhere, a fresh and fairly close translation of Geoffrey's Historia. *5. The Brut in BL Cotton Cleopatra B. v, NLW MS 7006 (Black Book of Basingwerk) and elsewhere, appears to have circulated in north-east Wales. It represents a freer and more piquant version than was previously attempted and draws on some extraneous material, notably Wace's Roman de Brut (a Norman language work which was in turn based on Geoffrey's Historia) and a Latin chronology. In the manuscripts, it is sandwiched between the Ystorya Dared and the Brenhinoedd y Saeson (Kings of the English), a version of the Brut y Tywysogyon which incorporates material from English chronicles. Also included is a condensed version of the Lludd and Llefelys tale. This Brut is the version used for the Welsh historical compilation attributed to the late 15th-century poet Gutun Owain, as well as for the Brut Tysilio. =14th or 15th century= *6. Brut Tysilio. Oxford, Jesus College MS 28, transcript from Jesus College MS 61 (14th or 15th century) made by Hugh Jones in 1695.Brut Tysilio in Oxford, Jesus College MS 28. Brut Tysilio and Geoffrey's putative British source The version known as the Brut Tysilio, attributed to the 7th-century Welsh saint Tysilio, became more widely known when its text was published in The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, a once-influential collection of Welsh literary material whose credibility has suffered due to the involvement of the antiquarian forger Iolo Morganwg, in 1801‚Äì1807. The editors did not place much faith in the attribution to Tysilio, using that title merely to distinguish it from another Welsh Brut entitled Brut Gruffudd ap Arthur (the chronicle of Geoffrey son of Arthur, an alternative name for Geoffrey of Monmouth). An English translation of the Brut Tysilio by Peter Roberts was published in 1811, and San Marte made a German translation of Roberts' English translation in 1854, making it available to non-specialists.Fran√ßoise Hazel Marie Le Saux, Layamon's Brut: the poem and its sources, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1989, pp. 119-120. At the very end of the Brut Tysilio there appears a colophon ascribed to Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, saying \\"I [‚Ä¶] translated this book from the Welsh into Latin, and in my old age have again translated it from the Latin into Welsh.\\"Brut Tysilio, tr. P. Roberts, The Chronicle of the kings of Britain. p. 190. On this basis, some took the Brut Tysilio to be, at one or more remove, the \\"very ancient book\\" that Geoffrey claimed to have translated from the \\"British tongue\\".Gerald Morgan, \\"Welsh Arthurian Literature\\", in Norris J. Lacy (ed.), A history of Arthurian scholarship, Boydell & Brewer, 2006, pp. 77-94 This claim was taken up by the archaeologist Flinders Petrie, who argued in a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1917 that the Brut and the Historia Regum Britanniae were both derived from a hypothetical 10th-century version in Breton and ultimately from material originating in Roman times, and called for further study.Flinders Petrie, \\"Neglected British History\\", Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume VIII, pp. 251-278. However, modern scholarship has established that all surviving Welsh variants are derivative of Geoffrey rather than the other way around.Roberts, Brut y Brenhinedd, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1971, pp. xxiv-xxxi Roberts has shown the Brut Tysilio to be \\"an amalgam of versions\\", the earlier part deriving from Peniarth 44, and the later part abridged from Cotton Cleopatra. It survives in manuscripts dating from , and Roberts argues that a \\"textual study of the version [‚Ä¶] shows that this is a late compilation, not different in essentials from other chronicles which were being composed in the fifteenth century\\".

While the caterpillars of most species of Pseudohemihyalea feed on broad-leaved trees (e.g. oaks, Quercus), the P. ambigua group has larvae that feed on conifers. Their forewing coloration has accordingly evolved to light-and-dark lengthwise striping, giving better camouflage among the slim needles of the host plants. In this, they seem to be convergent to certain geometer moths, such as Caripeta piniata or Sabulodes niveostriata. Taxonomy The genus was long included in Hemihyalea when the latter was still unresolved versus Amastus, but seems to be distinct and in fact contain more species than originally believed. The initial confusion stems partly from the fact that R√©go Barros when describing the genus set the type species to be Phaegoptera rhoda, but he had actually misidentified Pseudohemihyalea schausi specimens as P. rhoda.Schmidt (2009) The additional species were usually considered a group of the genus Aemilia, but this was long realized to be awkward and possibly wrong. Since then, a variety of data has been found to suggest the red-banded aemilia (\\"Aemilia\\" ambigua) and its closest relatives correctly belong in Pseudohemihyalea.

The group has also been condemned by the Catholic diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska. History Most Holy Family Monastery was founded in 1967, in Berlin, New Jersey, by a self-proclaimed Benedictine monk named Joseph Natale (1933-1995), originally as a community for handicapped men. Natale entered the Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in 1960 as a lay postulant, but left less than a year later to start his own Holy Family Monastery. According to an archivist of the Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Natale left before taking vows; he never actually became a Benedictine monk. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Natale denounced the Second Vatican Council and the post-Vatican II Mass, and by the mid-1970s the community had separated from the Vatican. By mid-1980s, there were ten monks in it, but by 1994 the number declined to three. Shortly after a conference in 1994, John Vennari left to work for Fr. Nicholas Gruner. Initially incorporated in 1993 as the Queen of Angels Corp, Most Holy Family Monastery is a New York Domestic Not-For-Profit Corporation under the business type ‚Äúreligious organization‚Äù.\\"Entity Information: Most Holy Family Monastery\\", New York State Department of State, Division of Corporations Natale died in 1995, whereupon Michael Dimond (born Frederick Dimond), who joined in 1992 at the age of 19 after converting to Catholicism four years earlier, was elected the Superior. Soon after, he relocated to Granger, New York (close to Fillmore, New York), where Natale owned more than of donated land. Michael and Peter Dimond's position condemning the Vatican's promotion of Natural Family Planning (a fertility awareness method for married couples to regulate conception, pregnancy, and birth) was noted in the 2010 book Twentieth-Century Global Christianity by Fortress Press, as \\"an admittedly rare example of contemporary opposition\\". Sacraments As none of their members were ordained into the priesthood, and as they believe that the post- Vatican Mass is invalid and that even the form of Tridentine Mass permitted by Benedict XVI in 2007 is compromised because the 1962 Roman Missal that he approved includes changes made by Pope John XXIII, they receive the sacraments from a Byzantine rite Catholic Church that is in communion with the Vatican, in Rochester, New York. During these occasions they wear layman's clothes in lieu of their Benedictine habits. Peter Dimond wrote: \\"In receiving the sacraments from certain Byzantine priests for over the last decade ‚Äì i.e. from priests who are not notorious or imposing about their heresies ‚Äì I've received what I consider to be tremendous spiritual graces.\\"http://www.TheCatholicFaith.us/Council_Of_Basel_Dogmatic_Decree_Against_Notorious_Non- Catholics.htm Claims of miraculous experience According to Michael Cuneo, who researched the various traditional movements in the USA, Natale claimed that he had the gift of prophecy in these words: A former member claimed that he heard angels singing when he joined the monastery.

Heracles is killing Laomedon. Pottery was produced in enormous quantities in ancient Rome, mostly for utilitarian purposes. It is found all over the former Roman Empire and beyond. Monte Testaccio is a huge waste mound in Rome made almost entirely of broken amphorae used for transporting and storing liquids and other products ‚Äì in this case probably mostly Spanish olive oil, which was landed nearby, and was the main fuel for lighting, as well as its use in the kitchen and washing in the baths. It is usual to divide Roman domestic pottery broadly into coarse wares and fine wares, the former being the everyday pottery jars, dishes and bowls that were used for cooking or the storage and transport of foods and other goods, and in some cases also as tableware, and which were often made and bought locally. Fine wares were serving vessels or tableware used for more formal dining, and are usually of more decorative and elegant appearance. Some of the most important of these were made at specialised pottery workshops, and were often traded over substantial distances, not only within, but also between, different provinces of the Roman Empire. For example, dozens of different types of British coarse and fine wares were produced locally,Potsherd British coarse wares (accessed November 9, 2011) yet many other classes of pottery were also imported from elsewhere in the Empire. The manufacture of fine wares such as ' took place in large workshop complexes that were organised along industrial lines and produced highly standardised products that lend themselves well to precise and systematic classification. There is no direct Roman equivalent to the artistically central vase-painting of ancient Greece, and few objects of outstanding artistic interest have survived, but there is a great deal of fine tableware, and very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes. Roman burial customs varied over time and space, so vessels deposited as grave goods, the usual source of complete ancient pottery vessels, are not always abundant, though all Roman sites produce plenty of broken potsherds. \\"Fine\\" rather than luxury pottery is the main strength of Roman pottery, unlike Roman glass, which the elite often used alongside gold or silver tableware, and which could be extremely extravagant and expensive. It is clear from the quantities found that fine pottery was used very widely in both social and geographic terms. The more expensive pottery tended to use relief decoration, usually moulded, rather than colour, and often copied shapes and decoration from the more prestigious metalwork. Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents. From the 3rd century the quality of fine pottery steadily declined, partly because of economic and political disturbances, and because glassware was replacing pottery for drinking cups (the rich had always preferred silver in any case). Fired clay or terracotta was also widely employed in the Roman period for architectural purposes, as structural bricks and tiles, and occasionally as architectural decoration, and for the manufacture of small statuettes and lamps. These are not normally classified under the heading 'pottery' by archaeologists, but the terracottas and lamps will be included in this article. Pottery is a key material in the dating and interpretation of archaeological sites from the Neolithic period onwards, and has been minutely studied by archaeologists for generations. In the Roman period, ceramics were produced and used in enormous quantities, and the literature on the subject, in numerous languages, is very extensive. A selection of pottery found in Roman Britain. The assemblage includes Black- burnished ware jars, a Rusticated Ware jar, a Central Gaulish Colour-Coated Ware beaker, Trier Black-slipped Ware with white trailed decoration, Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware, a coarse ware cheese press and other fine wares. Fine wares=Terra sigillata or red-gloss wares= Red gloss ' ware with relief decoration. Compare the plain unglossed restored section to the left. The designation 'fine wares' is used by archaeologists for Roman pottery intended for serving food and drink at table, as opposed to pots designed for cooking and food preparation, storage, transport and other purposes. Although there were many types of fine pottery, for example, drinking vessels in very delicate and thin-walled wares, and pottery finished with vitreous lead glazes, the major class that comes first to mind is the Roman red-gloss ware of Italy and Gaul make, and widely traded, from the 1st century BC to the late 2nd century AD, and traditionally known as '. These vessels have fine, fairly hard and well-fired buff to pink fabrics, with a naturally glossy surface slip ranging in colour from light orange to quite a bright red. The variations in the colour and texture of both body fabric and slip, as well as the vessel- shapes and the designs on the decorated forms can enable a trained student to identify source, date and often individual workshop quite accurately. Arretine ware, made at Arezzo in Tuscany, was the pre-eminent type of fine pottery in the 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, and was succeeded by samian ware, manufactured in a number of centres in Gaul, modern France and Germany. However the definition of all these terms has varied and evolved over the many generations during which the material has been studied.Varying definitions of some of these terms are discussed at '. Technically, red-gloss wares have much in common with earlier Greek painted pottery, but the decorated forms employ raised, relief decoration rather than painting. African Red Slip (ARS) ware belonged to the same tradition, and continued to be made much later than Italian and Gaulish sigillata, right through to the Islamic conquest.King, 181‚Äì185. Essential detailed works are: John P. Hayes, Late Roman Pottery, London 1972, and Supplement to Late Roman Pottery, London 1980 ARS in turn influenced the production of Phocaean red slip, which is common in the Eastern Mediterranean and also appeared occasionally as far west as Southern France and Britain. Selection of undecorated ' from La Graufesenque The production of related types of wares existed in Asia Minor and in other eastern regions of the Empire (Eastern Sigillata wares), while the Iberian provinces also had local industries producing terra sigillata hispanica, which had some similarities with the Gaulish products. Most of these wares were widely distributed and produced on an industrial scale (the largest kilns could fire up to 40,000 pieces at a timeJP Hayes article from the Grove Dictionary of Art ), and undoubtedly using a high degree of specialisation within the workshops. The names of many potters and factory-owners are known from the potters' marks frequently applied to fine wares, and can be highly informative. Cnaius Ateius was an especially prominent producer at Arezzo, but wares with his stamps can be shown by modern analysis of their clay to have been produced in Pisa in Tuscany, and at branch factories at both Lyon and La Graufesenque in modern France. However, the interpretation of name-stamps can be more complex than it appears at first sight. Bold name-stamps visible in decorated areas advertise the name of the factory, but the names of individual artisans working within the pottery, the bowl-makers, appear on plain vessels, while the moulds for decorated bowls were also sometimes signed freehand by the mould-makers, and their signatures also sometimes appear on finished vessels. Theoretically, a decorated vessel might bear the mould-maker's name, that of the bowl-maker or finisher (for example, on the rim), and the 'brand-name' of the factory in the decoration.Johns 1963, 288‚Äì289 The use of slave labour in the Italian workshops is unproven, though some names are certainly of ' (freedmen, that is, freed former slaves). The site of La Graufesenque in South Gaul, near Millau, has been extensively studied and excavated.Wisseman 1994, 37 Its products had an immensely wide distribution in the later 1st century AD, and sherds have been found from India to the Sudan and Scotland.Potsherd, La Graufesenque Moulds for ' bowls of form Dragendorff 37, made at the East Gaulish factory of Rheinzabern In 1895, the German scholar Hans Dragendorff produced a classification of vessel shapes in Roman red gloss pottery that is still used (as e.g. \\"Drag. 27\\" or \\"Dr.27\\" to refer to the small biconvex- profiled cup).Dragendorff 1895; Potsherd has a searchable database by Dragendorff and other classification systems. Other scholars added to his numbered forms, and some archaeologists working on the products of specific manufacturing sites, or the finds from important excavations, initiated their own typologies, so that there are now many other classification systems for Arretine and samian, as there are, indeed, for other classes of Roman pottery, such as the Hayes numbers for African Red Slip forms. Other numbering systems used with Italian and Gaulish sigillata include those of D√©chelette, Knorr, Curle, Walters, Loeschcke, Ritterling and Ludowici, to name but a few.Overviews of the most important types may be obtained by referring to the classic work by Oswald and Pryce in 1920. By far the most useful modern introduction in English to the study of Gaulish samian ware, applicable to all Roman provinces where it is found, not only to Britain, is Roman Samian pottery in Britain, by Peter Webster, (York 1996), . The most common method of making relief decoration on the surface of an open ' vessel was to throw a pottery bowl whose interior profile corresponded with the desired form of the final vessel's exterior. The internal surface was then decorated using individual positive stamps ('), usually themselves made of fired clay, or small wheels bearing repeated motifs, such as the ovolo (egg-and-tongue) design that often formed the upper border of the decoration. Details could also be added by hand with a stylus. When the decoration was complete in intaglio on the interior, the mould was dried and fired in the usual way, and was subsequently used for shaping bowls. As the bowl dried, it shrank sufficiently to remove it from the mould, after which the finishing processes were carried out, such as the shaping or addition of a foot-ring and the finishing of the rim. The details varied according to the form.Webster 1996, 5‚Äì7 The completed bowl could then be slipped, dried again, and fired. Closed forms, such as jugs and jars, were seldom decorated in relief using moulds, though some vessels of this type were made at La Graufesenque by making the upper and lower parts of the vessel separately in moulds and joining them at the point of widest diameter. Relief-decoration of tall vases or jars was usually achieved by using moulded appliqu√© motifs (sprigs) and/or barbotine decoration (slip-trailing). The latter technique was particularly popular at the East Gaulish workshops of Rheinzabern, and was also widely used on other pottery types. A typical plain African Red Slip dish with simple rouletted decoration. 4th century AD. Plain sigillata table vessels, which included large platters, shallow dishes in several sizes, slightly deeper bowls, and small cups, were made on the wheel using a range of templates to create very precise profiles. The sizes were also standardised, which would have facilitated the firing, storage and transport of the huge numbers that were made. The evolution in forms matches in many respects that seen in silver and glass table vessels of the same periods, and the precise forms can sometimes be closely dated. The forms archaeologically classified as 'plain' do sometimes bear decoration of a simple kind, often in the form of a ring of rouletting within the flat interior base of a dish. Plain wares also often bear name-stamps.Arretine stamps are catalogued in Ox√© and Comfort in 1968. Gaulish stamps were originally listed by Felix Oswald, Index of potters' stamps on terra sigillata, 'samian ware', privately published, 1931, now in process of revision and completion by the late Brian Hartley and Brenda Dickinson, Names on terra sigillata: an index of makers' stamps and signatures on Gallo-Roman terra sigillata (samian ware), Vol. 1 (A to AXO), Vol.2 (B to CEROTCUS), 2008 and ARS (African Red Slip) ware was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period. (Occasional imports of ARS have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th‚Äì6th centuries.Tyers 1996, 80‚Äì82 It was manufactured in the province of (approximately modern Tunisia), and similar forms and fabrics were made for more local distribution in Egypt, which had its own very active and diverse ceramic traditions in the Roman period. A wide range of bowls, dishes and flagons were made in ARS, but the technique of making entire relief-decorated vessels in moulds was discontinued.For the detailed typology and distribution maps, see Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980 Instead, appliqu√© motifs were frequently used where decoration in relief was required, separately made and applied to the vessel before drying and firing. Stamped motifs were also a favoured form of decoration, and in the later centuries, Christian subjects and symbols often appear.

Other fine, thin-walled flagons, drinking beakers, bowls and dishes were made locally in most regions of the Roman Empire, including frontier provinces such as Britain: for example, Romano- British 'colour-coated' (slipped) wares made at Colchester and in the Nene Valley belong to that classification. Several of the pots to the right of the group photograph in the lead section of this article are Nene Valley wares, including the large black beaker decorated with a lively hunting scene of hounds and hares in the barbotine technique.Tyers 1996, 166‚Äì175. This reference work, much of which is also available online at Potsherd \\"Atlas of Roman pottery\\", gives a very full picture of the complexity of pottery studies in just one Roman province. That complexity is repeated in each and every region of the Empire. Many decorative techniques were used to beautify pottery tableware, including the use of coloured slips, painting, and various textured surfaces. Painted decoration did not, however, continue the Greek and Etruscan traditions as a specialised technique used for elaborate luxury tablewares, though simpler painted designs do appear on many pottery types, both coarse and fine, throughout the Empire. The dividing lines between 'fine' and 'coarse' wares, or tablewares and cooking wares, become a little blurred in the case of some of the local, provincial products, because pottery is often multi-purpose. A lead-glazed flask, mould-made in the form of a bunch of grapes. From Syria. 1st century AD. Lead-glazed pottery was made in many regions of the Roman Empire, including Gaul, Italy and the eastern provinces. This type of vitreous glaze was most often used for small, decorative items of tableware, including mould-made cups with relief decoration, lamps and zoomorphic containers.There is a survey and typology of some of the Italian products by Roberts 2005. The glazes vary in colour from amber to brown and many shades of green. Tableware made of Egyptian faience, glazed in vivid blue, turquoise or green, continued to be manufactured in Egypt throughout the Roman period, and the shapes of some of these faience vessels in the 1st century BC and 1st century AD were directly influenced by Arretine ware. Very elaborate, decorated polychrome faience vessels were also produced. Egyptian faience, frit or 'glazed composition', as it is often termed by Egyptologists, has rather more in common technically with glass manufacture than with earthenware, since it is a non-clay ceramic material.For a very brief summary of the technology and history of Egyptian faience, see Nicholson 1993 The dividing line between pottery vessels and terracotta figurines is another that is not always sharp, since certain types of small container, such as oil- pourers, were sometimes moulded in representational forms.

The gritted interior of the bowl has been worn almost smooth with use. =Cooking pots= Pottery was essential for cooking food in antiquity. Although metal utensils made of bronze or iron were widely available in the Roman period, simple, functional earthenware bowls, pans, casseroles and jars were an inexpensive and standard part of the equipment of every kitchen. From Britain to Egypt, from Spain to Syria, over the length and breadth of a vast Empire, local pre-Roman pottery traditions in simple cooking wares often continued without major changes for centuries. Roman cooking pots therefore have to be studied on a regional basis.e.g. Tyers 1996, as above, for Britain; for the Rhineland, see Gose 1950 As well as the ordinary bowls and pans used for cooking, ceramic utensils were made for many specialised uses, such as the small cheese-press illustrated to the left of the group photograph of Roman pottery from Britain above. The two black jars to the left behind the cheese-press in the same photograph are examples of Romano-British black-burnished ware, first made in south-west England in the late Iron Age, before the Roman conquest: this ware continued to be popular throughout the Roman period, and was made in greater quantities, and marketed more widely, under Roman influence. Other wares made in Roman Britain were Crambeck Ware, Huntcliff ware, and Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware, which was often decorated. =Mortaria= However, one vessel type used in food preparation was closely linked with the spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the '. This was a robust shallow bowl with a thick, out-curved rim that made it easy to handle, often a pouring lip, and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to pur√©e or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation';Potter and Johns 2002, 141‚Äì142 In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain.Tyers 1996, 116‚Äì135 Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy. =Amphorae= Types of Roman amphorae, which were kept in racks Description and function Amphorae, or amphoras, were used during Roman times to transport food on long and short distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also ', the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora was supposed to be strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base. The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container. Studies on amphorae The first systematic classification of amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphorae deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the '. In his studies of the amphorae deposit he was the first one to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called Dressel table,Dressel 1879, 36‚Äì112, 143‚Äì196 which is still used today for many types. Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications which are usually named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Ma√±a published in 1951,Ma√±a 1951, 203‚Äì210 and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977‚Äì1978.Amphores de tradition punique √† Uzita, in BaBesch 52‚Äì53, 171‚Äì200 The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989,Laubenheimer 1986, 105‚Äì138 whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat.Marangou-Lerat 1995, 30 Beltr√†n studied the Spanish types in 1970.Beltr√†n 1970 Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955.\\"Sulla cronologia delle anfore romane di et√† repubblicana\\" in Rivista Studi Liguri 21, 252‚Äì60 For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella,Panella 2001, 177‚Äì275 and Peacock and Williams.Peacock and Williams 1986 Production Dressel type 1B, an early Roman amphora Key : 1 : rim - 2 : neck - 3 : handle - 4 : shoulder - 5 : belly or body - 6 : foot Amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then let it partially dry.Peacock and Williams 1986, 45 Then, coils of clay would be added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles.Peacock and Williams 1986, 45 Once the amphora was completed, the interior was treated with resin in order to ensure a better performance in liquid storage.Rizzo 2003, 141 The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on ethnographic data coming from the study of modern amphorae production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.Peacock and Williams 1986, 45 Amphorae are often marked with a variety of stamps and graffiti. The function of these stamps are related to the entire life of the vessel. Stamps, graffiti and inscriptions provided information from the production cycle to the content and the commercialisation. A stamp was usually applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage and it often indicated the name of the ' (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, ', were executed when the amphora was completed and provided indications regarding the weight of the container and the content. History The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC.Panella 2001, 177 This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, though also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so- called Dressel 2‚Äì4 starts to become widely used.Panella 2001, 194 This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4,500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6,000 Dressel 2‚Äì4 in the same space.Bruno 2005, 369 Dressel 2‚Äì4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which almost suddenly ceased to be used.Panella 2001, 194 At the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the ' type starts (Dressel 21‚Äì22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.Bruno 2005, 369 In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2‚Äì4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during the late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types.Panella 2001, 194 Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in the late Republican times. The ' and ' regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC thanks to the land distribution to the veterans and the founding of new colonies. The Spanish amphorae were widely spread in the Mediterranean during the early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in the Baetica and among these there was the Dressel 20, typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7‚Äì13, for garum, and the Haltern 70, for the defrutum, fruit sauce. In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped onto the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2‚Äì4. North-African production was based on ancient tradition which could be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage.Panella 2001, 207 Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Ma√±a C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3.Van der Werff 1977‚Äì78 In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC thanks to the local wine production which flourished for long time. This types developed into the Camulodunum 184, an amphora used for the transportation of the Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2‚Äì4 were produced in the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th BC until the middle imperial times.Bruno 2005, 374 Cretan containers were also popular for the transportation of wine and can be found in the Mediterranean from the Augustan times until the 3rd century AD.Bruno 2005, 375 During the late empire north- African types dominated the amphorae production. The so-called African I and II were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased to exist. Other ceramics=Lamps= Gladiators on an oil lamp Artificial lighting was commonplace in the Roman world. Candles, made from beeswax or tallow, were undoubtedly the cheapest means of lighting, but candles seldom survive archaeologically. Lamps fueled with olive oil and other vegetable oils survive in great numbers, however, and have been studied in minute detail.For a general, brief introduction, see Bailey 1997, 164‚Äì169. For detailed scholarly treatment, see Donald M. Bailey, A Catalogue of Lamps in the British Museum, II; Roman Lamps made in Italy, London 1980, and Donald M. Bailey, A Catalogue of Lamps in the British Museum, III; Roman Provincial Lamps, London 1988 Some Roman lamps were made of metal, and could be of highly elaborate forms incorporating statuettes and multiple nozzles, but fired clay was the most usual material, and the majority of small, probably inexpensive, clay lamps had a single nozzle for one wick, and therefore one flame. Most of these clay lamps were shaped using moulds in workshops that turned out large numbers of standardised products. Some of the most popular forms incorporated a central ', a circular area usually around 4‚Äì6 cm. in diameter, that incorporated the filling-hole and could be ornamented with pictorial motifs in low relief. The range of decoration included pagan deities, myths and legends, genre scenes from everyday life, animals, hunting, public entertainments such as gladiatorial combat and chariot-racing, erotic encounters, and in late- Roman times, some Christian symbolism: in short, the full range of subjects that occur in the Roman decorative arts (Jewish lamps with symbols such as the menorah are also found).For a close study of lamp production intended to draw conclusions about the emergence of Early Christian art, see Finney, Paul Corby, The Invisible God: The Earliest Christians on Art, Oxford University Press, 1997, , 9780195113815 Types and decoration initiated at the centre of Empire, in Italy, were often imitated in products made in workshops located in other provinces. Lamps could be directly copied by the process known as ', using an existing lamp as the archetype for producing the mould, rather than creating a hand-modelled clay archetype.Bailey 1997, 168‚Äì169 The highly organised manufacturing methods, usually using plaster (gypsum) moulds, the volume of production, and the trading and wide distribution all echo in some respects the production of red-gloss wares such as Arretine and samian, as does the existence of name-stamps on some of the lamps. Makers' or workshop names were normally placed on the underside of the lamp, and are common on the usually undecorated lamps known as ' ('factory lamps'), a type which was popular in the military zones of the north-west Roman provinces during the 2nd century AD. One well-known name is that of Fortis, and his products were evidently copied outside his own workshop in Italy ‚Äì or perhaps Fortis had his own branch factories in the provinces. The Gaulish ' in the adjacent picture, found in London, is stamped on the base with the name of the maker Atimetus. In addition to the many basic lamp-shapes, which consisted of a rounded or ovoid body, with one or more projecting nozzles, and sometimes a handle, terracotta lamps were also made in a variety of much more fanciful forms, moulded to represent animals, grotesque heads, feet and many other shapes. These are known traditionally as plastic lamps ('plastic' meaning 'modelled or moulded'). The close dating and distribution information that can be obtained from the detailed study of forms, makers' marks and decoration makes Roman lamps important and useful finds on archaeological sites. They are not found in quite as great profusion on Roman sites in Britain as on sites elsewhere in the Empire, including Gaul, quite possibly because imported olive oil would probably have been more expensive in Britannia.

In some northern provinces, such as Gaul and Germany, there was no native Iron Age tradition of making terracotta figurines, but new industries developed under Roman influence manufacturing mould-made figures in fine white pipeclay. Like bronze statuettes, which would have been more expensive items, small terracotta figures were generally made for ritual or religious purposes, such as dedication at temples, display in household shrines, or as grave-goods to be deposited with the dead. However, some terracottas were also used as toys by children, even if they were not manufactured for that specific purpose.Bailey 1983, 191‚Äì199 Most of the small terracotta figurines were mould-made objects manufactured in quite large numbers, and most would have been painted in bright colours when new. These pigments, applied after firing, rarely survive burial except in small and faded patches. Gaulish pipeclay figurine of a mother-goddess, England, 2nd century AD Each region of the Empire produced terracottas in distinctive local styles, but all had rather similar ranges of subjects, above all the standard religious themes of gods, goddesses and their attributes; representations of birds and animals may often be linked with specific deities, though some animal figures may well have been made without any religious or ritual purpose. The religious subjects often include local traditions and cults: for example, the Romano-Egyptian repertoire of terracottas includes Egyptian deities, such as Harpocrates, the Graeco-Roman form of Horus, while Celtic gods appear amongst those made in the Central Gaulish industries, centred in the Allier Valley and the Rhineland industry at Cologne. A Celtic mother- goddess nursing one, or sometimes two, infants, is one of the most popular Central Gaulish types,Rouvier-Jeanlin 1972, 156‚Äì186 though Venus was also very frequently represented in Gaul. The mother-goddess figurines are shown seated in high-backed basketwork chairs that seem to have been typical of Gaul and Britain. Figurines from the Allier Valley and Cologne sources sometimes bear the signatures of modellers and/or mouldmakers.Bailey 1983, 198 As in the case of the Gaulish samian industries, the makers' names and the styles and themes all illustrate the fusion of local and Mediterranean traditions.

These materials were used in buildings all over the Roman Empire, and in many areas, they fell out of use again after the Roman period, only to be rediscovered centuries later. Like other mass-produced Roman ceramic objects, bricks and tiles were often marked with inscriptions that indicate their manufacturer, or the organisation or authority, military or civilian, for which they had been made.The methods and technology of manufacture are described in some detail by Middleton 1997, pp. 158‚Äì163. Although this paper focuses on the Roman province of Britain, the basic methods and organisation described applied all over the Empire. The Roman bricks used for building walls are often referred to as 'tiles', because they are rather thin, flat squares, made in standard sizes, often related to the Roman foot ( ), from around 20 cm to about 58 cm square, and about 5‚Äì7 cm thick.For a very brief introduction, see Johns 2005, p. 8-9. Even stone-built walls frequently incorporated horizontal tile-courses. Brick-built walls were finished with various types of facing, rendering or plastering on both exterior and interior surfaces, so that the bricks themselves were not visible. Tiles used for roofing were intended to be seen, however. Roof-tiles were of distinctive shapes, the ' (pl. '), which was a large, thin tile, almost square, with upturned flanges on its longer sides, and the ' (pl. '), of slightly tapered half-cylindrical form. The imbrices, interlocking because of their tapered form, were laid over the raised flanges of the tegulae, and together formed the characteristic ridged tiled roof still to be seen in Italy and southern France today. The pitch of such a roof has to be fairly low, not more than about 30 degrees. The roof was finished with a series of plain ridge-tiles, and often with decorative finials, which could also be of terracotta, at the gable. Some buildings also featured antefixes, vertical ornaments of triangular or rounded shape that were placed along the edge of the roof. They, too, were often made of terracotta, and could be decorated with pictorial motifs intended to avert ill-luck, or with inscriptions: those made in military tileries attached to legionary forts bore the number and symbol of the relevant legion. A flue-tile with surface decoration that would have been hidden in use Roman hypocaust heating systems made extensive use of fired clay elements: The space beneath the floor of a room to be heated was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay. Ceramic tiles were not normally used for flooring in Roman buildings, though ', a favoured flooring material, was composed of concrete and crushed tile, and carefully cut small squares from tiles were often used in mosaic floors, ' about 2‚Äì3 cm. square being used for plain borders, and smaller squares, about 1 cm., where a red colour was required in a pictorial mosaic with multi-coloured geometric or figural designs. The edge of a roof might be embellished with plaques called antefixes, as mentioned above, and some pottery relief \\"revetment\\" panels with figurative scenes for setting into walls emulate the marble friezes of grand temples. These are still often called \\"Campana reliefs\\", after Giampietro Campana, the 19th- century Italian scholar and collector who first studied them. They were developed from about 50 BC and were used almost entirely in Italy between Tuscany and Campania ‚Äì areas once in the ambit of the Etruscan culture of which they seem a continuation. Initially used on small temples, they are later found on a wide range of public and private buildings. Usually between 22 and 50 cm high and 27 to 48 cm wide, plaques were perhaps typically arranged in bands or friezes. Subjects are usually drawn from mythology. They cease to be found after the middle of the 2nd century; they had to compete with moulded stucco as well as wall-paintings.Boardman, 276-77, Price 191‚Äì192 In archaeology, bricks and tiles, especially when encountered only in fragmentary form, are often classified under the generic term ceramic building material or CBM.

Marking the introduction of the \\"-Star\\" branding nomenclature to International, the conventional-cab ProStar replaced the 9400i (and shorter 9200i). Competing against the Freightliner Cascadia and the Kenworth T2000/Peterbilt 387, the ProStar was an aerodynamically-enhanced conventional. Offered in both day-cab and sleeper-cab configurations, the ProStar was configured primarily for long-distance highway use. Initially assembled in Chatham, Ontario until 2009, the ProStar was assembled in Springfield, Ohio and Escobedo, Mexico until its discontinuation. As part of a substantial model revision, International reintroduced the ProStar as the International LT for 2017 (LT=Line-haul Tractor).  Overview  2013 International ProStar+ Sharing its NGV (Next-Generation Vehicle) cab with the TranStar, LoneStar, and DuraStar, the ProStar was developed as a $300 million project to produce the most fuel-efficient Class 8 truck in North America, along with improving driver ergonomics and reducing maintenance complexity. For both day-cab and multiple sleeper-cab configurations, the ProStar was based on a 122-inch BBC dimension with a set-back front axle. The model line is powered by the MaxxForce 11 and 13 diesels, along with the Cummins ISX15 diesel. For 2015, Navistar introduced its N13 diesel as an option, replacing the MaxxForce engines. In 2010, the ProStar was renamed the ProStar+ as part of a model revision. Coinciding with emissions and fuel- economy refinements (including 700 pounds of weight reduction), the ProStar+ received updates to the interior to increase interior functionality. For 2015, a second revision was introduced as an option, making it the ProStar ES (Efficiency Specification). Coupled with further exterior aerodynamic enchancements, the ProStar ES achieved further fuel economy gains nearly through engine and transmission controls; an automated manual transmission was standard.  International LT (2017-present)  2019 International LT625 Introduced for 2017 production, the International LT serves as the replacement for the ProStar. Using the NGV cab (under a substantial revision), the LT improves its fuel economy over 7% over the ProStar+, intended to save an operator over $2000 per year in fuel costs. Replacing the ISX15, the standard engine is a Cummins X15, with a Navistar N13 returning as an option.

He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in 2006. He played college football for Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe. Jyles was also a member of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts, and BC Lions. Professional football=Edmonton Eskimos= Steven Jyles signed with the Edmonton Eskimos prior to the 2006 CFL season on March 23, 2006.Eskimos ink QB He dressed in all 18 games and scored his first CFL touchdown on October 21, 2006 against the Montreal Alouettes in Olympic Stadium. He again dressed for all 18 games as the third-string quarterback in 2007, seeing limited playing time behind Ricky Ray and Stefan LeFors. =Saskatchewan Roughriders= On February 8, 2008, Jyles was traded, along with Edmonton's 2008 2nd round CFL Draft choice, to the Saskatchewan Roughriders for Fred Perry and Saskatchewan's 2008 2nd round draft choice. He made his first career start against his former team, the Eskimos, on October 25, 2008 in a 55-9 win (although Jyles would be pulled at halftime). He completed his first professional touchdown pass against the BC Lions in week 2 to Andy Fantuz in a 26-16 win. In 2009, he competed against Darian Durant for the open quarterback position, following Michael Bishop's off-season release. Durant would win this battle and he would not relinquish the role as he started all 18 games that season. Subsequently, Jyles saw little playing time. =Winnipeg Blue Bombers= Jyles signed as a free agent with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on February 23, 2010, joining his former Saskatchewan offensive co-ordinator, Paul LaPolice, who had been hired as the Blue Bombers' head coach.https://www.cfl.ca/article/bombers-sign-qb- jyles-release-bishop It was initially thought that Jyles would have an excellent chance to be the starting quarterback for the team after they had released incumbent Michael Bishop, but two months later, the team announced that they had signed Buck Pierce,https://www.cfl.ca/article/winnipeg-the-buck- stops-here meaning Jyles would be relegated to backup duty. Pierce started the 2010 season as the starter, but was injured in game 3, meaning that Jyles would get the next start, again against Edmonton. After winning his first game as a Bomber against Edmonton, he would lose his next two before Pierce returned from injury to start game 7 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. However, Pierce was again injured in that game, so Jyles started the next game against Montreal. Pierce came back for the Labour Day Classic against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, but, for his third consecutive start, was injured in the game. Jyles was declared the starter for the remainder of the season, but he himself was injured in week 17 against the Toronto Argonauts, effectively ending his season and the Bombers' playoff hopes that year. =Toronto Argonauts= On March 30, 2011 Jyles was traded to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for a 1st round selection (4th overall) in the 2011 CFL Draft and a conditional draft choice in 2012.https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=360142https://www.cfl.ca/article/jumping- ship-argos-get-jyles-from-bombers Jyles spent the first nine games of the 2011 season on the nine-game injured list after he continued to recover from the injury he sustained during the previous season. After incumbent starting quarterback Cleo Lemon was released on September 6, 2011, Jyles was named the starter for the team's game against the BC Lions on September 10, 2011.https://www.cfl.ca/article/squeezed-out-cleo-lemon-cut-by-argonauts Squeezed out: Cleo Lemon cut by Argonauts Jyles would go on to start the following eight games of the season, having sat out the last regular season game due to injury. =Edmonton Eskimos= Jyles was again traded in the offseason, this time to the Edmonton Eskimos on December 12, 2011, along with Grant Shaw and a 2012 first round draft pick, for Ricky Ray. On June 24, Jyles was declared the starting quarterback for 2012.https://www.cfl.ca/article/ray- day-argos-land-new-starting-qb Ray Day!

It aired between 11.00am and 11.30am on Saturdays and sat between WOW! and The Chart Show in the schedule. Like The Chart Show, it was focused on music; however, whereas The Chart Show was based principally on videos, The Noise featured live in-studio performances, interviews and features. It was presented and produced by Andi Peters, who had recently left CBBC and been put in charge of music and youth programming at LWT. The show was made by LWT from the London Studios on the south-bank and featured a variety of guests from across the musical spectrum. The title sequence to the show depicts two middle-aged ladies enjoying tea and cakes together, while in the next room, a beat box speaker is playing a noisy tune which is disturbing both of the ladies. The loudness of the beat box causes the room to vibrate vigorously, until it breaks through the wall into the ladies' room and generates a swirl from its main speaker, sucking both of the ladies inside it as if it were a black hole. The titles were created by LWT's Bill Wilson, and the instrumental theme tune was composed by the synthpop duo, Pet Shop Boys. It performed poorly in the ratings and did not continue beyond its sole series; however, a special episode entitled \\"The Noise: Boyzone in Brazil\\" was produced and broadcast in 1997, the special was due to be broadcast on 6 September but was postponed due to an alternative schedule being used after the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and was transmitted on 4 October instead. Two years later, ITV would go on to replace The Chart Show with a studio-based music performance series, CD:UK, to significantly greater success. Andi Peters later left LWT to join Channel 4, where he developed the T4 youth strand. Julian Turner appeared on the show as an assistant to Andi Peters, but left the show during the series due to artistic differences, and went on to pursue a successful career in international finance. 1990s British music television series 1996 British television series debuts 1997 British television series endings British music television shows ITV (TV network) original programming Television series by ITV Studios London Weekend Television shows English-language television shows ","title":"The Noise (TV series)"},{"id":"21239286","text":"A New Dope is the fourth studio album by Boston underground hip hop duo 7L & Esoteric.

The membrane is a multi-layer fabric made of synthetic fibre (usually nylon) and rubberised on one or both sides. The fabric is quite flexible and yet exhibits good wear-resistance characteristics. A layer of stainless steel mesh or ceramic chips can be embedded in the surface layer to reduce or prevent vandal damage. The inflatable flexible membrane dams (IFMD, rubber dams, tiger dam) were developed in the early 1950s - Flexidam - Imbertson. They are installed in stream and river beds, generally being bolted into a concrete foundation. They are used to divert water for irrigation, temporarily raising existing dams, flood control, water retention for aquifer recharge, reducing or preventing salt water intrusion into fresh water areas, protect low-lying coastal areas from tidal flooding, enabling fish passage past diversion works, by deflation, and for sewage retention/separation during flood events. Inflatable dams can be filled with water, air or both. They are low pressure‚Äîtypically 4 to 10 psi. The present trend suggests an increased use of air-filled membranes because they can be deflated or inflated more rapidly, and they are little affected by freezing conditions. Characteristic dimensions cover typically lengths of about 100 m with specially-made membranes up to 200-m wide, dam heights usually less than 5-m but some special designs might be up to 10-m high. The membrane is usually deflated for large overflows. It is however common practice to allow small spillages over the inflated dam. During overflows greater than 20% over-topping, vibrations might result from fluid-structure interactions, and the instabilities might damage or destroy the rubber membrane. Several failures were experienced (e.g. CHANSON 1996). In practice, a deflector (i.e. fin) is installed on the downstream face of the rubber dam to project the nappe away from the membrane, hence preventing rubber membrane vibrations. There are more than 2000 inflatable rubber dams around the world. Durability can be excellent: recently, a 35-year-old dam in eastern Ontario, Canada, was replaced, and while still functional in both freezing winter conditions when it was air filled, and water filled in summer, it was deemed to have served its useful life, and was replaced.

It is situated between the Ketelmeer and the Zwarte Water in the Netherlands. This dam is built to protect the villages against the rising water of the Ketelmeer. It is the biggest inflatable rubber dam of Europe. The inflatable dam has three inflatable parts. The data of each inflatable part are: *Situated 4,65 m under NAP *Maximum height of the dam 3,55 m above NAP *Height 10 m *Length down 60 m, above 80 m *Threshold width 15,4 m *Length fabric 24,3 m *Capacity of dam: air 3,500,000 liter, water 3,500,000 liter *Thickness fabric 1,6 cm *Production Bridgestone, Japan *Weight fabric 19,3 kg/m2 *Weight dam 33 tons *Minimal lifetime fabric 25 year *Closing time max. 60 min. *Time to empty max. 180 min. *Closing water level + 0.50 NAP =Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam= The Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam (formerly known as the Sunbury Fabridam) is the world's longest inflatable dam. The dam is located just below the confluence of the Western and Main Branches of the Susquehanna, between the towns of Shamokin Dam and Sunbury, Pennsylvania. The dam is 2,100 feet (640 m) long. When it is raised in the summer time, it creates the 3,000 acre (12 km¬≤) Lake Augusta, which is used for recreation. The dam and lake are part of Shikellamy State Park. In 2001, the dam was renamed for Adam T. Bower, Chief Clerk of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1967‚Äì68 and Director of Services during the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, by Act 2001-5 of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The longest single span (190m) rubber dam is located in Molino de Suso, Spain. Qingdao Hua Chen Industrial Science and Technology Company Limited has built the longest rubber dam with 3.7m high and 1,110m long in Asia. As the largest manufacture of rubber dam in China, Qingdao Hua Chen has built more than three thousand rubber dams all over the world. NotesSources * Hubert Chanson (1996).

It is set in Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day, where the player assumes the role of an elite agent named Pierce, whose task is to eliminate enemies to prevent them from attacking the Capitol. The game uses the CloakNT in-game engine. The game was released in North America on and was released in Europe on .  Plot  On the day of the Presidential inauguration Secret Service agent Pierce, a member of current President Simon's personal detail, receives a phone call from an unknown caller who goes by the name \\"Semper\\"; Latin for \\"always\\" or \\"ever\\". He warns that the President is in danger and that someone at the top has compromised the Secret Service warning that \\"Tyrants are everywhere\\". Shortly thereafter, dozens of hostiles, although dressed like civilians, are all armed with AKs and speak Spanish, attack the Lincoln Memorial where President Simon is shot. After taking down several RPGs, President Simon is extracted to Walter Reed Medical Center. Then reports of bombs planted in the Capitol building with over one hundred civilians trapped in the cross fire. Agent Pierce enters while another agent, Doyle, provides updates on situation. After Pierce disarms bombs the bomb squad is killed when they enter the building. He rescues a group of senators and questions the Speaker of the House about the vice president-elect, and learns that the president-elect and vice president-elect were political enemies. Doyle then updates that the bombs were a setup for CVX bombs that would decimate D.C. and they originated from the fictional island of Costa Sentava; a military dictatorship led by a man named Vargas, who had used CVX gas before on his people during a revolt and also announced it was no longer in production. Doyle tells they had an inside man to not only get the gas in the country, but in the Capitol as well. The soon to be US vice president is also leading the US delegation at the South American summit being held in D.C. Doyle and Pierce discuss about how they need to get to the White House to expose what's happening, Semper interjects implying the top level people he's going to talk to, could be the same top level people who could be behind the attacks. Agent Pierce enters a network of tunnels that lead to the White House fighting the terrorists and the tunnel's automated defences. En route to the White House, Pierce is told to stand down on orders of Special Agent Kauffman, the man in charge of the Secret Service Protection Division, but later on while still in the tunnels, Pierce learns that President Simon died from his wounds. Doyle tells him that the President- elect detail has gone quiet as well. After preventing an explosion in the tunnels, Pierce enters Secret Service-held territory. Pierce must fight, non- lethally, through Secret Service agents ordered to stop him because he has been classified as a rogue agent. After exiting the train depot chamber, Pierce eventually reach the White House, though he has to fight his way, both lethal and non-lethal, through both Costa Sentavans and the agents who, for unknown reasons, are with them. He also comes in radio contact with the loyal agents holed up inside the Oval Office with both the President-elect and Vice President. When Pierce speaks to President-elect, Richards, and the Vice President William H. Fritz in the Oval Office, the Costa Sentavans attack the White House at night and Pierce must work with the remaining loyal agents to defend the complex before leaving for Andrews Air Force Base with the President on board Marine One, with the exception of the Vice President who has left behind to draw off enemy fire to allow the President to get away. While on board Air Force One, Pierce is on the phone call with Semper that Davies is their main suspect as he was the ambassador to Costa Sentava for eight years before transitioning as a Senator. This proves true as Davies takes the President hostage with the rogue agents backing the corrupt Senator. Kauffman authorises Pierce to use lethal force against the agents in order to rescue the President and even remotely turning back Air Force One before terminating Davies for good. Pierce and Doyle are both commendated by the President for all of their hard work and courage and they are hailed as heroes in their lives. Epilogue, Pierce and Semper contact once more and, though Semper decides not to reveal his own identity, he tells Pierce that he will be in touch soon. Gameplay The gameplay is very similar to Die Hard: Vendetta, the James Bond games, and Soldier of Fortune: Payback. The game contains puzzle elements, where players must defuse bombs and unlock doors. It also uses the same reloading animations from Soldier of Fortune: Payback and 007: Agent Under Fire. For instance, the Uzi in this game has the same reload animation as the Ingalls Type 20 that appeared in the latter game. Weapons are given pseudonyms as well, for instance, the AK-103 is called the \\"KMF-03\\", and the Uzi is the only firearm with its actual name. Reception Secret Service has received generally negative reviews. It has an aggregate score of 49.50% on GameRankings for the Xbox 360 version based on 4 reviews. IGN reviewer Charles Onyett awarded the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 version a 4.5 rating, praising some of the game's artificial intelligence for having a bit of challenge. However, Oynett pointed out the game's single-player campaign for being too short and not featuring a multiplayer mode.

It entered production as the PWS-14. Development The PWS-12 was a single-engined two-seat training biplane, fit also for aerobatics, designed in 1928 by A. Grzƒôdzielewski and August Bobek- Zdaniewski at the PWS factory. The design shared similar parts, including fuselage and engine, as a high-wing trainer fighter plane PWS-11, developed at the same time.Glass, A. (1977) The main difference was the addition of a lower wing. It was powered by a nose-mounted Skoda-built version of the Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial engine. Two prototypes and an airframe for static tests were ordered by the Aviation Department of the War Ministry in February 1928 (along with the PWS-11 prototypes). The first prototype was flown by Franciszek Rutkowski in November 1929. It was later improved - among others, a Townend ring replaced NACA cowling, and it was fitted with N-shaped struts between wings instead of perpendicular struts. The second improved prototype was flown on 18 November 1930, and designated PWS-12bis. Testing was successful and a production order for 20 aircraft was placed by the Polish Air Force. In a meantime, the factory developed improved model PWS-14, featuring a change from wooden to a steel-tube fuselage, strengthened wings and other improvements, like a door in first cockpit's side. The War Ministry ordered a production of one PWS-14 and a similar modification of the series being in production. It caused some financial problems for the factory, since a production of PWS-12s had already started. As a result, the factory delivered in 1932 a series of 20 PWS-14, marked officially as PWS-12 (military numbers 57.1 - 57.20). A further development of PWS-14 was PWS-16, and then PWS-26. Operational service PWS-14 The PWS-14s, officially marked as PWS-12s, were used by the Polish Air Force from 1933 in the Officer Training Centre in Dƒôblin and a Flying School in GrudziƒÖdz. Most were next replaced by the PWS-16 and PWS-26, some remained in use until World War II in 1939. The second prototype PWS-12bis (factory no. 358) was modified in 1931 to a role of an aerobatics aircraft. Among others, fuselage sides were made flat and a rudder shape was changed. It received markings SP-AKE and was flown mainly by Lt. J. Or≈Çowski. In March 1931 it was used in a trip to Estonia, and in April 1933 - to Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Then, both prototypes were used for several years as utility aircraft in Aviation Technical Research Institute (ITBL). They were later stored in Dƒôblin.

It starred Derek Bond, Jane Hylton and Dora Bryan. Plot Duncan McLeod (Derek Bond), a gentleman artist and former Naval officer, assisted by his crewman Lefty Brown (Michael Balfour), engages in smuggling contraband liquor between France and Britain across the English Channel. Duncan and Lefty store the liquor at the Quiet Woman, a local pub in their coastal town, only to find one day that its complicit owner has moved away without telling them, and the pub is now being run by Jane Foster (Jane Hylton) and her maid Elsie (Dora Bryan). Jane makes clear that she does not approve of activities that break the law, and demands that Duncan and Lefty remove their cache of contraband liquor from her property immediately or she will contact customs officials. Duncan and Lefty are attracted to Jane and Elsie respectively, and try to court them. The women are initially cold, but over time become more receptive to them. Unbeknownst to Duncan, Jane was unhappily married to criminal Jim Cranshaw, who is now serving a prison term. Jane is keeping her past a secret while trying to build a new, law-abiding life. Two new arrivals in town take rooms at the pub: Bromley (John Horsley), a former Navy colleague of Duncan, and Helen (Dianne Foster), an artist's model and former girlfriend of Duncan who has come in response to his request for a model to pose for his latest painting. Helen unsuccessfully attempts to rekindle the romance between herself and Duncan, who is not interested in her and is pursuing Jane. Bromley is supposedly on holiday, but in reality is a customs inspector tasked with secretly investigating Duncan's smuggling activities. Jane's former husband, Jim Cranshaw (Harry Towb), suddenly appears at the pub, having escaped from prison several days earlier, and demands that Jane hide him and arrange with Duncan to transport him across the Channel to France. He threatens Jane that unless she helps him, he will tell authorities that she has been hiding him ever since he escaped, making her look complicit. Under pressure, Jane agrees to hide Jim, but refuses to tell Duncan or involve him in the matter. Meanwhile, a newspaper runs a story on the escape revealing Jane's past involvement with Jim. Helen jealously reveals the story to Duncan and Jane in an attempt to break up their relationship, and makes clear that she suspects Jane of being involved in Jim's most recent escape. Fed up with Helen's interference, Duncan fires her from the model job and tells her to leave town. Duncan then learns via Lefty and Elsie that Jane is hiding Jim in the pub's attic. In order to protect Jane, Duncan and Lefty secretly move Jim from the attic without Jane's knowledge, and spirit him away aboard Duncan's boat for transport to France. As a result, when the local police come to the pub searching for Jim, he is gone, but Helen, who has not left town as directed, hints that he went to Duncan's house. Bromley chases after Duncan's boat and sees that Duncan and Jim are on board, but Jim then draws a gun on Duncan, causing the two men to fight and fall overboard. Bromley and Lefty rescue Duncan, but Jim is struck by Bromley's boat and killed. Bromley, who has become aware of Duncan's love for Jane, says he will tell police that Jim stowed away aboard Duncan's boat and that Duncan should go along with the story as it would be best for Jane. Duncan returns to a waiting Jane, who is now free to love him.

It features many other Detroit's MCs including Royce Da 5'9\\", Guilty Simpson, Black Milk, Fatt Father, Danny Brown and Phat Kat among others. The album has been critically acclaimed and considered by many professional reviewers as one of the best hip hop albums of 2008. Production The whole album was produced by Black Milk except for tracks \\"Save Ya\\" (produced by T3), \\"The Science\\" (produced by DJ Dez), and interludes produced by Leaf K. Mayfield, Petey Pistol and Denmark Vessey. A great amount of work was put on the songs' drum lines. Black Milk used various hard kicks and snares, which is a common aspect of his production style. The song which displays this fact the best is probably \\"Guessing Game\\". However, some tracks are noticeable for their deep and soulful samples such as \\"Save Ya\\" or \\"Transitional Joint\\". Eugene \\"Hexmurda\\" Howell served as executive producer of the album. Songs and content The Preface is known for containing songs which are related to various subjects and themes like dreams, colors or infatuation. *\\"Guessing Game\\", can be considered as an oral \\"Fill the Blank\\" game in which the listener has to guess the final 2 syllable word of each bars. According to HipHopMichigan.com's interview, Elzhi said he wrote this song in a couple of hours after listening to Black Milk's beat. On this track, the focus in on wordplays and flow variations.. *On \\"Colors\\", Elzhi is using words from the English dictionary which are related to colors like, for example : \\"Red Cross\\", \\"Bluetooth\\", \\"Black Mail\\"... This track could be compared to GZA's \\"Labels\\" except that Elzhi is focusing his rhymes on colors and not on record labels. Like for \\"Guessing Game\\", he modifies his lyrics through the beats and rhythm variations. *\\"Talking In My Sleep\\" is an immersive track in which Elzhi puts the listener in his dreams and describes different situations: the vision of his mom, to being in a barbershop, to flying through clouds, being in a fistfight, having sex, being chased by a killer armed with a chainsaw (who is possibly his father whom he faces in an inverted house) as well as other images. This track shows Elzhi's capacity for creating patterns, styles and his use of allegories and metaphors, along with his story-telling abilities.

It also does related research on bioethics and Catholic moral theology. Constitution Founded in 1994, the Academy is dedicated to \\"study, information and formation on the principal problems of biomedicine and of law, relative to the promotion and defense of life, above all in the direct relation that they have with Christian morality and the directives of the Church's Magisterium\\". Though the Academy is considered an autonomous entity, it is linked to the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers and various other dicasteries of the Roman Curia. The Academy members are named by the Pope. They are selected to represent different branches of biomedical sciences and ethics which are closely linked with problems concerning the promotion and defense of life. There are also ad honorem members and corresponding members who work in the Academy's institutes and centers of study. The Academy is responsible for the development and promotion of many of the Catholic teachings on questions of medical ethics including procreation, IVF, gene therapy, euthanasia and abortion.Academia Vita ‚Äì Publications It was also responsible for forming, in part, the Church's response to sexual abuse allegations. Activities On 14 February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI addressed members of the Academy to encourage them in their mission. He reiterated Catholic opposition to legislation relating to biomedical or ethical issues that is adopted without moral considerations. In February 2012, the Academy presented a one-day workshop on moral responses to infertility, specifically the need for the scientific community to prevent infertility and develop ethical alternatives to in vitro fertilization. Academy member Josef Seifert, an Austrian philosopher, and several others later complained that the meeting included speakers who did not oppose in vitro fertilization and objected to including supporters of embryonic stem cell research to participate in a Vatican-sponsored conference on stem cell research. Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, defended dialogue with scientists who did not share the Church's views on moral issues, while Michel Schooyans, an Academy member, said such dialogue under Vatican auspices was \\"compromising the Vatican\\" and likely to confuse the faithful. In 2020, the Academy hosted a workshop \\"Roboethics: Humans, Machines and Health\\" that accommodated scientists and church representatives. They discussed moral issues related to the rapid development of AI and robotics, a set of values to be established around these new technologies, their role in the life of society, and the rights that should be given to humans and new forms of autonomous technology. Participants agreed on the importance of technical research and scheduled another AI- focused meeting for the next year. New statutes and members, 2016 On 18 October 2016, Pope Francis approved new statutes for the Academy, which ended the life terms of all its 172 current members. The statutes were made public on 5 November and scheduled to take effect on 1 January 2017. The new statutes dropped a statement Academy members had been required to sign, promising to defend life in accordance with Church teaching, though they required members to \\"promote and defend the principles regarding the value of life and the dignity of the human person interpreted in conformity with the Magisterium of the Church\\". They also established that members would be selected \\"without any religious discrimination\\" and that members would be appointed to five-year renewable terms rather than for life. On 13 June 2017, Pope Francis appointed 45 ordinary members from 27 countries; thirteen were reappointments. A minority were Catholic clergy. Their five-year terms can be renewed until the mandatory retirement age of 80. Included were an Argentine rabbi and an Anglican priest. Academy president Vincenzo Paglia said that the inclusion of non-Catholics, \\"either belonging to other religions or nonbelievers\\", was meant to demonstrate that \\"the protection and promotion of human life knows no divisions and can be assured only through common endeavor\\". Five past leaders of the academy were also named honorary members. The members included such prominent \\"champions of the pro-life cause\\" as the American Carl A. Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, and Cardinal Willem Eijk, Archbishop of Utrecht. The new member whose views were most at odds with Church teaching was Nigel Biggar of the University of Oxford who, though an opponent of assisted suicide legislation, once suggested abortion might be licit during the first eighteen weeks of a pregnancy. Some of those not reappointed had been among the more vocal critics of Paglia or known for their \\"combative tone\\", including Michel Schooyans, professor emeritus at the Catholic University of Louvain, and Luke Gormally, a former research professor at Ave Maria School of Law.

The mound is the site of an 11th- century castle which consisted of motte with inner and outer baileys. Laxton Castle is a late 11th- or early 12th-century medieval castle located north of the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire, England. According to an early 20th- century report by the British Archaeological Association, the site is notable not only as \\"the most striking specimen of a mount and court stronghold\\" in the area, but also for \\"the nearly perfect condition of its two courts\\", which made of it a valuable resource for study. (Public domain) The remaining earthworks and masonry ruins have since 2003 been the subject of study of archaeologists at Birmingham University and the University of Nottingham. The property on which the ruins rest was also the site of a 16th-century manor house known as Laxton Hall. Medieval castle The motte-and-bailey castle first built on the spot seems to have been constructed very soon after the Norman Invasion, perhaps under order of Geoffrey Alselin who was granted the property in 1066, though more likely under order of Alselin's son-in-law, Robert de Caux, who used Laxton as his seat after Alselin's death. The construction of the inner courtyard, or Bailey, is common for smaller earthwork castles of Norman construction. The second wave of construction of the castle may have followed the appointment of de Caux to Hereditary Keeper of the Royal Forests of Nottingham and Derbyshire, although the extent of renovations undertaken by King John, who seized the castle for several years in 1204, is unknown. In 1230, the property and title passed to the Everingham family, until they were stripped of the title in 1286; the property found insufficient to sustain the family further, they left it for other property in Yorkshire. The castle subsequently fell into disrepair. The British Archaeological Association spotlighted the castle's defences, noting: > The greatness of the outer court, the formidable character of the defences > of the base court, the placement of the keep-mount on the edge of the steep > natural escarpment on the northern side, and the evidence of the guarded > track ways to the place, all tend to show the importance of Laxton Castle in > the fighting days of its early existence, when feudal lords cared only for > what they could get and hold, and had little thought for the rights of their > neighbours. Laxton Hall In 1408, the Roos family acquired the property,. The castle was already in ruins by the 16th century when the family constructed a three- gabled brick manor house there, dubbed \\"Laxton Hall.\\" In the 17th and 18th centuries, the property frequently changed hands before coming in 1788 to Charles Pierrepont, 1st Earl Manvers, whose family retained it until 1952, when it was sold to the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1981, it was purchased by the Crown Estate Commissioners.

It is believed that it could be written in Eastern Mediterranean (perhaps Cyprus or Palestine). The manuscript was bound in a modern time. Griesbach dated the manuscript to the 10th or 11th century. Scrivener and Gregory dated the manuscript to the 11th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 11th century. According to the inscription on the first folio it once belonged to Botiros (?), in the 16th century. It was a part of the collection of Robert Harley (1661‚Äì1724), and his son Edward Harley (1689‚Äì1741). In 1753, it was purchased by the British government for the British Museum. The manuscript was examined by Richard Bentley, who designated it by Œ∏'. Griesbach examined several of its passages and occasionally cited their texts in his Novum Testemantum Graece (e.g. in Matthew 3:8). It was also examined by Birch, Scholz, and Bloomfield. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1883. The manuscript was not mentioned on the list of Wettstein (the last number 112). It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Griesbach, who gave for it number 113.J. J. Griesbach, 1809 edition Novum Testamentum Graece, p. CVIII.

It consists of six primary-care hospitals, a children's hospital, and allied clinics and outpatient facilities. The system employs about 14,000 staff members, and is the second-largest system in the Portland metro area, after the Providence Health System. History The beginnings of Legacy Health date to 1875 with the foundation of Good Samaritan Hospital. Emanuel Hospital started in 1912, which in 1971 joined with the Physicians & Surgeons Hospital to form Metropolitan Hospitals in order to build Meridian Park Hospital. Also in 1971, Emanuel purchased Gresham Community Hospital, which later became Legacy Mount Hood Medical Center. Metropolitan Hospitals became a holding company for the hospitals in 1983, and was renamed to HealthLink in 1985. Holladay Park Hospital had joined the group by then, and closed in 1994. Physicians & Surgeons Hospital had started in 1945, and in 1986 became CareUnit Hospital of Portland for alcohol dependency treatments, which closed in 1987. In 1989, HealthLink and Good Samaritan Hospital merged to create Legacy Health System. It was renamed in 2010 as Legacy Health. Facilities The system's hospitals are:Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel, Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center, Legacy Meridian Park Medical Center, Legacy Silverton Medical Center, and Legacy Mount Hood Medical Center in Oregon; and Legacy Salmon Creek Medical Center in Washington. In the spring of 2017, Legacy, in partnership with three other health systems, opened the Unity Center for Behavioral Health. Legacy hosts several specialized institutes and research centers, including Legacy Cancer Institute, the Legacy Devers Eye Institute, the Legacy Weight and Diabetes Institute, the Legacy Rehabilitation Institute of Oregon, the Legacy Oregon Burn Center, Legacy Research Center, the Legacy Biomechanics Laboratory, and the Robert S. Dow Neurobiology Laboratories. It also runs Legacy Medical Group, and has major partnerships and collaborations in Legacy- GoHealth Urgent Care, Legacy Health Partners (collection of medical practices), and PacificSource HealthPlans. Legacy's hospitals and related services are accredited by the Joint Commission. Controversies In February 2018 two former nurses at Unity Center for Behavioral Health filed suit against Legacy, claiming they were fired from their jobs after complaining about their safety. In April 2018, state safety officials reported reviewing hospital records of over 500 patient-on-staff assaults over a ten-month period. In June 2018 friends of Chloe Sagal said she \\"spent two days sitting in triage at the Unity Center; she was never properly hospitalized.\\" After being released, Sagal committed suicide.

Background The term probably originated from the concept that enough water is \\"squeezed\\" out of the slurry to render it unflowable, so the portion that has actually entered the zone will stay in place when the squeeze pressure is removed. After surface indications (e.g., pressure reaching a predetermined maximum) that a squeeze has been attained, any still-pumpable cement slurry remaining in the drill pipe or tubing ideally can be reverse circulated out before it sets. Usually the zone to be squeezed is isolated from above with a packer (and possibly from below with a bridge plug), but sometimes the squeezing pressure is applied to the entire casing string in what is known as a bradenhead squeeze, (named for an old manufacturer of casing heads). Even if a drilling rig is on location, pumping operations usually are done by a service company's cementing unit that can easily mix small batches of cement slurry, measure displacement volume accurately to spot the slurry on bottom, then pump at very low rates and high pressures during the squeeze itself, and finally measure volumes accurately again when reversing out any excess slurry. A squeeze manifold is a compact arrangement of valves and pressure gauges that allows monitoring of the drill pipe and casing pressures throughout the job, and facilitates quick switching of the pumping pressure to either side while the fluid returning from the other side of well is directed to the mud pit or a disposal pit or tank. The generic term \\"squeeze\\" also can apply to injection of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure. Bullhead squeeze (or just plain bullheading) refers to pumping kill-weight mud down the casing beneath closed blowout preventers in a kick-control situation when it isn't feasible to circulate in such from bottom.

Its main east-west thoroughfares are Elizabeth Avenue and Empire Avenue, and its main north-south thoroughfares are Portugal Cove Road and Allandale Road. The neighbourhood borders the campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland to the north, and as a result, it is home to a sizable student population. The area is made up of single-family homes, mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s.

Post-Confederation, development of the area changed to include social housing blocks and housing cooperatives, which remain today in the west end of Churchill Park. The architecture and design was planned by Paul Meschino.\\"Park architect\\" Memorial University Gazette. (08-13-2000) Churchill Park is home to the Churchill Square shopping centre, which is the area's main commercial centre. Bell Aliant's main switching station for the city is located in Churchill Park. City parks include Kelly's Brook Park, Lions' Park, Larch Place Park and St. Patrick's Park, along with its namesake Churchill Park. Due to its proximity to the university campus, many of the homes in the west end of the neighbourhood (west of Allandale Road) are rented out to students, thus making it the city's principal student ghetto. Its proximity to campus makes renting costs higher than other areas of the city, such as Rabbittown or Georgestown. Houses in the west end of the neighbourhood are mostly small bungalows and social housing projects. The east end is much more affluent, with larger houses and an established and less transient population.

Churchill Park is close to the Churchill Square (known to locals as 'The Square') shopping area which has higher end boutiques, small grocery stores and independent offices for finance and lifestyle companies.

The chemical difference is the addition of nickel oxyhydroxide to the manganese dioxide and graphite for the cathode. This results in an unloaded voltage of 1.7 V DC per cell. The cells sustain a higher average voltage during discharge compared to alkaline batteries.

Popular examples include the enjoyment of a football game in a stadium, where the collective enjoyment of the game adds a relational good in terms of excitement and enjoyment to all in the stadium. This constitutes an experience that cannot be had when watching alone. Other examples include group charity work, friendship or reciprocal love. Relational goods can be necessary for the optimization of an activity like the football game example. On the other hand, like Nussbaum suggest, a relational good may be the relationship in itself, with the good being dependent on the existence of the relationship. Friendships is an example of a relationship in which the value that come from the relationship are tied up in the existence and maintenance of the relationship. This parade is an example of a relational good as the participants and the spectators both must engage in order for the experience to be successful. The essential point tends to consider relational goods as goods that are produced and consumed simultaneously by those interacting in the relationship.  Background  Adam Smith, in his 1759 work The Theory of Moral Sentiments, first outlined the idea of non-instrumental relational positives. The 18th century Italian tradition of Civil Economy put the concept of the inner relational nature of the person at the core of the economic science. The idea was largely abandoned until the 1970s by the mainstream (although we can find intuitions in Mill, Marshall, the Austrian school, Keynes, Hirschman), when the discussion of happiness again came to light with the first analysis of the Easterlin Paradox. A solid concept of relational goods was built in the following years in an attempt to reconcile this paradox, and to answer the issue of why voter turnout is higher than rational choice theory suggests. Thus relational goods as an economic concept became more researched in the late 1980s when economists Benedetto Gui wrote From Transactions to Encounters: The Joint Generation of Relational Goods and Conventional Values (1987), and Carole Uhlaner penned Relational Goods and Participation: Incorporating Sociality into a Theory of Rational Action (1989). They aimed to change the way economist think of relationships, and viewed them as non-instrumental goods that have value within themselves. This idea was adopted from other fields that understood human interaction as a fundamental part of human life, with social deprivation being incredibly harmful to human well-being. Economists adopted this concepts, and began to involve relational analysis to study what creates happiness for individuals. It is important to understand that while commodities may be exchanged or consumed during an encounter, it is the utility that comes from the encounter specifically, rather than the utility of the goods consumed, that is considered a relational good. A shopkeeper may sell a good to a customer, but the relational good in that instance is the interaction, the potential enjoyment, sharing and emotional connection that is swapped which is relevant. Due to the highly intangible nature of this connection, relational goods and their value is difficult to measure, and thus study. Many studies instead measure social interactions (volunteering, clubs, church events, parties and gatherings etc.) against self-proclaimed levels of happiness, thus identifying some impacts of socialization. What is infinitely clearer is that deprivation of human interaction can have drastic negative effects physiologically, which aids the hypothesis that relational goods at the very least have health- related utility. Theories on relational goods can have many policy implications for governments. Policies that increase Gross Domestic Product while negatively effecting an individual‚Äôs ability to consume and produce relational goods, may have negative long term impacts on society as a whole.  The production of relational goods  In mainstream economics, the production of commodities employs manufactured capital (tools and implements), natural capital, human capital, and financial capital. All of these contribute to the creation of a good or service valued for its mostly observable physical properties. In contrast, relational goods are produced in sympathetic, empathetic, trusting, and high regard relationships referred to here and by others as social capital. Social capital rich exchange partners exchange what Robison and Flora (2003) refer to as intangible socio-emotional goods (SEGs), which are capable of satisfying socio-emotional needs. When SEGs become embedded in or associated with commodities and other objects, they create an attachment value for the object in addition to its value connected to its physical properties. The result of embedding objects with SEGs is the creation of a relational good referred to as an attachment value good (AVG) that may be tangible or intangible. Though not always called by that name, AVGs are abundant in social life: wedding rings, meaningful songs, family photos, hometowns, artifacts in museums, religious symbols, mementos of emotionally charged experiences, and prized family heirlooms.  Happiness and relational goods  In their 2009 paper Income, Relational goods and Happiness, Becchetti, Londono Bedoya and Trovato were able to study 100,000 people from 82 countries and concluded that increased consumption of relational goods is strongly linked to happiness. They were also able to reflect on the \\"fellow feelings\\" theory which stated that relational goods increase in their ability to generate happiness with: # Increased time and experiences the interactors share # The mutual consent of the interactors This hypothesis suggests that closer, warmer relationships garner more happiness, than colder relationships. They were able to see that time spent with close friends or fellow religious congregation members more strongly increased a person's happiness than did spending time with colleagues outside of working hours. This strengthens the view that time and depth of experience has an impact of the value of a relational good. = Relational good-happiness-income connection = The question of whether income generate happiness is one that has plagued economists since Richard Easterlin (1974) published research that showed that increased income didn't generate the same proportional increase in wealth. Easterlin theorized that crowding out concept, where pursuit of increased wealth has a negative effect on non-material goods like maintaining relationships. Becchetti, Londono Bedoya and Trovato found in 2009 that at the highest income levels, time for relationship is negatively affected. However, they also found that this effect is reversed in other income groups as raised income levels increases the amount of free time available to dedicate to relationships. Meanwhile, others, like economist Justin Wolfers dispute this and place a much higher importance on money and financial security. Where Easterlin found that happiness didn't necessary correlate to money, Wolfers found in a study of 155 countries that richer countries and people are also generally happier. On this issue, Becchetti, Pelloni, Rossetti (2007) discovered that relative income is also a relevant factor. They found that an increase in income of a member of social group relative to your own income can actually have a negative effect on happiness. Regardless of the dispute on how important money is, what is less in dispute is that money is not the only factor. Traditionally, happiness, a notoriously difficult concept to measure, is defined economically as utility and is expressed as an extension of choice, i.e. the more choices available, the more happiness you can/do attain. The study of relational goods suggests that happiness can be correlated to the consumption of relational goods. = Relational goods and television = The average American watches about 5 hours of TV per day. In their paper Watching alone: Relational goods, television and happiness (2008) Bruni and Stanca were able to show that increased television watching time reduces consumption of relational goods as individuals use television as a substitute for relationships, thus crowding out relationships. This supports previous research that has shown that increased television time is negatively correlated to life satisfaction. One a direct level, Bruni and Stanca were able to show that increased television time takes away from time spent socializing, and also that television reduces communications within gatherings. Secondly television, through advertisement, has the indirect effect of propagating the consensus that material goods improve life satisfaction to a greater degree than do relational goods. People watch increasing amounts of television. This potentially takes time away from forging relationships Despite the reality that television correlates to unhappiness, the habit propagates because firstly, television is a cheap medium that requires no effort for a proportionally high degree of entertainment, compared to the higher degree of effort necessitated in socialization. Furthermore, television is highly addictive. The golden age of television has successfully created a pseudo-reality that people can escape to, alienating them from others. On the other hand, evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has shown that gossip evolved as an aid to social bonding, and about 2/3 of our conversations can be boiled down to gossip (defined as discussions on social topics). Discussing television shows is arguably a sub- set of this, and can thus help in forming relationships.  Policy implications of relational goods  Other research, such as the work of Blessi et al., has shown that people prefer cultural social activities of a non- instrumental nature, where relational goods can easily be shared, these types of activities in turn tend it improve one's well-being. This has several implications to government policy. If relational goods are currently under- consumed, then it may need organizational provision from government. Policies like increasing access to public spaces for collaboration, providing opportunities for volunteering or other sociable activities, all help that may improve wellbeing. This can help improve total happiness which as many positive consequences for overall stability and productivity within a nation. The United Nations General Assembly has also suggested that nations measure their citizens‚Äô Gross National Happiness, and use it to extrapolate policy. Research suggests that increasing relational goods consumption will also increase happiness. Unfortunately, relational goods and their direct impact is hard to measure, making investments into increasing their consumption hard for governments to make tangible. However, policies that encourage engagement tend to have positive effects can also be (socially) profitable. Consider for example, the provision or promotion of group volunteer opportunities.  Consumption of Relational Goods in varied demographics  In general, it has been found that relational good are not equally shared among peoples. It has been found that females consume and produce more relational goods in general. This is concurrent with other research that has proven women to be more empathetic, an emotion that lends itself well to socialization and may be considered a relational good. Furthermore, it has been found that older people as well as less educated people are happier and consume more relational goods. This may be an issue of choice, where they are less capable of doing solo activities, and are generally more dependent on a framework of people. Therefore, relationships are more vital, and thus they reap the rewards of relational good. Others have suggested that older people are happier due to an improved level of emotional intelligence. As for less educated people, findings about relational goods being more widely consumed within that demographic supports statistical evidence that shows that less educated people aren't necessarily less happy. This is an economical issue as choice and happiness are often correlated. While education significantly improves choice in material goods, the traditional yardstick for happiness, it does less to improve your options in relational goods, and may in fact reduce your options as more educated people tend to work longer hours, thus leaving less time for relationships.

In 1548, the early death of his relative Henry II of Podƒõbrady, made him the regent of his Duchy of Ole≈õnica on behalf of his sons Henry III and Charles II until 1569. Three year later, in 1551, the insubordination of his elder brother Frederick III of Legnica caused his deposition from the government and the appointing of his infant son Henry XI of Legnica as the new Duke of Legnica. George II became in the regent of the Duchy on behalf of his nephew, jointly with Balthasar von Promnitz, until 1556, when Frederick III managed to return to Legnica and retake the power. During all his reign he maintain a good relationship to the Habsburgs (despite being a Lutheran) and was sent by the Emperor in some diplomatic missions. In 1548, George II took part in the coronation of Maximilian II in Prague and Bratislava, and also used the Bryeg army to maintain the internal order of the Duchy (Police Regulation of 1577). In particular, he dedicated himself to the expansion of his main residence, Brzeg, where he built a magnificent Renaissance palace, which was later destroyed by Frederick II the Great during the siege of Brzeg. As a Lutheran, he was totally committed with the reforms started by his father. He also built the Gymnasium (high school) in Brzeg (1564‚Äì1569) and, after the fire of Brzeg in 1569, the new City Hall and the towers of the St. Nicholas Church.

At above sea level, it is the highest permanent settlement in the world. Between 2001 and 2009, the population was estimated by National Geographic to have increased to 30,000 people from just a small gold prospector camp because the price of gold rose 235% over that period,National Geographic Magazine, January 2009 although this number has not been reflected by the 2007 census or 2017 census. Geography=Topography= The town is in the Ananea District, San Antonio de Putina Province. The town lies at a height of to with the center at sea level, on the side of Mount Ananea and at the foot of glacier called Auchita, otherwise known as La Bella Durmiente (The Sleeping Beauty).http://www.papelesdesociedad.info/IMG/pdf/la_rinconada-2.pdf Some successful miners in La Rinconada have homes in Juliaca, which has municipal services and is only above sea level. =Economy and infrastructure= The economy is mainly based on the production of gold from nearby gold mines, many artisanal. Many miners work at the gold mine owned by Corporaci√≥n Ananea. Under the cachorreo system they work for 30 days without payment. On the 31st day they are allowed to take with them as much ore as they can carry on their shoulders. Whether the ore contains any gold or not is a matter of luck. Pocketing of nuggets or promising chunks of rich ore is tolerated. Women are banned from the mines, but pallaqueras can be seen working through rock on the mine dumps. Inca Manco C√°pac International Airport is the nearest commercial airport; it is in Juliaca. =Environmental issues= The town lacks plumbing and sanitation systems. Hypoxia is a significant health problem due to the low oxygen level of the high altitude. There is also significant contamination by mercury, due to the mining practices. Local miners refine the ore by grinding and treating it with mercury and pressing the mass through a cloth to filter it. The resulting amalgam is heated, to remove the mercury. = Climate = High in the Andes, La Rinconada has an alpine tundra climate (ET, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with no month having mean temperatures even close to the threshold that would permit tree growth and a subtropical highland classification for the city. Far above the tree line, La Rinconada is unique in its high elevation and population, with the highest city of comparable population (Cerro de Pasco) being over closer to sea level. Owing to the extreme elevation of the town, climatic conditions more closely resemble that of the west coast of Greenland than somewhere only 14¬∞ from the equator. The town has rainy summers and dry winters with a large diurnal variation seeing cool to cold days and freezing night time temperatures throughout the year, with snowfalls common.

A number of his sculptures are on display around the world, including President Macron at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris, Pope Francis at the Vatican, Michelangelos David in the Madonna del Parto Museum collection, and Kim Jong-un at the Pyongyang Museum in North Korea. After graduating in medicine from Paris Descartes University and completing his surgical training and Fellowships from Guy's Hospital in London, the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota in the States, the Soviet Union and University College London, he became appointed to St Mary's Hospital where in 1995, he performed London's first pancreas transplantation. He was part of the team that performed the first kidney transplantation in the Arab world in 2003, during the Iraq War, and later developed a kidney transplant technique using an unusually small 2.5 cm incision. The procedure was depicted in Henry Ward's 2010 painting The 'Finger-Assisted' Nephrectomy of Professor Nadey Hakim', commissioned to raise awareness of legal organ donations. Subsequently, in 2013, he performed the first kidney transplantation in Abuja, Nigeria. Following an 'unfair' dismissal by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in 2015, he was reinstated in 2016 after a tribunal. In the same year, he received the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur at a ceremony held at the French Embassy in London. The following year, Imperial appointed him as their president's envoy. Between 2018 and 2019, he became Visiting Professor of Surgery at the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the Beirut Arab University and a Doctor of Arts degree from the University of Bolton.

St Mary's hospital in london In 1995, he performed London's first pancreas transplantation at St Mary's Hospital and began the first pancreas transplant programme in South East England. =Limb transplantation= Hakim had hoped that the world‚Äôs first hand transplantation would be performed in London. Instead, representing Britain, in September 1998, then working at St Mary's Hospital, London, he joined the team led by Jean-Michel Dubernard at the √âdouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon, that then performed the world's first hand transplantation, an operation that took 14 hours. The recipient of the donor hand, Clint Hallam, failed to follow aftercare directions and later requested that the transplanted hand be removed. Hakim amputated the hand in February 2001 in London. In 2000, he was one of 20 surgeons led by Dubernard, involved in the transplantation of two arms on a 33 year old French man who lost both his arms in an explosive accident fours years earlier. =Kidney transplantation= One of the surgeons who inspired Hakim and whom he met, was the American Joseph Murray, who performed the first successful kidney transplantation in 1954, an operation involving two identical twins and the donor being live. In an article in Experimental and Clinical Transplantation (2016), Hakim recalled being invited to Yemen by professor Hussain Al Kaff to visit Aden, Yemen to attend the first International Yemeni Conference on Nephro-Urology in March 2003, during the Iraq War. During the visit, a Saudi team led by Faissal Shaheen from the Saudi Centre for Organ Transplantation, together with the Austrians, Robert Fitzgerald, Felix Stockenhuber and Annilies Fitzgerald, and Hakim who led Al Kaff's doctors from Aden, performed 10 operations, consisting of five living related kidney transplantations in one sitting over 20 hours, despite political instability and its near abandonment. These were the first kidney transplantations in the Arab world, which, as a result, led to the establishment of The Arab European Foundation, with the mission \\"to help poor Arab countries\\" and the motto of \\"poverty should not be a barrier to health or education!\\". Hammersmith Hospital, London During Hakim's appointment as surgical director of the West London Renal and Transplant Centre at Hammersmith Hospital, he developed a kidney transplant technique using an unusually small 2.5 cm incision.

As adjunct professor of transplantation surgery at Imperial College London, in November 2013, he performed the first kidney transplant at the Garki Hospital in Abuja, Nigeria. Over the subsequent five days, a total of eight living related kidney transplantations were performed at the hospital, and all using the finger assisted technique. In 2016, following a dispute about him operating on two private patients and an NHS patient on the same day in 2013, resulting in a subsequent suspension in 2014 and dismissal in 2015, he was reinstated by the Trust after a tribunal concluded that the dismissal was ‚Äúunfair‚Äù.< =Other roles= Hakim has been an advisor on transplantation issues to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and has been an examiner for the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

Early life  Born in a priests family, Ivan Vyshnegradsky graduated from the Tver Theological Seminary and later from the Main Pedagogical Institute. He later taught maths and mechanics at St. Petersburg military educational institutions. He specialized in mechanics and among his contributions was a set of criteria for identifying the stability of steam engine speed governors. By the time he was appointed a government minister his fortune was nearly a million roubles due to his participation in several joint-stock companies as well as being a renowned and talented entrepreneur. In 1884 Ivan Vyshnegradsky became a member of the Council of Ministers of Public Instruction and drew up a program for technical education.  Russian Finance Minister  In 1886 Ivan Vyshnegradsky was appointed a member of the State Council and in 1887 became the head of the Ministry of Finance. Similar to his predecessor Nikolai Bunge, Vyshnegradsky pursued a policy aimed at the settlement of the budget deficit, stronger government interference in private railways and the nationalisation of the least profitable railways as well as the support of domestic industry and preparation of monetary reform. Ivan Vyshnegradsky achieved this by; increasing direct taxes, pushing for an export drive and increasing railway lines. Although achieving a balanced budget, accumulating gold reserves and strengthening the rouble Ivan Vyshnegradsky work was criticised in light of his contradictory taxes on peasants leading to the 1891‚Äì2 famine.

It was built on the site of an earlier royal manor house that had provided accommodation for noblemen hunting in a nearby royal park in the reign of King John. Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, and continued until 1322, shortly before his execution, but the work was never fully completed. From the early 14th century, Melbourne Castle was mainly in the possession of the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster or the crown. Improvements and repairs were made, particularly by John of Gaunt, and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. John I, Duke of Bourbon, was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison for Mary, Queen of Scots, although events led to her incarceration elsewhere. The castle was in decline by the end of the reign of Elizabeth I. Although the stonework was sound, minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure. The manor was purchased in 1604 by Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, who had his own castle in nearby Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials. All that remains of Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15 m (50 ft) long and 4 m (13 ft) high and some foundations; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building. The ruins are grade II listed and the site is a scheduled monument. There is no public access to the castle remains.  Background  Melbourne is a town in South Derbyshire close to the River Trent, which may have originated as buildings associated with the royal manor to the south of the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of Alfred the Great, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the manor for life to √Üthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop √Üthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown. A royal hunting park close to Melbourne was probably created by King John around 1200, and the King is known to have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.  Description  alt=Drawing of a castle The castle was built to the east of the 14th-century town on a slightly raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8 ha (7 acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8 ha (20 acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3 m (10 ft) thick. All that is known of the appearance of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain. A bakehouse, kitchen and chapel are recorded, as well as the hall, great chamber, and drawbridge, but the details of the internal layout for the castle are unknown.  History = Early years = alt=End view of a wide stone wall Earl Thomas granted the manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert obtained a licence to crenellate from Edward II in order to fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry on the site of what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show ¬£1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313‚Äì14, of which ¬£548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, Millstone Grit. This is a coarsely grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late 18th century. Earl Thomas, with other barons, captured King Edward's favourite, Piers Gaveston, and killed him in 1312. Nevertheless, the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314. For a time, after Edward's defeat at Bannockburn, the earl, a friend of the Scots, controlled most of England, but by 1321 Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from the Midlands. The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and Tutbury were left deserted and looted by the local populace. Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. He was swiftly executed, and Robert de Holland was beheaded in 1328. The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward, Ralph Basset, to replace the incumbent, John de Hardedeshull.; . In March, those who had stolen from the castle were arrested, and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops. He appointed Robert Tocher and Roger de Beler in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from confiscations of rebel property in Staffordshire. Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325, and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby Swarkestone to repair the bridge over the Trent. = Lancastrian improvements = thumb The castle, still unfinished at the time of Thomas' execution, along with its lands, remained as crown property until it was bestowed on Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, Earl Thomas' brother, in 1327.; . In turn it passed to Henry's son, the fourth earl, who became the first Duke of Lancaster. At the time of the duke's death in 1361, his constable was Ingram Fauconer, who received an annual life stipend of ¬£10, a further ¬£5 going to his wife. Henry's heiress was Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt. Duke John confirmed Fauconer's pension when he came into possession of the Lancastrian lands. Catalina, the three-year-old daughter of John by his second wife Constance of Castile, was given her own room and a Castilian attendant at the castle in 1375.Weir (2008) p. 135. Peter Melbourne was made keeper of the Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of ¬£10. He was granted another 66s 8d in 1386, and 10 marks (¬£6 13s 4d) in 1395. The last award was conditional on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper of the parks, which had passed on to his son, also called Peter. The younger Peter Melbourne was involved in the upbringing of the future Henry IV during the reign of Richard II. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year. Upon Henry's seizure of the throne, Peter was confirmed as constable, and in October 1399 his annuity was increased from ¬£10 to 100 marks (¬£66 8s); in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle, co-leader of plot against the King. The Duchy of Lancaster continued to improve and expand the property through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the Communal Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392/3, along with other works. He repaired a drawbridge in 1393/4 and made plumbing improvements in 1399/1400, using lead acquired as a forfeit two years earlier. For 19 years, the castle served as a prison for John I, Duke of Bourbon after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His custodian was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the Wars of the Roses, the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou, but since her campaign was along the line of the Great North Road, it was Melbourn, Cambridgeshire she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake. In 1545, antiquarian John Leland reported to Henry VIII the property was in good enough shape that it was described as \\"praty and yn meately good reparation\\" perhaps following repairs in the reign of Edward IV, when Sir Ralph Shirley, a commander at Agincourt, was governor of the castle. = Decline = alt=Stone foundations in front of a wall When Elizabeth I became queen, she ordered a survey of her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles in the north of her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 reported that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen was on the verge of collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth ¬£1,000, and could be repaired for ¬£100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed \\"imperfect at every corner\\". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard \\"so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house\\". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne. In 1597, the castle was being used as a cattle pound, although a survey in 1602 assured Elizabeth that it was a \\"faire and anciente castle, which her Majesty keepeth in her own hands.\\" The constable's annual fee of ¬£10 was the same as that paid to Ingram Fauconer 140 years earlier. The castle and lands were bought for ¬£4,700 in 1604, by Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, whose family seat at Ashby de la Zouch Castle was just 11 km (7 mi) away. Melbourne Castle was destroyed between 1610 and 1637 so that its materials could be used in other construction.; . By 1629, it is likely that all the worked stone above ground level had been removed; Sir John Coke of Melbourne Hall obtained permission from the Bishop of Carlisle in that year to quarry stone from the castle foundations. Some of the facing stones were used to repair the weir at King's Mill, seen by some at the time to fulfil the words of a local prophet that \\"the waters of the Trent should overflow the towers of Melbourne castle\\". The Hastings estate was gradually sold off, and the castle site was sold by Earl Moira in 1811.  Ruins and archaeology  alt=Stone-clad terraced houses A section of rubble wall about 15 m (50 ft) long and 4 m (13 ft) high remains, incorporated into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are designated as a scheduled monument. The area to the south of the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers. The site is on the east side of Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access. Some of the stone taken from the castle was used to construct the mid-18th-century grade II- listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, was said to have been built on castle foundations up to 4 m (12 ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material. An early 19th-century excavation found underground apartments \\"of considerable extent and superior workmanship\\", and excavations in the latter part of the same century found considerable foundations in the gardens of Castle Farm. Castle Mills housing estate contains a now-covered well 2 m (6 ft) in width and 15 m (50 ft) deep, and work in 1961 uncovered massive 5 m (16 ft) foundations east of the old mill and on the same alignment as the existing wall. Excavations in 1969‚Äì1971 found an extensive network of walls faced with ashlar, a door post, the base of a spiral staircase and evidence of an outer courtyard. Many stones had mason's marks. During construction works in 1988, masonry including the rubble centres of two large east‚Äìwest walls was found in test trenches. Apart from the area of the turret bases next to the standing wall, none of the archaeology is now visible.

There are differences of opinion about the location and boundaries of the subranges of the northern Cascades, although early geologists and topographers had a fundamental agreement on the topic. The Hozomeen Range was seen as bounded by the Skagit River on the west and extending east to the Pasayten River (east of the Sumallo River) and Coquihalla River. The core of the Hozomeen Range under this definition marks the divide between streams in British Columbia that flow west to the Fraser River and those that flow via longer routes via the Nicola River, Thompson River, and Similkameen River tributaries into the Fraser or Okanagan River.

He served as an anti-tank gunner during the Battle of France and was evacuated to England during the Battle of Dunkirk, where he joined the Free French Forces under General de Gaulle. Iturria was assigned to the Free French paratroopers that joined the British Special Air Service in North Africa, with them he took part in several raids behind enemy lines. In 1944 he parachuted into occupied France during the liberation and fought with the French Resistance in Brittany and then in Southern France, where he was killed in an ambush. Biography Victor Iturria was born on 22 October 1914http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr/les-compagnons/476/victor-iturria in Bassussarry in the French Basque Country. He was mobilized and took part in the Battle of France as corporal and gunner of a 25 mm anti-tank gun. As such, he received a citation for having, by himself, disabling seven German tanks during an attack. Severely wounded during the retreat to Dunkirk in May 1940, he was evacuated to a hospital in England. He was reinstated in early July 1940 and joined the Free French Forces, becoming a paratrooper in the 1st Air Infantry Company established in England in late September 1940 by Captain Georges Berg√©. With his unit, now the 1st Parachute Company, he embarked for the Middle East in July 1941. In September 1941, the 1st Parachute Company was renamed the Parachute Platoon of the Levant and then, as part of the Air Force, it was renamed the 1st Parachute Chasseur Company of the Free French Air Force. After being stationed at Beirut and Damascus, the unit moved in January 1942 to Kabret on the banks of the Suez Canal. It was integrated into Special Air Service Brigade (SAS Brigade) commanded by Major Stirling. The French SAS becomes the French Squadron and, equipped with jeeps, they became famous for raids against the German rear and airfields. On 12 June 1942 in Libya, Victor Iturria took part in an attack, led by Andr√© Zirnheld, on an airfield in Benghazi. The following month, under command of Captain Jordan, he took part in three attacks on airfields in Cyrenaica and then, in August, an attack against Benghazi. In January 1943, he left Cairo with his unit for a 3 000 km raid to Tunisia, where it contributed to destroy the line of communication in the rear of the Mareth Line, where the Germans have stabilized their positions. Having already received two citations in the Order of the Army, he was decorated with the M√©daille militaire in Algiers. . He returned to England with the survivors of the French Squadron, which became the 1st Air Infantry Battalion (1er BIA) in July 1943 and then the 4th Air Infantry Battalion (4e BIA) in November. Promoted to adjudant, Victor Iturria was made an instructor. On 1 July 1944, the 4e BIA changed name again 2nd Parachute Chasseur Regiment of the Air Force (2e RCP). Iturria was parachuted into Brittany on 3 August 1944. A week later, he took part in the attack on Lorient and on 15 August, at Quiberon, with his section, he captured a hundred prisoners. Sent to Nantes with the 2e RCP, he patrolled along the Loire. On 25 August, Victor Iturria was killed by a machine gun burst in an ambush near Blain in Loire-Atlantique department. He was buried in the village of Sare in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques department.

It is visible from the PR-123 but is accessible from a trail that begins adjacent to a Puma gas station located along PR-10 on kilometer 75. The cave and surrounding land are privately owned. Tourism The cave is a popular tourist attraction for Puerto Ricans as well as tourists visiting from outside Puerto Rico. An initial admittance fee for Saturday and Sunday visits was established by the owner of a nearby gas station, due to the location's popularity. The number of visitors is at its largest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. In January 2013, a daily admission fee was established, and later raised the following month. A boardwalk project was constructed from the gas station, leading up to around 200 feet into the trail, as well as a small parking lot atop a plateau behind the gas station. After a rise in popularity and visits, different admission fees were established for certain days of the week, providing necessary safety equipment for the 45-minute guided tour. The number of visitors is greatest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. Nightly tours are also offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays. In popular culture R√≠o Grande in Arecibo from Cueva Ventana Between February and March 2009, Disney Channel filmed Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie in Puerto Rico with scenes shot inside the cave as well as a land that sits in the R√≠o Grande de Arecibo valley in front of the limestone cliff where the cave sits.

Biography Known as somewhat of a journeyman in British basketball, Perkins started his career playing for his hometown team Birmingham Bullets in 1995, making his professional debut against the Sheffield Sharks on 9 September 1995. He has since then gone on to play for no fewer than 7 British teams and over 9 European teams in his career as well as earn 6 appearances for the England national team. Perkins enjoyed most of his success with the famous Bullets team of the mid-nineties. In 1996 he picked up his first award as BBL Play-off winner, helping the Bullets to defeat London Towers 78-72 in front of a packed Wembley Arena crowd. Perkins and the Bullets were to regain the Play-off title two years later in 1998 with a close 78-75 victory over Thames Valley Tigers, capping off another successful season where the team finished as Runners-up in the League Championship. Perkins left the UK that year to pursue dreams of a career in Europe, finding himself in the Icelandic league where he was the league leader of Blocked Shots for 1998-1999. After stints at several other European clubs, the Small/Power forward returned home to sign for National Basketball League side Teesside Mohawks, one of the frontrunners of the lower leagues. Success returned again for Perkins, and inside his first season with the club he had already won the National Trophy, Conference Championship and Play-off final with an incredible double-overtime 127-117 victory against Solent Stars. Though his time at the Mohawks was a resounding success, Perkins soon moved on during the following season and returned to Europe and Finland where his achievements continued. Playing for Forssan Koripojat, he helped the team to second-place in the First Division finishing with impressive stats 19 points and 11 rebounds per-game, and picking up both the league's award for Player of the Year, Forward of the Year and Bosman of the Year. He was named in the All-Star 1st Team & All- Bosman Team for the 2004-05 Season. His stats caught the attention of Brighton Bears coach Nick Nurse who promptly signed up Perkins, leading the way for another return home and back into the BBL. His stint did not last long however and he was soon transferred to London Towers, where within a few months of being at the club, he helped the team to the Final of the 2006 BBL Cup, eventually losing to Newcastle Eagles, 83-69. Following the closure of the Towers that summer, Perkins was again on the lookout for a team and moved on to the Scottish Rocks for a brief period before travelling through Switzerland, Spain and France and eventually ending up back in London under the command of Steve Bucknall at BBL rookies London Capital, where he signed on a temporary basis. After the end of a shambolic first season for London, Perkins opted to sign for another rookie team Worthing Thunder, who had just joined the BBL from the English Basketball League. After retiring from the game of basketball in November 2008, Perkins has decided to revitalise his career and get back to playing and has journeyed back to Europe to France once again. He is now a teacher at Dame Elizabeth Cadbury School in Bournville, West Midlands (B30 1UL).

It generally means the ability to give the \\"correct\\" answer to standard questions that do not require significant creativity, for instance in most tasks in school and on standardized multiple-choice tests for intelligence.  Relevance  A Map of how Convergent Thinking Works Convergent thinking is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem. It is oriented toward deriving the single best, or most often correct answer to a question. Convergent thinking emphasizes speed, accuracy, and logic and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapplying techniques, and accumulating stored information. It is most effective in situations where an answer readily exists and simply needs to be either recalled or worked out through decision making strategies. A critical aspect of convergent thinking is that it leads to a single best answer, leaving no room for ambiguity. In this view, answers are either right or wrong. The solution that is derived at the end of the convergent thinking process is the best possible answer the majority of the time. Convergent thinking is also linked to knowledge as it involves manipulating existing knowledge by means of standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It is a source of ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent thinking is used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions. Convergent thinking is often used in conjunction with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many creative ideas are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking to decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative thinking at the beginning of the problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, convergent thinking can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.  Convergent vs. divergent thinking = Personality = The personality correlates of divergent and convergent thinking have been studied. Results indicate that two personality traits were found to be significantly associated with divergent thinking. These traits, namely Openness and Extraversion, were found to facilitate divergent thinking production. Openness assesses intellectual curiosity, imagination, artistic interests, liberal attitudes, and originality. The fact that Openness was found to be the strongest personality correlate of divergent thinking is not surprising, as previous studies have suggested that Openness be interpreted as a proxy of creativity. Although Openness conceptualizes individual differences in facets other than creativity, the high correlation between Openness and divergent thinking is indicative of two different ways of measuring the same aspects of creativity. Openness is a self-report of one‚Äôs preference for thinking \\"outside the box‚Äù. Divergent thinking tests represent a performance-based measure of such. No personality effects on convergent thinking were found, suggesting that the Big Five personality traits are a better predictor of divergent thinking than convergent thinking or that all types of individuals engage in convergent thinking regardless of their personality. = Brain activity = The changes in brain activity were studied in subjects during both convergent and divergent thinking. To do this, researchers studied Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns of subjects during convergent and divergent thinking tasks. Different patterns of change for the EEG parameters were found during each type of thinking. When compared with a control group who was resting, both convergent and divergent thinking produced significant desynchronization of the Alpha 1,2 rhythms. Meanwhile, convergent thinking induced coherence increases in the Theta 1 band that was more caudal and right-sided. On the other hand, divergent thinking demonstrated amplitude decreases in the caudal regions of the cortex in Theta 1 and 2 bands. The large increase in amplitude and coherence indicates a close synchronization between both hemispheres in the brain. The successful generation of the hypothesis during divergent thinking performance seems to induce positive emotions which, in part, can be due to the increase of complexity and performance measures of creative thinking, Psycho-inter-hemispheric coherence. Finally, the obtained dominance of the right hemisphere and ‚Äòthe cognitive axis‚Äô, the coupling of the left occipital ‚Äì right frontal in contrast to the right occipital ‚Äì left frontal ‚Äòaxis‚Äô characterizing analytic thinking, may reflect the EEG pattern of the unconscious mental processing during successful divergent thinking. Convergent and divergent thinking depend on the locus coeruleus neurotransmission system, which modulates noradrenaline levels in the brain. This system plays important roles in cognitive flexibility and the explore/exploit tradeoff problem (multi-armed bandit problem). = Intellectual ability = A series of standard intelligence tests were used to measure both the convergent and divergent thinking abilities of adolescents. Results indicate that subjects who classified as high on divergent thinking had significantly higher word fluency and reading scores than subjects who classified as low on divergent thinking. Furthermore, those who were high in divergent thinking also demonstrated higher anxiety and penetration scores. Thus, those subjects who are high in divergent thinking can be characterized as having their perceptual processes mature and become adequately controlled in an unconventional way. Conversely, subjects in the high convergent thinking group illustrated higher grade averages for the previous school year, less difficulty with homework and also indicated that their parents pressed them towards post-secondary education. These were the only significant relationships regarding the convergent thinking measures. This suggests that these cognitive dimensions are independent of one another. Future investigations into this topic should focus more upon the developmental, cognitive and perpetual aspects of personality among divergent and convergent thinkers, rather than their attitude structures. = Creative ability = Creative ability was measured in a study using convergent tasks, which require a single correct answer, and divergent tasks, which requires producing many different answers of varying correctness. Two types of convergent tasks used were, the first being a remote associates tasks, which gave the subject three words and asked what word the previous three words are related to. The second type of convergent thinking task were insight problems, which gave the subjects some contextual facts and then asked them a question requiring interpretation. For the remote associates tasks, the convergent thinkers correctly solved more of the five remote associates problems then did those using divergent thinking. This was demonstrated to be significantly different by a one-way ANOVA. In addition, when responding to insight problems, participants using convergent thinking solved more insight problems than did the control group, however, there was no significant difference between subjects using convergent or divergent thinking. For the divergent thinking tasks, although together all of the divergent tasks demonstrated a correlation, they were not significant when examined between conditions. = Mood = With increasing evidence suggesting that emotions can affect underlying cognitive processes, recent approaches have also explored the opposite, that cognitive processes can also affect one's mood. Research indicates that preparing for a creative thinking task induces mood swings depending on what type of thinking is used for the task. The results demonstrate that carrying out a task requiring creative thinking does have an effect on one's mood. This provides considerable support for the idea that mood and cognition are not only related, but also that this relation is reciprocal. Additionally, divergent and convergent thinking impact mood in opposite ways. Divergent thinking led to a more positive mood, whereas convergent thinking had the opposite effect, leading to a more negative mood.  Practical use  Multiple choice questions requiring convergent thinking Convergent thinking is a fundamental tool in a child's education. Today, most educational opportunities are tied to one's performance on standardized tests that are often multiple choice in nature. When a student contemplates the possible answers available, they use convergent thinking to weigh alternatives within a construct. This allows one to find a single best solution that is measurable. Examples of convergent questions in teaching in the classroom: *On reflecting over the entirety of the play Hamlet, what were the main reasons why Ophelia went mad? *What is the chemical reaction for photosynthesis? *What are signs of nitrogen deficiency in plants? *Which breeds of livestock would be best adapted for South Texas?  Criticism  The idea of convergent thinking has been critiqued by researchers who claim that not all problems have solutions that can be effectively ranked. Convergent thinking assigns a position to one solution over another. The problem is that when one is dealing with more complex problems, the individual may not be able to appropriately rank the solutions available to them. In these instances, researchers indicate that when dealing with complex problems, other variables such as one‚Äôs gut feeling or instinctive problem solving abilities also have a role in determining a solution to a given problem. Furthermore, convergent thinking has also been said to devalue minority arguments. In a study where experimental manipulations were used to motivate subjects to engage in convergent or divergent thinking when presented with either majority or minority support for persuasive arguments, a pattern emerged under the convergent thinking condition where majority support produced more positive attitudes on the focal issue. Conversely, minority support for the argument had no effect on the subjects. The convergent thinkers are too focused with selecting the best answer that they fail to appropriately evaluate minority opinion and could end up dismissing accurate solutions.

It features historically significant story elements and award-winning gameplay. It opened publicly on February 14, 1994. It has received critical praise for its research and attention to detail in reconstructing past cultures within the game context. Game characteristics A screenshot of LegendMUDs login screen The thematic structure of LegendMUD is based on a literal interpretation of historical legend, with content based on real locales at various points in history, but with mythological elements included as concrete reality. LegendMUD was derived from DikuMUD. At present, it features over 8,000 rooms contained within 60 areas. LegendMUD features several innovations, one of which was that players were not required to select a character class such as mage or warrior. Rather, a skill system is used, which has been noted as extensive and original. The player selects a hometown affecting the types of skills which are then able to be learned. For example, a character from the industrial period San Francisco has the opportunity to learn about guns, but cannot learn magic. In contrast, a character from ancient period Ireland is capable of learning druidic skills, but can never learn about more modern ideas such as field surgery. To further innovate on the learning of skills, the character must through interaction with non-player characters learn whatever that NPC had to teach, with some of these requiring a small form of quest. History In October 1995, LegendMUD was selected as The Mud Connector's Mud of the Month. Koster wrote \\"\\", a short essay and epitaph about the death of a LegendMUD player named Karyn. An investigative journalist later disproved evidence of Karyn's death. Richard Bartle considered the incident to be a key event in the development of virtual worlds' ethics, similar to A Rape in Cyberspace. The 'death' demonstrated that people can develop feelings for each other via the virtual world medium, thus experiencing real emotions about somebody they've never met, even an entirely fictional persona. A Story About a Tree is considered as a major counterargument against the \\"it's just a game\\" point of view on virtual worlds. Furthermore, it showcased that while being a very real object of grief to one party, it can indeed remain just a game for another.

These included elections for both Senate seats and a gubernatorial election. Due to the special election for US Senate, all of New York's six statewide offices were up for popular election on the same date. At the same time, all 29 members from New York of the U.S. House of Representatives, all 212 members of the New York State legislature, and many other local officers were elected. The Democratic Party swept all of the statewide races, but Republicans made net gains of six seats in the House of Representatives, nine seats in the state Assembly (breaking the veto-proof Democratic supermajority in that chamber) and two seats in the New York State Senate, the last of which delivered the Senate chamber back to the Republican Party. United States Senate Democratic Senator Charles Schumer won reelection against Jay Townsend, his Republican opponent. Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton resigned to become United States Secretary of State in the Obama Administration. Kirsten Gillibrand had been appointed to the seat by Governor David Paterson in 2009, and won the general election on November 2, 2010, to hold the seat for the remainder of its term, against Republican Joseph J. DioGuardi. United States House 29th district seat was vacated by Eric Massa, who resigned March 8. Under the authority of Article I in the U.S. constitution and provisions in New York state law, Governor David Paterson was supposed to call a special election in spring 2010 to fill the seat, but waited until September to call the election concurrent with the general election. The seat remained vacant from March 8, 2010 until new Congressman Tom Reed was sworn in, in November 2010. Two concurrent elections were held, one to fill the remainder of Massa's term (November to January) and one to fill the seat in the subsequent Congress. Both elections had the same candidates on the ballot, Democrat Matthew Zeller and Republican Tom Reed. Reed prevailed in both elections. All of the New York congressional districts that were expected to be competitive were in Democratic hands; Republicans were expected to mount serious challenges to Democratic incumbents in districts 1, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25 and 29. Republican candidates won their races in Congressional Districts 13, 19, 20, 24, 25, and 29. Republican candidates prevailed in a total of eight congressional races in New York, while Democratic candidates prevailed in the other 21; thus, the GOP gained a total of six House seats in New York. State=Governor= Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned due to a prostitution scandal. David Paterson, the Lieutenant Governor of New York, succeeded Spitzer. Neither Paterson nor his appointed Lieutenant Governor, Richard Ravitch, sought election to a full term in 2010. The following tickets were filed with the New York State Board of Elections: *Democratic Party: Andrew Cuomo/Bob Duffy (won the general election on November 2, 2010) *Republican Party: Carl Paladino/Greg Edwards *Independence Party: Cuomo/Duffy *Conservative Party: Paladino/Edwards *Working Families Party: Cuomo/Duffy *Taxpayers Party: Paladino/Edwards *Libertarian Party: Warren Redlich/Alden Link *Green Party: Howie Hawkins/Gloria Mattera *Rent is Too Damn High Party: Jimmy McMillan/no running mate *Anti-Prohibition Party: Kristin M.

Brian Foley, Antoine Thompson, Darrel Aubertine, and Craig Johnson) were defeated in the general election. Democratic candidate David Carlucci was elected to an open seat in Senate District 38 that had become vacant due to the July 2010 death of Republican Senator Thomas Morahan. After defeating incumbent William Stachowski in a Democratic primary, Timothy M. Kennedy prevailed in the general election in Senate District 58. The Republicans' takeover of control of the State Senate was not confirmed until Johnson, who had sought a full hand recount of his race, exhausted his final appeal on December 20, 2010. Control of the State Senate was considered of greater importance than other elections due to the prospects of redistricting in the 2010 United States Census. State Senate district boundaries had been gerrymandered to protect the interests of upstate New York, which had experienced a decline in population. Open seats *12th district: Democrat George Onorato announced he would not seek reelection. Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat, ran for the seat.

Carlucci prevailed in the general election. *40th district: Incumbent Republican Vincent Leibell announced he would not seek reelection to run for Putnam County Executive. (Leibell was elected Putnam County Executive, but resigned from both posts in December 2010 amid rumors of corruption charges. ) Michael Kaplowitz, Westchester County Legislator was the Democratic candidate. Republican Greg Ball, an Assemblyman, won his party's primary. Ball went on to win the general election. *53rd district: Republican George H. Winner, Jr. unexpectedly announced he would not seek re-election on June 2, 2010. Assemblymen Tom O'Mara and James Bacalles, both Republicans representing adjacent districts, made known their intentions to pursue the seat; O'Mara won the Republican primary and ran against Ithaca Democrat Pamela Mackesey. O'Mara won the general election. *59th district: Republican Dale Volker retired after 19 terms (38 years) in office. Former Erie County Sheriff Patrick Gallivan won a three-way the Republican primary, although Republican candidates Jim Domagalski and David DiPietro initially remained in the race on minor party lines (Domagalski eventually withdrew his candidacy). Cynthia Appleton, a Village of Warsaw Trustee and critical care nurse, was the nominee of the Democratic and Working Families Parties. Gallivan prevailed in the general election. Notable races *1st district: Incumbent Republican Kenneth LaValle, who has served 17 terms (34 years), ran unopposed in 2008. The district includes the five East End towns of Long Island, New York and the eastern half of the Town of Brookhaven, New York. LaValle faced a potentially formidable Democratic challenger in corporate fraud lawyer Regina Calcaterra, but Calcaterra dropped out after it was revealed that she had not met state residency requirements and was replaced on the ballot by Jennifer Maertz. LaValle won the general election on November 2, 2010. *3rd district: Incumbent Democrat Brian X. Foley was elected in 2008 to a seat held by Republican Caesar Trunzo since 1972.

The district stretches across the south shore of Suffolk County from Brentwood to Mastic Beach, New York. Zeldin defeated Foley, the one-term incumbent, in the general election on November 2, 2010 by a margin of 58% to 42%. *6th district: Incumbent Republican Kemp Hannon has represented this district since 1989. The district includes Levittown, Massapequa, Garden City, Uniondale, Hempstead, Farmingdale, Franklin Square, Old Bethpage, Salisbury, Garden City South, Plainview, Lakeview, Plainedge, Island Trees and East Meadow. In 2008, Hannon was almost defeated by political newcomer Kristen M. McElroy. Hannon was initially opposed by Democrat Dave Mejias, but Mejias withdrew his candidacy following his arrest on charges of stalking and battery and was replaced on the ballot by Francesca Carlow. Hannon won the general election on November 2, 2010. *7th district: Incumbent Democrat Craig M. Johnson was elected in a special election in 2007 and subsequently elected to a full term in November 2008. The district is located in the northwest corner of Nassau County, New York. Mineola, New York mayor Jack Martins ran on the Republican line. On December 4, 2010, the election results in this closely contested race were certified; Republican challenger Jack Martins, prevailed. The margin of victory was just 451 votes, 0.5%, and there were discrepancies in two of the 7 machine counts that were audited, leading Democrats to call for a full hand recount. Democrats promised to appeal the decision. However, on December 20, 2010, the New York Court of Appeals rejected Johnson's final appeal and ruled that Martins had won the election; Johnson then conceded. *11th district: Incumbent Republican Frank Padavan represented this district since 1972.

Messer. Stavisky won the primary. She won the general election on November 2, 2010. *27th district: Incumbent Democrat Carl Kruger faced a primary challenge from administrative judge Igor Oberman.

Oberman failed to submit the necessary signatures to participate in the primary. Kruger won the general election on November 2, 2010. *32nd district: Incumbent Democrat Rub√©n D√≠az, Sr. faced a potential primary challenge from Charlie Ramos; the socially conservative Diaz has come under fire for his public opposition to same-sex marriage, but nevertheless won the primary by a margin of 79% to 22%, and went on to win the general election on November 2, 2010. *33rd district: Incumbent Democrat Pedro Espada faced primary challenges from Desiree Pilgrim-Hunter and Jos√© Gustavo Rivera. Espada gained notoriety and earned disdain from Democrats for his brief alliance with Senate Republicans in 2009 that led to his elevation to Senate majority leader; he is currently being investigated by the Bronx County District Attorney in relation to questions regarding whether he meets residency requirements for representing the 33rd District, the IRS for alleged tax fraud, and by the State Attorney General for looting a state- funded health clinic.

As of December 11, 2010, the Republicans had made a net gain of eight seats, with two races still undecided; if the Republican candidate prevails in the lone remaining undecided race, the Republicans will hold 51 seats in the chamber, depriving the Democratic Party of the veto-proof supermajority it has held in the New York State Assembly for the past several years.

The Skagit Range lies to the west of the Skagit River and east and north of the Chilliwack River and flanks the Upper Fraser Valley region of British Columbia's Lower Mainland. Of the three subranges of the Canadian Cascades--the Skagit, Hozameen, and Okanagan ranges--the Skagit is the most mountainous. It continues north to the Fraser River, sometimes using different local names. The Hope Mountains, and the \\"Anderson River Group\\" are separated from the main Skagit Range by distinct natural boundaries, but are otherwise similar in character. Geography According to Fred Beckey there are differences of opinion about the names and locations of the subranges of the northern Cascades, especially between Canadian and American geographers. Nevertheless, early geologists and topographers had a fundamental agreement about the location and names of the subranges. The Skagit Range was seen as the mountainous area from the Skagit River northwest to the Fraser River. More recent Canadian maps show the Skagit Range as bounded to the west by the Sumallo-Nicolum valley and extending north along the east side of the Coquihalla River. BCGNIS defines the Skagit Range simply as \\"west of the Skagit River, extends into the U.S.A.\\" The USGS defines the range in its GNIS database with a single point, , north of Granite Mountain where Mount Chardonnay is situated. Peakbagger.com defines the Skagit Range as a large and not entirely mountainous region bounded by the Fraser River to the north, the Skagit River to the south and east, the Strait of Georgia to the west, and the Nicolum River and Sumallo River on the northeast. This definition includes a sizable area of non-mountainous areas, especially along the lower Fraser River and near the coast. Subranges include the Cheam Range, also known as the Four Brothers, and the Picket Range.

It was listed in the 1932 Brough Superior catalogue as the 'Straight Four' but it was commonly known as the Brough Superior Austin Four, or BS4, or '3-wheeled Brough'. The machine is unique in its design, being powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile engine and gearbox unit, from which a driveshaft emerges on the centre-line of the motor. Rather than design a new gearbox, George Brough had the inspiration to keep the central driveshaft, and use a pair of close-couple rear wheels driven by a central final drive box. This 3-wheeled design was legally considered a motorcycle as the wheel centres were within 24\\".Brough Superior: the Rolls Royce of Motorcycles, Clark, 1964. Goose&Sons; Publishers Ltd, The Brough Superior-Austin Four created a sensation when revealed at the 1931 Olympia Motorcycle Show. Development George Brough considered the four-cylinder engine ideal for a motorcycle, given its smooth running and potential for greater horsepower than a single or twin-cylinder engine of the same capacity. Brough Superior had already revealed two prototype 4-cylinder machines before 1932, using an air-cooled sidevalve V-4 built in-house (1927), and an air-cooled inline sidevalve 4 developed by Motosacoche (1928). While these prototypes were never built in series, they generated tremendous attention at shows and in the press . In 1930, George Brough considered using an engine already in production, in this case the well-developed Austin 4-cylinder sidevalve, water-cooled motor of 747cc. Brough increased the engine displacement by 50 cc to 797 cc and added a light alloy 'sports' cylinder head for more horsepower. George Brough claimed a significant increase in the Austin's power output, but, as The Motor Cycle magazine observed, this was a luxury motorcycle intended for use with a sidecar, not a sports machine. Power output was actually quite low, and the performance was inhibited by the use of standard Austin rear-axle ratios. The brisk acceleration with a heavy sidecar fitted would, however, more than compensate for lack of top speed. On sale from March 1932, the Brough Superior Four had been in development for 18 months and brought much needed publicity to the Brough works as the Depression struck the motorcycle industry worldwide. Despite the attention, however, only ten examples were actually built. Initially designed for use with a sidecar, the Austin engine was from a well-proven Austin 7 design, which was a side-valve with a low-pressure oiling system. George Brough chose to use also the standard Austin 7 three-speed gearbox, complete with reverse, driving a prop shaft to a crown wheel and pinion mounted in a specially cast housing. The twin rear wheels would possibly have been expected to make it difficult to handle, but Hubert Chantrey successfully completed the Land's End Trial on a solo version. Chantry pointed out that it really was a luxury motorcycle, as it had cost George Brough over ¬£1,000 to develop (which equates to over ¬£50,000 today.) The Brough Superior Four was actually sold for ¬£188 - cheaper than the Brough Superior SS100. Engine cooling was achieved with a pair of purpose-built radiators fixed either side of the front frame downtube. The Brough Superior- Austin Four's greatest success was the publicity generated by the introduction and imaginative marketing of such an unusual motorcycle. Surviving examples prop shaft. Of the ten Brough Superior Austin Fours built, (eight in 1932 and one in both 1933 and 1934), a total of nine have survived to this day. Of these, two are in the US, three are owned by UK enthusiasts, two are in Germany, and one is known to have been scrapped in Anglesey, Wales. One is at the Southward Car Museum in Otaihanga on New Zealand's North Island,. Recently the ninth surviving model has been discovered in the collection of the late Frank Vague near Bodmin, Cornwall. Brough Superior Austin Four in the UK Motorcycle Museum The Brough Superior Austin Four in the National Motorcycle Museum (UK) is actually a replica of the motorcycle that was scrapped in Wales. Built by enthusiast Albert Wallis, who started with a few spare parts including a rear bevel box casting, and a pair of original radiators, it was completed with a standard Austin 7 engine and gearbox.

The station also serves the nearby towns of Paris and Simcoe. History Grand Trunk Railway Station, ca. 1910 The station was built by the Grand Trunk Railway, as designed by architects Spier and Rohns, in 1905. The station played a key role in Brantford's economic development. It brought markets, materials and labour into the city. Refurbishments for the Brantford railway station came in 2002 when Via Rail spent $350,000 ($ in today's money) to make general improvements to railway service. Ten passenger trains connect Brantford to the major economic hubs of Windsor, Sarnia, Toronto, Montreal, and Ottawa every day. Facilities The station is wheelchair-accessible and is located near the junction of Market, Gray and West Streets. CN Gore Park is the closest park to the railway station, with the Carnegie Library and the Brethour House being other attractions within a reasonable distance of the station. A self-service ticketing kiosk allows people to print out their own tickets. The station building includes the Brantford Station Gallery, an art gallery & coffee shop featuring live music, which is open to travellers. Brantford Transit provides transit access to and from the railway station. Short-term and long-term automobile parking are available for a fee as of August 1, 2012; previously the parking had been free to use. Increased use of railway services has been the primary reason for this change in parking policy. Future GO Transit indicated in the \\"GO 2020\\" plan that peak hour train or bus service may be expanded to Brantford by the year 2020.

Under her leadership, the magazine became the global leader in fashion photography.Pitman, Joanna. \\"Non-stop erotic cabaret\\". The Times (8 May 2001). Crescent gave Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin, the magazine's two most influential photographers, complete creative control over their work. During the 1970s, Bourdin and Newton competed to push the envelope of erotic and decadent photography;Braunstein, Peter. \\"Shoot to chill\\". W (1 October 2001). the \\"prone and open-mouthed girls of Bourdin\\" were pitted against the \\"dark, stiletto-heeled, S&M; sirens of Newton\\". At times, Bourdin's work was so scandalous that Crescent \\"laid her job on the line\\" to preserve his artistic independence. The two photographers greatly influenced the late-20th-century image of womanhood and were among the first to realize the importance of image, as opposed to product, in stimulating consumption. By the late 1980s, however, Newton and Bourdin's star power had faded, and the magazine was \\"stuck in a rut\\". Colombe Pringle replaced Crescent as the magazine's editor-in-chief in 1987.Colapinto, John. \\"You'll think I'm a madman\\". The Guardian (May 27, 2007).

When Pringle left the magazine in 1994, word spread that her resignation had been forced.Daswani, Kavita. \\"Out of vogue\\". South China Morning Post (4 February 1996). Joan Juliet Buck, an American, was named Pringle's successor effective 1 June 1994.\\"French Vogue names editor\\". The New York Times (11 April 1994). Her selection was described by The New York Times as an indication that Conde Nast intended to \\"modernize the magazine and expand its scope\\" from its circulation of 80,000. Buck's first two years as editor-in- chief were extremely controversial; many employees resigned or were fired, including the magazine's publishing director and most of its top editors.\\"How two Americans shook up French 'Vogue'\\". CNN Business Unusual (8 May 1999). Transcript via LexisNexis. Though rumors circulated in 1996 that the magazine was on the verge of a shutdown, Buck persevered; during her editorship, the magazine‚Äôs circulation ultimately increased 40 percent.Horyn, Cathy. \\"Front row: New home for the best-dressed list? De Niro's dresser now has a store -- Editor of French Vogue calls it quits.\\" The New York Times (12 December 2000). Buck remade the magazine in her own cerebral image, tripling the amount of text in the magazine and devoting special issues to art, music, literature, and science. Juliet Buck announced her decision to leave the magazine in December 2000, after her return from a two-month leave of absence. The Sydney Morning Herald later compared her departure, which took place during Milan's fashion week, to the firing of a football coach during a championship game.Wilson, Catherine. \\"Strictly black and white\\". Sydney Morning Herald (17 November 2001). Carine Roitfeld, who had been the magazine's creative director, was named as Buck's successor the next April.Trebay, Guy. \\"She's the face of fashion, and its prophet\\". The New York Times (16 April 2002). =Under Carine Roitfeld (2001‚Äì2011)= Roitfeld aimed to restore the magazine's place as a leader in fashion journalism (the magazine \\"hadn't been so good\\" since the 1980s, she said) and to [restore] its French identity. Her appointment, which coincided with the ascendance of young designers at several of the most important Paris fashion houses, \\"brought a youthful energy\\" to the magazine.Healy, Murray. \\"We're French! We smoke, we show flesh, we have a lot of freedom\\". The Observer (25 February 2007). By April 2002, she had rid the magazine of foreign staffers, making it \\"all French for the first time in many years\\". The magazine also underwent a redesign by the Paris-based design firm M/M (Paris).\\"M/M make Vogue human\\". Creative Review (2 June 2003). It aimed to make the title appear more hand-crafted and organic, particularly through the use of collage and hand-drawn fonts. Continuity was created through the use of loose theming for each issue, smooth pacing, and visual uniformity in the shopping pages. The magazine‚Äôs aesthetic evolved to resemble Roitfeld's (that is, \\"svelte, tough, luxurious, and wholeheartedly in love with dangling- cigarette, bare-chested fashion\\").Larocca, Amy. \\"The anti-Anna\\". New York Magazine (25 February 2008). Roitfeld has periodically drawn criticism for the magazine's use of sexuality and humor, which she employs to disrupt fashion's conservatism and pretension. Roitfeld's Vogue is unabashedly elitist, \\"unconcerned with making fashion wearable or accessible to its readers\\". Models, not actresses promoting movies, appear on its cover. Its party pages focus on the magazine's own staff, particularly Roitfeld and her daughter Julia Restoin Roitfeld. Its regular guest-editorships are given to it-girls like Kate Moss, Sofia Coppola, and Charlotte Gainsbourg. According to The Guardian, \\"what distinguishes French Vogue is its natural assumption that the reader must have heard of these beautiful people already. And if we haven't? The implication is that that's our misfortune, and the editors aren't about to busy themselves helping us out.\\"Patrick O'Connor. \\"Un bon anniversaire\\". The Guardian (4 December 1995). Advertising revenue rose 60 percent in 2005, resulting in the best year for ad sales since the mid-1980s. On 17 December 2010, Carine announced her departure from Vogue Paris effective 31 January 2011. =Under Emmanuelle Alt (2011‚Äìpresent)= On 7 January 2011, it was announced that Emmanuelle Alt, who had been the magazine fashion director for the last 10 years, would become the new editor-in-chief effective February 1st.Emmanuelle Alt new French Vogue editor-in-chief - Vogue UK, 7 January 2011 See also * List of Vogue Paris cover models * List of women's magazines * List of men's magazines ReferencesExternal links *Vogue Paris *Vogue Paris in English Digitized issues of Vogue Paris in Gallica, the digital library of the BnF. 1920 establishments in France Cond√© Nast magazines French-language magazines Monthly magazines published in France Women's magazines published in France Magazines established in 1920 Magazines published in Paris Women's fashion magazines Paris ","title":"Vogue Paris"},{"id":"21241318","text":"Ptychoglene is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

In detail: *A 0-blade is a scalar. *A 1-blade is a vector. Every vector is simple. *A 2-blade is a simple bivector. Linear combinations of 2-blades also are bivectors, but need not be simple, and are hence not necessarily 2-blades. A 2-blade may be expressed as the wedge product of two vectors and : *:a wedge b . *A 3-blade is a simple trivector, that is, it may be expressed as the wedge product of three vectors , , and : *:a wedge b wedge c. *In a vector space of dimension , a blade of grade is called a pseudovector or an antivector. *The highest grade element in a space is called a pseudoscalar, and in a space of dimension is an -blade. *In a vector space of dimension , there are dimensions of freedom in choosing a -blade, of which one dimension is an overall scaling multiplier.For Grassmannians (including the result about dimension) a good book is: . The proof of the dimensionality is actually straightforward. Take vectors and wedge them together v_1wedgecdotswedge v_k and perform elementary column operations on these (factoring the pivots out) until the top block are elementary basis vectors of mathbb{F}^k. The wedge product is then parametrized by the product of the pivots and the lower block. For an -dimensional space, there are blades of all grades from 0 to inclusive. A vector subspace of finite dimension may be represented by the -blade formed as a wedge product of all the elements of a basis for that subspace. Examples For example, in 2-dimensional space scalars are described as 0-blades, vectors are 1-blades, and area elements are 2-blades known as pseudoscalars, in that they are elements of a one-dimensional space distinct from regular scalars. In three-dimensional space, 0-blades are again scalars and 1-blades are three-dimensional vectors, and 2-blades are oriented area elements. 3-blades represent volume elements and in three-dimensional space; these are scalar-like‚Äîi.e., 3-blades in three-dimensions form a one- dimensional vector space.

Sikhs historically celebrated Diwali along with Hindus, with Guru Amar Das explicitly listing it along with Vaisakhi as a festival for Sikhs., Quote: \\"Since the time of Guru Amar Das it has been customary for Sikhs to assemble before their Guru on three of the most important Hindu festival occasions - Vaisakhi, Divali and Maha Shivaratri\\". In the late 20th century, Sikh religious leaders increasingly called Diwali as Bandi Chhor Divas, and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee adopted this name along with the Nanakshahi calendar in 2003 by the executive committee under President Prof. Kirpal Singh Badungar the then president of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. The Hindu festival of Diwali whose significance is based on the ancient event and scriptures of Hinduism, Bandi Chhor Divas celebrates a Sikh historic event related to the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind. According to Sikh history, on this day, Guru Hargobind was released from prison by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir who freed 52 other Hindu kings with him.Phyllis G. Jestice, Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed by Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair The Bandi Chhor Divas is celebrated in a manner similar to Diwali, with the lighting of homes and Gurdwaras, feasts, gift giving and family time. It is an important Sikh celebration along with Vaisakhi, Maghi, Holi with Hola Mohalla and Gurpurab.Glimpses of Sikhism By Major Nahar Singh Jawandha  Description In addition to Nagar keertan (a street procession) and an Akhand paath (a continuous reading of Guru Granth Sahib), Bandi Chhor (Shodh) Divas is celebrated with a fireworks display. The Shri Harmandir Sahib, as well as the whole complex, is festooned with thousands of shimmering lights. The temple organizes continuous kirtan singing and special musicians. Sikhs consider this occasion as an important time to visit Gurdwaras and spend time with their families.  History and significance  Guru Hargobind's father Guru Arjan was arrested under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and he was asked to convert to Islam. He refused, was tortured and executed in 1606 CE. This event is remembered as a defining moment in Sikh history and as the martyrdom of Guru Arjan.Louis E. Fenech, Martyrdom in the Sikh Tradition, Oxford University Press, pp. 118-121 After the execution, Guru Hargobind succeeded his father as the next Guru of Sikhism.Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, Journal of Philosophical Society, 12(1), pages 29-62 Guru Hargobind, on 24 June 1606, at age 11, was crowned as the sixth Sikh Guru.Louis E. Fenech, Martyrdom in the Sikh Tradition, Oxford University Press, pages 118-121HS Singha (2009), Sikh Studies, Book 7, Hemkunt Press, , pages 18-19 At his succession ceremony, he put on two swords: one indicated his spiritual authority (piri) and the other, his temporal authority (miri).HS Syan (2013), Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century, IB Tauris, , pages 48-55 Because of the execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, Guru Hargobind from the very start was a dedicated enemy of the Mughal rule. He advised Sikhs to arm and fight. The death of his father at the hands of Jahangir prompted him to emphasise the military dimension of the Sikh community. Jahangir responded by jailing the 14 year old Guru Hargobind at Gwalior Fort in 1609, on the pretext that the fine imposed on Guru Arjan had not been paid by the Sikhs and Guru Hargobind. It is not clear as to how much time he spent as a prisoner. The year of his release appears to have been either 1611 or 1612, when Guru Hargobind was about 16 years old. Persian records, such as Dabistan i Mazahib suggest he was kept in jail for twelve years, including over 1617-1619 in Gwalior, after which he and his camp were kept under Muslim army's surveillance by Jahangir. According to Sikh tradition, Guru Hargobind was released from the bondage of prison on Diwali. This important event in Sikh history is now termed the Bandi Chhor Divas festival.

A Jordanian and Iraqi citizen of Palestinian origin, he served 16 years for plotting to attack New York City in 1973, placing three self-manufactured bombs in cars which failed to detonate.  Black September  Al-Jawary has been tied to a letter-bombing campaign conducted by the Black September militant group that targeted world leaders during the 1970s and a failed attack in 1979. He has also been accused of involvement in the bombing of TWA Flight 841 in 1974.  New York City bomb plot  In 1973, Al-Jawary manufactured powerful explosives and left them in three rental cars near Israeli targets throughout New York City. He targeted two Israeli banks on Fifth Avenue and the El-Al cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The explosions were intended to occur on March 4 to coincide with a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. The bombs failed to detonate, but the construction and materials used allowed the FBI to link the explosives to the Black September letter-bombs and to Al-Jawary. Investigators matched 60 fingerprints from evidence with Al-Jawary's.  1980 assassination attempt  On October 25, 1980 an unidentified assailant launched a rocket at the automobile of Abu Walid al-Iraqi while in Beirut, Lebanon. Although two aides suffered injuries, Abu Walid escaped the attack unharmed. The Voice of Palestine, a PLO-supported radio station, blamed the attack on the Mossad, although a rival Palestinian militant group may have attempted the attack. The same radio report indicated that he was head of the technical division of the Unified Security Organization, where he worked closely with Salah Khalaf, or Abu Iyad, for many years.  Capture and release  In January 1991 he flew from Iraq to attend the funeral of Abu Iyad in Tunis. He was detained en route in Rome for use of a false Jordanian passport. A few months later Italian authorities handed over custody to the FBI, who flew Al-Jawary to stand trial in Brooklyn. In 1993, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2000, Al- Jawary claimed in a sworn statement to U.S. immigration officials that he was a member of the PLO and of Hamas. Al-Jawary was released on February 19, 2009, having served 16 years of his term, and was handed over to US immigration officials pending deportation. On February 26, Al-Jawary was escorted from the United States, arriving in Sudan on March 3 after having been denied asylum in Jordan and Algeria.

The Culture of Virginia refers to the distinct human activities and values that take place in, or originate from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Virginia's historic culture was popularized and spread across America by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, and their homes represent Virginia as the birthplace of America. Modern Virginia culture has many heritages, and is largely part of the culture of the Southern United States. Regional aspects Map of nine Virginia cultural regions The Smithsonian Institution divides Virginia into nine cultural regions. *Eastern Shore *Hampton Roads *Chesapeake Bay *Northern Virginia *Central Virginia *Southern Virginia *Shenandoah Valley *Blue Ridge Highlands *Heart of Appalachia Language English was passed as the commonwealth's official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996, though the status is not mandated by the Constitution of Virginia. English is the only language spoken by , though it is spoken very well by an additional 570,638 (7.9%) for a total of 94.6% of the Commonwealth which speaks English. Spanish has the most speakers of other languages, with 424,381 (5.9%). Asian and Pacific Islander languages, including Vietnamese and Filipino. The Piedmont region is one of the most famous for its dialect's strong influence on Southern American English. Various accents are also present including the Tidewater accent and the anachronistic Elizabethan of Tangier Island, as well as a more homogenized American English in urban areas with a great deal of transplants. Cuisine The vineyard at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home did not produce wine until the late 20th century. Besides the general cuisine of the Southern United States, Virginia maintains its own particular traditions. Smithfield ham, sometimes called Virginia ham, is a type of country ham which is protected by state law, and can only be produced in the town of Smithfield. Barbecue in Virginia is similar to barbecue in North Carolina. It is mostly pork with a vinegar-based sauce, ranging from almost all vinegar in the east spiced with red pepper flakes, to a vinegar-based sauce that has some tomato and a bit of sweetness to it the further west one goes. Marble cake originated in Rockingham County, Virginia from a Mennonite community. Shoofly pie is popular in the Shenandoah Valley and was brought to that area from the Pennsylvania Dutch. Fried peaches, cut in half and simmered in butter with brown sugar melted in their hollows, and served with vanilla ice cream, is a more upscale dessert found in Virginia. Sausage, both link and patties, and usually flavored with sage, constitutes an important aspect to a traditional Virginian breakfast. Virginia is also well known for its peanuts which are prepared by either roasting or boiling them. A traditional Virginian dish is peanut soup which has been present in the cuisine since the colonial era. Historically, Greengage plums were common in Virginian cuisine, but their cultivation has been in decline since the eighteenth century, although it can still be found in Virginia occasionally. Instead Damson plums are more often found in Virginian cuisine. It is often used in jams, jellies, preserves, and desserts. Brunswick stew is a traditional and common dish in Virginia, a type of thick vegetable stew with meat. The traditional meat was the Appalachian flying squirrel, but this has since become endangered and chicken and rabbit are often used in current times. Virginians insist that this stew, common in most parts of the south, was invented in Brunswick County, Virginia, whereas Georgians insist it was Brunswick, Georgia.Brunswick County, Virginia website New Georgia Encyclopedia In the Western half, apples are important to the local cuisine, especially for apple butter and cider. Winesap apples are commonly grown and used in Virginia, whereas in most other American locales they have fallen out of favor. Seafood is important to the coastal areas, such as oysters, blue crabs, bay clams, blue fish, bay scallops, haddock, shad, and shad roe in the Spring. Blue crabs are prepared in many ways such as crab cakes, crab imperial, soft-shelled in season, or simply plain crab meat that is picked from its shell and dipped in melted butter. Oyster and spinach soup is a traditional New Year's Eve dish in Virginia, although currently in decline. A common seasoning for seafood is Old Bay spice mix, which is based on traditional spices historically used in the Chesapeake region. Black walnuts also have a place in the traditional cuisine, often used in desserts. Virginia wine is made in many parts of the state. As of 2007, the state has under cultivation, an increase of 14% over the prior year. 5,600 tons were harvested in 2007, a 10% decline from 2006, the majority of which was Vinifera. The entire year's crop was valued at $7,800,000. The state ranks eighth in the nation for both bearing acreage and grape production. There are six subregions in Virginia: Monticello AVA, North Fork of Roanoke AVA, Northern Neck George Washington Birthplace AVA, Rocky Knob AVA, Shenandoah Valley AVA, Virginia's Eastern Shore AVA. Traditional Virginian Christmas dinners vary but usually consist of either a Christmas ham or roast beef as the center of the meal. A common dinner is roast beef with yorkshire pudding. Arts=Fine arts= The Science Museum of Virginia is one of the popular museums in Richmond, Virginia. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities works to improve commonwealth's civic, cultural, and intellectual life. The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is a state-funded museum with the largest collection of Faberg√© eggs outside of Russia. The Chrysler Museum of Art is home to many pieces, stemming from the Chrysler family collection, including the final sculpture of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. There are regional museums as well, such as the southwestern Virginia Piedmont Arts Association of the visual and performing arts in Martinsville, Virginia, and the Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia, both of which also support local art history and artists. Other museums include the popular Science Museum of Virginia, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum, the Frontier Culture Museum, the Virginia Museum of Natural History and the Mariners' Museum. Besides these sites, many open-air museums and battlefields are located in the state, such as Historic Jamestowne, Colonial Williamsburg, Richmond National Battlefield, Manassas National Battlefield Park, Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. =Music and performance art= The Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, opened in 1933. Virginia has launched many award-winning traditional music artists as well as internationally successful popular music acts. Ralph Stanley, Patsy Cline, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family are award winning Bluegrass and Country music musicians from Virginia, and Ella Fitzgerald and Pearl Bailey were both from Newport News. Hip hop and Rhythm and blues acts like Missy Elliott, Timbaland, The Neptunes, Chris Brown, and Clipse hail from the commonwealth. The Neptunes produced 43% of all songs on American radio in 2003. Singer-songwriters from Virginia include Jason Mraz and jam bands like Bruce Hornsby, Keller Williams, and Dave Matthews Band, who continue their strong charitable connection to Charlottesville, Virginia. Influential stage-rock group GWAR also began at Virginia Commonwealth University. Notable performance venues include The Birchmere, Jiffy Lube Live, the Norva Theatre, the Patriot Center, and the Verizon Wireless Virginia Beach Amphitheater. Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts is located in Vienna and is the only national park intended for use as a performing arts center. Wolf Trap hosts the Wolf Trap Opera Company, which produces an opera festival every summer. The Harrison Opera House in Norfolk is home to the official Virginia Opera. The Virginia Symphony Orchestra is based in Hampton Roads. The American Shakespeare Center is located in Staunton, and home to resident and touring theater troupes. Other notable theaters include the Ferguson Center for the Arts, the Barter Theatre, and the Landmark Theater. Richmond's Theatre IV, The Children's Theatre of Virginia, ranks as the second largest children's theatre in the nation. The company tours to elementary schools around the country while producing lavish main stage productions at the historic Empire Theatre. Virginia is also home to Barksdale Theatre, the nation's first dinner theatre. Barksdale still operates both at The Shops at Willow Lawn in Richmond, as well as the historic Hanover Tavern in Hanover. Academy Award winners Warren Beatty, Sandra Bullock, Shirley MacLaine, and George C. Scott hail from the state, as does Wanda Sykes. =Literature= Literature in Virginia often deals with the state's extensive, and sometimes troubled, past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities and the role of women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate, currently Ron Smith, whose term began on July 1, 2014. =Architecture= Virginia furniture and architecture are typical of American colonial architecture. Thomas Jefferson and many of the state's early leaders favored the Neoclassical architecture style, leading to its use for important state buildings. The Pennsylvania Dutch and their style can also be found in parts of the state. Festivals Celebrate Fairfax! is one of many county sponsored events across Virginia. Many counties and localities host county fairs and festivals. The State Fair of Virginia was held at the Richmond International Raceway every September until the 2008. The fair is now held at the Meadow Event Park in Doswell, Virginia. The September Neptune Festival in Virginia Beach celebrates the city, the waterfront, and regional artists. Norfolk's Harborfest, in June, features boat racing and air shows. Fairfax County also sponsors Celebrate Fairfax! with popular and traditional music performances. The Virginia Lake Festival is held during the third weekend in July in Clarksville. In Amherst they celebrate Uncle Billy's Day . Other food festivals are held around the state. On the Eastern Shore island of Chincoteague the annual Pony Swim & Auction of feral Chincoteague ponies at the end of July is a unique local tradition expanded into a week-long carnival. The Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival is a six-day festival held annually in Winchester that includes parades and bluegrass concerts. From 2005 to 2007, Richmond was host of the National Folk Festival. The Northern Virginia Fine Arts Festival is held on a May weekend in Reston. Two important film festivals, the Virginia Film Festival and the VCU French Film Festival, are held annually in Charlottesville and Richmond, respectively. Annual fan conventions in the commonwealth include Anime USA, the national anime convention held in Crystal City, Anime Mid-Atlantic held in various cities, and Magfest music and gaming festival. The Old Time Fiddlers' Convention in Galax, begun in 1935, is one of the oldest and largest such events worldwide.

The screenplay by Jane Murfin is based on a play by Lucia Bronder. Plot When stage actress Judy Carroll testifies on behalf of her former lover, accused embezzler Al Howard, she loses custody of Elizabeth, an orphan she had planned to adopt. Her devoted manager Antonie \\"Tony\\" de Sola urges her to travel to Europe with her alcoholic mother Snooks to alleviate her emotional pain. While there she reads a play entitled Rockabye, which eerily resembles recent events in her life. Despite Tony's qualms, she is determined to star in a Broadway production. Playwright Jacob Van Riker Pell is certain the sophisticated Judy will be unable to portray convincingly his heroine, a tough girl from Second Avenue, until she confesses she was raised there herself. The two hit it off and Judy convinces Tony to produce the play. On the verge of divorce, Jake proposes he and Judy wed as soon as he is free. Jake fails to appear at the opening night party for Rockabye, and his mother tells Judy her daughter-in- law has just had a baby and asks her to forget her son. When Jake finally arrives and assures her he still wants to marry her, Judy insists he return to his wife and newborn child. Devastated, she is comforted by Tony, who finally reveals his feelings for her.

Anxious to accommodate exhibitors who were awaiting a new Constance Bennett film, the studio rushed the script into production with Phillips Holmes as the male lead. When the completed film was shown to executives, they declared it unreleasable and called in George Cukor to salvage it. The new director replaced Holmes with Joel McCrea and Laura Hope Crews, in the role of Judy's mother, with Jobyna Howland, reshot all their characters' scenes, and re-edited the balance of the film. Critical reception The New York Times observed, \\"There are tears enough in Rockabye to drown a plot, a circumstance which is a form of mercy in the case of this particular plot . . . As for the performance of Miss Bennett, a conservative opinion would be that she is a better actress than Rockabye makes her seem . . . Joel McCrea as the young playwright is better than the lines he has to recite.\\" ReferencesExternal links 1932 films 1932 romantic drama films American films American black-and-white films American romantic drama films English- language films Films about actors Films about adoption American films based on plays Films directed by George Cukor Films made before the MPAA Production Code Films produced by David O.

The company was founded by CEO Manoj Bhargava and launched in 2004. Ingredients The official website lists the active ingredients of 5-hour Energy as: vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12, sodium, taurine, glucuronolactone, malic acid and N-Acetyl L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, caffeine, and citicoline. The product is not U.S Food and Drug Administration approved. It contains no sugar, instead providing the stimulant caffeine and the psychoactive dopamine precursor amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. According to an article in Consumer Reports, 5-hour Energy should be avoided by children under the age of 12 and as well as nursing or pregnant women. History In 2004 Manoj Bhargava's company, Living Essentials LLC, launched a product called \\"5-Hour Energy\\". By 2012, retail sales had grown to an estimated $1 billion. A March 2011 article in Consumer Reports reported that, according to a lab test, a 5-Hour Energy contained 207 milligrams of caffeine, slightly more than an serving of Starbucks coffee which contains 180 mg of caffeine. (It is not clear whether the \\"Original\\" or \\"Extra Strength\\" product was tested.) The directions on the 5-Hour bottle recommend taking half of the contents (103 mg of caffeine) for regular use, and the whole bottle for extra energy. A regular cup of coffee has less than 100 mg/250 ml cup. In 2012, Forbes magazine commissioned an independent lab to analyze the contents within full bottles of 5-Hour Energy. The findings showed that the regular strength 5-Hour Energy contained 157 mg of caffeine, whereas the Extra Strength version had a caffeine content of 206 mg. In December 2012, Consumer Reports published an article on 27 energy drinks including 5-hour Energy, which compared the caffeine content of the 27 drinks. Caffeine levels in 5-hour Energy are: Decaf (6 mg), Original (215 mg), and Extra Strength (242 mg). The publication also reviewed a double blind study and reported that \\"5-Hour Energy will probably chase away grogginess at least as well as a cup of coffee\\" and that \\"little if any research\\" indicated that amino acids and B vitamins would result in a difference in energy level. Legal issues A lawsuit against Living Essentials was filed in 2010, alleging health hazards and deceptive labeling. The case was voluntarily dismissed in December 2011. In 2012, the media reported that the FDA was investigating allegations that Bhargava's 5-Hour Energy product was \\"potentially linked\\" to the deaths of 20 of its consumers. A 2014 article in The New York Times article reported that 5-hour Energy was lobbying state attorneys general in 30 states after being investigated for deceptive advertising. The New York Times report also revealed the company made contributions totaling $280,000 to the political funds of state attorneys general \\"after the investigation into false claims and deceptive marketing [...] opened in January 2013.\\" A 2015 report by the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) said that the attorney general offices in five US states had filed cases against Living Essentials for \\"deceptive marketing practices\\" and that additional class-action lawsuits were pending in seven states. In 2016 it won a $22 million lawsuit against Stacker 2 stating that \\"6-Hour Power\\" was too similar to its \\"5-Hour Energy\\" trademark. Living Essentials was found liable for deceptive practices under the Consumer Protection Act in Washington state in 2017. The court ordered the company to pay $4.3 million. The violations included stating that doctors recommended the product, that the product was superior to coffee, and that the decaffeinated product provided long lasting energy and alertness. The companies' communications director, Melissa Skabich, said they will appeal. \\"Unlike the two other courts that found in our favor, this court did not follow the law. We intend to vigorously pursue our right to appeal, and correct the trial court‚Äôs incorrect application of the law,\\" she said. In 2018 a suit was filed against Living Essentials, under the claim that it offered Costco preferential pricing, discounts, and rebates. However, in October 2019 a California federal jury found that Living Essentials did not violate federal antitrust law by selling its 5-Hour Energy product to Costco for a lower price than the one charged to its competitors.

Sep 02, 1982) Background Voluntary manslaughter is a form of homicide where a defendant's culpability is mitigated by an \\"adequate provocation\\", thereby resulting in a lesser sentence than a murder charge. Traditionally, at common law, manslaughter was limited to certain categories of actions, but by the time the Berry case was decided in 1976 the categorical approach had been broadened to include verbal provocation, and the court notes in the decision that \\"no specific type of provocation is required\\" and \\"verbal provocation may be sufficient.\\" Although Berry did not change the law of manslaughter at the time, instead applying a previous precedent Borchers, it is taught in most first-year law courses as an example of how the doctrine of provocation developed and moved away from the \\"no cooling period\\" requirement that had traditionally been a requirement for manslaughter.  Facts  Albert Joseph Berry was charged with murdering his wife, Rachel Pessah. The couple married in May 1974; Ms. Pessah was 26 years younger than Berry, and a recent immigrant from Israel. Three days after their wedding Rachel left for Israel, where she stayed for six weeks. Upon her return, she told her husband, Berry, that she had fallen in love with a man named Yako. The court summarized the facts leading up to Rachel's killing as \\"a tormenting two weeks in which Rachel alternately taunted defendant with her involvement with Yako and at the same time sexually excited defendant\\".People v. Berry , 18 Cal.3d 509 The crime was committed two weeks after Rachel first admitted the infidelity to her husband. Between Rachel's admission and the homicide, Berry had left the apartment and spent time with friends. When he returned to the apartment, Rachel wasn't home. Rachel returned home the next morning, on July 26, 1974. When Berry tried to talk to Rachel, she started screaming, and that was when he strangled her with a telephone cord. Police arrested Albert Joseph Berry for her murder on August 1, 1974. Procedural history The defendant was charged under ¬ß 187 of the California Penal Code. He was convicted of first degree murder by a jury. This defense appealed the murder conviction on the grounds that the trial court failure to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter was a reversible error. The defense claimed that a voluntary manslaughter instruction should have been given for both heat of passion and diminished capacity. The appeals court granted an appeal only for the heat of passion claim. Issue The issue decided in the case was whether taunts and provocation over a period of time could be adequate provocation for heat of passion manslaughter.  Appellate court's decision  The court reversed the first-degree murder conviction, explaining that the question of whether the defendant had acted under the heat of passion should have properly been resolved by the jury. Relying on a previous case People v. Borchers the court wrote that \\"evidence of admissions of infidelity by the defendant's paramour, taunts directed to him and other conduct, 'supports a finding that the defendant killed in wild desperation induced by (the woman's) long, continued provocatory conduct'. Prosecutors argued that manslaughter was not applicable because there had been a \\"cooling period\\" between the initial admission and the homicide, but the court rejected the argument writing that \\"the long course of provocatory conduct...reached its final culmination in the apartment when Rachel began screaming\\". Wayne LaFave has described this as rekindling an earlier passion, writing that the Court found that Pessah's screaming was \\"sufficient to rekindle passion regarding her earlier confession of adultery\\". A prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Blinder, had testified at trial that the victim was suicidal and that her taunting of Berry was an attempt to provoke him into killing her. He also testified that the long course of psychological torment she inflicted on Berry would have produced the same type of blind, uncontrollable rage traditionally associated with \\"heat of passion\\" defenses.  Other information  The lead prosecutor in this case was Evelle J. Younger. The defense attorney on appeal was Edward W. Suman. Transcripts of testimonies from the trial, which have been reviewed by law professor Donna Coker contain additional facts that the California Supreme Court did not include in their decision. The defendant, Berry, had a history of intimate violence and before his marriage to Pessah, had stabbed his second wife eleven times after she called out another man's name during sex. Berry had also admitted to police that he \\"deliberately waited to kill [Rachel]. No pretense, no bullshit, no nothing.\\" Two years passed before the California Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. Berry's trial attorney, public defender Geoffrey Brown had obtained Pessah's hospital records for psychiatric treatment she had received after a previous incident where Berry had strangled. The records provided details about Pessah's relationship with Yacob, and supported Dr. Blinder's testimony about Rachel's depression. The defense accepted a plea agreement for second degree murder, which carried a minimum 5 year sentence.

This species is known from a single fossil specimen consisting of a partial skeleton including vertebra, ribs, hips, and upper legs. The specimen (museum catalog number IVPP V9934) was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation near the city of Chaoyang in Liaoning province, China. This rock formation has been dated to the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous period, 120 million years ago. Description C. beishanensis, known only from a single partial skeleton, is relatively poorly known compared to other primitive euornitheans. Chaoyangia were small, basal euornithean birds characterized by more than eight fused sacral vertebrae (those connected to the hips), uniquely long, slender, and angled uncinate processes on the ribs, and a distinct 'neck' in the upper leg bone (femur). Overall, the known skeleton is very similar to another primitive Chinese euornithean bird, Zhongjianornis, which is known from a much more complete skeleton. History and classification C. beishanensis was among the first fossil bird species found in the Jehol biota of China. At the time of its discovery, it was seen as being quite distinct from all other known birds at the time.O'Connor, J.K. and Zhou Z. (2012). \\"A redescription of Chaoyangia beishanensis (Aves) and a comprehensive phylogeny of Mesozoic birds.\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, (advance online publication). When additional specimens were found and referred to the species in 1997, it was regarded as a member of the Ornithurae (=Euornithes), the lineage including modern birds but not enantiornitheans. Hou, who recognized the species as a euornithean, also placed it in its own order, Chaoyangiformes.Hou L. (1997). Mesozoic birds of China. Taiwan Provincial Feng Huang Ku Bird Park, Taiwan. The additional fossil specimens referred to Chaoyangia, one a partial skeleton including partial wing bones and a partial skull, and the other an isolated foot, did not contain any bones in common with the original specimen, and so it was impossible to determine whether or not they actually belonged to the same genus. The more complete specimen including the partial skull was later classified in its own genus, Songlingornis. The removal of this specimen from Chaoyangia left its identity uncertain, and some researchers continued to suspect Songlingornis and Chaoyangia were synonyms. In 2012, paleontologists Jingmai O'Connor and Zhou Zhong re-described the original Chaoyangia specimen, and confirmed that it was indeed a primitive euornithean (=ornithuran) using a phylogenetic analysis.

Owned by the automotive distribution company Autolink, Cargolink has operated both autorack and container trains since November 2008. Cargolink has a fleet of ten diesel locomotives, five shunters, 100 autoracks and 60 container cars. Combined autorack and container trains are operated up to five times per week along the S√∏rland-, Bergen-, Rauma-, R√∏ros- and Nordland Lines, as well as services through Sweden. Autolink, the largest distributor of automobiles in Norway, has traditionally bought train services from CargoNet. In 2007, they signed a contract with Ofotbanen, and at the same time bought 40% of the company. However, Ofotbanen was in financial difficulties, causing a dispute between the two owners. The result was that Autolink formally established Cargolink in March 2008, without the knowledge of Ofotbanen, and terminated the contract with Ofotbanen in July. Cargolink received an operating licence in September and service started in November.  Operation  Cargolink has taken over five shunters from Ofotbanen Cargolink has a fleet of five shunters at their port in Drammen, in addition to three Di 6 diesel locomotives and three TRAXX electric locomotives for main haulage. While the shunters are owned by Cargolink, the diesel locomotives are leased from Dispolok of Germany and the electric locomotives are leased from Hector Rail. It also has more than 100 closed autoracks for automobile transport, and 60 container cars. 70 new autoracks are under delivery from Sweden. On contract from Autolink, Cargolink operates autorack trains throughout large portions of the Norwegian railway network, from the seaports in Drammen and Oslo. Services are provided along the S√∏rland Line to Stavanger, along the Bergen Line to Bergen, along the Dovre Line to Trondheim, along the Rauma Line to √Öndalsnes, and along the Nordland Line to Mosj√∏en, Mo i Rana and Bod√∏. It also operates through Sweden to reach Narvik and Malm√∂ Each route has up to five weekly departures in both directions with combined autorack and container trains. The company transports 55,000 cars annually on 600 trains, giving a revenue of . Autolink is responsible for about three-quarters of all new-car distribution in the country. On the weekly return trips from Northern Norway, Cargolink uses the empty cars to transport aluminum from Elkem Mosj√∏en.  History = Autolink and Ofotbanen = Autolink has traditionally owned a large pool of autoracks. These have been operated by the Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, and at the same time signed a haulage contract with them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. Di 6 at Domb√•s Station on the Dovre Line Ofotbanen have since their establishment had financial difficulties. The contract with Autolink had helped, but in July 2008, Autolink canceled their contract with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink announced that they would establish their own railway company, which they had been working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because the majority owner‚ÄîRail Management, in turn owned by Mons Bolin‚Äîwould not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink. From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions. The matter ended in court, with a case to determine whether Autolink should be allowed to take control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal in regard to the contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. There was agreement that Autolink, on 13 February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK 12 million, of which NOK 9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt. Cargolink autorack train on the Dovre Line Ofotbanen lost their license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7 October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not documented necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity. On 24 October, the company was declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. = Establishment = Work on establishing the new company was initiated by Autolink in March 2008, with the company formally established on 27 March. It received an operating license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 18 September 2008. Five shunters that were operated by Ofotbanen, but owned by Autolink, were transferred to Cargolink. In addition, ten Di 6 diesel locomotives have been leased from Vossloh, with options for later purchase. Operations started on 2 November, with 22 engineers based in Drammen. Since the company has an all- diesel fleet, management is working to reroute trains to Trondheim and Northern Norway along the R√∏ros Line instead of the Dovre Line. CargoNet and Ofotbanen had been using the Dovre Line because it is electrified, giving lower operating costs despite its elevation, higher than the R√∏ros Line. After initial trial runs with only three locomotives, full service was introduced later in November.

It can be constructed as the tensor product of graphs, G √ó K2. It is also called the Kronecker double cover, canonical double cover or simply the bipartite double of G. It should not be confused with a cycle double cover of a graph, a family of cycles that includes each edge twice. In a connected graph that is not bipartite, only one double cover is bipartite, but when the graph is bipartite or disconnected there may be more than one. For this reason, Toma≈æ Pisanski has argued that the name \\"bipartite double cover\\" should be deprecated in favor of the \\"canonical double cover\\" or \\"Kronecker cover\\" names, which are unambiguous. Construction The bipartite double cover of G has two vertices ui and wi for each vertex vi of G. Two vertices ui and wj are connected by an edge in the double cover if and only if vi and vj are connected by an edge in G. For instance, below is an illustration of a bipartite double cover of a non-bipartite graph G. In the illustration, each vertex in the tensor product is shown using a color from the first term of the product (G) and a shape from the second term of the product (K2); therefore, the vertices ui in the double cover are shown as circles while the vertices wi are shown as squares. :Image:Covering-graph-2.svg The bipartite double cover may also be constructed using adjacency matrices (as described below) or as the derived graph of a voltage graph in which each edge of G is labeled by the nonzero element of the two-element group. Examples The bipartite double cover of the Petersen graph is the Desargues graph: K2 √ó G(5,2) = G(10,3). The bipartite double cover of a complete graph Kn is a crown graph (a complete bipartite graph Kn,n minus a perfect matching). In particular, the bipartite double cover of the graph of a tetrahedron, K4, is the graph of a cube. The bipartite double cover of an odd-length cycle graph is a cycle of twice the length, while the bipartite double of any bipartite graph (such as an even length cycle, shown in the following example) is formed by two disjoint copies of the original graph. :Image:Covering-graph-1.svg Matrix interpretation If an undirected graph G has a matrix A as its adjacency matrix, then the adjacency matrix of the double cover of G is :left[begin{matrix}0&A;A^T&0end{matrix}right], and the biadjacency matrix of the double cover of G is just A itself. That is, the conversion from a graph to its double cover can be performed simply by reinterpreting A as a biadjacency matrix instead of as an adjacency matrix. More generally, the reinterpretation the adjacency matrices of directed graphs as biadjacency matrices provides a combinatorial equivalence between directed graphs and balanced bipartite graphs.; . Properties The bipartite double cover of any graph G is a bipartite graph; both parts of the bipartite graph have one vertex for each vertex of G. A bipartite double cover is connected if and only if G is connected and non-bipartite., Theorem 3.4. The bipartite double cover is a special case of a double cover (a 2-fold covering graph). A double cover in graph theory can be viewed as a special case of a topological double cover. If G is a non-bipartite symmetric graph, the double cover of G is also a symmetric graph; several known cubic symmetric graphs may be obtained in this way. For instance, the double cover of K4 is the graph of a cube; the double cover of the Petersen graph is the Desargues graph; and the double cover of the graph of the dodecahedron is a 40-vertex symmetric cubic graph.. It is possible for two different graphs to have isomorphic bipartite double covers. For instance, the Desargues graph is not only the bipartite double cover of the Petersen graph, but is also the bipartite double cover of a different graph that is not isomorphic to the Petersen graph.. Not every bipartite graph is a bipartite double cover of another graph; for a bipartite graph G to be the bipartite cover of another graph, it is necessary and sufficient that the automorphisms of G include an involution that maps each vertex to a distinct and non-adjacent vertex. For instance, the graph with two vertices and one edge is bipartite but is not a bipartite double cover, because it has no non-adjacent pairs of vertices to be mapped to each other by such an involution; on the other hand, the graph of the cube is a bipartite double cover, and has an involution that maps each vertex to the diametrally opposite vertex. An alternative characterization of the bipartite graphs that may be formed by the bipartite double cover construction was obtained by . Other double covers In general, a graph may have multiple double covers that are different from the bipartite double cover.. In the following figure, the graph C is a double cover of the graph H: # The graph C is a covering graph of H: there is a surjective local isomorphism f from C to H, the one indicated by the colours. For example, f maps both blue nodes in C to the blue node in H. Furthermore, let X be the neighbourhood of a blue node in C and let Y be the neighbourhood of the blue node in H; then the restriction of f to X is a bijection from X to Y. In particular, the degree of each blue node is the same. The same applies to each colour. # The graph C is a double cover (or 2-fold cover or 2-lift) of H: the preimage of each node in H has size 2. For example, there are exactly 2 nodes in C that are mapped to the blue node in H. However, C is not a bipartite double cover of H or any other graph; it is not a bipartite graph. If we replace one triangle by a square in H the resulting graph has four distinct double covers. Two of them are bipartite but only one of them is the Kronecker cover. :Image:Covering-graph-4.svg As another example, the graph of the icosahedron is a double cover of the complete graph K6; to obtain a covering map from the icosahedron to K6, map each pair of opposite vertices of the icosahedron to a single vertex of K6. However, the icosahedron is not bipartite, so it is not the bipartite double cover of K6. Instead, it can be obtained as the orientable double cover of an embedding of K6 on the projective plane.

The company produced the Jackson from 1903 to 1923, as well as the 1903 Jaxon steam car and the 1904 Orlo. Company background 1905 Jackson Model C The three main partners in the 1902 incorporation of the Jackson Automobile Company were Byron J. Carter, George A. Matthews and Charles Lewis. Carter had previously been a steam-driven press printer who later started a bicycle shop with his father, Squire B. Carter, in 1894. He built his first experimental, gasoline-powered car in 1899, and then used his steam experience to build a steam-powered car which became the Carter in 1901. Matthews owned the local Fuller Buggy Company and later built the Fuller automobile, also in Jackson, before it was absorbed by the Jackson Automobile Company. Both Matthews and Lewis were directors of Jackson banks, Matthews of Jackson City Bank and Lewis of Union Bank of Jackson. Carter convinced the two bankers to support him in forming a company to produce both gasoline- and steam-powered cars. Jackson Full production started in 1903 with a single-cylinder engine car that closely resembled the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. The cylinder count in the engines doubled the next year, and doubled again in 1906. Not long after full production started, Carter left the firm to create the Cartercar. He left due to a disagreement with his partners, who did not wish to use the friction drive transmission he had developed. After Carter left, Jackson automobiles lacked any distinct feature, but they were well-built and long-lasting.Kimes, Beverly Rae. Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1805-1942 (Iola, WI: Krause, 1996), p.775. In 1910, Matthews bought out Lewis, leaving him as the sole remaining partner. Lewis left to start the Hollier car. Matthews installed his sons in the president, secretary and treasurer positions within the company. The engines used by the company continued to grow, with a Northway six-cylinder engine becoming available in 1913, and a Ferro V8 available in 1916. Later cars resembled the contemporary Rolls-Royce. Indeed, the company used the phrase \\"The Car with the Keystone Radiator\\" in advertisements.Kimes, p.776. During World War I, car production at the firm declined by more than half, since the company was producing materiel for the war effort. For 1919, all production was geared to military supplies. Many Jackson dealers at this time converted to Jordan dealerships. When car production resumed in 1920, the cars apparently were not as good as previously. One assembly line worker said that the company engineer \\"should have raised chickens instead\\". The 1921 Princess Coupe was a hit at the Chicago Auto Show, but obtaining credit was difficult during that year's recession. In 1923, Jackson, Dixie Flyer and National merged into Associated Motor Industries. The Dixie Flyer and Jackson were transformed into the National 4-H and 6-51, respectively. These models lasted just a year and, by the end of 1924, Associated Motors was no more, taking all three marques with it. Jaxon 1903 Jaxon Steam Car Carter further developed his automobile, eventually patenting a 3-cylinder steam engine of 6 horsepower. This became the basis of the 1903 Jaxon automobile. All Jaxons were steam-powered, with the Jackson name reserved for the gasoline-powered cars. There were two models on offer: the $975 Model A riding on a 72\\" wheelbase, and the $800 Model B on a 7\\" shorter wheelbase. Advertisements proclaimed that \\"steam is reliable and easily understood\\".Kimes, p.781. Orlo The Orlo was built only in 1904. The Orlo was a five-seat side- entrance model that was equipped with a 16/17 hp two-cylinder engine. The engine was located under the front seat and the drive was through a chain drive. The engine was water-cooled by a finned-coil mounted beneath the front of the bonnet. The Orlo cost $1,125. Duck There is some debate over whether this is actually a different marque of automobile produced by the company or just a Jackson model. It was also referred to as the Jackson Back Seat Steer. This gives new meaning to the term \\"back seat driver\\" because this is the actual location of the steering controls. The company probably introduced the car to see if having a car with the passengers seated in the front seat would be a winning sales proposition. Since this car only was around in 1913, it is not likely that there were many purchasers for such an unusual car.G.N. Georgano, Nick.

Old Main is one of the oldest surviving educational structures in the western United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Designed by Phoenix architect James Miller Creighton, construction of Old Main began on October 27, 1887. The budget of $37,969 ran out before the roof was finished. When university officials discovered federal loans were available for agricultural schools, they renamed the building from the originally planned School of Mines to the School of Agriculture. Federal funding allowed completion of the building and it opened for the first class of the university on October 1, 1891. Old Main, then the only building on the campus, contained the classrooms, library, offices, and dorms. Six faculty taught 32 students in 1891.History of UofA In 1919, the Alexander Berger Memorial Fountain was constructed in front of Old Main. Berger funded the project as a memorial for 13 University of Arizona students who were killed in World War I, including his nephew. Completed for $5500, the fountain was dedicated on January 31, 1920 by General John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing. Due to neglect by the University, Old Main fell into disrepair and was condemned by the City of Tucson in 1938. Demolition was averted when the US Navy repaired the building in 1942, for use as a Naval Indoctrination Training School during World War II. The Navy then paid $20,000 in 1945 to turn it back into a functioning campus building. The first floor of Old Main was restored and renovated in 2008 at a cost of $4.6 million. It then housed the University's Office of Admissions, Center for Exploratory Students, and the Dean of Student's Office. In January 2013, renovation of the entire building began ‚Äî including a modernization of the interior spaces, replacing the roof, and framing the porch. It reopened before the 2014-15 academic year.

This myth stems from a US Army training film portraying the M3 as more accurate than its counterparts. The M3 was commonly referred to as the \\"Grease Gun\\" or simply \\"the Greaser\\", owing to its visual similarity to the mechanic's tool.Ingram, Mike: The MP40 Submachine Gun, p. 85. Zenith Imprint, 2001. The M3 was intended as a replacement for the Thompson, and began to enter front line service in mid 1944. Due to delays caused by production issues and approved specification changes, the M3 saw limited combat use in World War II. The M3A1 variant was used in the Korean War and later conflicts. History M3 in use in Brittany, France, August 1944 In 1941, the US Army Ordnance Board observed the effectiveness of submachine guns employed in Western Europe, particularly the German 9√ó19mm MP 40 and British Sten submachine gun and initiated a study to develop its own \\"Sten\\" type submachine gun in October 1942. The Ordnance Department requested the army submit a list of requirements for the new weapon, and Ordnance in turn received a separate list of requirements from both the infantry and cavalry branches for a shoulder fired weapon with full or semiautomatic fire capability in caliber .45 ACP or .30 Carbine. The two lists of requirements received by Ordnance were then reviewed and amended by officials at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG). The amended requirement called for an all metal weapon of sheet metal construction in .45 ACP, designed for fast and inexpensive production with a minimum of machining and featuring dual full automatic and semiautomatic fire, a heavy bolt to keep the cyclic rate under 500rpm and the ability to place 90% of shots fired from a standing position in full automatic mode on a 6x6 feet target at a range of 50 yards. The benchmark for testing the M3's performance would be the M1928A1 Thompson. George Hyde of General Motors's Inland Division was given the task of designing the new weapon, while Frederick Sampson, Inland Division's chief engineer, was responsible for preparing and organizing tooling for production. The original T15 specifications of 8 October 1942 were altered to remove a semi-automatic fire function, as well as to permit installation of a kit to convert the weapon's original .45 caliber to that of 9 mm Parabellum. The new designation for the 9 mm/.45 full-automatic-only weapon was the T20. Five prototype models of the .45 T20 and five 9 mm conversion kits were built by General Motors for testing. At the initial military trials, the T20 successfully completed its accuracy trials with a score of 97 out of 100. In the endurance test, the test weapon fired more than 5,000 rounds of brass-case ammunition, with only two failures to feed. Four army test boards composed of multiple army service branches independently tested and reviewed the T-20 prototype weapons including the Airborne Command, the Amphibious Warfare Board, the Infantry Board, and the Armored Forces Board. All four branches reported malfunctions caused by the M3 magazine, mostly attributed to defective or jammed magazine followers. The T20 was formally approved by U.S. Army Ordnance for production at GM's Guide Lamp Division in Anderson, Indiana, in December 1942 as the U.S. Submachine Gun, Caliber .45, M3. Guide Lamp produced 606,694 of the M3 variant submachine gun between 1943 and 1945. Although reports of malfunctions caused by the single-feed magazine design appeared during the initial firing trials, no changes were made to the M3 magazine. Around one thousand M3 submachine guns in caliber 9 mm Parabellum were built by Guide Lamp.Cadiou, Yves, and Richard, Alphonse, Modern Firearms, Secaucus, NJ:Chartwell Books, (1977), p. 210 These original 9 mm guns, identified by the markings U.S. 9 mm S.M.G. on the left side of the magazine well (without any model designation, such as M3), were delivered to the OSS in 1944. Additionally, Rock Island Arsenal and Buffalo Arms Corporation manufactured parts for a limited number of 9 mm conversion kits for the M3.Iannamico, pp. 122‚Äì123 Though 25,000 kits were originally requested for procurement, this was changed to a recommendation by the Ordnance Committee in December 1943 that only 500 9 mm conversion kits be obtained. Procurement was authorized in February 1944, but it is believed that only a limited number of kits were actually produced. These conversion kits included a new 9 mm barrel, replacement bolt and recoil springs, a magazine well adapter for use with British Sten gun 32-round magazines, and a replacement 9 mm Sten magazine of British manufacture. As the M3's sights were not altered for the new cartridge, the 9 mm M3 shot high at 100 yards, but the sighting error was deemed inconsequential. The OSS also requested approximately 1,000 .45-caliber M3 submachine guns with an integral sound suppressor (designed by Bell Laboratories). Specially drilled barrels and barrel nuts were manufactured by Guide Lamp, while the High Standard Firearms Company produced the internal components and assembled the weapon.Iannamico, pp. 106‚Äì107 The Bell Laboratories suppressor was estimated to be only 80% as efficient as the British suppressed STEN Mk IIS.Iannamico, p. 108 With its stamped, riveted, and welded construction, the M3 was originally designed as a minimum-cost small arm, to be used and discarded once it became inoperative.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 3002nd Ranger Battalion, World War II Living History Group, M3A1 Submachine Gun As such, replacement parts, weapon-specific tools, and sub-assemblies were not made available to unit-, depot-, or ordnance-level commands at the time of the M3's introduction to service.Dunlap. p. 3002nd Ranger Battalion, M3A1 Submachine Gun In 1944, a shortage of M3 submachine guns created by the need for interim production changes forced U.S. Army Ordnance workshops to fabricate pawl springs and other parts to keep existing weapons operational.2nd Ranger Battalion, World War II Living History Group, M3A1 Submachine Gun. Retrieved on September 19, 2008. Harrison, armed with M3 submachine gun in conversation with Capt. John E. Kent, Co. A, 117th Infantry Regiment somewhere in France, fall 1944. After its introduction to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early failure of the cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. An investigation revealed several deficiencies in the construction of the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end. In December 1944, in response to field requests for further improvements to the basic M3 design, an improved, simplified variant of the M3 was introduced, the M3A1. 15,469 M3A1 submachine guns were produced before the end of World War II, and 33,200 during the Korean War. It was originally hoped that the M3 could be produced in numbers sufficient to cancel future orders for the Thompson submachine gun, and to allow the army to gradually withdraw the more expensive Thompson from front-line service. However, due to unforeseen production delays and requests for modifications, the M3 was introduced later than expected, and purchases of the Thompson continued until February 1944. A total of 622,163 M3/M3A1 submachine guns of all types were assembled by the end of World War II. The M3A1 did not see combat in World War II, but was used in Korea and Vietnam. The M3 and M3A1 were largely withdrawn from U.S. frontline service beginning in 1959 and into the early 1960s, but continued to be used until the mid-1990s as on vehicle equipment aboard armored vehicles. During the mid 1970s tank drivers of the 1st Battalion 67th Armored attached to the 2nd Armored Division were issued the M3A1, because of its size and portability. During the Gulf War, drivers of the 19th Engineer Battalion attached to the 1st Armored Division were equipped with the M3A1 as part of their vehicle Basic Issue Items (or BII). It was also the initial submachine gun equipping the Delta Force who prized it for its impressively quiet performance when equipped with a silencer.Inside Delta Force; The Story of America's Elite Anti-terrorist Unit by Eric Haney page 130 Design details The M3 is an automatic, air-cooled blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt. Constructed of plain sheet steel, the M3 receiver was stamped in two halves that were then welded together. The M3 has a fixed firing pin milled into the face of the bolt and fires using the principle of advanced primer ignition blowback operation. The bolt was drilled longitudinally to support two parallel guide rods, upon which were mounted twin return (recoil) springs. This configuration allows for larger machining tolerances while providing operating clearance in the event of dust, sand or mud ingress.Ingram, 87 The M3 features a spring-loaded extractor which is housed inside the bolt head, while the ejector is located in the trigger group.TM9-1005-229-35 repair manual, Sep 1969; Extractor M3 and M3A1 B-3 Item 5, Ejector M3 B-5 item 12, M3A1 B-4 item 2 Like the British Sten, time and expense was saved by cold- swaging the M3's barrel. =Operating mechanism= A diagram of the M3 illustrating function. The M3 operating sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked to the rear using the cocking handle located on the right side of the ejector housing. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the recoil springs, stripping a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the cartridge primer, igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the recoil springs and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the .45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and recoil springs with a lighter-than-normal compression rate. =Features= M3 receiver markings The gun used metal stamping and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, reducing the number of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the barrel, bolt and firing mechanism were precision machined. The receiver consists of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end is a knurled metal cap which is used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, rifled barrel has four right- hand grooves. M3 and M3A1 submachine guns can be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II.Iannamico, pp. 131‚Äì132: A conical sheetmetal flash hider designated Hider, Flash T-34 was developed in 1945. As it was a prototype only, few were produced. A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers. Projecting to the rear is a one-piece wire stock made from a formed steel rod that telescopes into tubes on both sides of the receiver. Both ends of the stock were tapped and drilled so that it can be used as a cleaning rod. It can also be used as a disassembly tool or as a wrench used to unscrew the barrel cap. The M3's cocking handle assembly is located on the right-hand side of the receiver on the ejector housing, just forward and above the trigger, and consists of nine parts. As the handle is pulled to the rear, a pawl rises to engage a notch in the bottom of the bolt, pushing the bolt to the rear until it locks back on the sear. The fixed sights consist of a rear aperture sight preset for firing at 100 yards (approximately 91 m) and a front blade foresight. All M3 submachine guns were test-fired for accuracy at a distance of . With the sights set at six-o'clock on a bull's-eye target, each gun was required to keep four out of five shots within or cut the edge of a bull's-eye to meet accuracy requirements. The weapon's only safety is the hinged ejection port dust cover. This cover has a projection on the underside that engages a notch on the bolt, locking it in either its forward or rearmost positions. The M3 has no mechanical means of disabling the trigger, and the insertion of a loaded magazine loads the gun. With receiver walls made of relatively thin- gauge sheet metal, the M3/M3A1 is subject to disabling damage if dropped on an open dust cover ‚Äì the covers bend easily, negating the safety feature. Dropping the gun on a sharp or hard surface can dent the receiver enough to bind the bolt. The M3/M3A1's 30-round magazine was the source of complaints throughout the service life of the weapon.Faris, Bob, The Browning Machine Gun: Reflections of an Ordnanceman, Ontario, CA: Collector Grade Publications, Vol.3, Ch. 23 (2007)Iannamico, pp. 36‚Äì37, 124‚Äì125 Unlike the Thompson, the M3 feeds from a double-column, single-feed detachable box magazine which holds 30 rounds and was patterned after the British Sten magazine; the single-feed design proved difficult to load by hand, and is more easily jammed by mud, dust, and dirt than double-column, double-feed designs like the Thompson.Iannamico, pp. 124‚Äì125 Additionally, the feed lips of the single-feed design proved more susceptible to feed malfunctions when slightly bent or damaged. Plastic dust caps were later issued to cover the feed end of the magazine and keep out dust as well as protect the sensitive feed lips. Variants=M3A1= In December 1944, a modernized version of the M3 known as the M3A1 was introduced into service, with all parts except the bolt, housing assembly, and receiver interchangeable with those of the M3. The M3A1 had several improvements: * Most significantly eliminating the troublesome crank-type cocking lever assembly, replaced by a recessed cocking slot machined into the top front portion of the bolt, letting it be cocked by putting a finger into the cocking slot and pulling back the bolt. * The retracting pawl notch was removed, and a clearance slot for the cover hinge rivets was added. * The ejection port and its cover were lengthened to allow the bolt to be drawn back far enough to be engaged by the sear. * The safety lock was moved further to the rear on the cover. * To make loading the single- feed magazine easier, a magazine loading tool was welded to the wire stock; it also served as a cleaning rod stop. * The barrel bushing received two flat cuts that helped in barrel removal by using the stock as a wrench. * The barrel ratchet was redesigned to provide a longer depressing lever for easier disengagement from the barrel collar. * The spare lubricant clip (on the left side of the cocking lever assembly) was removed, replaced with an oil reservoir and an oiler in the pistol grip of the receiver assembly. The stylus on the oiler cap could also double as a drift to remove the extractor pin. At 7.95 pounds empty, the M3A1 was slightly lighter than the M3, at 8.15 pounds empty, primarily due to the simplified cocking mechanism. The M3A1 was formally approved for production on 21 December 1944. The M3A1 modifications resulted in a more reliable, lighter weight, easier to maintain, and easier to field strip submachine gun; the original M3 needed both the trigger guard removed and the cocking crank assembly detached from the receiver housing before unscrewing the barrel, but the M3A1 only required the user unscrew the barrel. To date, only one 9 mm conversion kit for the M3A1 has been discovered. Because it had already been issued in large numbers, the existing M3 magazine design was retained, despite demonstrated deficiencies exposed during the weapon's firing trials and its early combat service. In an effort to improve reliability, a hard plastic Tenite cap designated T2 was adopted in November 1944 to fit over the feed lips of loaded magazines. These caps protected the feed lips while keeping out dirt, sand, and debris.Hogg, Ian V. and Weeks, John, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 6th ed. DBI Books , p.246 Sometime during the 1960s the hard T2 plastic cap was replaced in service with one of pliant neoprene rubber, which could be removed with less noise.Iannamico, p. 125 Unfortunately, during service in the humid climate of Vietnam it was discovered that the rubber cap caused rust to form on the covered portion of the magazine, while causing loaded ammunition to corrode. Initially, M3 submachine guns returned for repair were not upgraded to the M3A1 standard, but merely inspected to ensure they had the improved M3 housing assembly and magazine release shield.Iannamico, p. 81 During the Korean War, existing M3 guns in service were converted to the improved M3A1 configuration using additional new production parts.Iannamico, p. 91 During the conversion, armorers frequently removed the M3 cocking handle, leaving the rest of the now-redundant cocking mechanism inside the subframe.Hackworth, David H. and Sherman, Julie, About Face: The Odyssey of an American Warrior, New York: Simon and Schuster (1989) , p. 154 Overall, the M3A1 was seen by most soldiers and Ordnance technicians as an improvement over the M3. However, complaints of accidental discharge continued to occur even as late as the Korean War. These incidents were sometimes caused by dropping the weapon on a hard surface with an impact sufficient to knock open the ejection port cover and propel the bolt backwards (but not enough to catch the sear). The return springs would then propel the bolt forward to pick up a cartridge from the magazine and carry it into the chamber, where the bolt's fixed firing pin struck the primer upon contact.Iannamico, pp. 79‚Äì80 In 1945, the Guide Lamp factory manufactured 15,469 M3A1 submachine guns before production contracts were canceled with the end of the war. During the Korean War, Ithaca Gun Co built another 33,200 complete guns as well as manufacturing thousands of parts for the repair and rebuilding of existing M3 and M3A1 weapons.Hogg, Ian V, The Complete Machine Gun,London: Phoebus Publishing (1979) , p.107 Foreign variants and derivatives=P.A.M. 1 & 2 (Argentina)= In 1954, a variant of the U.S. M3A1 submachine gun was designed at the Argentine FMAP (F√°brica Militar de Armas Port√°tiles) factory in the city of Rosario and put into production the following year as the P.A.M. 1 (Pistola Ametrelladora Modelo 1).*Julio S. Guzm√°n, Las Armas Modernas de Infanter√≠a, Abril de 1953Iannamico, p. 99 Constructed of somewhat thinner-gauge steel than the U.S. M3A1, the P.A.M. 1 was in essence a 7/8 scale replica of the U.S. weapon in 9 mm Parabellum caliber,Armas MAGNUM, Pistola Ametralladora P.A.M. 1 Y 2, Vol. 193 (5 October 2008), retrieved 30 May 2011 but was lighterHogg, Ian V. and Weeks, John, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 6th ed., DBI Books Inc., (1991) pp. 190, 246: The P.A.M. 1 weighed about 6.6 pounds empty, compared to 7.95 pounds for the M3A1. and had a higher rate of fire. This was due to an incomplete transfer of all details to Argentina. In service, the P.A.M. 1's thinner sheet steel receiver tended to overheat with extended firing, while the gun itself proved somewhat more difficult to control in automatic fire despite the smaller caliber. Additionally, triggering the weapon to fire individual shots proved difficult owing to the increased rate of fire. Problems with accidental discharges and accuracy with the P.A.M. 1 led to an improved selective-fire version with a grip safety on the magazine housing known as the P.A.M. 2, first introduced in 1963. Colloquially referred to as La Engrasadora (the Greaser), 47,688 P.A.M. 1 and P.A.M. 2 submachine guns were produced between 1955 and 1972. A number of P.A.M. 1 and P.A.M. 2 submachine guns were used by the Argentine Army during the Falkland Islands War with the United Kingdom in 1982, and captured examples were tested by British military forces.Mendez, Rolando, Armas livianas de la Infanter√≠a en Malvinas , retrieved 30 May 2011 =Type 36 & 37 (China)= The Type 36 is a direct clone of the M3A1, manufactured in 1947 at the Shenyang Arsenal in Mukden.Thompson, p. 75. It resembles a M3A1, except that it has no flats to allow the use of a wrench for easy removal and it has no oil bottle trap in the pistol grip. Its parts are not interchangeable with the M3A1. 10,000 Type 36s were made before they were obtained by pro-Communist forces in 1949. The Type 37 is a direct clone of the 9mm-chambered M3, made at the 60th Jinling Arsenal near Nanking. Production continued in Taiwan as the Type 39, a successor to the Type 37.

Bobby went on to find greater fame as a solo artist while Cecil became successful as a member of the husband and wife duo of Womack & Womack with Linda Cooke. The group was well-known for of R&B; hits such as the original versions of \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", notably covered by the J. Geils Band and later a solo hit for Bobby Womack, and \\"It's All Over Now\\", covered by the Rolling Stones. Biography=Origins= The foundation of the Valentinos started in church where the five Womack brothers ‚Äì Friendly, Jr. (born 1941), Curtis (1942‚Äì2017), Bobby (1944‚Äì2014), Harry (1945‚Äì1974) and Cecil (1947‚Äì2013) ‚Äì performed at their father Friendly's church located from the East 85th & Quincy area of Cleveland. The group started out around 1952 when eight-year-old Bobby Womack played guitar for his father after he had broken a string. Following this, he discovered that all five of his sons could sing, forming the Womack Brothers. Attracting a gospel following, in 1954, the group, under the name Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers, cut a single, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" with the Pennant label; both Curtis and Bobby Womack were only ten years old at the time of the recording. In 1956, Sam Cooke discovered the group performing while he and his then group, the Soul Stirrers, were headlining and was so impressed with the brothers that he promised to help the group advance in their careers. In 1960, a couple of years after he founded SAR Records and becoming a crossover solo sensation, Cooke made good on his promise signing the teenage act to the label. The group arrived to California in a beat-up Cadillac prior to Cooke signing them. Still going by The Womack Brothers, SAR cut two gospel singles the group recorded in 1961 and 1962 including \\"Somebody's Wrong\\" and \\"Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray\\". After the singles failed to chart, Cooke advised the group to go a secular direction. Upon this, they changed their name to the Valentinos and while both Bobby and Curtis continued to switch leads, Sam Cooke reportedly favored Bobby and while some SAR singles featured Curtis in lead, the Bobby-led singles garnered the most airplay. =Success= Shortly afterwards, the group under its new moniker, recorded \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", which was a pop rendition of \\"Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray\\". The song peaked at number eight on the R&B; charts and number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100, going on to sell two million copies. The hit landed them an opening spot on James Brown & The Famous Flames' national tour. In early 1964, the group issued their next hit, \\"It's All Over Now\\", which was co-written by Bobby and sister-in-law Shirley. Prior to them releasing it, however, word got around that the Rolling Stones wanted to cover it. Despite Bobby's initial protests, the Stones were eventually allowed to release it and their version became their first national hit in the U.S. Bobby's anger cooled after he received his first royalty check for the single following the Stones' release of the single. Around 1963, Bobby Womack began touring as Sam Cooke's backing guitarist. Bobby added instrumentation to several of Cooke's albums including Night Beat and Ain't That Good News. Around the same time Bobby was one of the first people to hear Cooke's chilling anthem, \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\". In December 1964, the Valentinos' career was put in jeopardy when Cooke was suddenly shot and killed while at a Los Angeles motel. =Scandal= Struggling to deal with the sudden loss of Cooke, the group temporarily broke up. Not long after Cooke was buried, however, in February of the following year, Bobby, just before his 21st birthday married Cooke's widow, 29-year-old Barbara Cooke. Womack, his family and friends later say that Barbara fell in love with Bobby and convinced him to marry her. Womack even wore one of Sam's suits to the wedding by Barbara's request. The marriage angered many of Cooke's loyal fans due to the fact that Cooke's death was still being investigated at the time. In response to the negative attention, Bobby chose to leave the Valentinos and start his solo career in 1965, first recording for Him Records and later the Chess Records subsidiary, Checker. But due to the Cooke scandal, radio deejays refused to play his records and onstage, he was often referred to as \\"the kid that married Sam Cooke's wife\\". Womack settled on session work for the time being as a rhythm guitarist, beginning in 1966, while the rest of the Valentinos, who had initially disbanded following Cooke's death, were urged by Bobby to regroup. =Bobby Womack's success, Harry Womack's death and breakup= Following Cooke's death, SAR Records folded and the remaining Valentinos auditioned for several record labels before Chess Records picked them up. In 1966, they recorded two singles, \\"Do It Right\\" and \\"Let's Get Together\\" but both singles failed to chart and the brothers were dropped from the label soon after. Following this, the youngest Valentino, Cecil Womack, was the next brother to leave the group after he decided to marry former Motown singer Mary Wells. Cecil was 19 at the time of the marriage, Wells was 23. In 1968, Wells and Cecil helped the brothers get signed to Jubilee Records. Several of the brothers - including Bobby - contributed to the sessions of Mary Wells' Jubilee album Servin' Up Some Soul, many of the tracks being Cecil and Mary compositions. That same year, the remaining trio of Friendly, Jr., Curtis and Harry recorded the single \\"Tired of Being Nobody\\" followed by the Cecil Womack penned \\"Two Lovers History\\" before calling it a day. Meanwhile, Bobby Womack's career was on a rise again, this time as a session musician and songwriter. After contributing guitar to recordings by Aretha Franklin, he gave up some of his compositions to Wilson Pickett, who later took the Womack single, \\"I'm in Love\\", to the top 40 on the pop and soul charts. Several of Womack's other songs including \\"I'm a Midnight Mover\\" were recorded by Pickett. Following this success, Minit Records signed Bobby and released the album Fly Me to the Moon, which featured the singer's first charted hit, a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreaming\\". Once again being able to have a career after years of struggle following his marriage to Barbara Cooke, Womack continued his session work, working with musicians such as G√°bor Szab√≥, with whom he wrote \\"Breezin'\\". By 1970, Womack's brothers rejoined him as background vocalists on his work, starting with the 1970 release of his second solo album, My Prescription. In 1971, Bobby signed with United Artists Records and released his breakthrough album, Communication, which featured the top ten R&B; hit, \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\", to which the rest of his brothers (the Valentinos) contributed background vocals. The brothers featured on several of Womack's other albums over the years including Understanding, Facts of Life and Lookin' for a Love Again, the latter album in which the brothers re-recorded \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" in a modern funk setting. The remake later shot up to number one R&B; and number ten pop becoming the biggest hit the brothers ever sang on, selling over two million copies. Bobby Womack later produced a version of \\"I Can Understand It\\" for the remaining Valentinos, releasing it on the Clean Records label. The song gave the Valentinos some traction again on the R&B; charts leading to them appearing on Soul Train where Bobby was a frequent guest. However, this period of success was short lived. On March 9, 1974, Harry Womack was shot to death by his girlfriend during a fight while living in Bobby's Los Angeles home. Bobby said later that he received a phone call from his oldest brother Friendly, Jr., who told him of what had happened to Harry. Bobby was then doing an interview for a local radio station while \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" was rising on the charts when he got the call. Bobby said he was shocked by the news and tried to escape the building of the station, later landing in a hospital from his fall where he made a full recovery. In response, Bobby moved his entire family including parents Friendly and Naomi to California to strengthen a fragile family bond. The Valentinos ceased recordings after Harry's death settling on background work with brother Bobby. =Post-breakup= Bobby Womack's solo career struggled following the death of his brother as did the careers of the other ex-Valentinos. In 1982, Bobby Womack's solo career received a boost with the release of \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\", which featured his surviving brothers and other singers backing him. The following year, Cecil Womack, now married to Linda Cooke, Sam Cooke's daughter and Bobby's former stepdaughter, began finding success on his own with Linda as the duo Womack & Womack, releasing the album, Love Wars, which boosted the hit single, \\"Baby I'm Scared of You\\", which Cecil and Linda wrote. The duo later had a hugely successful international hit with \\"Teardrops\\". Friendly Womack and Curtis Womack continued to provide background vocals for brother Bobby's recordings until the nineties when both singers announced retirements. An estrangement in the family occurred following the 1977 divorce of Cecil Womack and Mary Wells as it was alleged that a reason for the divorce (filed by Cecil) was due to Mary Wells carrying on an extramarital affair with Curtis. Curtis and Mary continued to date and in 1986, Wells gave birth to Curtis' daughter Sugar. Mary and Cecil had three children during their marriage including record producer Meech Wells (born Cecil Womack, Jr.). In the late eighties, disenchanted with life in the United States and searching for their African roots, Cecil and Linda Womack and their children moved to an African country and changed their name to the Zekkariyas where they continued recording music. As a songwriting team for Philadelphia International Records, the couple wrote hits for Teddy Pendergrass and Patti LaBelle. Cecil died on February 1, 2013 in Africa. In 2009, Bobby Womack was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. During the ceremony, he performed his 1972 hit \\"Across 110th Street\\",his 1982 hit, \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\", and the Valentinos' original hit \\"It's All Over Now\\", in which Rolling Stone member Ron Wood backed him. (The Stones made a successful cover version of the song). Wood inducted Womack to the Hall. Womack's family with the exception of Cecil Womack was present for the induction ceremony. The family patriarch and founder of the Womack Brothers, Friendly Womack, Sr., died of cancer in 1981. Their mother, Naomi, died in December 2011. Some of the group's recordings are most noted for their covers by artists of various genres. Alongside the Rolling Stones, Solomon Burke and Wilson Pickett recorded covers of the Valentinos tunes \\"Everybody Wants to Fall in Love\\" and \\"I Found a True Love\\", both of which were written solely by Bobby. In 1971, the J Geils Band covered \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" a couple years before the brothers re-recorded it for Bobby's solo release, Lookin' for a Love Again. Another composition that was first recorded by Bobby as a solo release and revived by the Valentinos a year later, \\"I Can Understand It\\", became a major hit for the funk band New Birth. Prior to her later work with Cecil, Linda helped Bobby co-write the hit \\"A Woman's Gotta Have It\\", which also featured Cecil singing background for his brother. Cecil and Linda's composition, \\"Love TKO\\", a major hit for Teddy Pendergrass, has been covered several times. Naming controversy A popular Australia-based rock combo attempted to appropriate the name of the original Valentinos but had to change their name when faced with the threat of possible litigation by Bobby and his brothers. This group later changed their name to the Lost Valentinos. Since then, an a cappella doo-wop group and a Detroit-based rock band have also tried to use the original group's name. Deaths Four of the five Womack brothers are now deceased. Cecil died on February 1, 2013, Bobby died on June 27, 2014, and Curtis on May 21, 2017. Only Friendly Jr. - the eldest brother - remains alive.

Dendropithecus is now considered to be a stem catarrhine, too primitive to be closely related to any modern primates.Harrison, T., 2013. Catarrhine origins. In: Begun, D.R. (Ed.), A Companion to Paleoanthropology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, pp. 376-396. Dendropithecus was a slender ape, about in body length. The structure of its arms suggest that it would have been able to brachiate, swinging between trees by its arms, but that it would not have been as efficient at this form of movement as modern gibbons. However, its teeth suggest a very gibbon-like diet, likely consisting of fruit, soft leaves and flowers. Dendropithecus macinnesi was originally described as a new species of Limnopithecus, L. macinnesi, in 1950, before it was recognized as a distinct genus in 1977. D. ugandensis, known primarily from material from Napak, Uganda, is morphologically similar to D. macinnesi, but is 15-20% smaller than the type species.

An additional species, D. orientalis, was described in 1990 from middle Miocene deposits in northern Thailand, but was transferred to the pliopithecid genus Dionysopithecus in 1999.Begun, D.R.

On January 1, 1792, Louis XVI gave him the Cross of St. Louis. In 1792, he was a subordinate under Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, at Metz. He, Lafayette, and some other officers were taken prisoner by the Austrians near Rochefort when de Pusy asked for rights of transit through Austrian territory on behalf of a group of French officers. This was initially granted, as it had been for others fleeing France, but was revoked when the famous Lafayette was recognized., pp. 1‚Äì3 He was imprisoned by the Austrians at the fortress of Olm√ºtz in 1792. He was released in 1797, under the terms of the treaty of Campo-Formio (18 October 1797). He the then went to Hamburg. From there he traveled to the United States, where he received a warm welcome as Lafayette companion in misfortune. He was offered vast, land grants on the banks of the Delaware River, but he had not given up on returning to France, and when the consulate government had, after the coup of 18 Brumaire, struck off the list of √©migr√©s members of the National Constituent Assembly who had recognized the sovereignty of the people, he hastened to return.
