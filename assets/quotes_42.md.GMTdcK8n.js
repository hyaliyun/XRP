Along with Charles Wakefield Cadman, Blair Fairchild, Arthur Nevin, and Arthur Farwell, among others, he was one of the leading Indianist composers of the early twentieth century. Life Skilton was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1889. From that year until 1891 he taught languages at a preparatory school in Newburgh, New York; while there, he studied composition with Dudley Buck and organ with Harry Rowe Shelley. Skilton traveled to Berlin for further study in 1891, remaining there until 1893 and studying at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik with Woldemar Bargiel and Otis Boise. Returning to the United States, he became director of music at the Salem Academy and College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in which position he served until 1896. In 1897 he found work as an instructor of piano and music theory at the State Normal School in Trenton, New Jersey (now The College of New Jersey); he moved west in 1903, when he became a professor of organ, theory and history at the University of Kansas. He served as the Dean of the School of Fine Arts at that institution from 1903 until 1915. It was there that he developed his interest in American Indian music. Skilton died in Lawrence, Kansas in 1941. Music Skilton first became interested in the music of American Indians in 1915, when George La Mere, an Indian pupil of his offered a trade; the pupil would sing him traditional tribal songs in exchange for lessons in harmony. Skilton expressed interest, and soon found himself visiting the nearby Haskell Institute. The first works he completed on Indian themes were Two Indian Dances for string quartet, Deer Dance and War Dance,Program Notes to orchestral score of Skilton: Suite Primeval on Tribal Indian Melodies for Grand Orchestra, New York: Carl Fischer, no date, accessed online Dec. 10, 2010 originally intended for a student opera.Pratt, Waldo Selden, and Charles N. Boyd, eds.; Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, American Supplement; Philadelphia: Theodore Presser Co., 1922, accessed online Dec. 10, 2010 These he later orchestrated as the first part of his Suite Primeval; the second part, published four years later, consisted of four movements based on traditional songs of three tribes. These were: *Sunrise Song, from the Winnebago *Gambling Song, from the Rogue River *Flute Serenade, from the Sioux *Moccasin Game, from the Winnebago Skilton also wrote operas on Indian themes. The three-act Kalopin was based on legends of the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes, and took as its subject the 1812 New Madrid earthquake. This opera, though completed in 1927, was not publicly performed, but a one-act opera, The Sun Bride (to a libretto by Lillian White Spencer), was given on NBC in 1930. This piece is based on Pueblo themes, and incorporates themes from the Winnebago and Chippewa. For his work on Kalopin, Skilton was awarded the Bispham Memorial Medal Award by the American Opera Association of Chicago, Illinois. Besides his work on Indian motives, Skilton wrote music on other themes, including incidental music for a production of Sophocles' Electra at Smith College in his youth. Among his other compositions were an oratorio, The Guardian Angel, and numerous orchestral works. Many of Skilton's manuscript scores, and published copies of some of his work, are held in the library of the University of Kansas. Among these are manuscript copies of his three operas. Recordings Little of Skilton's music appears to have been recorded. Some of his piano pieces, including a solo piano arrangement of the \\"War Dance\\" from \\"Suite Primeval,\\" (possibly the arrangement by Carl A. Preyer referenced in the full score of Suite Primeval) may be found in two compilations of Indianist music released by Naxos Records on the Marco Polo label. During the acoustic era, Columbia Phonograph Company issued Part I of the suite, \\"Deer Dance\\" and \\"War Dance,\\" played by a house orchestra on A6131; the orchestral score of the Suite Primeval indicates that Path√© Freres Phonograph Company published an acoustic orchestral recording of the same movements and that Columbia published the \\"Flute Serenade\\" as well. Part I would again appear on record during the mono LP era as recorded by the Philharmonia Orchestra of Hamburg conducted by Hans-Jurgen Walther on MGM E-3141.

Blair Fairchild (June 23, 1877 ‚Äì April 23, 1933) was an American composer and diplomat. Along with Charles Wakefield Cadman, Charles Sanford Skilton, Arthur Nevin, and Arthur Farwell, among others, he is sometimes grouped among the Indianists, although he had only a marginal association with their work. Early life Fairchild was a native of Massachusetts, the son of Elisabeth A. (Nelson) and Boston investor Charles Fairchild. Fairchild was the brother of miniaturist Lucia Fairchild Fuller; their grandfather, Jairus C. Fairchild, was the first mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, while their uncle Lucius served three terms as the governor of the state. Career He studied at Harvard College and in Florence before embarking, after a stint in business, on a career in the diplomatic corps. He first saw service in Constantinople before being transferred to Tehran; in 1903 he settled in Paris, where he pursued further studies in music before becoming a composer. He died in 1933. Fairchild had studied music while at Harvard, attending classes taught by both John Knowles Paine and Walter Spalding. Upon his arrival in Paris he sought further study with Charles-Marie Widor. His musical style was based on music he had heard during his diplomatic travels, and among his early works were two tone poems upon Persian legends, Zal and Shah Feridoun. He also wrote much in smaller forms, including many pieces for chamber groups. He also wrote songs and choruses. Fairchild's music has been described as derived from the same influences as the work of Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky. Little of Fairchild's music appears to have been recorded. Some of his piano pieces may be found on a compilation of Indianist music released by Naxos Records on the Marco Polo label. Personal life In 1903, he was married to Edith Howard Cushing (1871‚Äì1920), the daughter of Thomas Forbes Cushing and the granddaughter of John Perkins Cushing, a wealthy Boston sea merchant, opium smuggler, and philanthropist. His wife died in Paris in 1920, and Fairchild died, also in Paris, on April 23, 1933.

Along with Charles Wakefield Cadman, Blair Fairchild, Charles Sanford Skilton, and Arthur Farwell, among others, he was one of the leading Indianist composers of the early twentieth century. Biography Born in Edgeworth, Pennsylvania, Nevin was the younger brother of composer Ethelbert Nevin, and a cousin of George Balch Nevin and his son, Gordon, both of whom were also composers. He received his first musical instruction from his father before enrolling in the New England Conservatory in 1889, studying piano with Otto Bendix and music theory with Percy Goetschius. Completing his work there, in 1893 he traveled to Europe, there receiving instruction in piano from Karl Klindworth and Ernst Jedliczka, and studying composition with Otis Boise and Engelbert Humperdinck. In 1897 Nevin returned to the United States, and spent time teaching and conducting as well as writing music; some of his early pieces were published under the pseudonym \\"Arthur Dale\\". In 1903 and 1904, he spent the summers living with the Blackfoot tribe in Montana, using the opportunity to study their music and folklore. He soon became recognized as an expert on Indian culture, and his interest in the Blackfoot led to the composition of an opera, Poia, on the subject of one of their legends. Between 1911 and 1914, Nevin worked in Virginia, also spending time in New Hampshire conducting at the MacDowell Colony. At the start of World War I, he took a teaching post at the University of Kansas, but gave it up when the United States entered the war in order to direct the army band and choirs at Camp Grant in Illinois. Post-war, he moved to New York after spending time in Tennessee; he suffered from poor health in the last two decades of his life. During this time he also traveled to Paris. He was elected an honorary member of the Alpha chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music, at the New England Conservatory c. 1916-1917. Nevin died in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, in 1943. He was married to the novelist Reita Lambert and had two children, Arthur Jr. and Martha Jane. His great-grandchildren are Frances and Mark Quinlan of the band Hop Along. Music Nevin is best known for his three-act opera Poia, based on the Blackfoot legend describing the origin of the Sun Dance. The opera had been commissioned in 1903 by Walter McClintock, and was composed on a libretto provided by Randolph Hartley. It was first heard in concert in Pittsburgh in 1907, and received good reviews. That same year, Theodore Roosevelt invited Nevin to the White House to give an illustrated talk on his work, but further interest from the American musical establishment was not forthcoming. Instead, Poia was given its highly controversial stage premiere on April 23, 1910 at the Royal Opera House in Berlin, in a German translation crafted in part by the composer's former teacher, Humperdinck. From there it fell into obscurity; it was only given again in the United States by a group in Great Falls, Montana, in 2005. Nevin composed numerous other works besides Poia. A one-act opera, initially titled Twilight, was said to have been accepted for performance at the Metropolitan Opera, but never saw the stage there. It was given as A Daughter of the Forest in Chicago in 1918.https://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/am/media/arthur_nevin/overview.html Nevin's other output includes a number of other dramatic works, some pieces for chorus, and some chamber music, as well as four works for orchestra. Recordings Little of Nevin's music has been committed to disc. Excerpts of his orchestral suite From Edgeworth Hills of 1903 may be found on an Altarus Records release, as may a complete version of his Toccatella.

He is remembered today, if at all, for his opera Winona; consequently, he is sometimes grouped with other composers of the Indianist movement in American music. Biography Born in Florence, Bimboni came to the United States in 1911, immediately finding employment with Henry Savage, who engaged him to conduct his company's tour of Giacomo Puccini's La fanciulla del West. Upon conclusion of the run, he continued to find employment as a conductor in various areas of the country. It was during this period that he became interested in American Indian subjects, and composed Winona to a libretto by a Minneapolis journalist, Perry S. Williams. The story is taken from a legend of the Sioux, and tells of a maiden, named Winona, who threw herself into Lake Pepin to avoid an arranged marriage. The opera's music is heavily based on the music of various Indian tribes, including songs from the Chippewa and Sioux; moccasin, war, and hunting songs are included in the score as well. Bimboni strove not to violate Indian convention; consequently, the choral passages are in unison, with no part-singing. Bimboni had some difficulty in finding an audience for his work, and kept the score with him when he traveled to conduct. At one engagement, in Washington, D.C., his story caught the attention of then-president Warren G. Harding, who used his influence to try to have it performed. Winona finally saw the stage in Portland, Oregon in 1926; at a performance in Minneapolis two years later, the composer was awarded the Bispham Memorial Medal Award for his work in promoting American opera. Bimboni wrote little else besides Winona, although one of his songs was recorded by John McCormack. From 1930 to 1942 he was a teacher at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and since 1933 also at the Opera Department at Juilliard School of Music in New York. For eighteen years, he directed the summer season in Chautauqua, New York, and from 1942 was director of the opera company of Canton (Ohio).Treaccani.itThe Italian American Experience: An Encyclopedia, ed.

Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians. New York: Schirmer Books, 1988. was a Danish-born American composer and music teacher sometimes associated with the Indianist movement. He was an important figure in the musical life of Kansas City, Missouri for many years. Background Busch was born in Bjerre, on Jutland, to a lawyer and his wife, and was the youngest of five children. His father hoped that he would follow him into the legal profession, but Carl was more interested in pursuing a career in music, learning to play the flute, violin, and cello. He studied and played under many of the notables of the day, including Niels Wilhelm Gade and Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann; he also worked under Johan Svendsen. The abilities he showed in his studies led to the offer of a scholarship to the conservatory in Brussels, from which city he went to Paris. There he played under Charles Gounod and Benjamin Godard, and became acquainted with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns as well. From Paris he returned to Denmark for a time before leaving for the United States. Career Denmark's vice- consul in Kansas City was one Thyge Skogaard, a former music publisher, and he encouraged Busch to come to the United States. Consequently, in 1887 he and three friends formed a group called the Gade Quartet and came to America, eventually coming to Kansas City. In addition to playing and conducting, he also began to teach, and soon became known in local cultural circles. When the Philharmonic Choral Society was formed, he was chosen as its director. Through this position he met pianist Sallie Smith, one of the Society's members, who became his wife after a short courtship. In 1911, one of the groups with which Busch was associated became the Kansas City Symphony Orchestra; he stayed with it as director for a further seven years, until his activities were curtailed by American entry into World War I. At the same time, he was active as a composer, and served as a guest conductor elsewhere as well. In 1912, the King of Denmark made Busch a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog; consequently, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Sir Carl\\". More recognition came in the form of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, into which he was inducted in 1924. He was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity by the Fraternity's Chi chapter at the University of Washington in 1913. The Kansas City Philharmonic, led by Karl Krueger, honored him at a concert in 1938, upon which occasion one newspaper referred to him as \\"Kansas City's own outstanding composer and for fifty years its most noted musician.\\"\\" He taught at the Kansas City-Horner Conservatory, and was one of the first faculty members of the University of Kansas City. He spent summers teaching and conducting as well, being invited to work at the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame and at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan. He also frequently summered in Battle Creek, Michigan, as a guest of one of his former pupils. Busch also enjoyed woodcarving and pressing flowers, hobbies which took up more of his time in later years. Busch's wife died in 1939; Busch himself died in Kansas City in 1943. Music Busch was especially noted for his works based on themes from the Western United States, and he would frequently incorporate American Indian themes into his music. He set many tribal songs as solos, and reworked some into larger pieces such as the Four Indian Tribal Melodies for string orchestra, based upon the music of the Omaha and Chippewa. Other works, such as A Chant from the Great Plains for band, are more generically \\"Western\\" in their inspiration. Among Busch's other works was the suite Ozarka, about the Ozarks in southern Missouri. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music houses the Carl Busch Papers and Music Instrument Collection, ca. 1833-1924.http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&id;=4256&q;=busch This collection consists of original and published music by Busch and other musicians, correspondence, newspaper and journal clippings, photographs, programs, books and music instruments.

Cast  * Jonathan Sagall as Robi * Ami Traub as Han * Ben Levin as Ezri * Dita Arel as Rachel * Boaz Torjemann as Baba * Mark Hasmann as Robi's Father  Plot  Robi (Jonathan Sagall) is a young Israeli who lives with his grandparents and works at their store. He dreams of finding true love and becoming a movie director, both of which seem increasingly difficult. His film career stalls, until he can get financial backing and his love life seems to be in similar shape. While the urban city has places to cruise for sex, Robi struggles to find an organized gay community and a committed relationship. His grandparents tolerate his homosexuality, preferring to ignore the men he brings home and avoid asking why he regularly visits the park. Yet, they view his sexual orientation as being shameful not only to him, but to the entire family. When upset, his grandmother yells at him, and asks when he is going to find a nice woman, marry and start a family. His ex-girlfriend would love to get back together, but Robi has fallen in love with a man named Han, who caved into the social pressure and married a woman.

Early life Hugh Robert Rollo Gillespie was born in 21 January 1766 and grew up in Comber, County Down, in what is now Northern Ireland. He was educated at Kensington and near Newmarket After turning down the opportunity of going to Cambridge University he joined the 3rd Irish Horse during 1783 as a Cornet. In 1786 he was involved in a duel in which he killed the opposing duellist. Fleeing to a friend's house in Narraghmore and then to Scotland, he returned voluntarily to stand trial in 1788. The verdict was 'justifiable homicide' and Gillespie was acquitted. Later he earned the title \\"Strongest Man of Comber\\" after performing many feats of strength. Active service In 1792 he transferred to the 20th Light Dragoons with the rank of lieutenant and soon embarked with his new regiment for Jamaica. However, his ship was shipwrecked at the Portuguese islands of Madeira forcing Gillespie to come ashore by a small boat and he then contracted yellow fever in his first night on the island. After recovery, he rejoined his regiment and fought against the forces of the French Republic in the Caribbean at Tiburon Peninsula, Port-au-Prince, Fort Bizotten and Fort de l'H√¥pital. Being made Adjutant-General of St. Domingo, he was at home alone when eight men broke into his house to burgle it. Armed only with his sword, he killed six of them while the other two fled.A memoir of major-general sir R. Rollo Gillespie by Major Sir William Thorn. 1816. Printed for T.

At his court martial it was pointed out that these regulations did not necessarily apply to a regiment which was paid not by the British government, but by the local government of Jamaica, which already had passed his accounts; many of its members and of his senior officers wrote letters to the court martial highly commending him and his care for his regiment.A memoir of major-general sir R.

From Basra he took ship for Bombay, then travelled overland to Madras. He was soon appointed to the command of the 19th Dragoons at Arcot, some 16 miles from Vellore. A few days after taking up his new post, Gillespie was warned of the Vellore Mutiny of 1806. He immediately collected about twenty dragoons, with galloper guns, and he set out ahead of a relief force within a quarter of an hour of the alarm being raised. Dashing ahead of his men, he arrived at Vellore within two hours, to find the surviving British troops within minutes of extinction by some hundreds of mutineers. About sixty men of the 69th, commanded by a sergeant (who recognized Gillespie from the West Indies) and by two assistant surgeons, were holding the ramparts but were out of ammunition. Gillespie was unable to gain entry through the gate (which was controlled by the mutineers), so the sergeant lowered a chain of soldier's belts to allow Gillespie to climb the wall onto the battlements.A memoir of major-general sir R.

Page 102. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JEgVAAAAQAAJ To gain time for the rest of his men to arrive Gillespie led the 69th in a bayonet-charge along the ramparts, engaging in close combat with the enemy. With the rest of the 19th arrived Gillespie ordered them to blow in the gates with their galloper guns and then made a second charge with the 69th, clearing the space just inside the gate to permit the cavalry to deploy. The 19th and Madras Cavalry then charged and slaughtered any enemy who stood in their way; about a hundred fugitives, captured within the fort, were summarily executed. Gillespie arrested the sons of Tipu Sultan, who were suspected of fomenting the mutiny, and sent them under guard to Madras. The mutiny was thus suppressed.A memoir of major-general sir R.

He was subsequently appointed Commander of the Forces in British-occupied Java and in 1812 he deposed the Sultan of Palembang in Sumatra, and took the royal Javanese city of Yogyakarta. On his return to India he speared a tiger that escaped from a cage and prowled on Bangalore racecourse. Two years later, at the beginning of the Anglo-Nepalese War, he led a column to attack a Nepalese hill fort at Khalanga, in the Battle of Nalapani, repulsing a Gurkha counter-attack. Gillespie then tried to follow them back into the fort with a dismounted party of the 8th Dragoons. Although this failed, Gillespie renewed the attack with companies of the 53rd Foot. Thirty yards from the fort he shouted the words, \\"One shot more for the honour of Down\\" and charged with the men when a Nepalese sharpshooter shot him through the heart and he died within seconds of falling. With his death the attack faltered causing the next senior officer to call a retreat. He was posthumously knighted with a K.C.B. on 1 January 1815. Memorials Comber A large statue of Major General Sir Robert Rollo Gillespie was constructed under the oversight of John Fraser, the first County Surveyor of Down, and was unveiled on 24 June 1845 (St. John's Day) in the Town Square of Comber. Fifty lodges of the Masonic Order were present, in what is believed to be the biggest Masonic gathering in Irish history. It was calculated that 25,000 to 30,000 people crowded into the town to witness the ceremony and celebrate the life of \\"The Strongest Man In Comber\\". The column is 55 feet high. At the foot of the column are many Masonic symbols and his famous last words \\"One shot more for the honour of Down\\".

Somewhat farther east, in Long Island, St. Abraam Coptic Orthodox Church was founded by the late 70's to serve the congregation in that region. However, one of the more prominent parishes that was recently founded is St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church, the first Coptic church that was established in densely populated borough of Manhattan. Although St. George Church was officially established as of 1973, the first liturgy was actually celebrated on December 31, 1972, after the current building was bought from the American Baptist Church.History of St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in Brooklyn (Retrieved 08-10-2008) Priests Fr. Mina K. Yanni served as priest for St. George Church from its early foundations until the present. Pope Shenouda III elevated Fr. Mina to the rank of Archpriest on August 16, 1978. Two other priests were eventually ordained and serve St. George Church alongside Fr. Mina. Fr. Armia Taofiles, who has served since Nov. 2000, as well as Fr. Luke Awad, who became priest as of 2005, and Father Gabriel Assad that was ordained in 2015 and is the 4th priest in this church. In January 2018, Fr. Armia was elevated to the rank of Archpriest. In February 2018, both Fr. Michael Dosse and Fr. Samwel Hanna were then ordained to be the fifth and sixth priests of this church.Priests of St. George Church (Retrieved 08-10-2008) There have been pastors at St. George Church up until the present. Expansion Even as St. George Church mainly served those who settled in Brooklyn, other areas were outreached over the years. Surrounding areas in New York's other boroughs as well as some parts of New Jersey were outreached until churches were built there. The building at the eastern corner of 11th Avenue and 67th Street in Dyker Heights, being one of the few structures in North America that was bought by the Copts from the beginning of the congregation's establishment, was expanded and redeveloped multiple times: *The first expansion occurred in 1984, when a new church was built bearing the name of Saint Mina the Miracle Worker. It was established with a seating capacity of about 40 people. *The second expansion occurred in 1986 to increase the seating capacity of St. George Church from 180 to 250. *The third expansion started out in 1996, when new Sunday School classes were built in the traditional Coptic style. This expansion was much larger than the first one and took longer to finish. *The project was completed by 1998 to further increase the capacity for 500 people and also to make some other additions. Publications St. George Church published many of the first Coptic Orthodox publications in North America. These publications include the Coptic Calendar, launched in 1977, as well as the first Agpeya that was translated into English (using the original Coptic texts). Several of Pope Shenouda's books, lectures, and sermons were republished by the church and sent to various places. On March 20, 1994 the Virgin Mary was said to have blessed St. George Church by seeping holy oil from one of her icons. A special place was constructed for this icon in the church building, which is visited by many Copts and Americans as well. Today Pope Shenouda III visited the congregation three times before its consecration on April 14, 1977, second on April 20, 1989 and on March 12, 1992. Pope Shenouda eventually consecrated the church on Sunday, September 6, 1998. There are currently over 600 Coptic families served by St. George's Church alone with several others belonging to other Coptic Orthodox congregations throughout New York.

Some typical questions asked by bibliometricians that can be answered by HistCite analysis are: # How much literature has been published in this field? When and in what countries has it been published? What countries are the major contributors to this field? What are the languages most frequently used by the items published in this field? # What journals cover the literature of the field? Which are the most important? # Who are the key authors in this field? What institutions do these authors represent? # Which articles are the most important? # How have the various contributors to the field influenced each other? The answers to such questions are valuable to researchers, librarians, and administrators. Information visualization is the transformation of non-numerical data into a graphic format. Visualization helps various researchers and scholars understand large collections of information. Although there are numerous uses for information visualization, HistCite performs one specific application: it converts bibliographies into diagrams called historiographs. A historiograph is a time-based network diagram of the papers in a bibliography and their citation relationships to each other. Historiographs are based on the citation relationships between the papers in a bibliography. In a historiograph, each paper in the bibliography is represented by a symbol selected by the user. The symbols are arranged over a timeline of the publication dates of the papers. By changing the time frame of the analysis, the resulting historiograph can form a snapshot of a specific period or an in-depth look at the total history of a subject. Once a historiograph is created for a bibliography, it is easier to see and understand the subject's key publication events, their chronology, and their relative influence. Applications A wide variety of professionals who need to analyze the published literature use HistCite for analysis, for example: researchers, historians, journal editors, librarians and patent lawyers. Operation In order to perform its functions, HistCite must import a bibliography from another source. Once the bibliography is imported, basic point-and-click commands initiate the various analyses and visualizations. HistCite is currently set up to import bibliographies created by searches of the Web of Science database offered by Thomson-Reuters Scientific. Bibliographies from other sources can be manually entered into HistCite. The bibliography the user feeds to HistCite represents the literature of the subject area as it is defined by that user's unique perspective. Thus, the analyses and visualizations produced by HistCite from that bibliography are one-of-a-kind. HistCite operates on Windows computers with Internet Explorer.

Three lines in Thuringia also now belonged to the SEG: * Arnstadt-Ichtershausen Railway * Hohenebra-Ebeleben Railway and the * Ilmenau-Gro√übreitenbach Railway. However these were operated by the Branch Line Central Organisation not by the SEG itself. On 8 December 1897, the SEG was expanded again with the following Bachstein railways the Grand Duchy of Baden: * Mannheim - Heidelberg ‚Äì Weinheim triangle railway (later the OEG) * Karlsruhe branch line * Breg Valley Railway, Donaueschingen ‚Äì Furtwangen * Kaiserstuhl Railway, Breisach ‚Äì Endingen am Kaiserstuhl ‚Äì Gottenheim and the * Upper Wiesen Valley Railway, Zell ‚Äì Todtnau. After the Mainz Tramway had been sold to the city in 1904, the electric tramway networks in Essen and Wiesbaden remained with the SEG. In the same year the railway network grew with the addition of the: * ‚ÄìBeerfelden Railway and the * Selz Valley Railway, Ingelheim ‚Äì Jugenheim - Partenheim. On the other hand, several railways were hived off by the SEG to other newly founded companies in the following years as follows: * In 1911 the \\"Triangle Railway\\" to the Oberrheinische Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft (OEG), with the SEG retaining a 26% share, and * In 1912 the suburban lines of Darmstadt to the Hessian Railway (Hessische Eisenbahn-AG, into which the city tramways were merged (SEG share 38%). * In 1914 the Karlsruhe branch lines were sold. * In 1915 the Central Organisation gave its share to the SEG and Herrmann Bachstein left the Board of Directors.  Essen tramways dominate  At this time ‚Äì on 1 April 1916 - the SEG firm owned branch lines totaling in length, of which were narrow gauge. In addition it owned two important tramway operations in Essen () and Wiesbaden () with a total of of metre gauge lines. In 1919 the Mainz Suburban Line was transferred to the city of Mainz. Whilst the SEG began to gradually close its tram lines in 1929 due to differences with the city of Wiesbaden, the Essen tramway remained at the heart of the SEG, in which the city of Essen in 1933 had 66% of the shares. Although early on, buses were used as a backup for rail services and to extend the branch lines, they only produced meagre profits compared with the tramways, so that the SEG endeavoured not to renew concessions when they expired. They invited the German Reich to take over the Worms-Offstein Railway, because its concession was running out on 1 December 1936. This offer was answered with a Reich law, according to which the Reich Minister of Transport decreed that operations were to continue after the end of the concession period. So the SEG had to carry on supporting all its railways. That said, it was able to gradually improve their profitability. After the end of the Second World War, the SEG was dispossessed of the three railways in Thuringia (AIE, HEE, IGE). In West Germany the branch lines could continue to be operated thanks to the revenue from Essen Tramway operations. In 1952/53 the SEG came to agreements with the states in which SEG branch lines operated: * Baden-W√ºrttemberg took over the Breg Valley Railway, Kaiserstuhl Railway and Wiesen Valley Railway, which went into the state-owned Mittelbadische Eisenbahnen AG. * Rhineland-Palatinate let the Deutsche Bundesbahn continue to run the lines, but quickly introduced bus services as well. * Hesse took over the Reinheim-Reichelsheim Railway, whilst the -Beerfelden Railways was closed. Because now only the tramways, whose network at times was over long, and buses in Essen belonged to the SEG, the company was renamed on 29 September 1954, as the Essener Verkehrs-AG (EVAG). This company exists to the present day with standard and metre gauge tramways of length, but is now called .

The town was inhabited about 1883-1919\\\\. History In the early 1880s, several settlements in Wayne County were started by Mormon farmers under the leadership of Hyrum Burgess. By 1883 some Burgess family members had moved to the Blue Valley area, constructing a dam and irrigation canal by 1884. The land along the Fremont River was fertile, and the growing season longer than in western Wayne County. The valley's farming potential soon brought other settlers. The settlement was known as Blue Valley for its blue-gray soil, colored by Bentonite clay and Mancos Shale. The town was built on both banks of the river, but most people lived on the south side. A footbridge connected the two halves. A school building was erected in 1888, but a proper townsite was not laid out until June 1895. At that time residents renamed their settlement Giles, in honor of the late Bishop Henry Giles, who had been one of Blue Valley's most prominent residents. The crops in Giles grew well, and by 1900 the population had increased to 200. A new meetinghouse went up in 1901, said to be the largest in the county. There was a sawmill in the nearby Henry Mountains, and the town included a grocery store, blacksmith shop, and boarding house. The early 1900s brought frequent devastating floods of the Fremont River. The flooding in 1909-1910 was so severe that local church authorities gave up on trying to maintain a permanent dam. Unable to irrigate their crops, the residents began to leave. By 1919 Giles was a ghost town. Two rock buildings still stand at the site, and numerous foundations and old corrals show where the town once was.

Since 2002, the sanctuary has been located just south of the suburb of Kimwenza at the Petites Chutes de la Lukaya, Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Lola ya Bonobo means 'paradise for bonobos' in Lingala, the main language of Kinshasa. Lola ya Bonobo is home to about 60 bonobos who live in 30 hectares of primary forest. Lola ya Bonobo is a member of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance. Typically, bonobos arrive as young infants. The bushmeat trade in the Congo area sees hundreds of bonobos killed each year for meat. The infants are sold as pets. When confiscated, these young bonobos are taken to Lola ya Bonobo. They start a new life at the sanctuary with close care from a substitute human mother, but are usually quickly ready to be integrated into a peer group, and shortly afterwards into one of the large, mixed-age social groups. Although the bonobos are captive, they live in an environment similar to the wild. They can forage among dozens of edible plants and fruiting trees, compete for mating opportunities, and learn to avoid dangers such as stepping on venomous snakes just as they would in the wild. As a result, the bonobos at the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary, living in their forested microcosm, show all the naturally occurring behaviors observed in wild bonobos (in fact, they actually display some behaviors such as tool use that have not been observed in the wild). Because of the living conditions provided, the sanctuary can play a critical role by demonstrating the level of humane treatment that captive apes deserve. The sanctuary also protects wild bonobos since it triggers the enforcement of domestic and international conservation laws aimed at preventing the trade in live bonobos. The sanctuary also acts as a mouthpiece for conservation efforts in DRC by educating thousands of Congolese visitors each year about the value of Congo's natural history, in particular the bonobo ‚Äì their unique Congolese inheritance. Friends of Bonobos Friends of Bonobos is a US 501(c)3 charity that supports Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary. It was founded by Claudine Andr√© and is entirely run by volunteers in the US. Its president, Dominique Morel, is based in Pakistan. Andre met Morel in Kinshasa while she was running the sanctuary in a small forested enclosure in the American school compound where Morel was living.

It is the world's largest maker of implants to mend bone fractures, and also produces surgical power tools and advanced biomaterials. In June 2012 Synthes was sold by its chairman, former CEO and largest shareholder Hansj√∂rg Wyss to Johnson & Johnson for $20.2 billion. It is now part of their DePuy franchise. History Synthes was originally established in 1960 as a trademark of the non-profit institute Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Osteosynthesefragen (, AO/ASIF),T. Schlich (2002) Surgery, Science and Industry. A Revolution in Fracture Care, 1950s-1990s (Houndsmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave) The Synthes trademark was applied to internal fixation implants produced under license by its industrial partners, Straumann Group and Mathys Medizinaltechnik. In 1975 Synthes USA, a firm founded by Harvard graduate Hansj√∂rg Wyss, became the third company to form an alliance with AO/ASIF. Throughout the decade, Straumann and Mathys expanded their coverage around the rest of the world. In 1990 Straumann spun off its implant business into a separate privately owned company, Stratec Medical. Stratec partially listed its shares on the SWX Swiss Exchange through an initial public offering six years later, while Synthes USA and Mathys remained in private hands. Three years later, however, Stratec and Synthes USA merged to form a new publicly traded company named Synthes-Stratec. After the merger Hansj√∂rg Wyss became, and remained (until the sale to Johnson & Johnson) the majority shareholder of the enlarged company. The third of the original AO/ASIF partner companies, Mathys, sold its osteosynthesis department to Synthes-Stratec in 2004, although the firm's German division was divested to satisfy competition authorities. The company subsequently dropped the \\"-Stratec\\" suffix to become simply Synthes. The company's shares were added to the benchmark Swiss Market Index for the first time in September 2004. In 2006 the company acquired the rights to the Synthes brand name and most of the related intellectual property, including patents, from the AO/ASIF foundation for around CHF1 billion. AO also acquired a stake in Synthes. The two organisations continue to collaborate on relevant issues. In October 2010, Synthes and its subsidiary Norian both plead guilty to crimes relating to illegally implanting bone cement without FDA approval. Norian will admit to a felony charge of conspiracy to impede FDA functions and pay a $23 million fine. Synthes will then divest Norian. In November 2010, Synthes acquired USA based privately owned surgical tools maker The Anspach Effort, Inc; the purchase price was not disclosed. On April 27, 2011, Synthes and Johnson and Johnson DePuy agreed to a merger deal. The merger created the world's largest orthopedic corporation.http://www.synthes.com/html/News- Details.8013.0.html?&tx;_synthesnewsbyxml_pi1[showUid]=65 On June 13, 2012 Johnson & Johnson announced the acquisition of Synthes for $19.7 billion. The merger led to jobs losses for some subsidiary groups. In Italy, the headquarters were moved from Milan to Rome. Products The company's product offering spans six divisions, of which four produce implants and related instruments for the treatment of physical trauma, spinal injuries and CMF (craniomaxillofacial) trauma, as well as for osteotomy in animals such as horses and dogs. Synthes' other business segments are the production of surgical power tools and biomaterials used to fill bone defects.  Norian XR Scandal  In 2009 the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia accused the company of illegally promoting a bone void filler for unapproved uses, running unauthorized clinical trials, and failing to properly report deaths and adverse events related to the product.Criminal Indictment Between 2002 and 2004, Synthes attempted to promote new uses for a product called Norian XR, a calcium phosphate bone void filler mixed with barium sulfate. The Food and Drug Administration explicitly told Synthes not to promote Norian for certain spine surgeries, but the company pushed forward anyway. At least five patients who had Norian injected into their spines died on the operating-room table. In 2009 Synthes announced a settlement with the state of New Jersey over concerns that clinical investigators did not disclose their financial interests. In November 2009 Synthes pleaded guilty to allegations of shipping ‚Äúadulterated and misbranded‚Äù products as part of unlawful clinical trials. The indictment charges Synthes Inc. with a total of 52 felony counts: conspiracy to impair and impede the lawful functions of the FDA and to commit crimes against the US; 7 counts of making false statements in connection with an FDA inspection; and 44 counts of shipping adulterated and misbranded Norian XR in interstate commerce with intent to defraud. The parent company, Synthes, was charged with 44 misdemeanor counts of shipping adulterated and misbranded Norian XR in interstate commerce, and the four executives, Michael D. Huggins, Thomas B. Higgins, Richard E. Bohner and John J. Walsh, were each charged with one strict liability misdemeanor offense. Synthes Inc. acquired N Spine Inc. in 2007. From May 2002 until fall 2004 Norian conspired with others, including Synthes and the four named executives, to conduct unauthorized clinical trials of Synthes's medical devices, Norian XR and Norian SRS, in surgeries to treat vertebral compression fractures of the spine (VCFs), a painful condition commonly suffered by elderly individuals. These surgeries were allegedly performed despite a warning on the FDA-cleared label for Norian XR against this use, and in the face of serious medical concerns about the safety of the devices when used in the spine. According to the indictment, before the marketing program began, pilot studies showed the company that the bone cement reacted chemically with human blood in a test tube to cause blood clots. The research also showed, in a pig, that leakage of small amounts of Norian XR from the spine into the blood caused clots, which become lodged in the lungs. Notwithstanding this knowledge, the company allegedly proceeded to market the product for VCFs without putting it through FDA-required testing. The company, it is alleged, did not stop marketing the product until after a third patient had died on the operating table.http://www.mmm-online.com/synthes-executives- indicted/article/138653/ In late 2011, all four executives received prison sentences ranging from five to nine months.

In the first week of October 2008, she published The Snowball, Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, a The New York Times Bestseller List bestseller. As a project manager for the US FASB, she managed SFAS No. 113. Since 2008, Schroeder has worked as a columnist for Bloomberg News. Early life and education Alice Lynnette Davey is a native of Dallas, Texas. She received a BBA in finance and an MBA from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin in 1978 and 1980. Career Work for the Financial Accounting Foundation From 1980 to 1991, Schroeder worked as a CPA at Ernst and Young, starting in Houston. In 1991 Schroeder became a project manager for the Financial Accounting Standards Board in Norwalk, Connecticut. Her projects focused on ending abusive insurance industry accounting practices primarily due to the use of finite risk transfer contracts, an issue which later became central to the criminal allegation faced by employees of AIG and Berkshire Hathaway-owned General Re, the release of: *SFAS No. 113: Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, *EITF Issue 93-6: Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Contracts (RRC's), and *EITF Issue 93-14: Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Insurance Contracts by Insurance Enterprises and Other Enterprises. When Greenberg was terminated from AIG at the insistence of New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, five employees of General Re and AIG were also indicted in connection with an accounting fraud at AIG that overstated reserves in this and subsequent quarters, the accounting rules violated were those Schroeder oversaw as an FASB project manager. Schroeder testified as an expert witness about accounting for finite risk reinsurance at this Federal criminal conspiracy trial in Hartford, Connecticut. Warren Buffett was never named in the case. Former AIG CEO Greenberg and CFO Howie Smith disputed in court whether the New York AG had the power to pursue a civil fraud case against them. The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned the convictions of all five Gen Re and AIG employees. In mid-2012 they signed deferred prosecution agreements with the Department of Justice that acknowledged mistakes and misjudgments but not criminal wrongdoing. Insurance analyst In 1993, Schroeder left the FASB to work a sell-side insurance investment analyst for Dowling Partners in Hartford, a boutique firm run by V.J. Dowling. In 1994, Schroeder moved to CIBC Oppenheimer. In 1998, she joined PaineWebber. In 1998 Schroeder wrote Warren Buffett a letter requesting a meeting for her clients about Berkshire's recent acquisition of the reinsurer General Re, which she covered. Afterward, Buffett approached her to become the first and only Wall Street sell-side analyst to whom he would speak. Schroeder then initiated coverage of the hard- to-analyze Berkshire Hathaway in a favorable report This was the first significant Wall Street coverage the company received. In 2000, Schroeder was hired by Morgan Stanley, where she was voted the #1 Property-Casualty insurance analyst two years in a row after having been ranked a member of the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team for seven years.‚Äô‚ÄôInstitutional Investor‚Äô‚Äô magazine, October 2001, October 2002 In 2002. Schroeder was voted one of Business Insurance magazine's. That year, she was also named analyst/researcher of the year by The Review, a reinsurance industry publication. Books and reporting The Snowball In 2003, Schroeder has reported that an investment writer approached her to jointly write a book about Warren Buffett and corporate governance. Schroeder felt this was not the right book and discussed another idea with Buffett, who offered to cooperate with her if she wrote a more comprehensive book. In June 2003, Schroeder, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, began travelling to Omaha to research and write Buffett's official biography, The Snowball. Schroeder spent approximately 2,000 hours with Buffett and interviewed 250 other people. Schroeder reportedly received a $7 million book contract for publishing The Snowball. The Snowball was published September 29, 2008 and debuted at #1 on The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Publishers Weekly lists of hardcover nonfiction best-sellers and remained on the bestseller list for more than three months. After the book‚Äôs publication, Buffett reportedly stopped speaking to Schroeder. He canceled the yearly dinner Schroeder hosted in Omaha at which she interviewed him before nearly two hundred people. The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called it one of her ten favorite books of 2008. Time Magazine and People also named The Snowball one of the ten best books of the year.People Magazine December 29, 2008 MBIA and Bill Ackman report In 2002, activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman challenged bond insurer MBIA's AAA rating calling for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance side. Ackman published a report raising extensive concerns about MBIA's continued solvency. He gave Schroeder‚Äôs team an early draft and suggested they downgrade MBIA, but they initially resisted. Schroeder and her colleague Vinay Saqi eventually responded to Ackman‚Äôs report, partially acknowledging Ackman‚Äôs thesis. Goldman Sachs pistol retraction On November 30, 2009, Schroeder published an opinion piece on Bloomberg News stating that several Goldman Sachs bankers, in a show of prescience about potential social unrest, had obtained pistol permits. In a December 9, 2009, The Wall Street Journal blog post, journalist Susanne Craig reported that New York City Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne retracted certain earlier information it had earlier given Alice Schroeder on the number of banker permit applications, which was part of the basis for the column. Bloomberg has since re-published the column on its website in corrected form. First Call estimate  In 2002, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Thomson Reuters' First Call, a research database which compiles the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts to publish consensus earnings estimates for public companies, removed Schroeder's estimate on Chubb Insurance from the database after Schroeder refused to raise her estimate on Chubb to match that of other analysts, whom she disagreed with. Once other investment banks complained about similar experiences, First Call agreed to include a broader range of analyst forecasts in its estimates and better disclose the factors that account for their differences in judgment.

Stross called it \\"a space opera and late-period [Robert A.] Heinlein tribute\\", specifically to Heinlein's 1982 novel Friday. The novel was nominated for the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2009 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was a finalist for the 2009 Prometheus Award. An audiobook version narrated by Bianca Amato was released in 2009. Plot The novel chronicles the travels and perils of Freya Nakamichi-47, a gynoid in a distant future in which humanity is extinct and a near-feudal android society has spread throughout the Solar System. Wealthy and self-indulgent \\"aristos\\" own and have enslaved most of the populace; the remaining \\"free\\" androids struggle to keep themselves independent and can rarely afford the exorbitant costs of interplanetary travel. Freya, a robotic courtesan originally designed to please humans but activated a century after their mysterious extinction, is considered obsolete and works menial jobs to survive. When she offends an aristo and needs to escape off-world, she accepts a job as a courier for the mysterious Jeeves Corporation and becomes embroiled in a complex and dangerous war among factions conspiring against each other for control of society. Influences Saturn's Children is an homage to the works of Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, in particular Heinlein's 1982 novel Friday. The novel opens with an explanation of Asimov‚Äôs Three Laws of Robotics, and then establishes that humans are extinct. Jesse Willis of SFFaudio.com commented: Critical reception Bookmarks magazine called the novel \\"a commentary on identity and free will in a post-human galaxy\\", adding: Booklist praised Saturn's Children as ‚Äúone of the most stylishly imaginative robot tales ever penned\\", and The Times described it as \\"a smart and playful romp.‚Äù The San Diego Union-Tribune called the novel ‚ÄúGood fun ... Heinlein himself would‚Äôve liked this.‚Äù Calling it an \\"erotic futuristic thriller\\", Publishers Weekly pointed out that the novel contains \\"a deep message of how android slavery recapitulates humanity's past mistakes\\", but also suggests that Stross \\"struggles to make it heard over the moans and gunshots\\". Adrienne Martini of the Baltimore City Paper wrote that \\"Stross seems to be saying something about identity and class, but those larger ideas get buried in a labyrinthine plot that isn‚Äôt overly satisfying on its own,\\" adding that \\"for a Heinlein fan, Saturn‚Äôs Children is an interesting game of spot the reference.\\" Jesse Willis of SFFaudio.com wrote: Saturn's Children was nominated for the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2009 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was a finalist for the 2009 Prometheus Award. Sequels Though Stross wrote Saturn's Children as a standalone novel, he published a short story sequel called \\"Bit Rot\\" in the 2010 anthology Engineering Infinity and later made it available online. In the story, a descendant android of Freya's named Lilith Nakamichi-47 is on a long interstellar voyage as a catastrophic event wreaks havoc on the spaceship and its occupants. Robert E. Waters of Tangent classified \\"Bit Rot\\" as \\"one of the hardest SF stories\\" in the anthology, and called it \\"one of the most clever zombie stories in recent memory.\\" Lois Tilton of Locus agreed, calling it \\"an exceedingly neat idea for a space horror story, twisting the classic, and Stross, of course, works it out thoroughly well.\\" Nigel Seel wrote for ScienceFiction.com: In 2013 Stross released Neptune's Brood, a novel set later in the same universe as Saturn's Children, and called \\"Bit Rot\\" the \\"missing link\\" between the two novels.

The Model 1903 was a \\"stock gun\\" from Krupp that could be supplied to customers on short notice with minor alterations to suit the customers needs. Romania acquired 636 of these guns and used them with a more sophisticated sighting device (than the one offered by the Germans) made locally, known as the Ghenea-Korodi sight. By number of guns, this was largest import of a single type of cannon ever made by Romania. It was the mainstay of the Romanian field artillery in World War I, equipping all artillery regiments of the Romanian infantry divisions. The number of these guns in Romanian service had decreased to 312 by 1926. The Romanians used them until 1942, although by this time they had become obsolete. During First Balkan War 126 field and 6 mountain Ottoman Krupp 7.5 cm Model 1903 guns were captured by Royal Serbian Army and later used in World War I. The Model 1903 was also bought by Denmark and the Netherlands and used in World War II. The Model 1903 also formed the basis for the Type 38 75 mm Field Gun used by Japan. In Danish service it was known as the 03 L/30 and does not appear to have been modified in any significant way before World War II. The Dutch bought some 204 of the slightly earlier Kanone M.02/03 and purchased a production-license as well. 120 appear to have been manufactured in the Netherlands, where it was known as the 7-veld. During the 1920s, the Dutch Siderius company a Krupp subsidiary rebuilt their guns to increase their elevation. At least 16 were modified for motorized traction, presumably with steel wheels and pneumatic tires, for service with the Light Division. Gander and Chamberlain claim there were three almost identical versions, the M 02/04, OM 04 and NM 10, but this has not been confirmed. The Germans designated these guns as the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 243(h) after the Battle of the Netherlands. Danish guns were known in German service as the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 240(d).

The combined phenotype of the patient is a combination of what is seen when any individual has disease-causing mutations in any of the individual genes involved in the deletion. While it can be caused by deleted material on a chromosome, it is not, strictly speaking, the same entity as a segmental aneuploidy syndrome. A segmental aneuploidy syndrome is a subtype of CGS that regularly recur, usually due to non-allelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats in the region. Most CGS involve the X chromosome and affect male individuals. One of the earliest and most famous examples of a CGS involves a male patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), retinitis pigmentosa and intellectual disability. When it was discovered that an X chromosome deletion (specifically Xp21) was the underlying cause of all of these features, researchers were able to use this information to clone the genes responsible for DMD and CGD. One of those more common CGS involves a deletion on the X chromosome (near Xp21) that encompasses DMD (causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy), NROB1 (causing X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita) and GK (causing glycerol kinase deficiency). These patients will have all the common features of each individual disease, resulting in a very complex phenotype. Deletions near the distal tip of the p arm of the X chromosome are also a frequent cause of CGS. In addition to the previously described CGS that occur on the X chromosome, two other common syndromes are Langer-Giedion syndrome (caused by deletions of TRPS1 and EXT1 on 8q24 and WAGR syndrome (caused by deletions on 11q13 encompassing PAX6 and WT1.)

The modern village of Lympne derives its name from the ancient port. History File:Roman Canterbury, Richborough, Dover, Lympne on the 4th century Peutinger Map.The first documentary mention of the site is found in the late 3rd century Antonine Itinerary, where it is mentioned as lying 68,000 paces (68 Roman miles) from Londinium (London) and 16,000 paces from the cantonal capital Durovernum Cantiacorum (Canterbury).Thomas Codrington (1903), Roman Roads in Britain However, there is archaeological evidence of much earlier use as a naval base: tiles stamped CL BR have been found indicating that sailors or marines of the fleet, the Classis Britannica, were involved in its construction, as well as an inscription dated to the first third of the 2nd century (RIB 66) on an altar stone, dedicated to the god Neptune by a Lucius Aufidius Pantera, prefect of the Classis Britannica.CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore, p. 29 According to the 5th century Notitia Dignitatum (probably recording the situation in the late 4th century), the fort was garrisoned by a regiment raised in Tournai (numerus Turnacensium) and formed part of a defence system known as the Saxon Shore under the command of a Count.Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ., XXVIII.16 The last mention of Lemanis in Latin sources is in the late 7th century Ravenna Cosmography, by which time the site, along with the rest of Britain, had long been severed from the Roman Empire.The Ravenna Cosmography: British Section  Roman Britain Location and construction Archaeological excavations of the east gate of Portus Lemanis in 1976 The fort stood on a hill overlooking a reach of sea which has since been drained to form the Romney Marsh. A harbour lay to the south and east. A vicus (civilian settlement) had also sprung up in its proximity, situated astride the road that led to Canterbury. The construction of the Saxon Shore-era fort can be dated to the late 270s, as is evidenced by its late-style characteristics, including forward-projecting towers.Fields (2006), p. 24 The remains are in poor condition, since the ground, mostly clay, has at places given way. The southern side of the fort is wholly missing, and elsewhere the remains have been moved at various angles, while little evidence of interior structures (remains of a bath and possibly the principia) survives. The site is still relatively unknown: the only major archaeological excavations were carried out by Roach Smith in 1850 and 1852. The remains of the main rampart show a strong construction ca. 3.9 m wide, and surviving sections are still between 6 and 8 m in height. The wall is built of recycled material from earlier structures and bonded with bands of brick, which include several roofing tiles.Fields (2006), p. 21 Originally, the fort may have had about 14 towers. A single main gate survives towards the east, as well as several posterns. Its shape may have been an irregular pentagon, which covered an area of ca. 3.4 ha; but this shape would be unusual for Roman forts, especially in the Saxon Shore system. The site, long known locally as Stutfall Castle, is on private land and may not be visited, but a fairly good view can be obtained at a distance from a public footpath running along the escarpment, and another view from a poorly maintained footpath to the west (erroneously shown on the Ordnance Survey map as running through the centre of the remains).

This is a quick, efficient method over surfactant-casting or acid oxidation filtration of carbon nanotubes. Background Traditional methods of buckypaper production involves the use of surfactants to disperse carbon nanotubes into aqueous solutions. It was found that filtering this suspension allowed the nanotubes to pack together in a paper-like mat, thus coining the term \\"buckypaper\\" (bucky being the reference to the buckminsterfullerene molecule). The problem was the difficulty in removing the surfactant afterwards, where the surfactant has been linked with cell lysis and tissue inflammation. Acid oxidation of carbon nanotubes can also be used in filtration to form buckypaper, but requires a high degree of surface acidic groups in order to obtain efficient dispersal in aqueous solution. Synthesis A frit compression system for casting buckypaper An alternative casting method was developed in 2008 to produce buckypaper that did not require the use of surfactants or the acid oxidation of carbon nanotubes in order to obtain high-purity buckypaper for biomedical applications. The frit-compression system was adapted from a Solid phase extraction (SPE) column, where a suspension of carbon nanotubes is squeezed between two polypropylene frits (70 micrometre pore diameter) inside a syringe column. The pore structure of the frit allows a rapid exit of the solvent leaving the carbon nanotubes to be pressed together. The presence of the solvent controls the interaction between the tubes allowing the formation of tube-tube junctions; its surface tension directly affects the overlap of adjoining nanotubes thus gaining control over the porosity and pore diameter distribution of buckypaper. The distribution of carbon nanotubes in solvent does not have to be a stable suspension, rather a general dispersion serves much easier to keep the nanotubes between the frits rather than pass through them. Once the system is compressed, the frit-carbon nanotube sandwich is removed from the syringe housing and allowed to dry. The frits can then be removed to leave intact buckypaper. This methodology rapidly speeds up the casting process, avoids use of surfactants and acid oxidation, and the solvent can be fully recovered.

Although there is currently no formal classification for paper, discs and columns, it was deemed necessary to differentiate between the different structures obtained for research purposes. Buckypaper Typically, cylindrical columns are used with a few milligrams of carbon nanotubes in a solvent. This generates buckypaper with a circular cross-section and film heights of a few hundred micrometres. Buckypaper is usually a class of carbon nanotube mats with depths from 1 to 500 micrometres. Buckydiscs Buckypaper with a height that is larger than 500 micrometres (0.5 mm) is called a buckydisc, being thicker than buckypaper and not paper- like. Moreover, when casting in water, the edges of the film can lift due to surface tension effects of the remaining solvent in the system that can pull carbon nanotubes closer together. Buckycolumns Buckydiscs with heights larger than 1 mm can be referred to as buckycolumns. These carbon nanotube monoliths often exhibit hyperboloid geometries and are highly compressible Buckyprism It is possible to use square housing to generate square cross sections, known as buckyprisms.

Under the Mamluks, the village was a dependency of Hebron, and formed part of the waqf supporting the Ibrahimi Mosque.Mujir al-Din, 1876, pp. 230-1. Cited and translated in Petersen, 2001, p. 320The villagers obtained their drinking water from two communal wells:- al-Saflani well which was drilled next to Wadi 'Ajjur, and al-Sarara well located north of the village.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 224‚Äì225 State of Israel In the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Az-Zakariyya was the longest lasting Palestinian Arab community in the southern Jerusalem Corridor.Morris, 2004, p. 521 The villagers were evicted by the Israelis in three different phases, last eviction was carried out on June 9, 1950, on the orders of David Ben-Gurion, Moshe Sharett and Yosef Weitz, and most ended up on the West Bank.Mordechai Bar-On, officer in charge of the eviction. Quoted in Morris, 2004, p. 521 In 1950 Moshav Zekharia was established by Kurdish Jewish immigrants on the village site.Khalidi, 1992, p. 226 During the 1960s, most of the older buildings in the village were destroyed to make room for the new. Zekharia In 1992, Walid Khalidi described the remaining structures: \\"The mosque and a number of houses, some occupied by Jewish residents and others deserted, remain on the site. Large sections of the site itself are covered with wild vegetation. The mosque is in a state of neglect and an Israeli flag is planted on top of the minaret. [..] One of the occupied houses is a two- storey stone structure with a flat roof. Its second story windows have round arches and grillwork. Parts of the surrounding lands are cultivated by Israeli farmers.\\" Landmarks and culture The tomb of Zecharia, which has been attributed to both the Hebrew prophet Zecharia and Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, is located on the moshav. The site is mentioned in sources as early as the fourth century, in the writings of Sozomenos, and it appears on the Madaba map. In the 1970s, there was a resurgence of Jewish interest in the site, which became a pilgrimage destination for Jews from Iraq, Iran, Cochin, India and elsewhere, who prayed there and lit candles.Sacred Space in Israel and Palestine: Religion and Politics, ed.

As a publisher, FantaCo was known for its idiosyncratic line-up of mostly black- and-white titles, including the humorous Hembeck Series and the horror title Gore Shriek. FantaCo also published \\"The Chronicles Series\\", which cataloged top-selling Marvel Comics titles. In its later years, FantaCo published mostly horror comics and a small number of \\"good girl art\\". FantaCo began as a mail order company and comic book store before branching out into publishing books, magazines, and comics. From 1979 through 1990, it also hosted FantaCon, a popular Albany-area comics and horror convention. (After FantaCo's demise, Skulan brought back FantaCon in 2013.)  History  FantaCo Enterprises began in 1978 as a mail order company and comic book store located at 21 Central Avenue in Albany. The name was short for either \\"Fantasy Company\\" or the \\"Fantastic Company,\\" depending on Skulan's mood. Many of the store's employees, including publisher/owner/editor Tom Skulan, Mitch Cohn, Roger Green, and Raoul Vezina, worked on FantaCo titles in many creative capacities.  Comics  FantaCo's first foray into publishing was Raoul Vezina's Smilin‚Äô Ed, about a rat with the personality of a 1950s children TV host. Smilin'Ed was also the store's emblem. Vezina drew Smilin‚Äô Ed from 1980 until his death in 1983.Green, Roger. \\"Working on the Raoul Vezina Recollection,\\" Information Without the Bun, TimesUnion.com (June 29, 2008). The company made its mark in the early 1980s with The Hembeck Series, seven volumes of comics by Fred Hembeck. These magazine-sized black-and-white books poked loving fun at the mainstream comics industry, with Hembeck himself appearing as a cartoon interlocutor with the superheroes he interviewed. During this period, FantaCo also published The Fantaco Chronicles Series, edited by Mitch Cohn and Roger Green, which exhaustively documented popular Marvel Comics titles such as the X-Men, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Avengers, and Spider-Man. A two-issue series was published during this period, Gates of Eden, which featured comics about the 1960s by an impressive array of talent, including John Byrne, Steve Leialoha, Michael T. Gilbert, Trina Robbins, Hembeck, Foolbert Sturgeon, P. Craig Russell, Rick Geary and Spain Rodriguez. 1986 saw the debut of the horror anthology Gore Shriek, initially edited by Skulan, and later issues by Stephen R. Bissette, who also contributed stories to each issue. Besides Skulan and Bissette, other Gore Shriek creators of note included Greg Capullo, Bruce Spaulding Fuller, Eric Stanway and Gurchain Singh. Gore Shriek Volume 1 ran for three years, and is still fondly remembered by horror fans as one of the top comics in that genre. Gore Shriek Delectus (1989) collects much of the best material from the first volume. FantaCo revived Gore Shriek in 1990 and started a new line of horror and zombie-related titles and one-shots. This period was noteworthy for the career jump-starts it gave to young creators like Chynna Clugston (Bloodletting), Steve Niles (Night of the Living Dead: London), and Jim Whiting (King of the Dead, Kill Me Slowly, Scab, and Uptown Zombies). From about 1995, the company's titles shifted to the good girl art of Tom Simonton's Amazon Woman comics, and titillating titles like Babes & Biomechanics, Lady Dracula, and Dead Chicks in Lace: Bloodletting Lingerie Special. = FantaCo/Tundra = From 1991 to 1994, the company co-published a number of Kevin Eastman projects with Eastman's company Tundra Press. Books under the FantaCo/Tundra imprint included Infectious, No Guts or Glory, and Zombie War. These projects petered out once Tundra folded in 1993. (Eastman and Skulan revived Zombie War in full color under the IDW Publishing imprint, with a graphic novel released in the summer of 2014.)  Books and magazines  FantaCo published books and magazines in addition to comics. Their first book being Mug Shots in 1980, a book of cartoons by John Caldwell. Later on, FantaCo published more trade books on the subjects of horror films; splatter films; exploitation films; an early guide to horror, science fiction, and fantasy films on videocassette; and even a straight-ahead horror novel, Ninth and Hell Street. John McCarty authored three books published by FantaCo, and Chas Balun wrote four. In a similar horror vein, they put out the FantaCo Horror Yearbook and Price Guide every year from 1978 until 1996; magazines like Barbara Steele: An Angel for Satan, Demonique 4, and the Comics Enquirer; twelve issues of Dread: The Official Clive Barker Newsletter in 1992‚Äì1993; and Clive Barker and Zombie War commemorative card sets. The book Amazon Women: The Art of Tom Simonton, edited by Tim D'Allaird, was FantaCo's final publication in the 1990s, right on the eve of their storefront closure in 1998. Mr. Skulan went into semi-retirement and FantaCo Enterprises remained dormant until 2013.  FantaCon  FantaCo owner Thomas Skulan also hosted FantaCon, a popular Albany-area horror convention and comic book convention that was preferred by many to the \\"over-crowded Fangoria events.\\" FantaCons lasted from 1979 to 1990, skipping only the years 1982 and 1984‚Äì1987.Green, Roger. \\"FantaCon 2013: the Tom Skulan interview,\\" \\"Information Without The Bun,\\" TimeUnion.com (Feb. 7, 2013). After a 23-year hiatus, Skulan launched FantaCon's revival, which took place on September 14 and 15, 2013, at the Marriott Hotel in Albany.Drew, Phil. \\"HORRORS! FantaCon comes back from the dead; movies and festival this weekend,\\" The Saratogian (Sept. 11, 2013). The City of Albany, including Mayor Jerry Jennings, wholeheartedly embraced and promoted the event with two additional days of events on September 12 and 13. Mayor Jennings kicked off the event at The Palace Theatre, followed by the official 45th-anniversary showing of the original 1968 cult classic film Night of the Living Dead. Following the film, some of the original cast members (Russ Streiner, Judith O'Dea, George Kosana, Judith Ridley, John A. Russo and Kyra Schon) came on stage for an intimate Q&A; session.  Storefront closure  With the mid-1990s bursting of the speculation bubble, combined with the decline in demand for comic books, in general, in conjunction with an untenable situation with a large corporate distributor, Skulan decided to close the storefront. FantaCo's mail order operations continued. In 2016 FantaCo Publishing was revived with the publication of Smilin' Ed Comics, in honor of FantaCo co-founder Raoul Vezina. The company currently publishes about one title per month.

It won the Locus Award for best novella of 2006. The novella was republished in Stross's short-story collection Wireless in 2009.  Plot  On 2 October 1962, the universe underwent a change ‚Äì instantly, the continents of the Earth were no longer wrapped onto a spherical planet but were on the surface of an Alderson disk. Measurements on Cepheid variable stars indicate that the Alderson disk is located in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, and that the epoch is roughly 800,000 years later than the calendar date (give or take 100,000 to 200,000 years). In the sky, the stars of the Milky Way are reddened and metal-depleted, evidence that it is now controlled by a Type-III civilisation capable of controlling the resources of an entire galaxy. Three theories for the change are suggested within the novella: # the atoms making up the surface and people of earth have somehow peeled off the Earth and shipped to a new location. # Marvin Minsky suggests that a snapshot of the world was taken and the snapshot has been used as the basis for a physical recreation. # Hans Moravec suggests that a snapshot of the world was taken and the snapshot has been used as the basis for a simulated reality. The first hypothesis would indicate that the characters of the book are the original humans of the 20th century Earth. The latter two hypotheses would indicate that the characters of the book are duplicates of humans that lived and died thousands of years previously. The creatures that moved or copied humanity are unknown, as is the technology they used and the purpose for their action. Because of the projection of a spherical surface onto a flat surface, some changes occur: North America is now much farther from Asia, as there is no polar route. Furthermore, launching an artificial satellite into orbit becomes impossible, and chemical-fuelled ICBMs are no longer capable of reaching other continents. The gravitational attraction in the near field of an Alderson disk does not drop away according to the inverse-square law but is approximately constant and perpendicular to the disk, so missile trajectories become parabolic rather than segments of elliptical orbits. Thus, both the strategic bomber and ICBM \\"legs\\" of the nuclear triad are no longer feasible so nuclear deterrence breaks down, and the Soviet Union takes advantage of this to conquer much of Western Europe. The deterrent role is taken over by long-range nuclear-powered cruise missiles. Cold war tensions between the two super states provide the in-between plot direction. There are several sub- plots ‚Äì the exploration of the new world by both superpowers forms much of the major plot. Yuri Gagarin captains a huge, nuclear-powered Ekranoplan on behalf of the Soviets, whilst the US launch cruise liners filled with colonists for distant islands. On one such island, Madelaine Holbright (initially a housewife) begins an affair with John Martin, an entomologist who is almost fatally stung by native termites which begin to display signs of intelligence. During his travels, Gagarin turns up further examples of \\"Earths\\" far away from the currently inhabited areas, with cities that have clearly been destroyed in nuclear war in the distant past. A character named Gregor Samsa seems to be highly connected with the US Government, and is later shown to be in fact an advanced alien termite with pheromone control, and is guiding the transplanted humanity towards nuclear destruction, to clear the path for the \\"mock aboriginal termites\\" that have previously stung Martin. Eventually Gregor is successful, and humanity is destroyed in a nuclear exchange ‚Äì Gregor's intelligence is saved and it is heavily implied that not only has this happened before, but that it will happen again, supporting (but not actually confirming) the second two of the suggested theories. To explain plot sections and provide background information, Stross makes use of themes that recur in his works ‚Äì the use of security clearance briefings, and codewords to infer secret levels of information ‚Äì COLLECTION and RUBY for Missile Gap Reception Publishers Weekly described the novella as a \\"blend of 1900s H. G. Wells and 1970s propaganda, updated for the 21st century in the clear, chilly and fashionably cynical style that lets Stross get away with premises that would be absurdly cheesy in anyone else's hands.\\" Carl Hays in his review for Booklist called the novel a \\"bizarre, nevertheless brilliant alternate- history novella featuring a protracted U.S.‚ÄìSoviet cold war.\\" References External links *Online text from the publisher's website 2006 British novels American alternate history novels Novels set during the Cold War American novellas Novels by Charles Stross American science fiction novels Novels set during World War III Fiction set in 1962 Small Magellanic Cloud in fiction ","title":"Missile Gap"},{"id":"18814397","text":"Fiat Lux are an English synthpop band formed in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England, in 1982, by Steve Wright (vocals, percussion) and David P Crickmore (guitars, bass, keyboards). Ian Nelson (sax, keyboards), younger brother of Be-Bop Deluxe guitarist and lead vocalist Bill Nelson, joined shortly afterwards, complementing the classic line-up of the band who remained until the mid-1980s, when Crickmore departed. In 2017 Wright and Crickmore began working together again as Fiat Lux. History Wright and Crickmore attended Bretton Hall College, Wakefield, where they studied drama, meeting after the first joined the latter's new wave band, Juveniles (whose two songs were released in a various artists compilation called Household Shocks). Wright later joined theatre company Yorkshire Actors where he met musician Bill Nelson.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books, , p. 163 After impressing him with a demo tape, Nelson produced one of the demo's tracks, \\"Feels Like Winter Again\\", b/w \\"This Illness\\" and released it on his Cocteau Records label in November 1982, by which time Nelson's brother Ian had joined the band.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , pp. 330-331 \\"Feels Like Winter Again\\" gained the band radio airplay and led to them signing a record deal with major label Polydor and subsequent support slots with Howard Jones. The band had minor UK chart hits with \\"Secrets\\" and \\"Blue Emotion\\", which were followed by the mini album Hired History in August 1984. They made several TV appearances, including a performance on Old Grey Whistle Test. There was also a long format video release Commercial Breakdown, which included live versions of the shelved tracks for their debut full-length Polydor album. Crickmore departed after the chart failure of their fifth Polydor single release 'House Of Thorns' The band continued recording some songs with session musicians, including Rick Martinez (Richard Anthony Martinez) who had already played drums on some of their earlier works. They disbanded in 1985. Wright joined former members of Camera Obscura, to form Hoi Poloi, another short-lived pop group. He then abandoned the music industry to become a television director. Crickmore dedicated to more experimental projects through the remaining 1980s, culminating in an album on the London-based independent record label, Yellow Moon Records, Lettuce Spay under the name This. In the 1990s he rediscovered his love of folk and roots music and became a founder member of The Durbervilles. From 2005 The Durbevilles became radio presenters with a weekly folk and roots show on BBC Radio Leeds. Ian Nelson continued to work with his brother Bill in the early 1990s; he died in his sleep on 23 April 2006. In 2017, Wright and Crickmore reformed Fiat Lux and released a remake of their song \\"Secrets\\".

Larsen Tractor Test and Power Museum is a historical facility located on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. The museum was established in 1980 and is dedicated to preserving and documenting the history of Nebraska's tractor test law (dating from 1919) which began as a law to protect others from irresponsible tractor companies failing to keep the best interest of the farmer in mind. Today it remains the only tractor testing museum in the world. It is also still the only complete tractor test laboratory in the world. History The Nebraska tractor testing law had its roots from 1919 when Wilmot Crozier, a farmer and legislator from Osceola in Polk County, bought a Ford 8-16 tractor. Not made by Henry Ford Co., the Ford 8-16 didn't live up to its advertised claims. The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once. Mr. Crozier could only get it to pull one. He took it back to the dealership and demanded they take it back, but they told him, \\"You own it, you keep it\\". They did eventually give him a Rumely H tractor The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once; Crozier got it to pull five. Wilmot Crozier and State Senator Charles Warner decided to ensure that all farmers would get a fair deal when buying any model of tractor sold in Nebraska. Under their leadership, the Nebraska Tractor Test Law was passed in 1919, House Roll 85. At the same time, the legislature established a facility for tractor testing on the east campus of the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln to ensure that tractor manufacturers met their advertised claims of the tractors performance. The Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory is known around the world as the first test lab in the world. And it is the leader in tractor testing and is still the only one of its kind in the world. The Lester F. Larsen Tractor Test and Power Museum is housed in the original Nebraska Tractor Test facility on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska Lincoln. It is located at 35th and Fair Streets. A newer section was built on in 1948. The building was declared a historical landmark by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers in 1980 and dedicated as a museum in 1998. Friends of the Museum were instrumental in early renovation efforts and continue to raise funds for the museum. The museum in now part of the University of Nebraska State Museum system. The Waterloo Boy tractor was the first to successfully complete the testing process in 1920. Only because of the harsh winter of 1919, they didn't get the testing finished in time. Since 1919, the state continues to test tractors to ensure reliability standards. The test track is located directly west of the museum, and the testing facility is northwest of the museum and north of the test track. The present site of the museum was previously used as a testing garage until a larger, more capable facility was constructed. The track is 12% stronger than an airport runway, which is 12% stronger than city streets. It has two 800-foot straightaways, but during testing only 500 feet are used. They use the track to determine the drawbar horsepower of a tractor. Inside the test laboratory, they back the tractor into a dynamometer, which determines the \\"belt horsepower\\" of the tractor. The original 1919 Sprague dynamometer is housed in the museum.

The town mayor, Ray Crill (Keith Carradine), and his wife Fanny (Susan Sarandon) come to see John to try to host a political rally in his backyard in support of the incumbent candidate for the federal elections for senator. John is unwilling to do so, but Emma agrees. Fanny runs a women's shelter in the small town of 800, and convinces Emma to hold the rally in order to raise funds for her organization. She agrees, but the next day, John has a mental breakdown at work when he meets the Crills. John is afraid, under the mayor's stipulation, that the two be present for the ceremony, presenting obvious problems that would reveal his identity. He phones the railway company to have it removed immediately, in order to avoid the confrontation. One night, a young mother, Maggie (Ellen Page) appears at John's house, looking for him. She has been receiving checks from John's mother, who died a year ago, to support her and her two-year-old son's living. She wants to move out of the town with her son Jake (Flynn Milligan) in order to seek new opportunities, but is unable to procure the funds to do so. She comes to John's house to ask for money, but he just goes upstairs and becomes Emma. Not knowing Emma, Maggie feels bad, and Emma drives her home, to her trailer. There, it is revealed that Jake is, in fact, Jake Skillpa, the son of John and Maggie. Emma suggests that Maggie move into Fanny's women shelter, but she refuses, citing that the women there are \\"unambitious.\\" John then visits Maggie at the shelter, agreeing to give her a ride to Madison, as well as just over $1000, his savings at the bank. Emma offers Maggie a job at the bank, in an attempt to keep Maggie in Peacock. John asks Maggie to meet him at the local motel at 11pm that night to collect the money. Emma seduces a man at the bar that night, and leads him to the motel room that John had arranged. She beats the man unconscious, lays him on the bed, and sets the motel on fire as Maggie comes to meet John. Emma, long gone, gets to feign the \\"death\\" of her \\"husband.\\" When the rally takes place, Emma shuts herself in her home, ignoring the attendees. She gives the money to Maggie, telling her to leave because it is not safe here in Peacock, as well as trying to prevent the abuse that she herself had endured. The film ends with Maggie holding Jake over her shoulder as they walk down the porch steps, with Jake waving a childhood toy of John's that Emma had given him and Emma barring herself in her home. Cast *Cillian Murphy as John/Emma Skillpa, a \\"retiring, shy and completely nondescript bank employee\\" leading a double life as Emma, his female dissociative identity. Murphy stated that \\"Peacock stunned me as a script from start to finish. It offers an incredible challenge to an actor -- one I couldn't turn down.\\" *Ellen Page as Maggie Bailey, a struggling young mother who holds the key to John's past and sparks a battle between the personalities. Page commented, \\"This is one of the boldest screenplays I've come across in my albeit short career; it's a character and story I can throw myself into and exactly the type of movie I love to be a part of.\\" *Susan Sarandon as Fanny Crill, the wife of Peacock's mayor, who also runs a local woman's shelter. Sarandon has said that Peacock is \\"a very strange little piece -- kind of ominous.\\" *Bill Pullman as Edmund French, John's boss. Pullman has described Peacock as \\"a very interesting script,\\" explaining that his role \\"is another character hiding the fact he's the closest one like [Skillpa]. It's a very different part for me.\\" *Josh Lucas as Tom McGonigle, a local police officer and the closest thing John has to a friend. *Keith Carradine as Mayor Ray Crill *Paul Cram as Kenny, a local store clerk. Casting calls for extras and other minor roles were made in the Des Moines, Iowa area in April 2008. Production and filming Though set in small-town Nebraska, Peacock was filmed in Iowa: Filming began on May 6, 2008 in Odebolt, in Sac County, while Greenfield and Adair County also staged production for several days, including scenes in Greenfield's town square and its E.E. Warren Opera House. Filming was scheduled to continue on June 5, 2008 in Boone, Iowa, but due to weather conditions, Cornfield Productions was forced to delay filming until the following day; the filming ended on June 9. The filming of the train derailment scene occurred at a local set of train tracks; line producer Brian Bell explained that this particular shot was a \\"visual effects\\" shot, where the train would eventually be digitally edited to appear as if it is passing through Skillpa's backyard, even though it is not physically there. Although the shooting took four hours to complete, it only comprises about 10 to 15 seconds of the film.

It enhances the notion of characteristic set.  Introduction  Given a linear system, one can convert it to a triangular system via Gaussian elimination. For the non-linear case, given a polynomial system F over a field, one can convert (decompose or triangularize) it to a finite set of triangular sets, in the sense that the algebraic variety V(F) is described by these triangular sets. A triangular set may merely describe the empty set. To fix this degenerated case, the notion of regular chain was introduced, independently by Kalkbrener (1993), Yang and Zhang (1994). Regular chains also appear in Chou and Gao (1992). Regular chains are special triangular sets which are used in different algorithms for computing unmixed-dimensional decompositions of algebraic varieties. Without using factorization, these decompositions have better properties that the ones produced by Wu's algorithm. Kalkbrener's original definition was based on the following observation: every irreducible variety is uniquely determined by one of its generic points and varieties can be represented by describing the generic points of their irreducible components. These generic points are given by regular chains.  Examples  Denote Q the rational number field. In Q[x1, x2, x3] with variable ordering x1 < x2 < x3, : T = \\\\\\\\{ x_2^2-x_1^2, x_2(x_3-x_1)\\\\\\\\} is a triangular set and also a regular chain. Two generic points given by T are (a, a, a) and (a, -a, a) where a is transcendental over Q. Thus there are two irreducible components, given by { x2  x1, x3  x1 } and { x2 \\\\+ x1, x3  x1 }, respectively. Note that: (1) the content of the second polynomial is x2, which does not contribute to the generic points represented and thus can be removed; (2) the dimension of each component is 1, the number of free variables in the regular chain.  Formal definitions  The variables in the polynomial ring :R = k[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] are always sorted as x1 < ... < xn. A non-constant polynomial f in R can be seen as a univariate polynomial in its greatest variable. The greatest variable in f is called its main variable, denoted by mvar(f). Let u be the main variable of f and write it as :f = a_eu^e + \\\\cdots + a_0, where e is the degree of f w.r.t. u and a_e is the leading coefficient of f w.r.t. u. Then the initial of f is a_e and e is its main degree. *Triangular set A non-empty subset T of R is a triangular set, if the polynomials in T are non-constant and have distinct main variables. Hence, a triangular set is finite, and has cardinality at most n. *Regular chain Let T = {t1, ..., ts} be a triangular set such that mvar(t1) < ... < mvar(ts), h_i be the initial of ti and h be the product of hi's. Then T is a regular chain if : \\\\mathrm{resultant}(h, T) = \\\\mathrm{resultant}(\\\\cdots(\\\\mathrm{resultant}(h, t_s),\\\\ldots, t_i)\\\\cdots) eq 0, where each resultant is computed with respect to the main variable of ti, respectively. This definition is from Yang and Zhang, which is of much algorithmic flavor. *Quasi-component and saturated ideal of a regular chain The quasi-component W(T) described by the regular chain T is :W(T)=V(T)\\\\setminus V(h), that is, the set difference of the varieties V(T) and V(h). The attached algebraic object of a regular chain is its saturated ideal :\\\\mathrm{sat}(T)=(T):h^\\\\infty. A classic result is that the Zariski closure of W(T) equals the variety defined by sat(T), that is, :\\\\overline{W(T)}=V(\\\\mathrm{sat}(T)), and its dimension is n - T, the difference of the number of variables and the number of polynomials in T. *Triangular decompositions In general, there are two ways to decompose a polynomial system F. The first one is to decompose lazily, that is, only to represent its generic points in the (Kalkbrener) sense, : \\\\sqrt{(F)}=\\\\cap_{i=1}^{e}\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{sat}(T_i)}. The second is to describe all zeroes in the Lazard sense, : V(F)=\\\\cup_{i=1}^{e}W(T_i). There are various algorithms available for triangular decompositions in either sense.  Properties  Let T be a regular chain in the polynomial ring R. * The saturated ideal sat(T) is an unmixed ideal with dimension n ‚àí T. * A regular chain holds a strong elimination property in the sense that: : \\\\mathrm{sat}(T \\\\cap k[x_1, \\\\ldots , x_i]) = \\\\mathrm{sat}(T) \\\\cap k[x_1,\\\\ldots , x_i] . * A polynomial p is in sat(T) if and only if p is pseudo-reduced to zero by T, that is, : p\\\\in\\\\mathrm{sat}(T)\\\\iff \\\\mathrm{prem}(p, T)=0. :Hence the membership test for sat(T) is algorithmic. * A polynomial p is a zero-divisor modulo sat(T) if and only if \\\\mathrm{prem}(p, T) eq0 and \\\\mathrm{resultant}(p, T)=0. :Hence the regularity test for sat(T) is algorithmic. * Given a prime ideal P, there exists a regular chain C such that P = sat(C). * If the first element of a regular chain C is an irreducible polynomial and the others are linear in their main variable, then sat(C) is a prime ideal. * Conversely, if P is a prime ideal, then, after almost all linear changes of variables, there exists a regular chain C of the preceding shape such that P = sat(C). * A triangular set is a regular chain if and only if it is a Ritt characteristic set of its saturated ideal.

History The Faculty of Philosophy is the oldest faculty of the University of Zagreb, which dates its founding to 1669. Philosophy and humanities were taught at the University from the very beginning, while a separate faculty first came into existence in 1776 when the University was divided into Faculties of Philosophy, Theology and Law. In 1874 the modern University of Zagreb was officially established, with four faculties: Law, Theology, Philosophy and Medicine. The Faculty of Philosophy was called the Mudroslovni fakultet and had the following Chairs: * Philosophy * History * Croatian history * Slav philology * Classical philology - Latin * Classical philology - Greek The Faculty also served as the general scientific faculty, and since 1876 it taught geology, botany, physics, mathematics, and chemistry; since 1877 zoology; since 1882 pharmacy; since 1883 geography. In 1893, the Chair of Pedagogy was instituted. The Study of Archeology started in 1893. The Chair of German Philology was created in 1895. The Chair of Indo- Germanology was created in 1908, transformed into the Study of Indology in 1962. The Seminar on Romance Philology first started in 1920. The Chair of Ethnology was created in 1924/1927. The Art History Seminar was created in 1928. The Chair of Psychology was created in 1929. The English Seminar was created in 1935. Mathematics, pharmacy and other sciences started to split off in several stages, with the creation of separate mathematics and pharmaceutical departments in 1928, when the faculty was renamed into its current name Filozofski fakultet, and the splitting off of individual departments into separate faculties in 1942, 1946 and finally in 1963. The Institute of Phonetics was founded in 1954. The Chair of General Linguistics and Comparative Literature was created in 1956. The Chair of Sociology was created in 1963 (the Faculty of Law had one since 1906). The Study of Swedish started in 1985. In 1989, the Institute for Information Sciences was founded. In 1994, the Study of Hungarology started. In 2009, the faculty was occupied by students who demanded free education. The peaceful occupation started on April the 20th 2009 and ended on May 24. The second occupation started on November the 23rd 2009 and ended nearly two weeks later. Current organization There are two models of study programs: single major (all courses belong to one program) and double majors (student studies in two equally important programs for equal degrees in both): * Single major programs are Archaeology, Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Pedagogy, Information Science, History, Comparative literature, Italian language and literature, and Croatian language and literature. * Double major programs are Philosophy, Archaeology, History, Art History, Sociology, Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology, Comparative literature, Croatian language and literature, Pedagogy, Linguistics, Phonetics and languages and literature (English, French, German, Dutch studies, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Classic Philology (Greek and Latin), Turkish, Indology, East, West and South Slavic languages). The faculty has more than 700 employees, with more than 500 academic staff as well as more than 600 part- time lecturers. Departments The Faculty consists of following departments: *Department of English studies **Chair of Scandinavian studies *Department of archeology *Department of ethnology and cultural anthropology *Department of philosophy *Department of phonetics *Department of German studies *Department of information and communication sciences *Department of classical philology *Department of comparative literature *Department of Croatian studies *Department of linguistics *Department of indology and Far East studies **Chair of indology **Chair of sinology **Chair of Japanese studies *Department of turkology and Hungarian studies **Chair of turkology **Chair of Hungarian studies *Department of pedagogy *Department of history *Department of history of art *Department of psychology *Department of Romanic studies *Department of East Slavic languages and literatures *Department of South Slavic languages and literatures *Department of West Slavic languages and literatures *Department of sociology *Department of Italian studies *Chair of anthropology *Chair of Physical education Library Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences library. The Faculty Library moved into a new building opened in March 2009, becoming the second largest library in Croatia (after the nearby National and University Library in Zagreb). It includes 24 department libraries with more than 600 000 books. The library consists of the ground floor, 6 upper floors and a closed repository. The ground floor is mainly intended to be used for reading and writing, while the five upper floors contain books from all departments. , the sixth floor does not function yet. Books which have not been processed yet and are not available for public use are stored in the closed repository, located in the basement. There are 750 working places and 250 computers available for use. The library is open to all students and employees of the Faculty for borrowing books, while members of the public may use books and other resources within the library building. All members and library employees use Koha ‚Äì a library software which has several interfaces depending on the type of user. The catalogue is open access. It is possible to search for particular books by title, author, ISBN, subject, publisher and call number. The entire library system is highly technically advanced and equipped with models for supply, catalogization, public borrowing and statistics. One of the main advantages of the library is the 3M RFID system of electronic chips, which enables self-check, allowing users to borrow books by themselves.  2016 riots  During 2016, many students and professors became dissatisfied with the current dean, prof. dr. sc. Vlatko Previ≈°iƒá (specifically his organization of the university). Previ≈°iƒá planned to connect Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (famous for its many agnostic and atheist students) with Catholic Faculty of Theology, offering a double major in Theology and another field of the students' choice. Students at the Faculty of Humanities protested against this, claiming they do not want to be associated with a religious institution. They started posting memes of the dean Previ≈°iƒá online, as well as putting them up at various locations across the university (such as public halls, library, and the toilet). The dean responded by hiring personal security guards.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-students-vow-to- escalate-war-with-dean-09-28-2016 Many Croatian universities, institutions and charities also offered their support to the protesting students.

It can be functional and/or ornamental. There are several different types of living sculpture techniques, including topiary (prune plants or train them over frames), sod works (create sculptures using soil and grass or moss), tree shaping (growing designs with living trees) and mowing and crop art (create patterns or pictures with plants or in lawns). Most living sculpture technique requires horticultural skills, such as grafting or pruning, to create the art.  History  Sculptors through the ages have traditionally worked with non-living media such as clay, plaster, glass, bronze, or even plastic. Although sculpting plants isn‚Äôt a new idea (bonsai or topiary have long historical traditions), its recent rediscovery by artists, horticulturalists, gardeners, and young people has given living sculpture an innovative popularity. Living sculpture offers a highly appealing blend of art and science. It‚Äôs a creative process that gives the sculptor a chance to bring their own unique vision to life (literally!) Creating a living sculpture is also a collaborative process that can bring artistic minds, logistical minds, and scientific minds together. As a team project, creating a living sculpture can be about more than just art or science. A team collaborating to design and build a living sculpture can learn a lot about themselves, each other, and what partnerships are all about - while making a functional and/or ornamental public sculpture in their community.  Topiary  Beckley Park, Oxfordshire: cottage garden topiary formulas taken up for an early 20th-century elite English garden in a historic house setting One of the older and more familiar kinds of living sculpture, topiary is the art of growing dense, leafy plants and pruning them into a form, or training them over a frame, to create a three-dimensional object. It relies on pruning and training to give shape to an existing plant. It also can involve training a plant to fill in a form. Topiary is one type of living sculpture that has gone in and out of favor through the ages. A few historical highlights of its importance and use: *Earliest references of topiary date back to 23-79 A.D. *It was immensely popular in Ancient Rome using cypress trees, but after the fall of Rome, topiary fell out of favor for several hundred years. *It returned in medieval times as a way of training fruit plants, and then was again rediscovered during the Italian Renaissance. *The Dutch in the 15th century became intrigued with creating topiary in animal shapes, as did 17th century England; the French preferred creating topiary in geometric designs with strict symmetry. *18th century, topiary fell out of favor again, and a natural look returned. *Victorians brought back topiary, adding in new plants and details. *Topiary spread to North America at Williamsburg, Virginia, around 1690. *As houseplants became popular in the 1950s and 1960s, topiary moved indoors.  Turf and sodworks  Grasswoman sculpture at Eden Project Turf- or sod-works are created from grass or moss and soil. This type of art has roots in the Land Art movement (also known as the Earthworks or Earth Art movement) that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, landscape and the work of art began to be viewed as linked. Sculptures were not just placed in the landscape; rather the landscape became the very means of their creation. These works often existed in the open, located well away from communities, and were left to change under natural conditions. Many of the first works were created in the deserts of Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. They did not, or were not meant to last, and now exist only as recordings or photos. Works made from the earth are changing the way in which people view art, and often are used to promote environmental awareness. These works may be created on waste sites, and may draw attention to land reclamation and urban restoration efforts. Recent earth artists have worked with soil, sod, or moss to create forms that may be intimate and small, or large and multi-acre. They may be cut out of the earth, or formed with soil. They may give a nod to the past, or they may be cutting edge and contemporary in design. Some examples include labyrinths and mazes, animal and human forms, geometric shapes, and furniture. Espalier Espalier is the art and horticultural practice of training tree branches onto ornamental shapes along a frame for ascetic and fruit production by grafting, shaping and pruning the branches so that they grow flat, frequently in formal patterns, against a structure such as a wall, fence, or trellis. The practice is commonly used to accelerate and increase production in fruit-bearing trees and also to decorate flat exterior walls while conserving space. Pleaching Pleaching is a technique of weaving the branches of trees into a hedge commonly, deciduous trees are planted in lines, then pleached to form a flat plane on clear stems above the ground level. Branches are woven together and lightly tied.The Complete Guide to Pruning and Training Plants, Joyce and Brickell, 1992, page 106, Simon and Schuster Branches in close contact may grow together, due to a natural phenomenon called inosculation, a natural graft. Pleach also means weaving of thin, whippy stems of trees to form a basketry affect.  Bonsai  Bonsai is the art of aesthetic miniaturization of trees, or of developing woody or semi-woody plants shaped as trees, by growing them in containers. Cultivation includes techniques for shaping, watering, and repotting in various styles of containers.  Tree shaping  Tree shaping uses living trees as a medium to create structures and art for example, chairs, ladders, mirrors and people trees. There are a few different methods to create shaped trees, which share a common heritage with other artistic horticultural and agricultural practices, such as pleaching, bonsai, espalier, and topiary, and using some of the similar techniques. Tree shaping has been practiced for at least several hundred years, as demonstrated by the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people of India.  Creative Mowing and Crop Art  A crop circle in SwitzerlandCrop circles are created by crop artists plan in advance on paper, and often work with farmers, special equipment, and a diversity of crops to create multi-acre masterpieces that are viewed from the air and are captured via photographs. They draw on a variety of impressionist, surrealist, and modernist roots in their designs, and some are downright quirky: . Stan Herd is a renowned Crop artist.

In it had a population of . History The village was established on 29 July 1958 (12 Av 5718 anno mundi) by Kurdish immigrants from Iran on farm land that had belonged to the depopulated Palestinian village of Bayt Nattif. The place had formerly been known as Khirbet Jurfah,In the Survey of Western Palestine (Arabic and English Name Lists), London 1881, p. 307, E.H. Palmer describes the site Kh≈≠rbet Jurfa as \\"the ruin of the perpendicular bank (cut out by the torrent in the d√©bris of a valley).\\" where archaeological finds point to a Jewish settlement dating back to the early Hellenistic period and early Roman period. The newly restructured Jewish National Fund, working in concert with Hitahdut HaIkarim, settled new immigrants on the site in 1958, giving to the place the name Roglit (), meaning \\"tiller [of the grapevine]\\". The new immigrants were initially employed as laborers for Jewish National Fund land reclamation. Afterwards, the village economy was based on agriculture (citrus fruit) and poultry, which phased out in the late 1980s. A newer regional community center built alongside it was given the name Neve Michael, in memory of American philanthropist, Michael M. Weiss, who was a donor to the Jewish National Fund.Stone Monument in Neve Michael, in memory of Michael M. Weiss; In recognition of Michael M. Weiss The newer section had a regional elementary school which catered to children from the surrounding communities of Roglit, Aderet and Aviezer, but closed its doors in the early 1980s. Today, the grounds of the old school serve as a home for the mentally and physically disabled. When the new settlement of Neve Michael failed to attract new residents, the settlement of Neve Michael was merged with Roglit in 1983. A new Israel Border Police outpost was also built in Neve Michael, which was later abandoned after the Six-Day War, following the change in demarcation lines. The founders were joined by immigrants from North Africa, mainly Morocco.About Neve Michael Homee In 2005 the village started an expansion plan attracting many younger families to the moshav. The moshav has a mixed population with people of different, ages, ethnic background and Jewish religious observance. Within relatively short driving distances from the Moshav are the ruins known as Adullam and Hurvat Itri.

After interest in classical liberalism had declined in the 1920s and 1930s, the aim was to construct a new liberalism as a rejection of collectivism, socialism and laissez-faire liberalism. At the meeting, the term neoliberalism was coined by Alexander R√ºstow, referring to the rejection of the (old) laissez-faire liberalism.  Namesake  The colloquium was named after American journalist Walter Lippmann. Lippman's 1937 book An Enquiry into the Principles of the Good Society had been translated into French as La Cit√© libre and was studied in detail at the meeting.  Importance  Twenty-six intellectuals, including some of the most prominent liberal thinkers, took part. The participants chose to set up an organization to promote liberalism which was called the Comit√© international d'√©tude pour le renouveau du lib√©ralisme (CIERL). Though CIERL had few consequences because of the war, it inspired Friedrich Hayek in the postwar creation of the Mont Pelerin Society. Michel Foucault's 1978‚Äì1979 Coll√®ge de France lectures, published a quarter of a century later as The Birth of Biopolitics, drew attention to the importance of the Walter Lippmann Colloquium.  Ideological cleavages  The participants were divided into two primary camps; one, represented by Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Jacques Rueff, and √âtienne Mantoux, which advocated a strict adherence to Manchester liberalism and laissez-faire; the other camp, represented by Alexander R√ºstow, Raymond Aron, Wilhelm R√∂pke, Auguste Detoeuf, Robert Marjolin, Louis Marlio, and Walter Lippmann, opted for a kind of social liberalism which was more favorable to state intervention and regulation and Keynesian solutions.

The ratio of acid, AH and conjugate base, A‚àí, concentrations varies as the difference between the pH and the pKa varies, in accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pH of a solution of a monoprotic weak acid can be expressed in terms of the extent of dissociation. After rearranging the expression defining the acid dissociation constant, and putting pH = ‚àílog10[H+], one obtains :pH = pKa ‚Äì log ( [AH]/[A‚àí] ) This is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. It can be deduced from this expression that * when the acid is 1 % dissociated, that is, when [AH]/[A‚àí] = 100, pH = pKa ‚àí 2 * when the acid is 50 % dissociated, that is, when [AH]/[A‚àí] = 1, pH = pKa * when the acid is 99 % dissociated, that is, when [AH]/[A‚àí] = 0.01, pH = pKa \\\\+ 2 It follows that the range of pH within which there is partial dissociation of the acid is about pKa ¬± 2. This is shown graphically at the right. A practical application of these results is that the pH transition range of a pH indicator is approximately pKa ¬± 1; the colour of the indicator in its acid form is different from the colour of the conjugate base form. In the transition range both forms are in equilibrium, so the colour is intermediate. Outside the transition range the concentration of acid or conjugate base is less than 10 % and the colour of the major species dominates. Species concentrations calculated with the program HySS for a 10 mM solution of citric acid. pKa1 = 3.13, pKa2 = 4.76, pKa3 = 6.40. A weak acid may be defined as an acid with pKa greater than about ‚àí2. An acid with pKa = ‚àí2 would be 99 % dissociated at pH 0, that is, in a 1 M HCl solution. Any acid with a pKa less than about ‚àí2 is said to be a strong acid. Strong acids are said to be fully dissociated. There is no precise pKa value that distinguishes between strong and weak acids because strong acids, such as sulfuric acid, are associated in very concentrated solution. Calculation of the species concentrations for a polyprotic acid is more complicated unless the pK values are separated by four or more, because three or more species may co-exist at a given pH. The example of citric acid is shown at the right. The pH regions in which the species exist overlap extensively since the difference between successive pKa values is small. A large number of computer programs for the calculation of equilibrium species concentrations have been published. Most of them can handle much more complicated equilibria than acid-base equilibria in solution. For details concerning general purpose programs see computer programs for calculating species concentrations in chemical equilibrium.

It can be configured for PXE, reinstallations, and virtualized guests using Xen, KVM or VMware. Cobbler interacts with the \`koan\` program for re-installation and virtualization support. \`koan\` and Cobbler use libvirt to integrate with different virtualization software. Cobbler is able to manage complex network scenarios like bridging on a bonded Ethernet link. The Cobbler project was born at Red Hat and lead by Michael DeHaan.http://www.linux- magazine.com/Issues/2009/98/Cobbler Cobbler builds on the Kickstart mechanism and offers installation profiles that can be applied to one or many machines. It also features integration with Yum to aid in machine installs. Cobbler has features to dynamically change the information contained in a kickstart template (definition), either by passing variables called ksmeta or by using so-called snippets. An example for a ksmeta variable could be the name of a disk device in the system. This could be inherited from the system's Cobbler profile. Snippets can be dynamic Python code that expands the limited functionality of Anaconda. The combination of profiles, ksmeta and snippets gives Cobbler high flexibility; complexity is avoided by keeping the actual \\"code\\" in the snippets, of which there can be one for each task in an installation. There are examples for network setup or disk partitioning; keeping common code in snippets helps minimize the size of the kickstart files. Cobbler was originally targeted for RPM-based installs via Kickstart and Anaconda and was previously hosted as part of the Fedora Project. Since Jan 19, 2011, Cobbler has been packaged for Ubuntu. Since 2012, Canonical Ltd has used Cobbler for test automation of OpenStack on Ubuntu. Red Hat's systems management application, Satellite, used Cobbler for provisioning up until RHEL 6.0.

History  The engines were manufactured for the metre gauge route between Eichst√§tt-Stadt and Eichst√§tt-Bahnhof. In 1885 the railway procured two units and, in 1892, a third. After the 5.2 kilometre long line was extended from Eichst√§tt by 30 kilometres, two more engines were added in 1898 and 1900. The machines carried railway numbers I - V. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over all five engines in 1925 as Class 99.07 with numbers 99 071‚Äì99 075. The first two locomotives were retired by 1932, the remaining three in 1935, after the whole route was converted to standard gauge.  Technical Features  The engines were of a design by Krauss that, in similar dimensions, was used for other classes, include some for the Felda Railway, later the Prussian T 31, and designated by the factory as XXXV. The locomotives had a box frame with a water tank. The short boiler barrel comprised two boiler rings. On top of the boiler were the steam dome, two spring-balance, safety valves and a sand dome. The flat valves were operated by an Allan valve gear, the connecting rod worked the third axle. On the first locomotives the driving gear was also covered, but these were removed around 1908. The coal bunkers were located in front of the driver's cab. The engines carried up to 1.77 m3 of water and 0.65 tonnes of coal. The air pump for the compressed-air brake was positioned at the front right, next to the smokebox, the air reservoirs were on the right and left of the boiler and the silencer was fixed to the chimney.

The album contains 14 tracks, including an instrumental, \\"Fiddlefolkpunk\\". Thematically, the album focusses on creatures of mythology like sirens (\\"Sirenen\\"), werewolves (\\"Wolfsmensch\\") and spirits (as in \\"Stunde des Lichts\\"). The track \\"Drei Lieder\\" (Three Songs) tells of a young bard who participates in a singers' competition to take revenge on the prince who once destroyed his native village and killed his only brother. \\"Die K√∂nigin\\" (The Queen) is about a bewitched woman who was once good-natured but has been turned into a dragon. The track \\"Anderswelt\\"(Other-world) deals with mysterious sightings of figures from the Other-world who were spotted near a Celtic shrine. Reception The album remained in the German Longplay Charts for fifteen weeks, peaking at #8, in the Austrian charts for 3 weeks, peaking at #43 and in the Swiss charts for 2 weeks, peaking at #44. The Austrian webzine Stormbringer lauded the album's diversity and balance and rated it five stars out of five.

Martinez graduated from the University of Florida in 1989 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography. He continued his education at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University, earning his Master of Fine Arts in Photography in 1991. Martinez attended the Skowhegan School of Sculpture and Painting in 2003. Martinez was a Pew Fellowship in the Arts recipient in 2001 and was a Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship recipient in 2003. He has received two Individual Artists Grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. Martinez has been an artist-in- residence at both the Fabric Workshop and Museum and at the Rosenbach Museum and Library, both in Philadelphia. Martinez's work over the last seventeen years has most often been focused upon the male body. Early on, Martinez used his own naked body in both photography and performance-based works. His work from about 1997 to present has in many ways embodied the homosexual male gaze upon the heterosexual male body. The work typically evokes tension and apprehension. His best-known body of work perhaps is \\"Self Portraits by Heterosexual Men.\\" In 1998, Martinez created ambrotypes from 'self-portraits' recorded on 35mm film by one hundred, presumably straight men who took the shots at the point of manually, self-induced ecstasy (with the assistance of a cable release). In 2007, Martinez revisited this project arming the performers with a digital camera and a remote controlled shutter release with multi- exposure capabilities. This allowed the men to snap several photos during the time of expulsion and gave Martinez the ability to select the most expressive image for the individual giving insight on the location and objects the performer kept around at the time of the act. The project was composed of one hundred 20\\" x 30\\" framed c-prints. Martinez held the position of Director of Graduate Photography Studies from 2004 to 2007 at the University of Pennsylvania and is currently the Coordinator of Undergraduate Photography at University of Pennsylvania. Martinez work has been exhibited extensively: the Philadelphia Museum of Art (2006); Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, Miami, FL (2004); Philadelphia Art Alliance (2003); Nexus Gallery, Philadelphia (1998, 1995); White Columns, New York, NY (1995).

He served as the British Ambassador to Iraq, Jordan and Tunisia before becoming an academic at Exeter University. Biography The son of John William Balfour Paul, he was born in Moniaive in Dumfriesshire, educated at Lime House school near Carlisle, then at Sedbergh School, before going to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1936, to read Classics. He served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders during World War II before being sent east to Egypt and then on to Sudan to the Sudan Defence Force. After the war he served the Sudan Political Service as a District Commissioner in the Blue Nile and Darfur provinces. Before leaving Sudan in 1954, he set out on a camel trek to explore the foothills of eastern Ennedi in nearby Chad. After some days alone he met up with his local guide, Ordugu, who had worked with Wilfred Thesiger on his expedition to the Tibesti Mountains decades earlier. On returning to Britain he joined the Diplomatic Service. Following a first posting in Santiago he became First Secretary in Beirut and later Political Agent in Dubai, followed by a brief stint in Bahrain as Deputy to William Luce. He was appointed Ambassador to Iraq in 1969, Ambassador to Jordan in July 1972 and then Ambassador to Tunisia 1975-77. Having retired from the diplomatic service aged 60, Balfour Paul became Director-General of the Middle East Association in London before joining Exeter University as a Research Fellow in the Centre for Arab Gulf Studies.The Independent, p.36, 24 July 2008 Whilst at Exeter he produced the volume The End of Empire in the Middle East (1991), and the Middle East section of The Oxford History of the British Empire.

Career Slik and PVC2 Future Ultravox and Live Aid organiser, guitarist and singer Midge Ure, drummer Kenny Hyslop, keyboardist Billy McIsaac and bassist Jim McGinlay had been gaining commercial successes as a band named Slik, playing in a variety of styles, such as glam, soft rock and bubblegum pop. With the advent of punk rock, McGinlay left in early 1977. Webb, who had recently dropped out of university, replaced him. Shortly afterwards the band changed their name to PVC2 and their musical style to punk. PVC2 released one single, \\"Put You in the Picture\\", in 1977. Zones Ure joined Glen Matlock's Rich Kids and by late 1977/early 1978, Webb and the rest of PVC2 called Alex Harvey's cousin Willie Gardner to replace him, founding Zones. This band released singles during 1978 and 1979 and one album called Under Influence in the latter year. The Zones failed and split up shortly afterwards.  Skids  Webb joined Skids halfway through their career in February 1980, replacing co-founder William Simpson. He performed on the last two Skids albums, The Absolute Game released in 1980 and 1981's Joy. During that time, he collaborated with Jobson on his solo career and engineering The Who's new recordings, which were incomplete because that band split up.  The Armoury Show  After Skids broke up, he and Jobson along with guitarist John McGeoch (formerly of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees) and drummer John Doyle (also of Magazine) formed The Armoury Show in 1983. They recorded one album called Waiting for the Floods, which was critically acclaimed but a commercial letdown. The band released singles until 1988, when they broke up. The Armoury Show recorded a second album for Parlophone which was to feature a song entitled \\"I Will Find You\\" sung by Webb; however, Jobson and Webb disbanded the group before the album was released. Following a discussion with Jobson and Clive Black of Parlophone, Webb agreed to allow the album to be issued under Jobson's name, entitled Badman. Public Image Ltd In mid-to-end 1992, Webb joined John Lydon's post-Sex Pistols band, Public Image Ltd, replacing bassist Allan Dias. The Ring, Lost After PiL, Webb formed his own band called The Ring, which toured Europe opening for Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads in promotion of his second solo album Casual Gods in 1988, but no commercial success followed. Webb retired from performing to design board games. Following a discussion with Richard Branson at the latter's knighthood party, Branson agreed to take Webb's first board game (4 years in the making) entitled Lost to Necker Island for play testing with his family and children. The play testing was a success, but no game was released. Instead it became the initial inspiration for JJ Abrams' hit TV show Lost, for which Webb was never credited. Webb continued to work on projects with his Armoury Show associate, John McGeoch, until the latter's death in 2004. Webb contributes music to dramas by Blue Hours Productions, a company specializing in retro horror/sci-fi/fantasy drama for radio and the Internet. He lives in England.

Boaz's Field) is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Located on a hill above Neve Daniel, it falls under the jurisdiction of Gush Etzion Regional Council. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History The settlement was established in 2002 by Hananel Shear-Yashuv, who claimed the land by moving a shipping container to the top of the hill and moving into it. It is named after Boaz from the Book of Ruth. In its charter, Sde Boaz proclaims its desire to live in peace with its Arab neighbors and eschew violence. It is an environmentally friendly agricultural community that accepts both religious and non-religious Jews. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called outposts like Sde Boaz a \\"disgrace.\\" On taking office in 2006, Olmert began the destruction of illegal outposts in order to comply with the terms of the Road map for peace and by 2008 had agreed to dismantle Sde Boaz among these. In 2006 Sde Boaz was the site of a massive protest against the court-ordered Israeli Defense Force (IDF) destruction of illegal Israeli construction. The IDF managed to destroy a small house and a stable as the court had ordered, but hundreds of Israeli protesters prevented the soldiers from destroying the foundation of a house under construction. By 2008, some residents of Sde Boaz were being trained by Mishmeret Yesha, a non-profit organization that teaches settlers counterterrorism techniques and the use of guns so that they can form \\"rapid response teams.\\" The IDF supplies settlers who've received the training with M16 rifles and ammunition. Demographics Most of the residents are professionals who commute to work. Apart from communal agriculture projects, some families engage in private organic farming, raising chickpeas, cauliflower, tomatoes, watermelons, lettuce, grapes, mulberries and olives. Experimental crops include tomatillos, North American pumpkins and sweet peas.

Captured weapons were designated by the Wehrmacht during World War II as the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 237(i).  Variants  Special fortress versions were produced as the Cannone da 75/27 modello 06 in Casmatta and Caverna. These had different carriages suitable for static use. A high- angle pedestal mount for anti-aircraft use was produced and these were assigned to coastal defense and second line units during World War II. In 1915 the anti-aircraft version formed the basis of Italy's first truck mounted artillery called the Autocannone da 75/27 CK. Eventually twenty-seven batteries of five guns were formed during World War I. Between the wars, many guns were modernized for tractor-towing with pressed-steel wheels and rubber rims. These weighed some more than the original version with spoked wooden wheels. The Cannone da 75/27 modello 12 was a modello 06 modified for greater elevation (-12¬∞ to +18¬∞ 30') and lighter weight (only ). Only small numbers seem to have been produced.

He is married to actress Judi Bowker.  Biography  Harry Meacher grew up in Hainault, near Chigwell, in Essex. In his teens he worked with Joan Littlewood in Stratford and with James Cooper in Ilford. He won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, then performed at the Royal Court Theatre, in London's West End and at many leading regional venues. At the National Theatre he worked under Laurence Olivier, and later played Martin Dysart there during the run of the original production of Equus directed by John Dexter. One of his early appearances as a leading actor was seen by Alec Guinness, who said to him afterwards, \\"You were very good. The Times said so. I read their review. And I know you did - because you were playing the review, rather than the part! Promise me you will stop reading reviews.\\" Meacher stopped reading drama criticism. Roles in Shakespeare included Pistol to Frank Middlemass's Falstaff, and Exton to Ian McKellen's Richard II. In the death scene at one performance, Exton's blade broke the skin on the King's back; McKellen appeared ready for the curtain call handing Meacher a stiff drink to help him get over it. He also performed in Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Dream. His screen appearances have ranged from series such as Dixon of Dock Green, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Softly Softly, Special Branch and The Troubleshooters Encyclopaedia of Television Ed. Horace Newcomb, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Second Edition 2004 to major films, including Trial By Combat, Transatlantis and Kannibal.The British Film Catalogue 1895-1985, Ed.Denis Gifford, Volume One, Third Edition, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 2000. He has written and adapted plays which have been performed in London, and he toured the Mediterranean with his wife Judi Bowker in his own play The Brownings. His plays Buccaneer and A Haunting Twist have been seen in New York and elsewhere in America. He has toured capital cities in the Middle and Far East, Australia and New Zealand. His adaptations include works by Chekhov, Ibsen, Strindberg, Gorky and Dickens. With Kit Gerould he co-wrote The Sensualist which played at the Arts Theatre in London. He directed and performed in Uncle Vanya which won Time Out's Critics' Choice award. He has played the title roles in King Lear, Macbeth, Othello, Richard III, Ivanov, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice and Prospero in The Tempest. In his own adaptation from Conan Doyle, he portrayed Sherlock Holmes. He directed Hedda Gabler starring his wife Judi Bowker. Over his many productions, he built up at North West London theatre venues and sometimes touring wider afield what was in effect the nucleus of a smallscale classical company, performing both Shakespeare and the later literary greats. As well as Judi Bowker, the team often included Georgia Cardy, Bryan Hands, Emily Holden, Adam Lewis, Seamus Newham, Tom Reah, Roger Sansom and Jonson Wilkinson. He co-founded Coachhouse Films, whose work has been shown on television. References External links *  Documentary Sources  *Who's Who In The Theatre Sixteenth Edition Edited by Ian Herbert Pub.

The large Ruvu River crosses the reserve and the forest stretches to the top of the nearby hills. It is interspersed by massive rock outcrops and has several permanent small streams. During the 20th century, Kimboza was depleted by deforestation and commercial logging. Over the past two decades, the forest has been repeatedly affected by large fires that have spread from the surrounding land as a result of slash-and-burn agriculture. Local inhabitants have played a role in conserving the forest despite issues with land rights. Local communities and the Tanzanian Forest Agency have been involved in a joint forest management program. Due to the severe shortage of resources, limited successes have been achieved. The area is of special conservation interest due to its exceptional biodiversity, including many endemic plants and animals. Many medicinal wild plant species are used by local inhabitants around the Kimboza Forest Reserve. Kimboza National Forest Reserve was established in 1964. It is currently recognized as an IUCN Category IV ‚Äî Habitat/Species Management Area.ProtectedPlanet.net Kimboza Forest Reserve The area is home to at least 226 vertebrate species, including 52 amphibians and 174 mammals.

Born in Wilmslow, Cheshire, England, in 1923,Gifford D. Obituary: Syd Lawrence. The Independent (7 May 1998) (accessed 20 April 2010) Lawrence was a talented trumpet player during World War II. He wrote and arranged music. He was based in Cairo during the war years, playing and arranging for the RAF service bands. After he left the armed forces, he played with some of the leading British dance bands of the 1940s, finally being invited to join the BBC Northern Dance Orchestra in 1953. He stayed with this band for sixteen years playing alongside fellow trumpet player Stan Hibbert. In 1967, Lawrence teamed up with several of his colleagues at the Northern Dance Orchestra to play the music that he was most enthusiastic about, that of Glenn Miller. Early concerts at the Mersey Hotel in Manchester were a success, and larger venues were found to play in as the reputation of his band grew. Yorkshire Television gave the Syd Lawrence Orchestra a regular spot on the comedy show Sez Les. As the music became more popular, Lawrence and his band started touring around the UK, which they did with great success for many years. Several records were made along with radio and television appearances on variety shows. He appeared with his band on 3-2-1 and also occasionally was a vocalist. Lawrence retired from touring in 1994 and died of an aneurysm in 1998. Following his death, the Syd Lawrence Band continued on and still tours. The orchestra has been led by Brian Pendleton, and presently by Chris Dean. In 2011 it was voted the Best Big Band in the Land for the 11th consecutive year.

Asaf Hill) is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank. Located from the settlement of Beit El, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It has about 30 structures and is home to some 30 families. It was established in May 2001 after the murder of Asaf Hershkovitz, a resident of Ofra, for whom it was named. The international community, excluding the United States, considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. According to the 2005 Sasson Report, Giv'at Asaf was built on privately owned Palestinian land, and is therefore also illegal under Israeli law. Two IDF soldiers were killed in a shooting near the settlement on 13 December 2018. Establishment Giv'at Asaf was established in 2001 and named after Assaf Hershkovitz, a 31-year-old settler from Ofra who was shot dead by Palestinian gunmen. A placard was placed at the entrance of the outpost that said \\"We have come back home\\". According to Benny Gal, the community leader, \\"On this exact spot, 3,800 years ago, the land of Israel was promised to the Hebrew people\\". Status A demarcation order was issued in 2004, and renewed in 2006, to establish the boundaries of the outpost, but building beyond it went on despite the order. In 2004, then Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz issued an order to evacuate illegal outposts, including Giv'at Asaf. In 2006, his successor Amir Peretz extended the evacuation order by two years following a petition filed by the settlers, announcing that at the end of that period the settlers would be evacuated by force if needed. In 2008, Defense Minister Ehud Barak announced that the order would be extended for an additional year, during which the state would attempt to negotiate with the settlers. In May 2009, in response to a petition filed by Peace Now, the Supreme Court issued an order demanding that the state explain within 90 days why the illegal outposts have not yet been evacuated. In March 2011, in response to another petition by Peace Now, the Israeli government announced its decision to dismantle all illegal outposts built on private Palestinian land by the end of 2011, including Giv'at Asaf. The residents of Giv'at Asaf vowed \\"a violent struggle\\" against their removal. In November 2011, the government asked the Supreme Court to give them an extension for the Giv'at Asaf razing, affirming that it is in talks with the outpost's representatives, and is asking them to clear out by 1 July 2012. A case involving the forging of documents for a land sale at Giv'at Asaf led to an indictment for illegal land transference from Palestinians to Israelis. The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court Judge's decision in October 2009 said \\"The move was intended to transfer lands owned by Arab residents to the ownership of Jews. The success of the conspiracy by the accused and his colleagues was liable, with very great likelihood, to have aroused hostilities between population groups in this context that could have been considered land theft.\\" In 2011, fifteen gravestones in the Mamilla Cemetery were spray painted with red graffiti that said \\"Death to the Arabs\\" and the name of the Giv'at Asaf outpost in a \\"price- tag\\" attack. In November 2011, the apartment building in Jerusalem where Peace Now's Settlement Watch director Hagit Ofran lives was sprayed with the slogans \\"the revenge of Givat Assaf\\", \\"regards from Oz Zion\\", and \\"death to Hagit Ofran\\". Haaretz reported that it was probably a response to the Oz Zion outpost's evacuation and the government's decision to evacuate the Giv'at Asaf outpost. In May 2013, the Israeli government announced it was considering legalizing Giv'at Asaf, along with three other unauthorized outposts. According to the state, while Giv'at Asaf had originally been deemed problematic, the land on which it sat had since been purchased. In response, the US State Department said the US would not \\"accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity\\" and that \\"continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace\\". In May 2014, settlers dismantled four homes in the outpost built on private Palestinian property in accordance with a High Court of Justice order issued in response to a 2007 petition by Peace Now. Impact on Palestinians According to Haaretz, since the outpost was established, Palestinians from the village of Burqa have been unable to access the direct road that links their village to Route 60 and the neighboring village of Beitin, which has resulted in what was \\"a trip of a few minutes\\" becoming \\"a long, circuitous journey\\".Amira Hass, In West Bank, buying land isn't always what it seems,' at Haaretz, January 10, 2012.

He played for the Cleveland Indians from April 17, 1945, to September 22, 1945. Cihocki was born in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, where he played sandlot ball with Steve Bilko, his cousin who also went on to play in the major leagues, as well as Pete Gray. He originally tried out for the Philadelphia Phillies organization in 1941 and Wilkes-Barre Barons in 1942 but failed to make the cut for either team. Cihocki then joined the Batavia Clippers as a third baseman, where he had a batting average of .342 and was named to the New York‚ÄìPenn League's All-Star team. After finishing the season, he joined the United States Coast Guard, and served for two years at the United States Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Baltimore. Early in 1945, he received a medical discharge from the Coast Guard, and resumed his professional baseball career with the Cleveland Indians organization. Due to a lack of players available as a result of the war, Cihocki made the major league squad and remained there throughout the season. In 92 career games, Cihocki had a .212 batting average. After one season with the Indians, he joined the Baltimore Orioles, where he spent the next seven years. During his time with the Orioles, he played 850 total games, and was considered the team's \\"Iron Man\\". He also spent one year with the Sabios de Vargas of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, playing in 14 games for them. The Orioles released Cihocki after the 1952 season, and he continued to play on and off until 1958, where he spent his final year in professional baseball with the Allentown Red Sox. After retiring from baseball, he coached various minor league teams and served as a corrections officer at the Dallas Correctional Institution. He died on March 27, 2014.

His batting average was second-best in the Three-I League behind teammate Floyd \\"Pat\\" Patterson's .348 average.

It aired on September 23, 2008. Plot Two women are playing tennis when one of them collapses, clutching at her chest. On a construction site, a crane worker dies in his seat. A fighter dies in the middle of a MMA match. A tuba instructor starts coughing up blood in the middle of a lesson and expires. Thirteen interrupts a college class to confirm the math instructor, Apple, had a corneal transplant five years ago, then informs her that four other people who received a transplant from the same donor died. Apple is taken to the hospital where they determine four of the victims are dead and one more, an elderly man named Frank, is on the verge of death. The team is unable to determine a common denominator and House is more concerned about Wilson's absence. Finally House goes with a diagnosis of cancer and orders them to run more tests. He then approaches Dr. O'Shea as a possible Wilson-replacement. Foreman arrives to inform House that Apple's eye is failing and they have to remove it. She had taken an eye test and had gotten it wildly wrong, but did not squint. House then states that her eye thinks it is fine, but that eyes do not think, but only brains. He then states that it is too late to remove her eye, and instead has to remove her head, as he brandishes a giant meat cleaver. As he swings the meat cleaver towards her, Apple starts screaming. However it's soon revealed that this is nothing more than Apple's imagination and back in reality, House realizes that Apple is hallucinating. House reviews a video of the kickboxer looking for signs of brain damage. The coffee machine repairman interrupts to berate Taub and Thirteen for being idiots. They conclude he's a private investigator and House admits hiring him. House is impressed at his thoroughness. They need to do a brain biopsy and appeal to Frank's wife for approval. Taub reluctantly tells Frank's wife the truth. The wife refuses to allow the procedure. Frank suddenly stops breathing and dies despite Taub's efforts. They determine Frank's brain is clean and House still suspects cancer. Kutner suggests a perforated intestine and bacterial infection that spread through the blood and infected all the organs. House meets with Lucas, who figures that House wants to hire him to check out Wilson. House asks if there is something, and Lucas admits there is not. House returns to the hospital where Kutner and Foreman inform him the colonoscopy proved clean. House still believes in cancer and Kutner suggests they use a high-pressure water jet to apply pressure to Frank's colon. There are no leaks but Foreman spots what appears to be a core lesion. Apple's heart starts racing but there's no indication her colon is leaking. The team has nothing new and House orders chemo for the cancer he suspects she has. He goes to her room and signals an emergency when he cannot find the medical records on Apple's bed. He then asks Apple to sign a consent form to receive chemotherapy. As she signs, Apple talks about how she was an architect but gave it up after her corneal transplant. Apple notes that House does not seem much different, and he notes that at least he has not given up. Lucas tells House that Wilson has a new job. He points a woman out that he's following because he likes her, then informs House that Wilson is attending grief counseling and Cameron and Cuddy have been at his house several times. Lucas starts following the girl and House has to trail along. The girl finally confronts them and says they're making her uncomfortable. After she leaves, Lucas notes that Wilson has not said anything about House. House gets a page and heads to the hospital where Apple is vomiting from the chemo but her system is stabilizing. Foreman is surprised House was right, but House concludes that it is not cancer. Back in differential, House notes he never thought it was cancer but thought it acted like cancer. Now he wants to find something that is similar to cancer, and notes the last patient was using methotrexate for his arthritis, which allegedly would also have treated any cancer. He goes to Wilson and asks for an epiphany, wanting to bounce ideas off of him. Wilson tries to shut him out and House asks how he's doing. Wilson begs him not to do this so he can move on, and House accuses him of talking to the others. House admits he hired a private detective to watch Wilson because they're not friends anymore, then tries to convince Wilson to help with a diagnosis. Wilson refuses to participate and warns he will not answer the door the next time House knocks. Lucas is outside and tries to advise House on friendship, and inadvertently gives House a new way to think about a possible diagnosis. House goes to see Cuddy and shows her Apple's CAT scan. It indicates something is in there that her brain is not compensating for. House believes that the donor had cancer stem cells spread in his organs, and when transplanted these spread and attached themselves to the recipients' various organs, which eventually stopped working. He wants to open up Apple's skull before it's too late for her, and Cuddy wonders if House is going to do something to make Apple crash prematurely. She puts security guards on Apple's room, so House convinces Lucas to disguise himself as a nurse and replace Apple's IV meds with a saline solution. She crashes and is taken into surgery where they have to open up her skull. House suggests from the observation deck that they check her IV. Chase suddenly realizes that House had somehow had the IV switched, triggering the operation by deception. Chase wants to abort the operation, but House observes that they've already completed the most dangerous procedure, so they might as well continue. Lucas comes into the observation gallery and is alarmed that the patient whose IV he had switched is undergoing such a serious operation. House explains that he is a better liar than Lucas. Meanwhile, the doctors finish the operation, using a neural net on Apple's brain to detect and remove defective brain cells. Later, House goes to visit Apple and explains that the world is ugly but not as ugly as she thought. Her brain was not working properly and the transplanted brain cells were making things dull and unattractive to her. He takes off the bandages over her eyes and Apple sees the world with normal vision. House asks \\"How do I look?\\", and she responds \\"You look sad.\\" House is in his office and calls to ask Lucas if he would work on retainer.

Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional life-cycle assessments. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements) required for producing a particular product or service. EIO-LCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product. To the extent that the good or service of interest is representative of a sector, EIO-LCA can provide very fast estimates of full supply chain implications for that good or service. Background Economic input-output analysis was developed by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief. It quantifies the interrelationships among sectors of an economic system, enabling identification of direct and indirect economic inputs of purchases. This concept was extended by including data about environmental and energy analysis from each sector to account for supply chain environmental implications of economic activity.Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input-Output Approach, Resources for the Future Press. Theory Input-output transactions tables, which track flows of purchases between sectors, are collected by the federal government in the United States. EIO works as follows: If X_{ij} represents the amount that sector j purchased from sector i in a given year and y_i is the \\"final demand\\" for output from sector i (i.e., the amount of output purchased for consumption, as opposed to purchased by other businesses as supplies for more production), then the total output x_i from sector i includes output to consumers plus output sold to other sectors: x_i = y_i + \\\\sum_jX_{ij} If we define A_{ij} as the normalized production for each sector, so that A_{ij} = X_{ij}/x_j, then x_i = y_i + \\\\sum_jA_{ij}x_j In vector notation \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{y} + \\\\mathbf{Ax} \\\\mathbf{y} = (\\\\mathbf{I - A})\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mathbf{x} = (\\\\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\\\\mathbf{y} This result indicates that knowing only the final demand from each sector \\\\mathbf{y} and the normalized IO matrix \\\\mathbf{A}, one can calculate the total implied production \\\\mathbf{x} from each sector of the economy. If data are available on a particular emissions release (or other attribute of interest) from each sector of the economy, then a matrix \\\\mathbf{R} can be compiled to represent various releases (columns) per $ output from each sector (rows). Total additional emissions \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{b} associated with additional final demand of \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{y} can then be calculated as: \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\mathbf{R}^T\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{R}^T(\\\\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{y} This simple result enables very quick analysis, taking into account releases associated with the entire supply chain requirements needed to provide a specific final demand, on average. The equations are based on average data in the current economy, but they can be used to make predictions for marginal changes in output (such as one more unit of a particular product) if # average output and marginal output are assumed to be sufficiently close (i.e., the impact of one more unit = the impact of the average unit), and # the marginal change in final output \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{y} is representative of the product of interest (ex: if the product will use electricity from wind energy exclusively, then using the electricity sector, which is dominated by coal, would yield a poor estimate). Finally, if the researcher has estimates for valuation of externality costs associated with each item in \\\\mathbf{b} (or, alternatively, if weighting coefficients are available that represent the relative importance of each item in \\\\mathbf{b}, using ecological indicators, for example) then the externality costs (or weights) per unit of releases could be compiled into a vector \\\\mathbf{m} in order to calculate the scalar \\"environmental impact metric\\" m: \\\\Delta m = \\\\mathbf{m}^T\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\mathbf{m}^T\\\\mathbf{R}^T\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{m}^T\\\\mathbf{R}^T(\\\\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{y} Generally there is wide uncertainty associated with estimates of \\\\mathbf{m}, so such aggregation should be done only with care, including sensitivity analysis. Typically, researchers examine specific elements of \\\\mathbf{b} rather than attempting to aggregate. The big picture result is that by collecting data on average economic sector transactions \\\\mathbf{A} and average sector emissions \\\\mathbf{R}, it is possible to make quick predictions about the full supply chain emissions associated with a product of interest by representing the product as marginal changes in production from relevant sectors \\\\mathbf{y}. Software Researchers at the Green Design Institute of Carnegie Mellon University began developing a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s. The underlying softwarewww.eiolca.net traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions associated with the production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy. In 2018, VitalMetrics Group, an environmental consultancy, developed a web-based Spend Analysis Toolwww.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/ for quantifying the environmental impacts associated with an organization‚Äôs entire upstream supply chain.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 30, 2011 coastal estuary and river draining through the Scarborough Marsh in Scarborough, Maine. It empties into Saco Bay between Pine Point Beach and Western Beach and marks the bay's northern end. The main tributaries are the Nonesuch River, Dunstan River, and Libby River, as well as smaller brooks and streams. In its natural state, it was a sediment sink for Saco Bay, storing sediment migrating northward up the bay from the beaches to the south and ultimately from the Saco River. The channel migrated regularly in response to natural events; as it did so, abandoned sand banks would replenish the sand on both Pine Point Beach to the south and Western and Ferry beaches to the north. In the early 17th century, Christopher Levett gave the name of the river, or perhaps the marshes it drains, as Owascoag, after the Abenaki Indian name. The English fishing fleet offshore in 1624 was over 50 vessels, and the shores of the river were settled by fishermen and their families early in the period of English settlement; when the primary road in Maine ran along the coastline for its entire length, a ferry operated across the mouth of the river, running from Pine Point Beach to Ferry Beach. Downeaster passenger train traveling across Scarborough Marsh In the late 19th century, Little River Inlet, a tidal reentrant located at the south end of Pine Point Beach, was dammed and diverted into the Scarborough River. In 1962, the Army Corps of Engineers stabilized the river channel, in part by building a jetty at the southern edge of the river mouth. This has allowed a stable river channel for use by those fishing and pleasure boats harbored in the river and for occasional launches from a town-managed dock. The stabilized channel gradually fills with sediment, and has needed to be dredged roughly every five years. Materials from the 2004 dredging were deposited on Western Beach in imitation of the natural sediment flow.

He was the son of Theodore Claudius Pease, briefly a professor at Andover Theological Seminary before his sudden death, and his wife Abby Frances Cutter Pease. Pease was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and while living there he acquainted himself with the plants growing in the towns of Essex County. Pease said of his early life: > I will confess that I am by nature a collector, that I began with marbles > and horse chestnuts, advanced to postage stamps, continued with botany and > books, and at all times have gathered facts and occasional ideas. After earning his terminal degree, Pease travelled to Europe and spent most of his time there in Italy and Greece. In 1909, Pease married Henrietta Faxon in Cohasset, Massachusetts. Their only child, Henrietta Faxon Pease, was born July 14, 1912. She grew up and married the pioneering anthropologist and primatologist Sherwood \\"Sherry\\" Washburn in 1939. They had two children -- Sherwood (\\"Tuck\\") and Stan -- and at least six grandchildren. University of California San Francisco Chronicle New York Times Academic career Pease attended Harvard College and Harvard University and received AB (1902), AM (1903), and PhD (1905) degrees in classical studies. From 1906 to 1909 he taught Latin at Harvard and Radcliffe College. From 1909 to 1924 he taught at the University of Illinois. Pease starting teaching at Amherst College in 1924 and was appointed college president in 1927. According to a Time magazine's account of his appointment: > He is less of a liberal than Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, Amherst's eighth > president; he is less of an administrator than Dr. George D. Olds, Amherst's > ninth president. But, as a distinguished scholar, he fulfills the > presidential needs of a small New England college. Time magazine (Monday, > Jul. 04, 1927) Five years later, Pease resigned from the presidency of Amherst College to return to his alma mater again as a Latin professor. At Harvard, he was appointed Pope Professor of Latin in 1942 and was made became Professor Emeritus upon his retirement in 1950. During his lengthy academic career, Pease articulated the following philosophy of education: > ...from the first grade to graduate school, the aims are threefold: first, > to fit us for more successful practice of our respective callings; second, > to enrich and refresh our lives with more intelligent and varied avocations; > and, third, to render us more helpful in our manifold relations to the > community at large. Amherst College: Amherst's Philosophy Pease further expounded on his personal views and habits when he said: > ...in lack of sufficient cranial space for dead storage, I enter (facts and > ideas) methodically on 3 x 5 slips of paper. When enough of a kind are > amassed, they are outspread, classified, digested, written down, dehydrated, > and lo! and article, or more rarely a book, to be pursued by some lone > watcher in Czechoslovakia or beside the Bay of Biscay.

All of which, as > Augustine says, is \\"a great task and a difficult, but God is our helper. Botany Although a classicist by training, Pease was also \\"an outstanding amateur field botanist\\" and \\"it is Professor Pease's work in New England botany for which he will be especially remembered. Pease traveled with Merritt Lyndon Fernald on botanical expeditions to Mount Logan in southwestern Yukon, to northern Newfoundland, to Nova Scotia, and to Gasp√© Peninsula in Quebec. Harvard University: Exploring The Gasp√© Peninsula, Summer 1923 About him Fernald wrote \\"how, with such a keen interest in plants and their natural habitats, he was lured into classical philology is beyond the comprehension of a mere botanist of more limited horizon.\\" In naming the flowering plant Draba peasei, in Pease's honor, Fernald wrote: > ...it is a great pleasure to associate the name of its discoverer, ARTHUR > STANLEY PEASE, distinguished classical scholar and keen amateur botanist, > (to this plant that) was at first identified by me as D. oligosperma Hook. > of the Rocky Mountain region... Fernald, M. L. (1934) Draba in temperate > northeastern America. Rhodora 36: 298-299 Other plants named after Pease include the perennial plant Antennaria peasei, the hawkweed Hieracium peasei, and Salix peasei, a type of willow. Pease himself named a long list of taxa including species in the Aster, Botrychium, Carex, Agropyron, Potentilla, Houstonia, and Epifagus genera. An enthusiastic mountaineer as well as an avid botanist, Pease collected and studied plant life in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. He shared his findings, including \\"Vascular flora of Co\`s County, New Hampshire\\", in the publications of the Boston Society of Natural History and the New England Botanic Club eventually leading to the posthumous 1964 publication of A flora of northern New Hampshire. Pease's studies of the vegetation around in the vicinity of his summer home in Randolph, New Hampshire led him to say that it \\"has probably changed more materially during the last hundred years than at any period of the same length since the last glacial epoch.\\" Randolph Mountain Club Some of the specimens Pease collected in New Hampshire are now kept at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Pease also collaborated with Richard Evans Schultes in writing Generic Names of Orchids: their origin and meaning(1963). Among Pease's donations to the Gray Herbarium at Harvard University and the New England Botanical Club was his 12,000 specimen herbarium. Harvard University: Library of the Gray Herbarium Other work Besides his many botanical articles, Pease published a considerable amount of material on classical languages and literatures, his academic speciality. His most famous work in this field is a detailed commentary of Book Four of Vergil's Aeneid. In some cases, Pease combined his vocation (classics) with his avocation (botany) in the publication of papers such as \\"Notes on ancient grafting\\" (1933) and \\"Mythology and mycology\\" (1947). Pease also published a 1946 memoir, Sequestered vales of life, which includes remembrances and anecdotes of his career and hobbies. Much of his personal papers, including correspondence with figures of historical interest and various manuscripts, are now kept by Harvard's Houghton Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Built in the mid-18th century, it was home during that time to two men who confronted the authorities and were punished for it. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington used the house as his headquarters when the Continental Army was garrisoned in the area. A later owner built a large main wing in the Federal style; the only remnant of the original house is the small kitchen wing. It has since become the property of the Historical Society of Quaker Hill and Pawling, which uses the house as its headquarters and to display exhibits related to local history, particularly the life of pioneering radio broadcaster and executive Lowell Thomas, who lived near Pawling for the later years of his life. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Property The oldest part of the house is the eastern extension known today as the kitchen wing, a one-and-a-half-story frame structure on a stone foundation. It has a low-pitched gabled shingled roof, pierced by a brick chimney at the gable end. The five-bay south-facing front elevation appears as one story due to the windows and colonnade added later. Earlier stone and frame additions have since been removed. An original rendering vat is in the basement. The main block, added later, is a five-by- three-bay two-story frame house lined with brick. Its most distinctive Federal style feature is the main doorway, flanked by sidelights, fluted pilasters and topped with a rectangular transom window. Smaller versions of the pilasters flank the Palladian window immediately above the doorway. All the other windows are rectangular symmetrical and topped with projecting cornices. A columned Greek Revival portico runs the length of the first story. On the west gable there is a Palladian opening with grilled quarter-round openings on either side and topped with a pediment. The rear entrance uses a Dutch door and lacks the transom but is otherwise identical to the front. Three chimneys rise from the main block's roof, two in the west and one in the east near the join with the kitchen wing. Inside, the two wings present a contrast. The kitchen wing has little decoration beyond the carved wooden fireplace mantel. The main block is more lavishly decorated, with marble mantels and casings on two of its four fireplaces. All the windows and doors are trimmed in carved wood; the rooms also have similarly carved wainscoting and ceiling cornices. The upper story, mainly given over to bedrooms, also has several fireplaces, all with similarly detailed and painted wooden casings and mantels. The attic is unfinished. There are three outbuildings: a small brick smokehouse, frame woodshed and two-story frame barn. It is not known when exactly they were built, and they have all been altered over the years. History The property was first settled in the late 1730s by William Prendergast, a tenant farmer who leased southeast of the nascent settlement of Pawling from the Philipse family, the area's dominant landowners. He built the small house that became the kitchen wing in 1740, adding other buildings later and connecting the two through a stone passageway. In 1766 he became a leader in the tenant uprising known as the Dutchess County Anti-Rent War, a revolt against the quit-rents left over from the feudal system left in place by Dutch colonists in the region which made it hard for tenants to eventually purchase their land. It was quelled by troops called in from Poughkeepsie. Prendergast was tried, convicted and sentenced to hang for treason. His wife made a personal appeal to the colonial governor, Sir Harry Moore and he was spared at the last minute by a gubernatorial reprieve and later a royal pardon. The Prendergast family left for Chautauqua County shortly thereafter as it was outgrowing the house. Kane, an Irish immigrant, bought the house later that year. When the Revolution started, he was initially on the Patriot side, as he had been elected to the Provisional Congress of New York in 1775. After the first year of the war, he switched sides and became a Loyalist, convinced the cause was hopeless. Accordingly, his house and property were confiscated by the New York State Legislature, and the following year, in September 1778, George Washington moved in when the Continental Army wintered in the area, where they could move on either New England or New York City at short notice. Kane retreated to the safety of British lines for the remainder of the war, while his family went to Nova Scotia. He received a lifelong pension from the British in 1783, when the war ended, and returned to the Pawling area. Since he could not legally live in or repurchase his home, he lived the remainder of his life with his children. A later owner in the early 19th century demolished all but the original kitchen wing and built the current Federal structure. It went through a variety of later uses, as an inn and a rental property owned by the local bank, but returned to single-family dwelling status late in the century.

It completely superseded the previous 1719 Establishment, which had subsequently been modified in 1733 and again in 1741 (but not formally replaced on either occasion). Although partially intended to correct the problems of the ships built to the earlier Establishments, the ships of the 1745 Establishment proved just as unsatisfactory, and important changes in the make-up of the Admiralty and Navy Boards finally led to the end of the establishment era by around 1751.Lavery, The Ship of the Line - Volume 1, p 86‚Äì97. Origins When the 1706 Establishment had come into effect, British naval architecture had been set on a path of conservatism that caused stagnation in the advance of shipbuilding in Great Britain. Over the course of the existence of the 1706 and 1719 Establishments, the sizes of ships had remained relatively unchanged: the gundeck length of a 70-gun third rate of 1706 was , compared with in 1733. By comparison, the 70-gun French ship captured by the Royal Navy in 1702 was , and the 70-gun of 1744, captured in 1748 was . This was almost as long as the to which British first rates were to be built according to the 1741 proposals.Lavery, The Ship of the Line - Volume 1, p 168‚Äì175. With the end of Robert Walpole's government in 1742, the Board of Admiralty was re‚Äìorganised, and the civilian Earl of Winchilsea was appointed First Lord. Under the new administration, there were some half-hearted attempts at reform, with the ordering of the 90-gun to be razeed to 74 guns in response to the increasing French and Spanish practice of building 74-gun ships, and an experiment in building larger ships for their class which resulted in the construction of and . The Duke of Bedford, again a civilian, was appointed First Lord in December 1744. He relied upon Rear-Admiral George Anson, who had refused promotion to flag rank under the previous First Lord. The fiasco that was the Battle of Toulon highlighted many of the problems in British shipbuilding, with several ships unable to open gunports due to a combination of a lack of stability and insufficient height of the ports above the waterline. It was observed by Commodore Charles Knowles that the British 70-gun ships were 'little superior to [the French] ships of 52 guns.'Lavery, The Ship of the Line - Volume 1, p90. Many of the fleet's problems were blamed on Sir Jacob Acworth, the Surveyor of the Navy since 1715, and an unsuccessful attempt to remove him was mounted by one of the members of the Board of Admiralty, Henry Legge. For the previous Establishments, the dimensions had been decided upon through consultation with the Surveyor and senior shipwrights; instead in June 1745 the Admiralty took the lead when it decided to deal with the problem of ship sizes, and set up a committee to review proposals made by the Navy Board. The original purpose of the Establishments was to standardise the fleet, but because ships had been built and rebuilt at various times to varying established dimensions, there was little more standardisation than had been present before the 1706 Establishment came into being. The new Establishment of 1745 was intended to correct this situation, and at the same time solve the issues with British ships that had been the cause of complaint by sea officers for several years. The Admiralty had intended that the 80-gun ships should no longer be built, as they lacked maneuverability and stability, and their lower gunports were so close to the waterline that they could not be opened in anything above a calm sea. The committee the Admiralty had set up disagreed with their assessment however, and a suggestion to switch to 74-gun ships in lieu of the 80s was rejected. The size of ships was to be limited according to the depth of water available in the country's ports, and so even the 90-gun ships were to remain smaller than some French and Spanish 74s. Despite these setbacks, the Admiralty had achieved much greater increases in the sizes of ships than with the previous establishments. Furthermore, the ship types of pre-1741 were restored, with the 64-gun vessel returned to 70 guns, and the 58-gun vessels to 60. Earlier establishments had merely laid out the principal dimensions for each type of warship from the 100-gun first rates down to the 20-gun sixth rates, although with effect from the 1719 Establishment this was augmented by defining the sizes and thicknesses of wood to be used in the construction. These establishments had left the actual design of each vessel to the Master Shipwright in each Naval Dockyard, with the Surveyor of the Navy responsible only for common designs for those ships built by contract by mercantile shipbuilders. However, under the new 1745 Establishment the responsibility for preparing designs (\\"draughts\\") for all ships was given to the Surveyor of the Navy, with the Master Shipwrights now responsible only for constructing ships to those common Surveyor's designs for each vessel type. Additionally, control over the Establishments was passed from the Admiralty to the Privy Council, a move intended to remove the possibility of ongoing change. Despite the rejection of their proposal that 74-gun ships should replace 80s in the new Establishment, Admiralty did succeed in having , which was building as an 80, modified to be completed as a 74, though she was never considered a particularly successful ship, and was the smallest 74-gun ship of the 18th century. Individual ship types A different set of Establishment dimensions was defined for each size of ship, other than the smallest (i.e. the unrated) vessels. In the main (the exceptions being the 64-gun and 58-gun ships, as shown below) the armament remained that set out under the 1743 Establishment of Guns (created by Order of the King in Council, 25 April 1743); this was applied retrospectively to all ships order to be built subsequent to 1 January 1740. First rates of 100 guns As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 100-gun first rate was to carry an armament of: * twenty-eight 42-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty- eight 24-pounder guns on its middle deck, * twenty-eight 12-pounder guns on its upper deck, * twelve 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * four 6-pounder guns on its forecastle. Second rates of 90 guns As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 90-gun second rate was to carry an armament of: * twenty-six 32-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-six 18-pounder guns on its middle deck, * twenty-six 12-pounder guns on its upper deck, * ten 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * two 6-pounder guns on its forecastle. Third rates of 80 guns As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 80-gun third rate was to carry an armament of: * twenty-six 32-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-six 18-pounder guns on its middle deck, * twenty-four 9-pounder guns on its upper deck, * four 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * nil guns on its forecastle. Third rates of 70 guns The 1743 Establishment of Guns had provided for the former 70-gun third rate to be reduced from 70-gun to 64-gun ships, each with an armament of: * twenty-six 32-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-six 18-pounder guns on its upper deck, * ten 9-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * two 9-pounder guns on its forecastle. Under the 1745 Establishment they were restored to 70 guns and were to carry an armament of: * twenty-six 32-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on its upper deck, * twelve 9-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * four 9-pounder guns on its forecastle. Fourth rates of 60 guns The 1743 Establishment of Guns had provided for the former 60-gun third rate to be reduced from 60-gun to 58-gun ships, each with an armament of: * twenty-four 24-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-four 12-pounder guns on its upper deck, * eight 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * two 6-pounder guns on its forecastle. Under the 1745 Establishment they were restored to 60 guns and were to carry an armament of: * twenty-four 24-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-six 12-pounder guns on its upper deck, * eight 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * two 6-pounder guns on its forecastle. Fourth rates of 50 guns As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 50-gun fourth rate was to carry an armament of: * twenty-two 24-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty-two 12-pounder guns on its upper deck, * four 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * two 6-pounder guns on its forecastle. Fifth rates (44-gun) As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 44-gun fifth rate was to carry an armament of: * twenty 18-pounder guns on its lower deck, * twenty 9-pounder guns on its upper deck, * four 6-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * nil guns on its forecastle. Sixth rates (20-gun or 24-gun) As provided for under the 1743 Establishment of Guns, the 24-gun sixth rate was to carry an armament of: * two 9-pounder guns on its lower deck (aft), * twenty 9-pounder guns on its upper deck, * two 3-pounder guns on its quarter deck, and * nil guns on its forecastle. Amendments to the 1745 Establishment When the first of the new ships began entering service, it became apparent that they were not so successful a design as had been hoped. Captains complained of their poor sailing qualities, and so the Admiralty sought permission from the Privy Council to make amendments to the designs in 1750. The changes agreed mainly affected the 90, 80 and 60-gun ships, although changes were made to the draughts of all sizes of ships. By 1752, it was felt necessary to petition the Council for further alterations to be made to the designs, and again in 1754. On this occasion, the Admiralty decided to omit certain details‚Äînamely a increase in the length of the 70-gun ships‚Äîfrom their proposals, so as to better the chances of their being accepted. However, by this time it was clear that the ships of the 1745 Establishment were a thorough disappointment. End of an era In 1755 Joseph Allin retired from his post as Surveyor of the Navy on ill health. He had been joint Surveyor with Jacob Ackworth until Ackworth's death in 1749, and sole Surveyor thereafter. The Admiralty reacted swiftly and appointed Thomas Slade and William Bateley as the new joint Surveyors, and shortly thereafter two new 70-gun ships were ordered to be built to Slade's draught, which represented a significant increase in size over their predecessors‚Äî as opposed to the of the 1754 amendments. Although nominally ordered as 70s, these new third rates were in fact the first of the 74s, and represented the end of the 70-gunner as a ship type on the navy lists. The era of crippling conservatism in British shipbuilding completed its slow death when Anson, by now the First Lord of the Admiralty, had the Navy Board reorganised with people who would support the Admiralty rather than fight with it, as had been the case previously.

History The self-stated mission of NEC is to carry a message of recovery, empowerment, hope and healing to people who have been labeled with mental illness diagnosis. It argues that recovery and empowerment are not the privilege of a few but a process that is possible for everyone to embark on and find help with. Although unconventional to those accustomed only to a narrow medical model, the model is part of a recovery movement that comprises an emerging consensus. NEC and other groups are working to implement the transformation to a recovery-based system recommended by the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. It operates a toll-free information and referral line. It organizes and speaks at conferences. Its staff have published in professional journals, scholastic books, popular press and alternative publications. NEC has \\"been involved\\" in many national boards and committees and in policy consultations at the White House, in Congress, in federal agencies such as HUD, the Social Security Administration, HCFA, the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, and The President's Commission on Disability, and at the regional and local level with organizations such as HMOs and state divisions of mental health programs.

The 1924 map showing the entity as \\"South-Eastern Oblast\\" Originally, the name \\"South-East\\" was used informally to refer to the territories of Don, Kuban-Black Sea, and Terek Oblasts, as well as those of Stavropol Governorate and Dagestan ASSR, which were governed by the Revolutionary Soviet of the Laborers' Army of South-East Russia (hence the name \\"South-East\\") established on August 7, 1920. While the Soviet itself was abolished in 1921, the name \\"South-East\\" stuck. Occasionally, the territory was also referred to as \\"South-Eastern Krai\\" and \\"South-Eastern Oblast\\", even though no official krai/oblast status was assigned to it at the time. The system of the administrative and territorial division of the RSFSR was developing haphazardly in the beginning of the 1920s: it was inconsistent, expensive to maintain, and not very effective in practice. As a reaction to that, the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on April 23, 1924 decided to test a new system of the administrative division in two experimental areas: one industrially developed and one agricultural. The South-East became a testing ground for the new system in the agricultural area. On February 13, 1924, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) officially defined the South-East as the area comprising the territories of Don and Kuban Oblasts, Terek and Stavropol Governorates, the city of Grozny, and Kabardino-Balkar, Karachay-Cherkess, Adyghe-Cherkess, and Chechen Autonomous OblastsThe names of some of these administrative units, as used in the definition of the South-East, are inconsistent with their official names. The area of the South-East itself was inconsistently referred to as either \\"South-East\\", or \\"South-Eastern Oblast\\", or \\"South-Eastern Krai\\". and mandated its division into districts (raions) by the end of 1924. On June 2, 1924, the Presidium of the VTsIK established a list of the new okrugs and districts into which the \\"South-Eastern Krai (Oblast)\\" was to be divided. At the same time, Kuban-Black Sea Oblast was abolished and replaced with four new okrugs, which were further divided into districts by the Executive Committee of Kuban-Black Sea Oblast on July 19, 1924. South-Eastern Krai was renamed North Caucasus Krai by the Resolution of the Presidium of the VTsIK of October 16, 1924 and by the Resolution of the Krai Executive Committee of November 16, 1924.

They occur in Irish orthography, and many of them can be analysed as a tetragraph followed by the vowels e or i on either side to indicate that the neighbouring consonants are palatalized (\\"slender\\"). However, not all Irish hexagraphs are analysable that way. The hexagraph oidhea, for example, represents the same sound (approximately the vowel in English \\"write\\") as the trigraph adh, and with the same effect on neighboring consonants. English does not have hexagraphs. The six-letter sequence schsch appears in German, for example in the name Eschscholtz (and thus is the scientific name Eschscholtzia of the California poppy), but this is a doubling of the trigraph sch to indicate that the preceding vowel is short rather than itself being a hexagraph.

It aims to cater for individual differences, develop skills (e.g. communication skills, collaborative skills, critical thinking skills), generic knowledge and socially acceptable attitudes or to generate conforming standards of behavior and judgement, a \\"group mind\\".Le Bon, 1910 Specifically in psychotherapy and social work, \\"group work\\" refers to group therapy, offered by a practitioner trained in psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, counseling or other relevant discipline.  Social group work  Social group work is a method of social work that helps persons to enhance their social functioning through purposeful group experiences and to cope more effectively with their personal, group or community problems (Marjorie Murphy, 1959). Social group work, is a primary modality of social work in bringing about positive change, it is defined as an educational process emphasizing the development and social adjustment of an individual through voluntary association and use of this association as a means of furthering socially desirable end. It is a psycho social process which is concerned in developing leadership and cooperation with building on the interests of the group for a social purpose. Social group work is a method through which individuals in groups in social agency setting are helped by a worker who guides their interaction through group activities so that they may relate to others and experience growth opportunities in accordance with their needs and capacities to the individual, group and community development. It aims at the development of persons through the interplay of personalities in group situation and at the creation of such group situation as provide for integrated, cooperative group action for common ends. It is also a process and a method through which group life is affected by worker who consciously directs the interacting process towards the accomplishment of goals which are conceived in a democratic frame of reference. Its distinct characteristics lies in the fact that group work is used with group experience as a means of individual growth and development, and that the group worker is concerned in developing social responsibility and active citizenship for the improvement of democratic society. Group work is a way to serving individual within and through small face to face group in order to bring about the desired change among the client participants.  Models There are four models in social group work:Friedlander, W.A., Concept and Methods of Social Work * Remedial model (Vinter, R. D., 1967) ‚Äì Remedial model focuses on the individuals dysfunction and utilizes the group as a context and means for altering deviant behaviour. * Reciprocal or Mediating model (W. Schwartz, 1961) - A model based on open systems theory, humanistic psychology and existential perspective. Relationship rooted in reciprocal transactions and intensive commitment is considered critical in this model. * Developmental model (Berustein, S. & Lowy, 1965) - A model based on Erikson's ego psychology, group dynamics and conflict theory. In this model groups are seen as having \\"a degree of independence and autonomy, but the dynamics of to and fro flow between them and their members, between them and their social settings, are considered crucial to their existence, viability and achievements\\". The connectedness (intimacy and closeness) is considered critical in this model. * Social goals model (Gisela Konopka & Weince, 1964) - A model based on 'programming' social consciousness, social responsibility, and social change. It suggests that democratic participation with others in a group situation can promote enhancement of personal function in individuals, which in-turn can affect social change. It results in heightened self-esteem and an increase in social power for the members of the group collectively and as individuals.  Functions of Social Group Worker  The American Association of Group Workers (1949) describes as: > ‚ÄúThe group worker enables various types of groups to function in such a way > that both group interaction and programme activities contribute to the > growth of the individual, and the achievement of the desirable social goal. > The objectives of the group worker include provision for personal growth > according to individual capacity and need; the adjustment of the individual > to other persons, to groups and to society, the motivation of the individual > toward the improvement of society and; the recognition by the individual of > his own rights, abilities and differences of others. Through his > participation the group worker aims to effect the group process so that > decisions come about as a result of knowledge and a sharing and integration > of ideas, experiences and knowledge, rather than as a result of domination > from within or without the group. Social Work Intervention with Individuals > and Groups through experience he/she aims to produce those relationship with > other groups and the wider community which contributes to responsible > citizenship, mutual understanding between cultural, religious, economic or > special groupings in the community, and a participation in the constant > improvement of our society towards democratic goals. The guiding purpose > behind such leadership rests upon the common assumptions of a democratic > society; namely, the opportunity for each individual to fulfill his > capacities in freedom, to respect and appreciate others and to assume his > social responsibility in maintaining and constantly improving our democratic > societies. Underlying the practice of group work is the knowledge of > individual and group behaviour and of social conditions and community > relations which is based on the modern social sciences. On the basis of this > knowledge the group worker contributes to the group with which he works with > a skill in leadership which enables the members to use their capacities to > the full and to create socially constructive group activities. He is aware > of both programme activities and of the interplay of personalities, within > the group and between the group and its surrounding community. According to > the interests and needs of each, he assists them to get from the group > experience, the satisfaction provided by the programme activities, the > enjoyment and personal growth available through the social relations, and > the opportunity to participate as a responsible citizen. The group worker > makes conscious use of his relations to the group, his knowledge of > programme as a tool and his understanding of the individual and of the group > process and recognizes his responsibility both to individuals and groups > with whom he works and the larger social values he represents‚Äù.  Group work in psychology  Group work in psychology is done with a smaller number of participants for controlled effectiveness. It is an ethical practice that aims to bring out a collective positive behavioral and well-being change in the individual participants life. *generating a broad array of possible alternative points of view or solutions to a problem *giving clients a chance to work on a goal that might appear too large or complex for an individual *allowing clients with different backgrounds to bring their special knowledge, experience, or skills to a project, and to explain their orientation to others *giving clients a chance to teach and contribute to each other *giving clients a structured experience so their problem solving ideas are encouraged with a set of new practice skills applicable to their subjective environmental situations Brainstorming is a method used to generate ideas. Participants mention ideas in any order (without others' commenting, disagreeing or asking too many questions). The advantage of brainstorming is that ideas do not become closely associated with the individuals who suggested them. This process encourages creative thinking, if it is not rushed and if all ideas are written down (and therefore, for the time-being, accepted). A disadvantage: when ideas are suggested quickly, it is more difficult for shy participants or for those who are not speaking their native language. One approach is to begin by brainstorming and then go around the group in a more structured way asking each person to add to the list.

Briggs initially signed with his hometown team, the Sacramento Solons of the Open- Classification Pacific Coast League, in 1952. In 1954, he led the Class A Western International League in strikeouts (233) and earned run average (2.50) and won 20 of 28 decisions as a member of the Salem Senators. After two three- game trials with the Cubs in 1956 and 1957, he rejoined the Cubs in the midst of the 1958 campaign and took a spot in their starting rotation. He split ten decisions in 20 games pitched (with 17 starts) and put up an ERA of 4.52. He threw what would be his only MLB shutout on June 24, scattering eight hits and four bases on balls to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies, 3‚Äì0. In January 1959 Briggs was sent to the Indians in a waiver deal that also featured outfielder Jim Bolger, pitcher Morrie Martin and utilityman Earl Averill, Jr. Although he pitched effectively in three spring appearances for Cleveland, Briggs spent most of the 1959 season in Triple-A with the San Diego Padres, where he went 14‚Äì6 (2.60). That led to Briggs's only full season of Major League experience, 1960. He worked in 21 games for the Indians, all but two of them as a relief pitcher, and compiled a 4‚Äì2 mark with one save. His contract then was sold to the Athletics on July 30. But Briggs treated roughly in his first five appearances for Kansas City, allowing 14 hits, seven bases on balls and 13 earned runs in seven innings pitched. During that skein, he lost his only starting assignment to the Boston Red Sox on August 4, failing to record an out and allowing a three-run, first-inning home run to veteran Vic Wertz. Briggs finished the 1960 season 4‚Äì4 with a 6.42 earned run average. The following winter, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds with fellow right- hander John Tsitouris for veteran southpaw pitcher Joe Nuxhall.

Plot The protagonist, C√©sar Rubio, is an unemployed professor who, in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, settles with his family in a small town in the north of Mexico. There, a professor from Harvard University confuses him for a missing revolutionary hero with the same name. Rubio claims to be the deceased hero, telling the professor that, disillusioned with the course of the Revolution, he had embraced anonymity until thirty years thereafter. The story is published in The New York Times, and Rubio comes to the attention of his compatriots, receiving accolades and fielding offers to run for the governorship of his state against a corrupt Revolutionary general. Rubio loses himself in his new identity, viewing it as an opportunity to renew the promise of the Revolution. Things go awry when the corrupt general against whom C√©sar is running forces a meeting between the two. In their conversation, each attempts to blackmail the other. Navarro, the corrupt general, knows that C√©sar is not the general he claims to be. C√©sar, on the other hand, figures out that Navarro killed general C√©sar Rubio during the war. Outside the door was C√©sar's son, who had trouble reconciling his father's newly revealed heroism. Despite Navarro's threats, C√©sar proceeds with his candidacy for governor. After leaving to attend the election, Miguel, Julia, and Elena (C√©sar's son, daughter, and wife, respectively) discuss the nature of their father's actions; Julia supports him, while Miguel, and ultimately Elena are unable to come to terms with his lie. However, Elena also realizes that Navarro will try to kill C√©sar, and sends Miguel to warn his father of the assassination. Unfortunately, he arrives too late; both C√©sar and the assassin have been killed, leaving no link back to Navarro. Navarro briefly returns to the house to gloat before addressing the crowd outside, promising that C√©sar will be treated as a hero and his family will be taken care of. While the crowd is initially hesitant, Navarro's apparent goodwill convinces them, and they cheer both him and C√©sar. Controversy The play was daring for its time in that it used the true language of contemporary politics, a first for Mexican literature.Krauze, 526 Originally published in the literary review El hijo pr√≥digo in 1938, the play was not staged until 1947. Its debut in the Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes was welcomed by the theater-going public, but was met with hostility by the Mexican government. At issue was the play's declaration of the death of the Mexican Revolution in its institutionalization in the Partido Revolucionario Institucional.Beardsell, 60. The government cancelled several performances, and writers were hired to severely criticize the performances that were allowed to go on. The work thus became the only play in Mexican history to be censored by the government.

The mountainous physiography and the diversity of rock types and ages hint at the complex geology, which is still undergoing revision despite a century of exploration and mapping. The country's most prominent geological features are mountain ranges, including the North American Cordillera, which stretches from Southern Mexico to Alaska.  Terrane theory  Terrane theory was first proposed by Jim Monger of the Geological Survey of Canada and Charlie Rouse in 1971 as an explanation for a set of fusilinid fossils found in central British Columbia. Rather than use facies changes or seaways (which were common explanations at the time), the two geologists proposed that the fossils in question had been part of an assemblage of rocks that had migrated across the Pacific Ocean to their present location. This theory was then developed by Porter Irwin and Davy Jones of the US Geological Survey to its common definition of \\"fault bounded regional geologic entities, each characterized by a different geologic history than its neighbours\\". Terranes are most commonly associated with different tectonic elements such as island arcs, volcanic plateaus, subduction zones, continental margins, mid-oceanic ridges and continental fragments. These terranes are gradually joined together by elements such as overlap assemblages and stitching plutons and are then accreted to the continent. In some cases, a terrane can contain multiple tectonic elements. The Cache Creek Terrane is composed of a massive carbonate component, an oceanic floor component and a subduction m√©lange component.  Architecture and composition  There are five morphogeological belts that define the geology of British Columbia from east to west: the Foreland, Omineca, Intermontane, Coast and Insular Belt. Each has a separate geology, including different metamorphic, physiographic, metallogenic and tectonic histories. The Foreland Belt is composed of weakly metamorphosed sedimentary rocks which are 1.4 billion to 33 million years old, and the belt represents a rift sequence followed by a passive margin that was turned into a retro arc fold and thrust belt with synorogenic sedimentation. The region is very rugged except in the northeast of the province where the earth flattens out to a wide plain. The Omineca Belt is composed of highly metamorphosed, pericratonic (near craton) terranes and fragments of North America that are 2 billion to 180 million years old. Terranes in the belt include the Slide Mountain Terrane, the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane and the Cassiar Terrane. This belt goes from low hills to high mountains across its length, with the majority of the region being extremely rugged. The Intermontane Belt is a flatter, more rounded region composed of three terranes, Stikinia, Quesnellia and the Cache Creek Terrane. The belt has a lower metamorphic grade than the Omineca Belt and ranges from 400 million to within 10,000 years old. Volcanic activity has been recorded as occurring in the past 10,000 years, including at Nazko Cone and in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. The Coast Belt is the single largest outpouring of granite and granodiorite in the phanerozoic, it contains heavily metamorphosed fragments of both the terranes of the Insular Belt and the Intermontane Belt. In the southeast there is a series of small terranes of both oceanic (Bridge River and Chilliwack) and continental affinity (Jack Konat Mountain, Ladner). The hard-weathering granite is extensively rugged throughout the belt. The Insular Belt is composed of the outboard terrain with no connection to North America before accretion. There are two main terranes‚ÄîWrangellia and the Alexander‚Äîand a few smaller ones such as the Pacific Rim terrane. Because the Insular Belt is the most tectonically active of the belts, it has the greatest relief differences from the depths of the Queen Charlotte sound to the heights of the Wrangell‚ÄìSt. Elias mountains. The ages are from 600 million years to recent, with metamorphic grades depending on the age and host of the rock type.

The square has been the location and focus for political demonstrations in Cairo, most notably those that led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.  History  The square was originally called \\"Ismailia Square\\" ( '), after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, but the square was not officially renamed until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which changed Egypt from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. The square was a focal point for the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Tahrir Square at night with traffic circle, view northwest from Talaat Harb Street  Features  Mogamma building and Umar Makram statue At the centre of Tahrir Square is a large and busy traffic circle. On the north-east side is a plaza with a statue of nationalist hero Umar Makram, celebrated for his resistance against Napoleon I's invasion of Egypt, and beyond is the Umar Makram Mosque. The square is the northern terminus of the historic Qasr al-Ayni Street, the western terminus of Talaat Harb Street, and via Qasr al-Nil Street crossing its southern portion it has direct access to the Qasr al-Nil Bridge crossing the nearby Nile River. The area around Tahrir Square includes the Egyptian Museum, the Folklore Arts House, the Mogamma government building, the Headquarters of the Arab League building, the Nile Hotel, Kasr El Dobara Evangelical Church and the original downtown campus of the American University in Cairo. The National Democratic Party-NDP headquarters building stood here until it was set on fire during the revolution and demolished in 2015.Egypt demolishes Mubarak‚Äôs party headquarters The Cairo Metro serves Tahrir Square with the Sadat Station, which is the downtown junction of the system's two lines, linking to Giza, Maadi, Helwan, and other districts and suburbs of Greater Cairo. Its underground access viaducts provide the safest routes for pedestrians crossing the broad roads of the heavily trafficked square. Public use and demonstrations Tahrir Square has been the traditional site for numerous major protests and demonstrations over the years, including the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots, and the March 2003 protest against the War in Iraq. Protesters on an army vehicle during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution in Tahrir Square 2011 Egyptian Revolution Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. Over 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days, Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. On 29 January, Egyptian fighter aircraft flew low over the people gathered in the square. On 30 January, the seventh day of the protests, PIK BBC and other correspondents reported that the number of demonstrators had grown to at least 100,000, and on 31 January, Al Jazeera correspondents reported that the demonstrations had grown to at least 250,000 people. On 1 February, Al Jazeera reported that more than one million protesters peacefully gathered in the square and adjacent streets. However, such media reports that so many people congregated in Cairo's largest public square are believed to be exaggerated for political purposes and, according to Stratfor's analysis, the real number of gathered protesters never exceeded 300,000 people. People congregated in Tahrir Square on 9 February 2011 The square became established as a focal point and a symbol for the ongoing Egyptian democracy demonstrations. On 2 February, violence erupted between the pro-Mubarak and pro-democracy demonstrators there, followed by the 3 February 'Friday of Departure' demonstration, one of the named \\"day of\\" events centered in the square. Within a week, due to international media coverage, the image and name of Tahrir Square became known worldwide. A Facebook page called \\"Tahrir Square\\" ŸÖŸäÿØÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ± was maintained by a rotating staff of twenty during the uprising, particularly to offset the lack of and/or distorted coverage of events and responses in the state-run media outlets. The 18-day revolt centered in the square provided the Egyptian Armed Forces an opportunity to remove Mubarak from power on Friday, 11 February 2011, when the president officially stepped down from office. The announcement that Mubarak had passed all authority to the Council of the Armed Forces was made by longtime intelligence chief and new vice president Umar Suleiman.Kirkpatrick, David D. and Anthony Shadid from Cairo. Other reporting was contributed by Kareem Fahim, Liam Stack, Mona El-Naggar and Thanassis Cambanis from Cairo, and Alan Cowell from Paris, \\"Mubarak Steps Down, Ceding Power to Military\\" ,The New York Times, 11 February 2011. Tahrir Square erupted in a night-long celebration after the twilight announcement, with shouts such as \\"Lift your head up high, you're Egyptian\\", \\"Everyone who loves Egypt, come and rebuild Egypt\\", and others. The next day, Egyptian Cairen women and men came to clean up the square, \\"they came and cleaned up after their revolution,\\" relaying 'projectiles' in the cobblestone paving and removing eighteen days' worth of trash and graffiti. Post-revolution Tahrir Square in the early morning, November 2012 Tahrir Square, with 'democracy anniversary' celebrations and visits from foreign dignitaries, continued to be a symbol of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. British Prime Minister David Cameron, Catherine Ashton, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, Chairman of the American Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Kevin Rudd Foreign Minister of Australia, and American actor Sean Penn visited Tahrir Square after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. One of the ships in the planned Freedom Flotilla II, intended to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, was named Tahrir after the square. Among its passengers was Haaretz reporter Amira Hass. Ultimately, the sailing did not take place. =June 2013 protests and Morsi overthrow= On 29 June 2013, millions of Egyptians converged on Tahrir Square to demonstrate against the Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, demanding his resignation from office. The demonstrators used the slogan \\"the people want the ouster of the regime,\\" used in the protests that led to the 2011 revolution. By the 30th, their number had increased and demonstrations were reported to be in progress in 18 locations across Cairo. The demonstration had hundreds of thousands of protesters, although the Egyptian Government claims there were 33 million in the street, this number is highly suspected of since the largest square in Egypt, Tahrir Square, can only hold 2 million people maximum. On 3 July 2013, General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi announced the removal of President Mohamed Morsi and suspended the Egyptian constitution after ongoing public protests. The move was described as a \\"coup d'√©tat\\" by supporters of Morsi and/or the Muslim Brotherhood and much of the international media, but when combined with the protests, it has instead been described by its supporters, as well as other media outlets, as a revolution.

The season was much the same; he had eight plate appearances and seven at bats with the Indians, and played the bulk of the year for the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs, batting .294. Then followed three full seasons in the Majors as a reserve outfielder. In , appearing in 74 games for Cleveland, he reached MLB highs in home runs (seven), RBI (17), and batting average (.272). The following year, , saw an increase in playing time, with 94 games played, including 50 in the outfield with 29 starting assignments, and 27 more at bats. But his average (.230) declined, as did his on-base percentage and slugging percentage, and during the inter-league trading period following the season, he was packaged in a multi-player trade with the Braves in which the Indians received veteran first baseman Joe Adcock. His season with the Braves saw Dillard make 67 appearances as a pinch hitter and left fielder, playing behind regular Lee Maye, with a batting average of .235 with one home run. In 1964, he returned to the minor leagues and, apart from another 20-game trial with Milwaukee in 1965, he spent much of the rest of his career at the Triple-A level, retiring in 1967. As a major leaguer, Dillard collected 116 total hits, with 16 doubles and five triples accompanying his 14 home runs. He finished his big league tenure with 47 runs batted in.

Mau Forest is the largest drainage basin in Kenya.Daily Nation, July 22, 2008: Selfish interests threaten Mau forest Numerous rivers originate from the forest, including Southern Ewaso Ng'iro, Sondu River, Mara River and Njoro River. These rivers feed Lake Victoria, Lake Nakuru and Lake Natron. Western slopes of the Mau Escarpment are covered by Mau Forest.  Ecology  Typical tree species in Mau Forest include Pouteria adolfi-friedericii, Strombosia scheffleri and Polyscias kikuyuensis. Olea capensis, Prunus africana, Albizia gummifera and Podocarpus latifolius are also found there. Endemic bird species in the area include Hartlaub's turaco (Tauraco hartlaubi), Hunter's cisticola (Cisticola hunteri) and Jackson's spurfowl (Pternistis jacksoni).  Destruction  The forest has been traditionally inhabited by Ogiek people, whose hunter-gatherer lifestyle is sustainable. However, due to immigration from other ethnic groups, large parts of the forest area have been cleared for settlement. Human activities, especially logging, have led to deforestation of more than a quarter of the area since 1973.http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/engineering/images/stories/docs/publications/land_degredation_mau.pdf This is due to increased charcoal trade in places like Narok town and supply of logs to saw mills in Baringo, Nakuru and Narok counties. In 2008, the inauguration of the Sondu-Miriu hydro power plant was postponed due to low water levels, that are said to be resulting from the destruction of Mau Forest.  Mau Forest evictions  In summer 2008 there was a political row over resettlement of people, who had been allocated land there during the KANU era during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of the settlers are famed politicians, like Franklin Bett and Zakayo Cheruiyot. In 2004 Paul Ndung‚Äôu released \\"Ndungu Report\\", which listed these land allocations, terming them illegal and recommended revocation of them. Some evictions were implemented between 2004 and 2006, without a resettlement scheme.Amnesty International: Kenya Nowhere to go: Forced Evictions in Mau Forest Briefing Paper, May 2007 On July 15, 2008, Prime minister Raila Odinga issued an order that these evictions to be implemented by October 2008 in order to protect the forest from destruction.Capital News, July 15, 2008:Raila meeting endorses Mau evictions The order has been opposed by number of Rift Valley area politicians, led by Isaac Ruto.

Pausanias said that Panopeus was 20 stadia from Chaeronea and 7 from Daulis;Pausanias, Description of Greece ix. 4. ¬ß 1.7. but the latter number is almost certainly a mistake. The ruins at the village of Agios Vlasios (or Aio Vlasi) (), which are clearly those of Panopeus, are about 20 stadia distant from Chaeronea, but as much as 27 stadia distant from Daulis. Panopeus was a very ancient town, which according to Greek mythology was originally inhabited by the Phlegyae. Strabo relates that it was founded by Panopeus. Homer lists Panopeus in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. Schedius, king of Panopeus, and his brother, were the leaders of the Phocians in the Trojan War.Pausanias, Description of Greece x. 4. ¬ß 1-5.

Pausanias said that the city was 7 stadia in circumference, but in his time the place only consisted of a few huts situated on the side of a river. Up until at least the 19th century there were still considerable remains of the ancient walls on the rocky heights above Agios Vlasios. The masonry is of different periods, as one might expect given the repeated destruction of the city. There are no longer any remains of the tomb of Tityos, which, according to Pausanias, was 1/3 of a stade in circumference, and stood on the side of the river.

Mappin & Webb traces its origins to a silver workshop founded in 1775. It now has retail stores in the UK. It has held Royal Warrants to British monarchs since 1897. The company's master craftsman Mark Appleby is the current Crown Jeweller of the United Kingdom. History Mappin & Webb, Oxford Street Mappin & Webb traces its origins to 1775, when Jonathan Mappin opened a silver workshop in Sheffield, then as now a major centre of the English silver trade. The business eventually became Mappin Brothers. One of Jonathan Mappin's great grandsons, John Mappin, started his own business in London, Mappin & Company, in 1860, which became Mappin, Webb & Co. in 1862 after John Mappin was joined by his brother-in-law George Webb. The first Mappin & Webb store opened in 1860 at 77-78 Oxford Street, London and the company‚Äôs candelabras, fine silverware and vanity products swiftly gained renown. As a natural progression from silverware, Mappin & Webb began designing jewellery. Mappin, Webb & Co. acquired Mappin Brothers in 1903. However, shortly after it was subject to a hostile takeover (through shares) in the 1930s. Since then it has passed ownership many times. Mappin & Webb expanded internationally beginning in the 1890s. Its first overseas store was established in Johannesburg and stores soon followed in Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Biarritz, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Cairo and Bombay. However all international stores closed in the second half of the 20th century. Mappin & Webb has created jewellery for royalty both in the United Kingdom and internationally. Patrons have included Queen of France Marie- Antoinette, the Empress of Russia and Princess Grace of Monaco. The company historically held Royal Warrants to both the Russian Empire and the Japanese Royal Household. Queen Victoria was the first British monarch to commission Mappin & Webb. Victoria's Golden Jubilee necklace was created by the house in 1888 and was designated by the queen as an heirloom of the Crown. Mappin & Webb has held Royal Warrants in the UK since 1897. Today, Mappin & Webb holds warrants to both the Queen and the Prince of Wales. Mappin & Webb‚Äôs master craftsman Martin Swift was appointed in 2012 to the position of Crown Jeweller, the custodian of the British Crown Jewels who is responsible for preparing them for the State opening of Parliament and other state occasions. Mark Appleby, also of Mappin & Webb, took over as crown jeweller in 2017. The brand produced the original Ryder Cup trophy, and made trophies for the Royal Ascot horse races for 75 years. Ownership Mappin & Webb merged with Elkington and Walker & Hall in 1963, the merged company being named British Silverware Ltd. In 1973 Mappin & Webb was bought by Sears Holdings.British Museum Messrs Mappin & Webb (Biographical details) The company was eventually bought by Baugur, which became insolvent in 2010. After a brief spell in the Asprey Garrard group, the company now forms part of the retail group Watches of Switzerland, formerly Aurum Holdings. The company floated on the LSE in 2019. http://www.mappinandwebb.com/our-history. http://ukcareers.thewosgroup.com/jobs/history/.

History Brigham Young University Press was formed in 1967 through the consolidation of BYU's various publishing activities into one central organization.'Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years (Provo: BYU Press, 1975) Vol. 3, p. 620 In its prime, BYU Press was a robust press publishing in a wide array of subjects, such as interior design, preschools, dancing, and wood-burning, as well as intellectual, scholarly and fine arts titles. In 1974, the press published Roughing it Easy: A Unique Ideabook for Camping and Cooking, by Dian Thomas, which later made the New York Times Best Seller list. The press also published works for Latter-day Saint readers and scholars, including BYU speeches and symposia proceedings and the periodical BYU Studies. Amongst its major publications in Church history are James B. Allen's Studies in Mormon History series, several of the \\"Charles Redd Monographs in Western History\\", the LDS Church's 1965 reprint of A Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Fox and Quinn's biographies of J. Reuben Clark, and Davis Bitton's Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies. The press itself received a 1978 Special Citation from the Mormon History Association for encouraging and publishing fine Church histories that year. Many of its LDS books have been published in conjunction with Deseret Book. It also maintained the imprint \\"Young House\\" during the 1970s. BYU Press had a reputation of selecting for publication only church approved material. Press officials scrutinized and rejected manuscripts they found too technical or too controversial. These rejections include Dennis Lythgoe's Let 'Em Holler: A Political Biography of J. Bracken Lee, B√©la Petsco's Nothing Very Important and Other Stories (1979 AML Best Fiction Award winner), and Science and Religion: Toward a More Useful Dialogue by several BYU faculty. In 1973, BYU Press recalled Thomas Cheney's The Golden Legacy: A Folk History of J. Golden Kimball, a new release, over concerns with some of Kimball's vulgar language. The book was edited and republished by Peregrine Press in 1974. Decline and return Financial troubles struck the press in the late 1970s, leading to a decision for it to only print internal university publications, making it essentially defunct for many authors and scholars. In 1984, the press was replaced by BYU Print Services and has since merged with BYU Mail Services to become BYU Print and Mail.http://printandmail.byu.edu In 1997, BYU Press returned as a logo under the Academic Vice President's office, intended for use with expanded distribution of some titles to other university libraries. Officials made clear that BYU Press would not be an organization or an office. The return was inspired by the production of new religious texts and the university's desire to clear out manuscripts to focus on publishing the papers of LDS Church founders Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, which were then being developed by BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History. In 2005, the Joseph Smith Papers Project transferred from BYU to LDS Church headquarters, and began publication in 2008 with a new imprint, the Church Historian's Press, rather than BYU Press. The Church Historian's Press may also publish the George Q. Cannon journals, another project formerly slated for BYU Press. Recent work Some notable recent publications by BYU Press: * Elwin C. Robison's 1997 book, The First Mormon Temple, Mormon History Association Special Citation winner. * Glen M. Leonard's 2002 book, Nauvoo: A Place of Peace, a People of Promise, Mormon History Association Special Merit Citation Book Award winner. * James B.

Trivia Before achieving wide notability, and after his own theater company failed, Orson Scott Card worked as a proofreader, then copy editor at BYU Press. In this role he met Calvin Grondahl, whose Mormon- themed cartoons were rejected by BYU Press, yet he would later illustrate one of Card's early works, the 1981 Saintspeak. Card's role at BYU Press led to his later editing job at the LDS Church's Ensign magazine.

It concern a husband's surfacing insecurities as his wife's independence strengthens when she claims a bloodsucking pet for her very own. Tuttle declared in an interview with M. M. Hall from Fantastic Metropolis: \\"My first post-natal story to deal with in any way with motherhood was ‚ÄúReplacements‚Äù, written when my daughter was only seven months old. Make of that what you will‚Ä¶\\". The Mysterious Q&A; with Lisa Tuttle with M.M. hall \\"Replacements\\" has been widely reprinted since being first published in 1992, both in Tuttle's own short story collections and various writers anthologies. It was also included on various \\"best of\\" anthologies in the year.  Summary  As Stuart commences his walk to work, he notices an animal \\"about the size of a cat, naked looking, with leathery, hairless skin and thin, spiky limbs that seemed too frail to support the bulbous, ill-proportioned body.\\" American Gothic Tales: edited with introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, New York: Plume, 1996 Disgusted and horrified by the appearance of this animal, he crushes it with his foot. Immediately, he is remorseful and his first instinct is to call his wife Jenny. Since he is not sure what her reaction will be, he waits to call her at the normal time in the afternoon. She is not able to take his call and does not return the call either. Stuart calls again, only to find that she has left work early. This, being unlike her, worries Stuart and he returns home as soon as possible. Once home, he finds that Jenny brought one of the \\"creatures\\" with her. Stuart shows strong dislike towards the creature and wants Jenny to get rid of it. The two argue about what to do with Jenny's new \\"pet\\" but never come to a resolution. The creature begins taking up more of Jenny's time and attention. She also does abnormal activities with the creature (letting it drink blood from her). As this progresses, Stuart is regarded less and less and becomes very distanced from Jenny. Eventually, Jenny says that she is going to keep it whether Stuart likes it or not. Stuart then decides that he cannot live with the creature and the woman Jenny has become, and he moves out. He begins to notice these creatures more and more. The women at work, women on the streets - every woman he sees seems to have one of these creatures. One evening while on his way home from work, he notices a woman sitting opposite with a gold chain that brings back memories. After leaving the train at the same stop as the woman, he strives to come up with something to say, but he sees the chain linked to one of the \\"pets\\" he despises and immediately lets her walk away. He absentmindedly walks to his old house where he sees the creature longing to be outside and he longing to be in.

Early life Whyte was born in 1928 in Penang, Malaya. His father was manager of a rubber plantation on the mainland. Whyte's family left Malaya, and returned to Europe when he was three, eventually settling in Rostrevor, County Down, Northern Ireland. The Whytes are a well known County Down family recorded in the area since at least 1713. The Whyte family is said to have come to Ireland from South Wales with Strongbow in 1170 and settled in Leinster. Whyte was educated locally, at Ampleforth and Oriel College Oxford, from which he took a degree in Modern History in 1949. Having continued studies some two years later he was awarded a B.Litt degree for further research, which was to form the nebula of his first book which was to be published in 1958. Whyte undertook National Service during the 1950s and worked as a history teacher in his old school before being appointed lecturer in Modern History at Makerere University, Uganda. In 1962 he returned to Ireland having been appointed first 'lecturer in empirical politics' at the then expanding University College Dublin (UCD). In 1966, he wed fellow academic Dr. Jean Murray and moved to Queen's University Belfast to undertake further studies. Dispute with Roman Catholic Church and move to Belfast In his book, Preventing the Future: Why Was Ireland So Poor for So Long?, Whyte's successor as Professor of Politics at UCD Tom Garvin gives an account as to the clerical politics prevalent at the time in UCD which caused Whyte's untimely departure: At Queen's Whyte was to spend seventeen years as lecturer and reader, and from 1982 Professor of Irish Politics during which he sought to bring together political scientists from across the Island and develop an All-Ireland political science fellowship. From 1973 to 1974 he worked at as a research fellow at Harvard's Centre for International Affairs, and in 1975 he helped lead a team of researchers investigating the Northern Ireland conflict, then at its height. He also worked as research fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies during the late 1970s and was elected Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1977, serving as Vice-President from 1989 to 1990. Later career In 1984 he returned to University College Dublin, then faced with stringent fiscal cuts and wider problems in Irish third-level education. In his second period at UCD, Whyte led the Department, which he now headed, through a troubled period of financial cuts while supervising a reorganisation of the undergraduate curriculum. In his last years at UCD he completed his seminal work, the widely regarded Interpreting Northern Ireland. Whyte finished correcting the proofs and compiling the index of this work only a week before his death. He died whilst on his way to the United States for an academic conference in 1990. The John Whyte Trust Fund Following his death Whyte's family, friends, and colleagues set up the John Whyte Trust Fund to continue Whyte's work, honour his memory and encourage \\"informed dialogue and interaction at graduate level among people who are likely to be leaders and opinion-shapers\\". To date the fund has awarded one fully paid scholarship and a number of part-paid scholarships as well as essay prizes annually. The fund also hosts an annual John Whyte Memorial Lecture.

STRP states its mission as being: > To protect endangered sea turtles in ways that make cultural and economic > sense to the communities that share the beaches and waters with these gentle > creatures.STRP Mission . Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 28, 2008). STRP engages in activities such as educating the public about sea turtles, urging people to get involved with sea turtle protection, advocating for laws and regulations that protect sea turtles from accidentally getting caught in commercial fishing operations, filing lawsuits when the United States Endangered Species Act or other conservation laws are violated, and disseminating information about sea turtles to elected officials, regulatory agencies, members of the media and the public. STRP currently has offices in the United States, Central America and the Western Pacific. History Todd Steiner, a herpetologist and then director of the Save the Dolphin Project, an affiliate organization of the Earth Island Institute, launched STRP to help strengthen sea turtle protection policies at the local and international level. Steiner had traveled to Nicaragua to assist local communities in protecting their nesting populations of sea turtles. When he returned to the United States Steiner learned that the sea turtles that were protected in Nicaragua were being killed in Mexico to supply shells for the Japanese luxury apparel market.Sea Turtle Restoration Project, \\"STRP History,\\" STRP Brochure (2003]: 1 The sea turtle is a highly migratory species that crosses national boundaries as part of its natural life cycle. STRP join international efforts to end the trade in endangered sea turtles by organizing protests at the Mexican and Japanese consulates in the United States and generating thousands of letters and phone calls of protest. Mexico banned the killing of sea turtles and Japan ended its illegal trade in endangered sea turtle parts for luxury items. Since 1989, STRP has attempted to address other threats facing sea turtles at nesting beaches and in the ocean where sea turtles spend most of their time. This has included protecting critical nesting habitat in Central America, seeking to establish a marine reserve for the Kemp's ridley sea turtle in [/Texas/], developing community-based projects to protect local sea turtle populations in the Western Pacific, preventing the capture of sea turtles by industrial fishing operations worldwide, and protecting critical foraging habitat for the near extinct Pacific leatherback turtle off the west coast of the United States. In 1999 STRP broke off from its parent organization Earth Island Institute and was re-incorporated as the Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN). That same year STRP staff members marched with people dressed in sea turtle costumes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meetings in Seattle to protest the conflict of trade rules with protecting endangered species. In September 2008 the movie titled Battle in Seattle was released that dramatizes the events surrounding the 1999 WTO protests. Programs STRP currently has five programs that focus on protecting sea turtles and the marine environment. These include the Save the Leatherback program, Gulf of Mexico program, US Pacific sea turtle campaign, Central America program and Western Pacific program. In addition STRP has a public health campaign - Got Mercury? - that addresses the public health issue of mercury in seafood. Save the Leatherback Program STRP began the Save the Leatherback Program in 2000 when a scientific article published in Nature magazine stated that the Pacific leatherback sea turtle could become extinct within 10‚Äì30 years if its adult mortality was not drastically reduced.Spotila, J. R. et al., \\"Pacific leatherback turtles face extinction,\\" Nature 405 (2000): 529-530 Industrialized fishing practices, particularly longlining and drift gillnetting, used to catch swordfish, shark, and tuna, were cited as causing the most adult leatherback mortality. In response, STRP convened the International Leatherback Survival Conference in April 2002. The outcome was a call by leading sea turtle and marine scientists for a moratorium on Pacific longlining and drift gillnetting. In the next few years STRP organized over 1,000 scientists from 97 countries and 280 NGOs to sign a petition to the United Nations seeking a moratorium on high seas industrial longline fishing to prevent the extinction of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle.Victories . Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 28, 2008). In 2004 the documentary Last Journey for the Leatherback? was released, which depicts the plight of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle. US Pacific sea turtle program STRP's American Pacific sea turtle campaign began in 2001 when their legal action forced a seasonal closure of the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery to protect endangered sea turtles and other marine species. In 2006 STRP and a coalition of environmental organizations prevented efforts by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) to reopen the seasonal closure to drift gillnet fishing. STRP is currently working to prevent the development of a pelagic longline fishery within the California Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where it has been banned for 30 years to protect various marine species.West Coast Longline Fishery. Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 28, 2008). Gulf of Mexico program In August 2002 STRP merged with the Texas-based Help Endangered Animals ‚Äì Ridley Turtles (HEART) organization and opened its Gulf of Mexico office.HEART Help Endangered Animals - Ridley Turtles. Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 29, 2008). The focus of this program is protecting the habitat of the critically endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle through the enforcement of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in shrimp nets and the development of a Kemp's ridley marine reserve that is off limits to commercial fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008 a record-breaking season occurred with 148 Kemp's ridley nests found along the Texas coast, which was more than double the figure found in 2005.Gulf of Mexico Program. Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 29, 2008). Central America program Since 1989, STRP has been working directly in Central America with coastal communities in an effort to protect sea turtles. Along with its sister organization PRETOMA which is based in Costa Rica, STRP is focused on decreasing the threats to sea turtles in Central America that include development of nesting sites, killing of breeding females, illegal poaching of eggs, and the incidental capture of sea turtles by industrial fishing fleets.Central America Program. Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 29, 2008). Western Pacific program STRP's Western Pacific program began in 2006 and is based on the island of Papua New Guinea. STRP partners with coastal communities to protect and restore the declining leatherback turtle population and habitat by helping to establish conservation deeds in important nesting beaches and marine waters.Western Pacific Program. Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 29, 2008). Got Mercury? In 2002 STRP began its Got Mercury? program to educate the public about mercury levels in seafood and to take action to reduce the public's exposure to methylmercury in seafood.GotMercury.org . Sea Turtle Restoration Project (July 29, 2008). Got Mercury? has tested mercury levels in fish found in sushi restaurants and found high levels of mercury in tunaSea Turtle Restoration Project: Got Mercury? . GotMercury.org (July 29, 2008). Volunteers monitor restaurants and supermarkets to make sure they are in compliance with California's Proposition 65 law. Proposition 65 requires the posting of mercury in seafood consumer advisory warnings by seafood purveyors.Mercury in Seafood: No Fair Warning. GotMercury.org (July 29, 2008) Got Mercury? developed a free online mercury in seafood calculator that allows individuals to use the Environmental Protection Agency's calculations to estimate average mercury exposure levels by fish type and amount relative to a person's weight.

It grew in importance on the arrival of the canal, at the highest level ( above sea level) of which it lies, in 1784. Grand Canal Hotel In 1801 the Grand Canal Hotel was opened to cater for the passenger traffic along the canal and an extension was added in 1804. For a time business was good, with the canal carrying 100,000 passengers per year, but revenues began to fall and gradually the 72 windows and 62 hearths were closed up to avoid paying tax. It ceased being a hotel in 1849, was used as a barracks for the Irish Constabulary between 1869 and 1905 and was later used as a community centre. It has since closed and is now in private ownership. Hauntings. The Grand Canal Hotel is famously said to be haunted by the \\"Ghost of Fergal Dobbins\\" said to be a 3000 year old Vampire that came from the nearby bog land, he is said to appear in the town late at night and wander the dark roads and lanes before retreating back to the hotel at dawn. The hotel is also described locally as being haunted by spirits of old workmen from its days as a operating hotel in the 1800s. Modern times Fenton Bridge over the Grand Canal in Robertstown. There are three public houses in the village and two supermarkets. Developments include a set of canal-side cottages, and Lowtown Marina,Lowtown Marina with boats for sale and other services. The town caters for tourism with canal walks, fishing and an annual vintage fair which takes place in June every year. A local group, Robertstown Community Amenities Association (RTG Ltd.) was formed in 2008 with the aim to build a community centre on lands promised, with an added grant of 500,000 euro, to the community by Failte Ireland when the hotel was sold to a private buyer. A canal barge, 52M Eustace, was also to be transferred. Local TD Jimmy Percival, was recently quoted as saying that there are future plans to invest in the hotel with a view to restoring its operations as a restaurant. Wildlife Ducks, swans and herons, fish such as pike bream, barracuda, bream, tench, roach and stickleback, and mammals such as shrew, stroat, and rat, are all observed locally. There are rare ocassions where great whites can be spotted lurking in the waters of the grand canal in the village , though these sightings have been rare. Demographics The population of Robertstown more than tripled (from 206 to 707 inhabitants) in the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census. As of the 2002 census, Robertstown had a population of 375, growing (by 65.6%) to 621 in 2006, and to 669 by the time of the 2011 census. The 2016 census recorded a population of 666.

It comprises all of Main Street, Queen Elizabeth Way, and St. Mary's Road. Route description Beginning at the northern city limits, the route runs south as Main Street along the west bank of the Red River. After passing through downtown, it becomes the Queen Elizabeth Way from the Main Street Bridge to the Norwood Bridge, over the Assiniboine and Red Rivers. South of the Norwood Bridge, it continues along the east side of the river as St. Mary's Road to the south Perimeter Highway. At the northern city limits, Route 52 becomes Manitoba Highway 9; at the south Perimeter Highway, it continues as Manitoba Provincial Road 200. Route 52 passes through the suburbs of West Kildonan, the North End, Downtown, Fort Rouge, St. Boniface, and St. Vital. The section between Broadway and St. Anne's Road is part of Manitoba Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway. Many of Winnipeg's most prominent buildings and institutions are located along Main Street, including City Hall, the Centennial Concert Hall, the Manitoba Museum, Union Station, the Richardson Building, and 360 Main (formerly the Commodities Exchange tower). History Main Street is one of the oldest routes in the Winnipeg region. It originated as the trail between Lower Fort Garry and the various settlements huddled around the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. Its intersection with the Portage Trail near Upper Fort Garry (now downtown Winnipeg) spawned the Portage and Main corner, which is today the heart of the city. Upper Fort Garry was eventually demolished by the city in order to straighten the southern portion of Main Street and realign it to its current configuration. The north gate, the sole surviving piece of Upper Fort Garry, stands near the corner of Broadway and Main. St. Mary's Road is named after St. Mary's Parish (Ste. Marie Paroisse in French), a Roman Catholic parish located in the northernmost section of St. Vital.Winnipeg's Historic Sites and Monuments: An Illustrated Guide. City of Winnipeg Parks and Recreation Department. Published 1979. It was originally a trail that led from the parish south to the United States border at Emerson along the east side of the Red River. In rural Manitoba, St. Mary's Road is now incorporated into Provincial Roads 200 and 246. A short section of Main Street was renamed Queen Elizabeth Way to commemorate the 2002 Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the city.

It was first published in the Illustrated London News in 1892, and later published in book form in the short-story collection Island Nights' Entertainments (1893). It was written after Stevenson moved to the South Seas island of Samoa just a few years before he died there.  Plot  The story is told in the first person by John Wiltshire, a Scottish copra trader on the fictional South Sea island of Fales√°. Upon arriving on the island, he meets a rival trader named Case, who (in an apparently friendly gesture) arranges for him to be \\"married\\" to a local girl named Uma in a ceremony designed to impress the natives but to be completely non-binding in the view of Europeans. Wiltshire soon discovers that Uma has a taboo attached to her which causes all the other natives to refuse to do business with him, to Case's profit. He also hears rumours of Case having been involved in the suspicious deaths of his previous competitors. Although realising that he has been tricked, Wiltshire has genuinely fallen in love with Uma, and has their marriage legalised by a passing missionary. Wiltshire gradually learns that Case's influence over the villagers stems from their belief that he has demonic powers, as a result of his simple conjuring tricks as well as strange noises and visions they have experienced at a \\"temple\\" he has built in the forest. Upon investigating, Wiltshire finds that these experiences are also tricks produced by imported technologies such as luminous paint and Aeolian harps. Wiltshire sets out that night to destroy the temple with gunpowder. Case confronts him and the two men fight, resulting in Case's death. The story concludes with Wiltshire several years later living on another island, still happily married to Uma, worrying about what will happen to his mixed-race children.  Analysis  Stevenson saw \\"The Beach of Fales√°\\" as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romance to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin: In an unusual change for Stevenson, but in-line with realism, the plot of the story is less important, rather the realistic portrayal of the manners of various social classes in island society is foregrounded; it is essentially a novel of manners. As Stevenson says to Colvin in a letter, \\"The Beach of Fales√°\\" is \\"well fed with facts\\" and \\"true to the manners' of the society it depicts.\\" Other than the island itself which is fictional, it contains the names of real people, real ships and real buildings which Stevenson was familiar with from his personal travels in the South Seas. Of further interest regarding the analysis of this text is its publication history. Censored by its publisher, The Beach of Fales√° directly addresses British colonialism while confronting the taboos regarding miscegenation. A comparison of earlier printed editions to Steven's original draft has been a source of fairly recent scholarly inquiry.Robert Louis Stevenson and 'The Beach of Fales√°': A Study in Victorian Publishing by Barry Menikoff In a somewhat similar vein, another provocative approach to Stevenson's South Seas writings has been taken through the lens of ethnography.The ethnographic potential of Stevenson's South Sea Writing by Liam Connell In 1956, The Heritage Press of New York published a full version stating \\"the text (of the 1892 serialization) was bowdlerized, and the present printing represents the story exactly as R.L.S. wrote it.\\" The Beach of Falesa by Robert Louis Stevenson, The Heritage Press New York, Introduction by J. C. Furnas, Illustrated by Millard Sheets, Copyright 1956 by The George Macy Companies, Inc., 130 pp.  Reception  \\"The Beach of Fales√°\\", along with his two other South Seas tales in Island Nights' Entertainments, were generally poorly received by his peers in London. Stevenson was known and loved for his historical romances such as Treasure Island, Kidnapped and The Master of Ballantrae and so his shift to realism was not widely applauded. Oscar Wilde complained \\"I see that romantic surroundings [Samoa] are the worst surroundings possible for a romantic writer. In Gower Street Stevenson could have written a new Trois Mousquetaires. In Samoa he wrote letters to The Times about Germans.\\" Edmund Gosse wrote \\"The fact seems to be that it is very nice to live in Samoa, but not healthy to write there.\\" Screenplays based on the story were written by Dylan Thomas and Alan Sharp but never produced. Adding a narrator's voice, BBC Radio 3 broadcast Thomas's screenplay in May 2014. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042bh3t While its title was unnamed, the book was referenced importantly in the plotting of Georges Simenon's 1930 The Late Monsieur Gallet.

One of Dr. Royston's most significant achievements may be his successful efforts to partner academic medical research with industry to take potential treatments more quickly from the benchtop to the bedside. After co-founding the first biotechnology company in San Diego, California, he and his associates went on to form or invest in dozens of other biotechs, laying the foundation of the region's thriving biotech cluster, one of the three largest in the United States. As a venture capitalist, Dr. Royston invests in start-up companies that have promising technologies for treating and potentially curing diseases, including various forms of cancer.\\"Ivor Royston, MD\\", VentureForth, 2005. Accessed June 20, 2008.\\"Ivor Royston profile\\", LinkedIn, 2008. Accessed June 20, 2008. Born in Retford, England, Dr. Royston emigrated to the United States with his family in 1954 at age 9, and later, as a 14-year-old, he declared that he would devote his life to curing cancer. Unlike many future scientists, his passion also extended to commerce. This early interest in business manifested itself in a Washington, D.C., high-school investment club of 16 boys -- dubbed the Chessmen -- that he founded with friends. He also bought and operated an ice cream truck to earn money for college. These divergent interests -- medicine and business -- would one day catapult Dr. Royston beyond his peers, transforming San Diego's economy while improving the health and lives of tens of thousands of patients along the way.\\"Ivor Royston, MD\\", Conde Nast Portfolio.com:, 2008. Accessed June 20, 2008. Accomplishments In 1978 Royston, then an assistant professor at the University of California-San Diego, bridged a chasm between academia and the marketplace, triggering a paradigm shift that forever changed San Diego's medical research community and led to the region's establishment as a leading international biotech clusters.\\"Innovation Prospectors: San Diegans ply a river of ideas for biotech gold\\" , Acello, Rich. San Diego Magazine, June 2008. Accessed June 20, 2008. Royston's reasoning was that private enterprise clearly provided the fastest way to get new, life-saving medicines from the research bench top to the patient's bedside. While serving as a researcher and a practicing physician at UCSD, Royston felt the frustration at the long process required to deliver innovative treatments to patients. That frustration fueled his decisive action to work towards eliminating the disconnect between research and clinical application by founding Hybritech with fellow scientist Howard Birndorf in 1978.\\"Cancer Researcher Turned Venture Capitalist\\" , San Diego Metropolitan, November 2002. Accessed June 20, 2008. The idea behind Hybritech was to harness monoclonal antibodies to quickly diagnose and treat diseases. Financier Brook Byers, of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, realized the importance of the science and recognized the longer-term value of the budding entrepreneurs' passion, energy and commitment. His firm provided the $300,000 start-up funding, and Hybritech's first product, antibodies for the hepatitis B virus, reached the research market in 1980. The PSA test developed later by the company for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer has benefited countless victims of this deadly disease and set the stage for new blood tests for the early detection of cancer. Hybritech went public in 1981 and, five years later, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company paid $480 million for the company.\\"The Birth of Biotech: How one company helped seed San Diego's industry\\", Chi, Kelly Rae. The Scientist. Accessed June 20, 2008.\\"Forbes Profile: Ivor Royston, MD\\", Forbes.com, 2008. Accessed June 20, 2008. Dr. Royston went on to co-found IDEC Pharmaceuticals (later Biogen Idec) in 1985. Other co-founders included Howard Birndorf, Richard Miller and Brook Byers. He also co-founded the San Diego Regional Cancer Center, of which he was president and CEO 1990 until 2000. Renamed the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in 1995, it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. More than 50 San Diego companies trace their lineage directly to Hybritech, its founders and early employees. Among those are IDEC, San Diego's biggest biotech success story, with a billion dollars in sales for its lymphoma treatment Rituxan. Others include Amylin, Cancervax, Gen-Probe, Ligand Pharmaceuticals and Nanogen. In addition to Hybritech, Dr. Royston has been directly involved in the founding or funding of many biotech companies as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. These companies include: Applied Molecular Evolution, Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Combichem (acquired by Dupont), Corixa, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, Genesys Therapeutics (merged with Somatix and acquired by Cell Genesys), Genquest (acquired by Corixa), HenaQuest, IDEC Pharmaceuticals (merged with Biogen), LigoCyte, Micromet (formerly CancerVax), Morphotek (Acquired by Eisai Corporation), Sequana Therapeutics (merged with Arris to form AXYS and acquired by Celera Genomics), Syndax, Targegen, Triangle Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead) and Variagenics (merged with Hyseq Pharmaceuticals to form Nuvelo). -- Dr. Daniel Gold Career milestones * In 1970, Dr. Royston earned an MD from Johns Hopkins University, after receiving a BA in Human Biology from JHU in 1967. He chose Stanford University for his internship and residency (1970‚Äì72) and clinical oncology fellowship (1975‚Äì77) in order to study with cancer research luminaries Saul Rosenberg and Henry Kaplan. He is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology. * Dr. Royston served in the Public Health Service at National Institutes of Health from 1972-75 conducting research in virology and immunology. * In 1977, Dr. Royston accepted a position as assistant professor of medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, at the University of California-San Diego, where he was instrumental in developing the new UCSD Cancer Center as the director of Clinical Immunology. * Dr. Royston remained at UCSD until 1990, earning tenure while continuing his entrepreneurial activities. During those years, he served as the director of UCSD's Cell Surface Marker Laboratory, as director of the Clinical Immunology Program at the UCSD Cancer Center, and as chief of the Oncology Section at the VA Medical Center in San Diego. * In 1990, Dr. Royston established the San Diego Regional Cancer Center, now known as the Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC), with Drs. Tom Shiftan and Alan Goodman. Again Dr. Royston was driven not only to discover cutting-edge cancer therapy, but to speed the process of delivering treatments to patients. Thanks to his leadership and vision, and an affiliation with Sharp HealthCare, SKCC is today recognized as a leading center for translational cancer research. * During his years at UCSD and the Cancer Center, Dr. Royston made significant contributions as a medical researcher. He was one of the first to use monoclonal antibodies to treat patients with melanoma, leukemia and T cell lymphoma. He developed radio- labeled monoclonal antibodies that came to be known as \\"magic bullets\\" for the precise delivery of radiation therapy to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. And he was on the front lines in developing gene therapies for treating cancer. * In 1993, Dr. Royston and Stan Fleming founded Forward Ventures. This new venture capital firm empowered Dr. Royston to apply his extensive scientific and medical knowledge to the founding and funding of companies developing breakthrough medical treatments. Forward Ventures became the largest fund in Southern California focused exclusively on the life sciences. * In 1996, President Bill Clinton appointed Dr. Royston to a six- year term on the National Cancer Advisory Board. * As a producer of the Broadway musical Jersey Boys, Dr. Royston won a 2006 Tony award for best musical. \\"Ivor Royston, Producer\\", Internet Broadway Database, 2006.

A pioneer in cancer research\\", he completed over 250 papers before his death. Sugiura received a number of awards and prizes throughout his life, and retired from the center in 1962. He is perhaps best known for his work on laetrile, a controversial alternative cancer treatment, which he was convinced had a palliative effect on certain mice tumors. The report that was released by Sugiura of his findings of the experiment are as follows: The results clearly show that Amygdalin(Laetrile) significantly inhibits the appearance of lung metastasis in mice bearing spontaneous mammary tumors and increases significantly the inhibition of the growth of the primary tumors....Laetrile also seemed to prevent slightly the appearance of new tumors....The improvement of health and appearance of the treated animals in comparison to controls is always a common observation....Dr. Sugiura has never observed complete regression of these tumors in all his cosmic experience with other chemotherapeutic agents.  Laetrile controversy  In 1972, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center board member Benno Schmidt convinced the hospital to test laetrile in order to assert its ineffectiveness \\"with some conviction\\". Sugiura found that laetrile inhibited secondary tumors in mice, without destroying the primary tumor, but in a blind test was unable to conclude that laetrile had anticancer activity. The initial positive results were not published because, in the words of Chester Stock, Sugiura's supervisor, \\"it would have caused all kind of havoc.\\" Nevertheless, they were leaked in 1973, causing a stir. Consequently laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems, and a Sloan-Kettering press release concluded that laetrile showed no beneficial effects. Three other researchers were unable to confirm Sugiura's results. Mistakes in the Sloan-Kettering press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents, led by Ralph Moss, former public affairs official of Sloan-Kettering hospital, who was fired when he announced his membership in the group. These mistakes were considered inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in Science noted that, \\"even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate.\\" The results of all of the studies were published together in the Journal of Surgical Oncology.Published in Journal of Surgical Oncology 10(2).

He took part in several campaigns of the French Grande Arm√©e in Dutch army units of the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland that were attached to that army. After the United Kingdom of the Netherlands regained its independence he joined its army. He commanded, as a captain, a battery of horse artillery that played a pivotal role in the Battle of Waterloo. He died in action as a major during the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Early career Krahmer (he took the name Krahmer de Bichin only after 1815Vets Heijn, p. 5, note 2) originally came from the principality of Waldeck in Germany. He entered the service of the Batavian Republic as a cadet with the 2nd Artillery Battalion in January, 1804. He was promoted to second lieutenant on September 29, 1806, and assigned to the first horse battery of that bataillon. This battery was attached to the (Dutch) Arm√©e du Nord of the Kingdom of Holland that same month and it took part in the campaign of Marshal Mortier's army corps in Swedish Pomerania in 1807.Uythoven, op. cit. Assigned to gen. Mihaud's first division Krahmer participated in the Battle of Friedland of 1807. After the battery ran out of ammunition, Krahmer's single 6-pdr gun alone continued firing, with ammunition supplied by a nearby French battery. For this he later received the L√©gion d'honneur.Uythoven, op. cit. Krahmer was promoted to first lieutenant on August 8, 1808. He earlier participated in the Dutch/Danish attack on Stralsund, on May 31, 1808, fighting an artillery duel to cover the infantry attack.Uythoven, op. cit. After Krahmer transferred to the foot artillery he was promoted to captain on August 31, 1813. He had been integrated into the French army with the rest of the Dutch army after the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland in 1810. He took part in the final German campaign of Napoleon I of France's army in 1813, was taken prisoner as part of the garrison of Dresden, and imprisoned in Hungary.Uythoven, op. cit. Battle of Waterloo After his release he entered the service of the by now again independent Netherlands in the \\"south Netherlands\\" (i.e. Belgian) part of its army in 1814. He received command, in the rank of captain, of a horse artillery battery, part of the combined 7th/8th company of the horse artillery corps. This battery was manned by Belgians. The battery was attached to the First Brigade (col. Detmers) of the Third Netherlands Division (general Chass√©) on the eve of the battle of Waterloo.Uythoven, op. cit. Initially the Third Division was placed in reserve on the right wing of the Anglo-Allied army of the Duke of Wellington. Later it was ordered forward, behind the British troops of Sir Colin Halkett's Fifth Brigade. When Chass√© noticed a slackening of the firing of one of the British artillery batteries (apparently due to lack of ammunition), he ordered Krahmer's battery forward to take this battery's place. He came in line behind the hollow road, to the left of Lloyd's battery, where Cleeve's battery had been.Uythoven, op. cit. The horse artillery unlimbers by Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht Now the action unfolded that is depicted in Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht's painting, entitled De rijdende artillerie komt in stelling (The horse artillery unlimbers).Vets Heijn, op. cit., p. 3 He immediately engaged a French battery near La Haye Sainte that was enfilading the British artillery at the time, forcing it out of position. Next the battery started pouring a murderous fire into the French Middle Guard division, cutting lanes through its columns. When next the Detmers brigade performed a bayonet attack on the French Guards, Krahmer came forward to support it under the direction of Major Van der Smissen.This explains why often the action of the battery is attributed to Van der Smissen in the literature; Uythoven, op. cit. As a consequence the French Guards faltered and eventually broke. This was the turning point in the battle. During the action, Krahmer's battery lost 27 men dead and 21 wounded.Uythoven, op. cit. for the account of the entire action Later career For his action Krahmer was given the Knight's Cross 4th class of the Military William Order on July 18, 1815. He next took part in the final campaign of the Allied army in northern France until the fall of Paris. In the early 1820s Krahmer wrote the words for the regimental song of the Belgo-Dutch horse artillery: Nous sommes tous de francs lurons (We are all likely ladsFranc-luron is an archaic piece of French slang that deserves to be translated with an equivalent colloquialism. \\"Bon-vivant\\" comes close, but is too \\"respectable,\\" as the term has connotations of \\"hard- drinking womanizer.\\" It is a soldier's song after all. But \\"hooligan\\" would be too harsh.). On August 1, 1826 Krahmer was promoted to major of horse artillery. He took part in the opening stage of the Dutch campaign to suppress the Belgian Revolution militarily in August, 1830. He died in action during bloody street fighting in Brussels, on September 23, 1830.Uythoven, op. cit. Notes References *G. van Uythoven, Krahmer de Bichin, Carel Frederik * N.

A trusted confidant of four-time Pittsburgh Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh, Oceak was coaching at third base on October 13, 1960, during Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, when Pirate second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit his dramatic walk-off home run to clinch the Series against the New York Yankees. Oceak, wearing uniform #44, can be seen in many of the films and still photos of the historic event, celebrating with Mazeroski as he rounds third base and following him to home plate. Frank Oceak was born in Pocahontas, Virginia. He batted and threw right-handed, and stood tall and weighed . Primarily a second baseman and shortstop, Oceak spent his entire playing career (1932‚Äì40; 1942‚Äì43; 1946‚Äì47) in the lower minor leagues, briefly as a member of the Yankees' farm system. He became a player-manager at age 25 in 1938 with the Lafayette White Sox of the Class D Evangeline League‚Äîwhich was, despite its nickname, an affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. Two years later, as manager of the Beaver Falls Browns of the Class D Pennsylvania State Association, Oceak was suspended by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis for the entire 1941 season for an assault on an umpire.Marcin, Joe, ed., The Baseball Register, St. Louis: The Sporting News: 1970 However, Oceak resumed his playing and managing careers in 1942 with the Oil City Oilers of the PSA, his first assignment in the Pirates' organization, where he would spend most of the rest of his baseball life. The bulk of his managing career, as in his playing days, took place in the lower minors, until 1957 when he was named skipper of the Columbus Jets of the Triple-A International League, one of the Pirates' two top-tier farm clubs. The following season, he was named to Murtaugh's coaching staff, serving for seven seasons as the Bucs' third base coach before Murtaugh resigned because of ill health at the close of the campaign. Oceak then spent one season, , with the Cincinnati Reds as a coach under Dick Sisler before returning to Pittsburgh as a minor league manager at the Class A and Double-A levels from 1966‚Äì69. In , Murtaugh returned to the dugout as manager of the Pirates, and Oceak rejoined him as third-base coach. He served through another world championship with the 1971 Pirates. When Murtaugh retired in the days after the 1971 World Series, Oceak stayed on for one more season as a coach under Bill Virdon before leaving baseball. He died in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 70. His career record as a minor league manager was 1,285 victories, and 1,386 defeats (.481).

Plantation Dockery's parents left the Carolinas sometime before the American Civil War and settled in Mississippi as farmers, but were left poor by the war's end. Dockery was born in Love, Mississippi, and went on to graduate from the University of Mississippi in 1885. He left the family farm and purchased, with a $1000 gift from his grandmother, tracts of forest and marshland outside of Cleveland, Mississippi in the Mississippi Delta between the Yazoo River and the Sunflower River. First he went into the lumber business, cutting trees and building a sawmill. As he made more money he acquired more land; realizing that the bottom soil was rich, he cleared the trees, drained the marshes of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and began to plant cotton. It subsequently became known that Dockery needed manual labor, and he was willing to pay for it, so laborers flocked there. Eventually, Will Dockery built a large cotton gin, a post office and a company store which produced its own money. By the 1930s, Dockery plantation covered of rich fertile river delta lowland. Will Dockery earned a reputation for treating his workers fairly. Over the years, black laborers began to migrate to the Dockery Plantation, to work in the fields and become tenant farmers or sharecroppers, a system in which they leased land to cultivate, paying the owner a share of the crop. The families lived on their land and grew their own gardens. Often peripatetic blues musicians were attracted there for itinerant work and they lived in what were called the \\"quarters\\" for bachelors, known for the partying and drinking going on there. Here musicians, often drunk, played their music far into the night. The guitar was particularly suited to the rural Mississippi Delta musician. The Mississippi Blues Commission placed a historic marker at the site of the plantation in recognition of its enormous importance in the development of the Mississippi blues. The blues Although the complete history will never be known, there is a central theme to the development of what is known as the blues, and that is the plantation that Will Dockery built outside of Cleveland. Although Dockery was unaware of the music his laborers played in their quarters at \\"house parties\\" during their off hours, his plantation provided a particularly fertile atmosphere for musicians to gather and play their music while others listened and danced. It is difficult to know what Mississippi music would have emerged without the musical mix of Tommy Johnson, Charley Patton, and Robert Johnson. Historic marker A marker designating Dockery Plantation as a site on the Mississippi Blues Trail is an acknowledgment of the important contribution of the plantation to the development of the blues in Mississippi. The marker was placed in Cleveland, Mississippi.

History Don Stevenson first obtained local recognition as a member of The Frantics, a band based in Seattle and including fellow Washingtonian Jerry Miller (from Tacoma) on guitar. The band relocated to San Francisco in 1966 and formed the nucleus of what became Moby Grape. Stevenson's position in Moby Grape is similar to, but predates that of Don Henley of The Eagles, in that Stevenson was a drummer and a principal songwriter and lead singer.This position is exemplified in his 1967 performance, with Moby Grape, of \\"Omaha\\" on the Mike Douglas Show. The performance is accessible here With Jerry Miller, Stevenson is the co-writer of three of Moby Grape's best known songs, \\"Hey Grandma\\" and \\"8:05\\", both from Moby Grape's self-titled first album (1967) and \\"Murder In My Heart for The Judge\\", from the Wow album (1968). The latter song was covered by both Three Dog Night and Lee Michaels, while Robert Plant covered \\"8:05\\" and The Move covered \\"Hey Grandma\\". He continued to write with Jerry Miller during the course of Moby Grape's four albums with Columbia Records (1967-1969). In later years, such as on Moby Grape's Legendary Grape album (1989) and beginning with 20 Granite Creek (1971), Stevenson contributed songs that were solely composed. Stevenson is the only member of Moby Grape to continue in music while at the same time developing occupational interests outside of music. Stevenson has become well known in real estate circles, such as in relation to the sale of time shares in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, a resort location where he maintains a residence.Frank Goodman, Interview with Jerry Miller, puremusic.com, June 2007; accessed December 31, 2015.

Informational sign The Bellamy Road was the first major U.S. federal highway in early territorial Florida. Land travel and transportation in Florida prior to its acquisition by the United States was by foot over trails. The Spanish used existing Native American trails to reach missions established in the interior of Florida. The main route from St. Augustine to the Apalachee Province was known as el Camino Real, the Royal Road. In the latter part of the 17th century the Spanish tried, with limited success, to improve the Royal Road to allow use by ox carts. In 1824, three years after Florida became a United States territory, the United States Congress authorized the construction of a road connecting Pensacola to St. Augustine. The law specified crossing points for the Choctawhatchee River, Econfina Creek (using the natural bridge there) and the Apalachicola River. From Tallahassee the road was to follow the old Spanish Road (Camino Real) to St. Augustine, crossing the St. Johns River at Picolata. Congress authorized US$20,000 for the project. The Army, which was responsible for constructing the road, solicited proposals to build the eastern portion of the road. John Bellamy of Monticello, with the endorsement of Florida Territorial Governor William Duval, offered to construct the road between the Ochlockonee River and St. Augustine for US$13,500. The Army contracted with Bellamy, and the Ochlockonee River to St. Augustine section became known as Bellamy's (or Bellamy) Road. Bellamy built the road using equipment and slaves from his plantation, and completed his portion of the road in 1826. The congressional act state that the road was to be wide, but the contract with Bellamy required that the road only be wide. Tree stumps were to cut as close to the ground as possible, in order to clear a wagon's axles. Travelers quickly complained that the road was not always wide enough to let two wagons pass, that the bridges were inadequate, and that some stumps (\\"stump knockers\\") were too tall, jolting passengers and breaking axles. The Bellamy Road followed the general route of the Spanish Royal Road (el Camino Real) or Old Mission Trail, used by Native Americans and Spanish missionaries, running from Mission San Luis de Apalachee near Tallahassee to St. Augustine. It headed eastward through present-day Jefferson County, and then crossed the Aucilla River by ferry into Madison County. The road continued eastward most of the way across Madison County until close to the Suwannee River, turning south into Lafayette County. The road crossed the Suwannee River by ferry into Suwannee County and ran southward close to the Suwannee River. It then passed into Columbia County, running past the Fig Springs mission site on the Ichetucknee River and entering Alachua County using the natural bridge of the Santa Fe River at O'Leno State Park. The road continued across northern Alachua County to near Lake Santa Fe. From there, the route of Bellamy Road forms the current boundary between the northwest part of Putnam County and the southwest part of Clay County. The road then crossed southeast Clay County, crossed the St. Johns River at Picolata, and continued through St. Johns County to St. Augustine.

The majority of known members of the group lived in the Cretaceous; one species, Gurbanodelta kara, is known from the late Paleocene (Gashatan) of China. Their fossils are restricted to Central Asia and North America. This order can be defined as all metatherians closer to Deltatheridium than to Marsupialia. These mammals possessed primitive tritubercular (three-cusped) lower molars that were not tribosphenic. This is awkward because tribosphenic molars are commonly found in most therian mammals (there exist some exceptions such as anteaters and some whales, which have no teeth at all). When they were first identified in the 1920s, they were believed to be placentals and possible ancestors of the \\"creodonts\\" (a polyphyletic group of extinct carnivorous mammals from the Paleogene and Miocene), but this was later disproven.

The problem was identified and named by Atle Selberg in 1949. Beginning around 1996, John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec developed some parity-sensitive sieves that make the parity problem less of an obstacle. Statement Terence Tao gave this \\"rough\\" statement of the problem: This problem is significant because it may explain why it is difficult for sieves to \\"detect primes,\\" in other words to give a non-trivial lower bound for the number of primes with some property. For example, in a sense Chen's theorem is very close to a solution of the twin prime conjecture, since it says that there are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is either prime or the product of two primes. The parity problem suggests that, because the case of interest has an odd number of prime factors (namely 1), it won't be possible to separate out the two cases using sieves. Example This example is due to Selberg and is given as an exercise with hints by Cojocaru & Murty. The problem is to estimate separately the number of numbers ‚â§ x with no prime divisors ‚â§ x1/2, that have an even (or an odd) number of prime factors. It can be shown that, no matter what the choice of weights in a Brun- or Selberg-type sieve, the upper bound obtained will be at least (2 + o(1)) x / ln x for both problems. But in fact the set with an even number of factors is empty and so has size 0. The set with an odd number of factors is just the primes between x1/2 and x, so by the prime number theorem its size is (1 + o(1)) x / ln x. Thus these sieve methods are unable to give a useful upper bound for the first set, and overestimate the upper bound on the second set by a factor of 2. Parity-sensitive sieves Beginning around 1996 John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec developed some new sieve techniques to \\"break\\" the parity problem. One of the triumphs of these new methods is the Friedlander‚ÄìIwaniec theorem, which states that there are infinitely many primes of the form a2 \\\\+ b4. Glyn Harman relates the parity problem to the distinction between Type I and Type II information in a sieve. Karatsuba phenomenon In 2007 Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba discovered an imbalance between the numbers in an arithmetic progression with given parities of the number of prime factors. His papers were published after his death. Let \\\\mathbb{N} be a set of natural numbers (positive integers) that is, the numbers 1, 2, 3, \\\\dots. The set of primes, that is, such integers n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, n > 1, that have just two distinct divisors (namely, n and 1), is denoted by \\\\mathbb{P}, \\\\mathbb{P}=\\\\\\\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\\\dots\\\\\\\\}\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{N}. Every natural number n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, n > 1, can be represented as a product of primes (not necessarily distinct), that is n = p_1p_2\\\\dots p_k, where p_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}, \\\\ p_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}, \\\\ \\\\dots, \\\\ p_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}, and such representation is unique up to the order of factors. If we form two sets, the first consisting of positive integers having even number of prime factors, the second consisting of positive integers having an odd number of prime factors, in their canonical representation, then the two sets are approximately the same size. If, however, we limit our two sets to those positive integers whose canonical representation contains no Primes in arithmetic progression, for example 6m + 1, m = 1, 2, \\\\dots or the progression km + l, 1 \\\\leq l < k, (l,k) = 1, m = 0, 1, 2, \\\\dots, then of these positive integers, those with an even number of prime factors will tend to be fewer than those with odd number of prime factors. Karatsuba discovered this property. He found also a formula for this phenomenon, a formula for the difference in cardinalities of sets of natural numbers with odd and even amount of prime factors, when these factors are complied with certain restrictions. In all cases, since the sets involved are infinite, by \\"larger\\" and \\"smaller\\" we mean the limit of the ratio of the sets as an upper bound on the primes goes to infinity. In the case of primes containing an arithmetic progression, Karatsuba proved that this limit is infinite. We restate the Karatsuba phenomenon using mathematical terminology. Let \\\\mathbb{N}_0 and \\\\mathbb{N}_1 be subsets of \\\\mathbb{N}, such that n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_0, if n contains an even number of prime factors, and n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_1, if n contains an odd number of prime factors. Intuitively, the sizes of the two sets \\\\mathbb{N}_0 and \\\\mathbb{N}_1 are approximately the same. More precisely, for all x\\\\geq 1, we define n_0(x) and n_1(x), where n_0(x) is the cardinality of the set of all numbers n from \\\\mathbb{N}_0 such that n \\\\leq x, and n_1(x) is the cardinality of the set of all numbers n from \\\\mathbb{N}_1 such that n \\\\leq x. The asymptotic behavior of n_0(x) and n_1(x) was derived by E. Landau: n_0(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2}x + O\\\\left(x e^{-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln x}}\\\\right), n_1(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2}x + O\\\\left(x e^{-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln x}}\\\\right); c > 0. This shows that n_0(x) \\\\sim n_1(x)\\\\sim\\\\frac12x, that is n_0(x) and n_1(x) are asymptotically equal. Further, n_1(x)-n_0(x)=O\\\\left(xe^{-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln x}}\\\\right), so that the difference between the cardinalities of the two sets is small. On the other hand, if we let k \\\\geq 2 be a natural number, and l_1, l_2, \\\\dots l_r be a sequence of natural numbers, 1 \\\\leq r < \\\\varphi(k), such that 1\\\\leq l_j < k; (l_j,k) =1; every l_j are different modulo k; j = 1, 2, \\\\dots r. Let \\\\mathbb{A} be a set of primes belonging to the progressions kn + l_j; j \\\\leq r. (\\\\mathbb{A} is the set of all primes not dividing k). We denote as \\\\mathbb{N}^* a set of natural numbers, which do not contain prime factors from \\\\mathbb{A}, and as \\\\mathbb{N}^*_0 a subset of numbers from \\\\mathbb{N}^* with even number of prime factors, as \\\\mathbb{N}^*_1 a subset of numbers from \\\\mathbb{N}^* with odd number of prime factors. We define the functions n^*(x) = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{ \\\\begin{array}{c} n\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^*\\\\end{array}}1 ; n^*_0(x) = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{ \\\\begin{array}{c} n\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^*_0\\\\end{array}}1 ; n^*_1(x) = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{ \\\\begin{array}{c} n\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^*_1\\\\end{array}}1 . Karatsuba proved that, for x\\\\to+\\\\infty the asymptotic formula n^*_1(x)-n^*_0(x)\\\\sim C n^*(x)(\\\\ln x)^{2\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{\\\\varphi(k)}-1\\\\right)}, is valid, where C is a positive constant. He also showed that it is possible to prove the analogous theorems for other sets of natural numbers, for example, for numbers which are representable in the form of the sum of two squares, and that sets of natural numbers, all factors of which do belong to \\\\mathbb{A}, will display analogous asymptotic behavior. The Karatsuba theorem was generalized for the case when \\\\mathbf{A} is a certain unlimited set of primes. The Karatsuba phenomenon is illustrated by the following example. We consider the natural numbers whose canonical representation does not include primes belonging to the progression 6m + 1, m = 1, 2, \\\\dots. Then this phenomenon is expressed by the formula: n^*_1(x) - n^*_0(x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8\\\\sqrt3}\\\\frac{n^*(x)}{\\\\ln x}, x \\\\to +\\\\infty .

Two of the students, 12-year-olds Wade Simmons and Henrike Foerster, were killed in the sinking. The ship sank suddenly in rain and nearly gale-force winds, causing the parents of the deceased to question the captain's decision to travel in such bad weather. The captain ignored a Small craft advisory warning about the relatively heavy seas and high winds prior to leaving the dock (1m waves and 15-25 knot winds), although it was later reported that the vessel experienced winds of 30 knots.https://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports- reports/marine/2000/m00c0033/m00c0033.html The remaining 18 people on board (11 of whom were classmates of the victims) managed to survive by swimming approximately 200 metres to shore. None of the passengers were wearing lifejackets, as it was not officially required by law at the time to don them unless the captain ordered a ship evacuation. This rule came under some scrutiny after the accident. An inquest into the events was in fact later launched and ended in the jury calling for safer school field trips and boating standards in Ontario. One issue that was pointed out was that there were 22 lifejackets, which were stored in garbage bags, on board, but that only two were child-sized despite the fact that there were 13 children on board. The sinking of the True North II on a whole, however, was ruled to be an accident.

Lindstr√∂m is so far the only one sentenced for the crime. Spaliviero served 11 years in prison and was released October 2017, but was never charged for the hitman case. The hitman case has been widely reported by media in Australia and Scandinavia. Charlotte Lindstr√∂m Charlotte Karin Lindstr√∂m (born 9 August 1984 in Sollentuna, Sweden) is a former waitress, promotion model, and former prisoner having spent three years in a Sydney jail after being arrested on 26 May 2007 in Sydney, Australia on suspicion of trying to hire a hitman to kill two men who were about to testify against her boyfriend Steven Spaliviero in court. Case Lindstr√∂m arrived in Sydney in 2004 working as a part-time model as well as a waitress in the exclusive nightclub Hemmesphere in Sydney. In Sydney, Lindstr√∂m met Steven Spaliviero and they soon started a relationship living in an apartment in Darling Harbour. Lindstr√∂m later told the court that she soon realised that he was both a wealthy businessman and a drug dealer. In early 2007, investigators started to look into Spaliviero's business and soon found two witnesses who said they had information about the man's drug dealing business. At that time Spaliviero was already on bail from Melbourne in relation to another drug case. Spaliviero was arrested, refused bail and sent to Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (\\"MRRC\\") in Silverwater, New South Wales. Murder plot In MRRC, Spaliviero allegedly met another inmate who offered him to get witnesses in Spaliviero's case killed. In relation to this, Spaliviero phoned Lindstr√∂m from MRRC telling her to meet a \\"solicitor\\" and give him money. Lindstr√∂m started acting upon instructions from Spaliviero. When Lindstr√∂m finally met who she thought was a hitman, but who in reality was an undercover police officer, she was arrested. The policeman on the case stated that Lindstr√∂m wanted to have two men taken to the \\"cemetery\\" which meant she wanted them dead. The price was agreed as for each contract. Upon her arrest on 26 May Lindstr√∂m was remanded in custody. Later an application for bail was made where Steven Spaliviero's mother, Dolores Spaliviero, offered to put up surety to get Lindstr√∂m out from custody. In addition, Lindstr√∂m's friend and employer, Justin Hemmes provided an undertaking that if Lindstr√∂m was set free on bail, he would let her continue her work at the Hemmesphere nightclub until the trial. The application for bail was denied due to flight risk and Lindstr√∂m was remanded in custody. On 18 September, having had a deal made with the prosecutors Lindstr√∂m pleaded guilty to the charges. On 21 December, she pleaded guilty in another court in Sydney. Lindstr√∂m appeared in a bullet-proof vest at her court hearings because of the alleged death threats against her. Lindstr√∂m was initially sentenced to four years in jail being eligible for early parole on 25 May 2009. Even though Lindstr√∂m was given a hefty discount from her sentence because she had agreed to testify against Steven Spaliviero and two other men, the Crown appealed against the sentence as \\"manifestly inadequate\\". The criminal court of appeals heard the appeal on 4 July 2008. On 23 July 2008, her maximum sentence was increased from three years and ten months to four years and nine months, making her eligible for parole in May 2010. On 11 August 2008, Lindstr√∂m started testifying against Spaliviero in his court case, even reading a love letter to the court which she had written to him in February 2007, some months before her own arrest. Despite Lindstr√∂m's extensive testimonies, Spaliviero and two other defendants were found not guilty for the murder plot. Lindstr√∂m was released on parole from Long Bay jail in New South Wales on 25 May 2010 and deported the next day from Australia. Since her release from prison, Lindstr√∂m has returned to her native home Sweden and is understood to have had ongoing threats against her life. According to the Australian media, on 15 August 2010, Charlotte Lindstr√∂m agreed to return to Australia to testify in the trial of Spaliviero's associate. Due to an unspecified severe illness, she has not been allowed to travel to Australia. The upcoming trial has been postponed. Court hearings after sentence On 11 August 2008, Lindstr√∂m was in court reading the love letter she wrote to Steven in February 2007, some months before her own arrest. In June 2009, Lindstr√∂m started to testify against Spaliviero in a Sydney courtroom. A video of Lindstr√∂ms 2007 arrest in Sydney was also released to the media. However, in July 2009 Steven Spaliviero and two suspected accomplices were found not guilty of conspiracy to murder the witnesses. Spaliviero argued that Lindstr√∂m had acted alone and that he, Spaliviero, only wanted to discredit the witnesses, not murder them. Media In November, a few months after being released Charlotte Lindstr√∂m appeared on the Australian 60 Minutes on Channel 9 telling about her time in jail and about how she could do the crime she was sentenced for. Channel 9 in Australia aired a documentary on 6 September 2011 concentrating on Charlotte Lindstr√∂m's murder plot. According to the article in The Sydney Morning Herald Charlotte Lindstr√∂m \\"no longer has feelings for\\" Steven Spaliviero. Steven Spaliviero published a book in 2017 called Narco X about his criminal past and his relationship with Lindstr√∂m.Jetsetsvenskans ex sl√§ppt ur f√§ngelset talar ut om lyxlivet Aftonbladet Retrieved 5 December 2017 References Crime in Sydney 2007 crimes in Australia ","title":"2007 Hitman case"},{"id":"18817674","text":"Ottho Gerhard Heldringstichting (Dutch: Ottho Gerhard Heldring Foundation) is a Dutch orthopaedic institution in Zetten, Netherlands.

History The facility is named after Ottho Gerhard Heldring, in his time a famous Dutchmen. As author and pastor He worried about and cared for the less fortunate and people with problems. In 1848 he founded the first society offering place to young women who were pregnant against their will. And the children of these women were raised by his society and received education. Also youngster that couldn't survive in society because of their behavior could find shelter and help as well. Education has always been important for Heldring.

Arid or semiarid conditions are encountered in the Baja California Peninsula, the northwestern state of Sonora, the northern altiplano, and also significant portions of the southern altiplano. Rainfall in these regions averages between per year, although even less in some areas, particularly in the state of Baja California. Average rainfall totals are between in most of the major populated areas of the southern altiplano, including Mexico City and Guadalajara. Low-lying areas along the Gulf of Mexico receive in excess of of rainfall in an average year, with the wettest region being the southeastern state of Tabasco, which typically receives approximately of rainfall on an annual basis.

Description It grows as a shrub up to five metres high, with a down of fine hairs on the stems. This variety has the smallest leaves of any B. sessilis variety, being no more than three centimetres long, and less than two centimetres wide. They are often wedge-shaped with a long, toothless lower margin, and as such are quite similar to those of B. sessilis var. flabellifolia, only somewhat smaller, with a concave lower margin, sometimes with small lobes at the base, and often a much darker green. As with other varieties of B. sessilis, the flowers are greenish-yellow. Each head contains from 55 to 65 flowers. Taxonomy This variety was first published by Michel Gandoger in 1919. Gandoger actually published two names: Dryandra quinquedentata, based on specimen material collected from the Swan River by Arthur Mills Lea in 1902; and Dryandra cygnorum, based on material collected by Alexander Morrison from the Swan River in the vicinity of Melville, on 31 July 1897. In 1996, Alex George declared these two names to refer to the same plant, since Gandoger distinguished them only by the width of the leaves, the number of leaf teeth, and the length of the flower head, all of which are quite variable in this variety. He adopted the epithet cygnorum, demoting it to a variety of D. sessilis. Gandoger did not explicitly give an etymology for the epithet cygnorum, but it is assumed to be from the Latin cygnorus (\\"swan\\"), in reference to the Swan River, from whence it was first collected. The current name of this variety arose in 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia; thus the variety's current full name is Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum (Gand.) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele. Distribution and habitat B. sessilis var. cygnorum occurs along the coast of Western Australia from Dongara in the north, to south of Fremantle. It largely occurs near the coast, in sand over limestone; but it does occur further inland, at Kings Park and also around Lake Indoon. Cultivation Foliage with very early buds This variety is little known in cultivation. It is suggested that cultivation requirements would be similar to the better- known B. sessilis var. sessilis. Despite being a coastal plant, it has been reported as being frost-resistant down to -7 ¬∞C.

Military career and death Anderson joined the Royal Air Force in 1936 and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer. He was stationed with No. 600 Squadron RAF at RAF Manston in Kent flying Bristol Blenheims. On 10 May 1940, Anderson and his air gunner, Leading Aircraftman Herbert Hawkins, were assigned to a mission to bombard Waalhaven airfield near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The six Blenheims involved in the mission were ambushed whilst returning to base by twelve Bf-110s near Spijkenisse. Hawkins shot down one of the attacking aircraft, but the attack was too much for the Blenheims. Anderson and Hawkins' aircraft was chased by a single Bf-110, and one of the engines burst due to German fire above Hoogvliet. Forced to attempt a crash landing, Anderson crashed the plane into a field near Hoogvliet. Both Anderson and Hawkins were killed in the landing, Anderson being decapitated.

The case to find her abductor was covered heavily by the Louisville news media and stretched for the next twenty-five years until a person of interest was eventually identified. Background Gotlib, a Russian Jewish immigrant, came to the United States in 1980 and was fluent in both English and Russian. Disappearance Ann was last seen on June 1, 1983, between 5:30 and 6:00 PM. She was visiting Bashford Manor Mall, across the street from the apartment complex where she lived with her family. Her bike was later found outside the Bacon's Department Store at the mall. Investigation The FBI headed the investigation. Police followed up on thousands of leads and questioned between 30 and 40 suspects over the years. Three days after her disappearance, a police dog traced her scent to the apartment of Ester Okmyansky, the grandmother of the last person to see Gotlib alive. Okmyansky said Gotlib had never visited the apartment, and after a thorough investigation of her family, police concluded the dog had been in error. Others investigated included a sex offender who had been at the mall within an hour of Gotlib's disappearance and a serial sex offender who had supplied an alibi. An often repeated conspiracy theory held that Gotlib had been abducted by the Soviet government to force her parents to return to Russia. Both the FBI and the Gotlib family had dismissed this theory. Another theory was that she had left voluntarily after having trouble adapting to life in the United States. Investigators and her family dismissed this as well, saying she gave no indications of anxiety prior to the disappearance, and if she had run away voluntarily she likely would have taken some money or possessions, and made contact eventually. In 1990, Texas Death Row inmate Michael Lee Lockhart claimed to have killed Gotlib and buried her body at Fort Knox and eventually provided a map of the burial site, but after a thorough investigation police found no physical evidence to verify his claim. Up through 2008 the Louisville Metro Police Department still listed the disappearance as an open case. Nevertheless, it was considered a cold case due to the amount of time that had passed. The investigation documents fill four filing cabinets. 2008 developments On December 4, 2008, Louisville Metro Police announced a major break in the disappearance case of Ann Gotlib. A spokesperson for the LMPD, commenting on new developments in the case, suggested that it was the police's belief that convicted felon and former veterinarian Gregory Oakley Jr. ‚Äî who had been a suspect since the initial disappearance in 1983 ‚Äî had possibly been responsible for the young girl's disappearance. Oakley died in Alabama in 2002 after being released from the Kentucky State Reformatory in La Grange on a medical pardon, where he was serving time for burglary and rape. That case was similar to the Gotlib case by the fact the victim was a 13-year-old girl having red hair. Police believe that Oakley followed Gotlib to the Bashford Manor Mall parking lot, where he abducted her leaving nothing but her bike. According to a man who had once served time in a Kentucky prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s with Oakley, Oakley confessed to abducting Gotlib and killing her with an overdose of Talwin, a pain killer. Police had considered Oakley a suspect in the Gotlib case since January 1984, when Oakley was arrested and eventually convicted of raping a 13-year-old Louisville girl. Oakley failed a polygraph test concerning Gotlib, but police never had enough evidence to tie him to her disappearance. Impact Due to the startling way in which Gotlib had vanished in broad daylight without any trace, it was a key case that led the United States Congress to create the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 1984 to coordinate departments involved in missing-persons cases. The center credits the Gotlib case with increasing national awareness of missing and abducted children and revolutionizing how missing-child cases are handled. One new technique that came out of the investigation was the use of billboards and other tactics to generate widespread awareness of a missing person, which was considered futile according to conventional wisdom at the time.

He is best known for founding the publishing company Methuen & Co. Background and education Methuen was born as Algernon Methuen Marshall Stedman in London, the third son of John Buck Stedman, FRCS, and Jane Elizabeth n√©e Marshall. He was educated at Berkhamsted School and then Wadham College, Oxford, from which he graduated with an MA. Career After graduating from Oxford, Methuen entered teaching, and rose to become head of High Croft Preparatory School at Milford in Surrey from 1890 to 1895.Obituary of Sir Algernon Methuen. The Times, Monday, 22 September 1924; page 18. Issue 43763. While teaching he began, as a sideline, writing a number of school textbooks under the nom-de-plume A. W. S. Methuen, of which his series on French, Greek and Latin were best known. Among his works were books on gardening and current affairs. In June 1889, Methuen began to publish and market his own textbooks under the label Methuen & Co. (later Methuen Publishing Ltd.). Two months later he formally adopted Methuen as his surname. His first success at publishing came in 1892 with the publication of Rudyard Kipling's Barrack-Room Ballads. He later published works by Hilaire Belloc, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Oscar Wilde. Methuen was an outspoken critic of the Boer War. He stood for Parliament as the Liberal party candidate for the seat of Guildford in the General Election of January 1910. The seat was a safe Conservative seat and he was unsuccessful. In 1916, he was created a baronet, of Haslemere in Surrey, and he later published his own memoir.

Early life and education Harry Rosenberg was the son of a small shopkeeper in East Ham, UK. He left school at 16 and went into the Civil Service in a clerical post. He volunteered and served throughout the war in the RAF working with radio equipment, which he had studied in his spare time. On demobilization he was given a further education, a training grant, and studied at University College London (UCL). He graduated with a first class honours degree in physics from UCL, and then obtained a DPhil in 1953 from the University of Oxford under Kurt Mendelssohn. Career Six years later he became a university lecturer and in 1978 was appointed a Reader. He also became a fellow of the newly founded Linacre College, Oxford a graduate college, and subsequently, in 1970, a tutorial fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford. Harry Rosenberg's initial research was in the area of metals, but in 1962 new phenomena associated with magnetism and the interaction between magnetism and phonons (the quantized vibrations that store and transport heat in insulating as well as metallic solids) began to interest him. This occupied his attention for the next decade. Then, in 1972, he began the work on composite, disordered and amorphous materials that lasted until his retirement. On his 60th birthday, in 1982, Rosenberg was gloomily contemplating the need to find a new topic of research to last until his retirement, when a note from an old colleague, Ray Orbach in California, showed that his experimental results on the low temperature properties of amorphous solids found a natural explanation in terms of the newly discovered mathematical theory of fractals, by now of course familiar through the strange and beautiful pictures that they generate. This new approach to the interpretation of excitations in disordered solids was first expressed in the paper \\"Fractal interpretation of vibrational properties of cross-linked polymers, glasses and irradiated quartz,\\" Alexander, Laermans, Orbach, and Rosenberg, Phys Rev (1993) B28 4615-4619 which, according to Orbach, was a very controversial piece of work, greeted with considerable skepticism. Rosenberg was regarded as a gifted lecturer, not only to undergraduates and to colleagues at conferences, but also to a much wider audience, both on the radio and on television. Death He died on 21 November 1993, whilst on holiday in Brazil, survived by his wife Mildred Anna and three daughters. Honors He was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and received the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit.

The register is administered by the Heritage Council of NSW via Heritage NSW, a division of the Government of New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet. The register was created in 1999 and includes items protected by heritage schedules that relate to the State, and to regional and to local environmental plans. As a result, the register contains over 20,000 statutory-listed items in either public or private ownership of historical, cultural, and architectural value. Of those items listed, approximately 1,785 items are listed as significant items for the whole of New South Wales; with the remaining items of local or regional heritage value. The items include buildings, objects, monuments, Aboriginal places, gardens, bridges, landscapes, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, relics, bridges, streets, industrial structures and conservation precincts. Typically, an item will first attract local listing, then regional or State listing. If the item is of significance to the nation, the State will advocate for listing on the Australian National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List. Finally, if the item is of global significance, the Australian Government will advocate for the item to be listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Heritage Council The Heritage Council of New South Wales, a statutory body appointed by the NSW Government and comprising members of the community, the government, the conservation profession and representatives of organisations such as the National Trust of Australia, makes decisions about the care and protection of heritage places and items that have been identified as being significant to the people of NSW. The Council provides advice on heritage matters to the Minister for Heritage, presently Hon Donald Harwin MP. The Council recommends to the Minister places and objects for listing on the State Heritage Register. The work of the Council and the State Heritage Register is generally covered by the and its 2010 amendments. Under section 170 of the Act, government agencies in New South Wales are required to compile a register of heritage assets and look after their assets on behalf of the community. Other legislation preserves Aboriginal heritage. Criteria Items nominated for listing on the register are assessed against the State Heritage Register criteria to determine the level of significance. To be assessed for listing on the State Heritage Register an item will, in the opinion of the Heritage Council of NSW, meet one or more of the following criteria: :a) an item is important in the course, or pattern, of NSW‚Äôs cultural or natural history; :b) an item has strong or special association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in NSW‚Äôs cultural or natural history; :c) an item is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in NSW; :d) an item has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in NSW for social, cultural or spiritual reasons; :e) an item has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW‚Äôs cultural or natural history; :f) an item possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of NSW‚Äôs cultural or natural history; :g) an item is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of NSW‚Äôs: ::- cultural or natural places; or ::- cultural or natural environments. An item is not to be excluded from the Register on the ground that items with similar characteristics have already been listed on the Register.

Christian ska is a form of Christian alternative rock, and subgenre of ska and ska punk which is lyrically oriented toward contemporary Christian music (CCM) Though ska did not constitute a genre within the Christian music industry until after third wave ska had peaked in the general market, The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music defines (CCM) as \\"music that appeals to self-identified fans of contemporary Christian music on account of a perceived connection to what they regard as Christianity\\". Based on that definition, this list includes artists and bands who perform ska music and work in the Christian music industry as well as artists in the general market whose lyrics reflect their Christian faith or where either the artists themselves or outside sources identify members as performing Christian music.

W. Hornung. It was published in the UK by Chatto & Windus, London, and in the US by Scribner's, New York.Rowland, p. 280. The stories feature Hornung's popular character A. J. Raffles. It was the third book in the series, and the final collection of short stories. In it, Raffles, a gentleman thief, commits a number of burglaries in late Victorian England. A full-length Raffles novel, Mr. Justice Raffles, would follow in 1909. Overview Chronicler and accomplice Bunny Manders narrates additional adventures which he had previously omitted, from various points in their criminal careers. All but the last two stories take place while A. J. Raffles and Bunny Manders are still respectable gentlemen and Raffles is still an amateur cricketer who lives in rooms at the Albany. The two remaining stories take place after Raffles and Bunny become professional criminals of ruined reputations: the second last story follows after the events of \\"An Old Flame\\", and the final story takes place after the events of \\"The Knees of the Gods\\". All stories are largely self-contained and independent, with the exception of the last story, which serves as an epilogue to events explored in the first story. Each story was first published in serial format, except for \\"The Last Word\\" which is a short epilogue to the events of \\"Out of Paradise\\".

The Schuylkill Canal Association (SCA) is a non-governmental organization that maintains the Oakes Reach and Lock #60 of the Schuylkill Canal as a public recreation area and historical site. Organized in 1982 as the Schuylkill Canal Advisory Board, the Association, in cooperation with Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, maintains the canal reach, associated structures, parks and trails. The area extends along the canal and left bank of the Schuylkill River, from Mont Clare past Port Providence. The area makes up a large part of the Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section Historic District (#88000462). As its first priority project, SCA repaired the Lock 60 lock tender's house at Lock 60 that had been abandoned in the 1950s. The lock tender's house was eventually restored to habitable condition. The restoration of Lock 60 itself to operating condition was another major SCA project that was completed in 2005. The house and lock are both contributing structures to the historic district. SCA maintains the area near Lock 60 as a public park and periodically opens the lock tender's house and operates the lock for small recreational craft. The Canal Park has a river launch area and a floating dock in the canal. An association maintained portage trail at the other end of the canal reach, which with the park, creates a canoe and kayak loop. SCA also maintains the towpath trail and other adjacent trails. Plans to route the Schuylkill River Trail along the canal towpath will likely shift towpath maintenance from SCA to the county.  Canal Day  Restored Lock Tender's House open for Canal Day 2008 The SCA organizes the annual Canal Day each summer on the last Sunday in June. This summer fair features events centered around the canal, including: a canoe and kayak race, a run, opening of the lock, and the popular pugil stick joust on a telephone pole over the canal. The events take place at the Lock 60 Canal Park and adjacent St. Michael's recreation field in Mont Clare.

Description It grows as a shrub up to five metres high. Unlike other varieties of B. sessilis, it has hairless stems. The leaves are fan shaped, with a long, toothless lower margin, and a toothed end. As such its leaves are quite similar to some of those of B. sessilis var. cygnorum, but are larger, being up to four centimetres long and 3.5 centimetres wide. They also lack lobes at the base. As with other varieties of B. sessilis, the flowers are greenish-yellow. Each head contains around 90 flowers. Taxonomy This variety was first published by Alex George in 1996, based on a specimen he collected on 11 August 1993 on West Binnu Road, 4.4 kilometres east of Yeringa South Road, north-north-west of Northampton, Western Australia. The varietal epithet is from the Latin flabellum (\\"fan\\") and folium (\\"leaf\\"), and refers to the fan-shaped leaves characteristic of this variety. The name given at the time was Dryandra sessilis var. flabellifolia, and this stood until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia; thus the variety's current full name is Banksia sessilis var. flabellifolia (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele. In 1999, George placed it between B. sessilis var. sessilis and B. sessilis var. cordata in phyletic order. Distribution and habitat B. sessilis var. flabellifolia grows in both deep sand and on laterite, between Geraldton and Kalbarri inland to Northampton and south as far as Moora, in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia Cultivation This variety is little known in cultivation. It is suggested that cultivation requirements would be similar to the better- known B. sessilis var. sessilis, but that this variety would be better suited to hotter, drier coastal areas.

was an American composer and organist, born in England. A native of London, he came to the United States in 1886, and served for many years as a church organist on the West Coast. In 1898, he was awarded a doctorate degree in music from the University of the Pacific. In 1901, he gave a recital in Buffalo, New York and accepted a position at Trinity Church in Boston, but after two years he returned to San Francisco. In 1915, Stewart took a position as organist at the Panama- California Exposition in San Diego, and stayed in that city for many years, playing open-air organ concerts at Balboa Park.Pratt, Waldo Selden; George Grove; Charles Newell Boyd; John Alexander Fuller-Maitland. Grove's dictionary of music and musicians, Volume Six, 1920, p. 374. Stewart was a founding member of the American Guild of Organists, and was an honorary lifetime member of the Bohemian Club. In the pages of The American Organist, Stewart wrote in March 1919 about what he called the \\"Messiah Fallacy\\", a critical analysis uncomplimentary to Handel's Messiah. Stewart described how the music of the Messiah was completely incompatible to the sacred nature of the text, except for the Hallelujah chorus, of which he was non-committal, preferring Beethoven's Hallelujah. A flurry of letters to the editor resulted, some critical of Stewart, some supportive of his stance.The American Organist, Volume 2, March 1919 Works Among his works were an opera, two comic operas, three Grove Plays, incidental music for plays, some works for orchestra, choral music, and some songs and instrumental works; he also wrote church music. *1888 - The Nativity, oratorio (church) *1889 - Bluff King Hal, romantic opera *1890 - His Majesty, comic opera *1899 - I behold and lo! anthem *1900 - The Conspirators, comic opera *1903 - Montezuma, Grove Play *1906 - Scenes in California, orchestral suite *1906 - The Owl and Care, Grove Play, musical spectacle *1916 - Gold, Grove Play References * External links * 1856 births 1932 deaths American male classical composers American classical composers American opera composers Bohemian Club members Musicians from London American classical organists American male organists Balboa Park (San Diego) English emigrants to the United States University of the Pacific (United States) alumni ","title":"Humphrey John Stewart"},{"id":"18818509","text":"Johann Heinrich Beck (September 12, 1856 ‚Äì May 26, 1924) was an American composer and conductor.

In particular, he promotes the value of harmonic reduction, as it can make ‚ÄúPlaying by Memory and Playing at Sight easier to learn.‚Äù Since ‚Äúa piece of figurated music is always built on a plain harmonic structure, [the student will learn] that this harmonic structure is a concrete thing; that it may be taken hold of, as it were; may be played by itself, giving a good idea of the whole.‚Äù Thus, ‚Äúin playing from memory there is given to the player a greater assurance, if he knows that at a certain point he is to use such and such a chord, or go to such a key‚Äù (80-81). The basic method of harmonic reduction is that ‚Äúthe extreme notes of the florid phrase must be brought into proper vocal compass, after which the inner parts may be added, . . . although occasional breaks in the leading may be unavoidable in the compression of a very florid structure‚Äù (8, 83).

The 1949 final The final was played in front of a then-record crowd of 12,000. Interest was high as the local Wellingtonian team was a lower ranked team (in the second division of Wellington football) who had gained a reputation as giant-killers. They went on to win the final 1-0 after having beaten several higher ranked sides in the course of the tournament, including a narrow win over Waterside and a heavy 7-1 thrashing of Wellington Marist. The final is memorable for the magic of the giant-killing performance, which caught the imagination of the local population. The only goal of the match came in the second half, when Northern keeper Jim Stephenson parried a David McKissock shot directly into the path of Petone forward Wally Hewitt who duly scored.

The S&W; 645/745 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The S&W; 645 is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions, whereas the S&W; 745 has a stainless steel frame and a blued carbon steel slide. The S&W; 645 was introduced in 1985 and discontinued in 1988. The S&W; 745 was produced from 1986 to 1990, primarily as a single-action competition gun for IPSC shooting. History Smith & Wesson (S&W;) began experiments with .45 ACP-firing pistols in 1984, and produced their first one, the Model 645, in 1985. Public demand led to the development of this series. The series is a .45 ACP version of their 9mm Parabellum weapons. They are normally double-action weapons, or what Smith & Wesson refers to as a traditional double action. They generally have a barrel bushing press fitted into the muzzle end of the slide instead of a separate barrel bushing like a 1911 pistol. Like many Smith & Wesson models, each variant was generally in production for only a few years. The Model 645 was introduced in 1985, and produced until 1988. It has a stainless steel frame and slide, an ambidextrous safety/decocker, a squared trigger guard, and black plastic grip plates. The Model 745, built from 1986-1990, was a single-action target version of the Model 645, with a match barrel, Novak sight (an adjustable rear sight was optional), an adjustable trigger stop, stainless frame,walnut grip panels and blued slide. It does not have ambidextrous controls, but does have a half-cock safety. The pistol is rollmarked \\"IPSC 10th Anniversary 1976-1986\\". Smith & Wesson changed its numbering system with the introduction of its third generation iteration, where a four digit numeral replaced the earlier three digit numeral designators. One of the first in this series was the 4505; this is essentially the 645 with only the safety catch ambidextrous and a blued finish. A Novak Lo-Mount rear sight was installed on a small number of 4505s. It was produced only in 1991. The Smith & Wesson Model 4506, is made of satin finished stainless steel, a Novak Lo-Mount rear sight later in the series, and a Xenoy wrap-around grip with either a straight or arched backstrap. After 1998, the 4506 had a rounded trigger guard profile, which replaced the earlier squared profile inherited from the 645. The 4506 was produced from 1988-2001. The S&W; 645 was used in Miami Vice by the character Vice Detective Sonny Crockett in seasons 3 and 4 of the TV series.

CricketArchive has his date of birth as 8 December. was an English clergyman, distinguished Jungian analyst and a first- class cricketer who played for Cambridge University Cricket Club. Early life and cricket He was born in Agra in India, where his father, Colonel Geoffrey Anderton, was a doctor with the British Army. Through his mother, the former Edyth Cecile Hastings, he was descended from the family line of the Earls of Huntingdon. Shortly before World War Two began, the family returned to England. He went to Sherborne School, where he became Head Boy and excelled at sport. On the occasion of the school's four hundredth anniversary, he was the host for a lunch attended by King George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth. After National Service with the Green Jackets Brigade, he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1952, originally to read Medicine but eventually graduating in History and Economics. He played both rugby and cricket for the University, including three first-class cricket matches in 1953, but he did not win a cricket Blue. His highest score of 38 came when playing against Middlesex County Cricket Club. Career Priest After university, he was briefly a schoolmaster before he entered Westcott House to train to become an Anglican priest. After being ordained, he became a curate at St John's Wood Church, before moving to All Hallows by the Tower. This was the Guild Church of the Toc H movement, and he was with Tubby Clayton, its founder, when Clayton died. Psychologist He became the chairman of the Guild of Pastoral Psychology and, through his work with the Guild, was influenced in middle age to give up his career as a priest to become a psychotherapist. He trained at the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, before setting up his own psychotherapy practice in London, where ‚Äì according to his Daily Telegraph obituarist ‚Äì \\"his deep intellect and innate sensitivity allowed him to bring profound insights to bear\\". In 1987 he helped to set up the Guild of Analytical Psychology and Spirituality ‚Äì since renamed as the Guild of Analytical Psychologists ‚Äì which particularly focused on the religious and spiritual aspects of Carl Jung's work. Anderton's consulting room was notable for its clouds of smoke from his pipe. He gave up smoking in his seventies, but continued to work into his mid-eighties while in semi-retirement in Winchester. Personal life He had a life-long love of cricket, and it was after a Test at Lord's that he first met Robin Coulson, whom he married in 1977. They had a daughter. MCC made him an honorary life member in 2018, sixty years after his first having been elected to membership. He was a bon viveur and a large but gentle man who was inclined to be absent-minded and clumsy, leaving \\"a trail of broken armchairs and pranged cars\\". He enjoyed the company of his family and friends and the life of the Winchester Cathedral community. Anderton died on 28 April 2020, at the age of 88.

Notalgia paraesthetica is a common localized itch, affecting mainly the area between the shoulder blades (especially the T2‚ÄìT6 dermatomes) but occasionally with a more widespread distribution, involving the shoulders, back, and upper chest.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . The characteristic symptom is pruritus (itch or sensation that makes a person want to scratch) on the back, usually on the left hand side below the shoulder blade (mid to upper back). It is occasionally accompanied by pain, paresthesia (pins and needles), or hyperesthesia (unusual or pathologically increased sensitivity of the skin to sensory stimuli, such as pain, heat, cold, or touch), which results in a well circumscribed hyperpigmentation of a skin patch in the affected area. Causes The correlation of notalgia paraesthetica localization with corresponding degenerative changes in the spine suggest that spinal nerve impingement may be a contributing cause. According to Plete and Massey, \\"The posterior rami of spinal nerves arising in T2 through T6 are unique in that they pursue a right-angle course through the multifidus spinae muscle, and this particular circumstance may predispose them to harm from otherwise innocuous insults of a varied nature.\\" Patients may have other conditions that predispose them to peripheral neuropathies (nerve damage). The causes of this condition have not yet been completely defined. Patients are usually older persons. Diagnosis Treatment Therapy for notalgia paresthetica is directed at controlling symptoms, as no cure exists for the condition. Available treatments include local anesthetics, topical capsaicin, topical corticosteroids,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology Volume: 32 Issue: 2 Pages: 287‚Äì289 Part: Part Published: FEB 1995 ISSN hydroxyzine, oxcarbazepine, palmitoylethanolamide and gabapentin. Paravertebral nerve block and botulinum toxin injections may also be helpful. Some patients treated with low concentration topical capsaicin reported pain, burning, or tingling sensations with treatment, and symptoms returned within a month of ceasing treatment. Oxcarbazepine was reported to reduce the severity of symptoms in a few cases.JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY Volume: 45 Issue: 4 Pages: 630-632 Published: OCT 2001 ISSN One patient has been treated with \\"paravertebral nerve blocks, with bupivacaine and methylprednisolone acetate injected into the T3‚ÄìT4 and T5‚ÄìT6 intervertebral spaces\\" JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY Volume: 38 Issue: 1 Pages: 114-116 Published: JAN 1998 ISSN Hydroxyzine has also been used with considerable success in some cases as long as the pills are used daily. High concentration topical capsaicin (8%, Qutenza) have been shown to be highly effective in treating neuropathic itch in some patients (including notalgia paresthetica) as well as in a recent proof-of-concept study, but this remains to be confirmed in randomised controlled trials. Most recently intradermal injections of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) have been tried with some success. Even though botulinum normally wears off in three to six months, the treatment appears to be long term, and it has been theorised that botulinum type A effects lasting change in pain signaling.NEUROTOXICOLOGY Volume: 26 Issue: 5 Special Issue: Sp.
