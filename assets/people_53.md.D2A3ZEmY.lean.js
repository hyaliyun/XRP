The book tells about the plants, animals and habitats of the Grand Canyon, both now and in the past, using the premise of a hiking trip there. The inspiration for the book was a trip in high school; Chin had originally conceived of a Grand Canyon origin story. The book marked the first time Chin used die cuts, in addition to his normal use of pen and ink, watercolors, and gouache. The book was awarded a 2018 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations and a 2018 Sibert Honor for its informative text. Grand Canyon is one of only a few non-fiction books that are not biographies to be recognized by the Caldecott.  Synopsis  Grand Canyon's illustrations use the conceit of a day trip between an Asian American father and his daughter, while the text gives information about the different plants, animals, and habitats found in the Grand Canyon. While some pages are in the present day, others take the reader into the past. The book is told in the second person and ends with backmatter where Chin provides additional scientific information and an author's note, which he uses to describe his process of creating the book. Hiking map of the Grand Canyon  Background and publication  Chin had always considered the Grand Canyon as a topic for a book after a formative trip he took there in high school. His original concept was for an \\"origin story\\" of the Canyon based on his high school knowledge of it being six million years old. After pitching the book to his publisher, Chin purchased Carving Grand Canyon by Wayne Ranney. Reading Ranney's book, Chin discovered that scientists had become more uncertain about when the Grand Canyon was formed, and that it could be up to ten times older than he learned when in high school. This presented the biggest challenge of the book as he needed a new story arc to serve as the book's hook. His breakthrough for a new premise came when walking in the forest with his own child; he realized he wanted to tell the story through a father-daughter trip, saying: \\"Once I had these two characters that resonated with me it was much easier to create the story around them.\\" In his research, Chin found that there were three distinct topics ‚Äì geology, ecology, and paleontology ‚Äì that would each need to be explored in order to tell the \\"biography\\" of the place. This presented challenges for Chin, as there was more information than could be included in the pages he had available to the topic. The writing and illustrations are closely connected; Chin finds a change in one of them frequently leads to a change in the other. The book was published on February 21, 2017, by Roaring Book Press.  Writing and illustrations  An image from the Grand Canyon's hermit trail, one of the trails used as an inspiration for the book. Some critics labeled the book as like a tour guide, with it including a two-page map at the start. Chin tried to remain true to his experience visiting the Canyon and to a plausible recreation of the past, except in two illustrations. However, some elements, such as the lighting and colors of prehistoric plants and animals, were imagined by Chin for the book. As a result, critics saw the illustrations as helping to effectively convey the information about the Grand Canyon. The borders of each page have plants and animals serving as the frame. Several reviewers also praised the effect of the gatefold pages for creating an inspiring panoramic display of the Grand Canyon. Chin used die cuts for the first time, along with his typical mix of pen and ink, watercolors, and gouache. He uses watercolors and gouache because they're practical, with gauche being a little more forgiving while watercolors require planning to move from sketch to the final illustrations. Betsey Bird of Horn Book praised Chin's use of die cuts for the way that he uses them to connect the present and the past. John Peters for School Library Journal also commented on Chin's ability to \\"transport\\" the reader through the design of the book, including the gatefold and the book's cut-outs that serve as a link through pages between the past and present. Because of the book's premise changing between times, consecutive pages can show different habitats, such as going from desert to the aquatic.  Reception and awards  The book was well received. Starred reviews from Booklist, where reviewer Anita Locke wrote of its \\"brilliant artwork\\", Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, Horn Book, and School Library Journal, all praised the book's illustrations. In its starred review, Publisher's Weekly described it as \\"a stunningly illustrated story of a magical father-daughter hike\\". Danielle Ford in Booklist's starred review gave particular praise to the informational text, writing how Chin was able to bring the past \\"to life through scientific imagination.\\" Kirkus Reviews was less complementary than others, positively reviewing the book's illustrations but comparing it unfavorably to other works of Chin's, saying it has a \\"relatively dry factual approach\\". The book received a 2018 Sibert Honor, with committee praising the illustrations in its citation, \\"Through magnificent panoramic illustrations, meticulously researched diagrams and lucid text, Jason Chin has created a book as grand as the canyon itself.\\" It was also awarded a 2018 Caldecott Honor, with the committee praising how \\"Chin uses watercolor, gouache and pen and ink to render sweeping landscapes, culminating in an epic gatefold panorama.\\" The book was unusual in receiving Caldecott recognition. Few nonfiction books besides biographies, and especially few science books, have been honored in the past.

The 1934 Japan Tour was a 12-city barnstorming baseball tour of Japan that took place in November and December 1934. It featured American League baseball players that formed a special team called the All Americans. The baseball stars were both tourists and ambassadors of good will. This was not the first baseball tour of the country (there were tours in 1908, 1913, 1920, 1922 and 1931), but the Americans in those tours had played Japanese amateur or college ballclubs. Details The tour included Earl Averill, Lou Gehrig, Charlie Gehringer, Lefty Gomez, Connie Mack, Jimmie Foxx, Babe Ruth, Moe Berg and other American League players, as the National League would not allow their players to participate. Ruth, ‚Äústill the most popular and famous athlete of his day‚Äù was the face of American baseball at the time. Empress of Japan\\", October 1934, before steaming to Japan. 500,000 Japanese filled the streets of Tokyo to welcome Ruth and 14 other all-star baseball players for the barnstorming tour. The Americans played 18 games against the All-Nippon team, featuring many of Japan‚Äôs top players, in front of tens of thousands of fans. The games were played in Meiji-Jingu Stadium in Tokyo, Koshien Stadium in Kobe, Yagiyama Baseball Field in Sendai and others throughout the country. The Americans won all eighteen games. Ruth would hit 13 home runs during the tour. Staying in the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, there was a knock on the door of Babe Ruth‚Äôs hotel room one night. The Babe answered to find a gentleman wearing a kimono, asking for Ruth‚Äôs autograph on a baseball. Ruth happily obliged; the man then proceeded to pull out another dozen or so balls from his kimono for Ruth to sign. Ruth‚Äôs wife and daughter witnessed the event. His daughter also recalled how popular Ruth was during the tour: fans would rise to their feet every time he came to bat and waved Japanese and American flags. After the Japanese games, the team played games in Shanghai and Manila. Most players then went home while Ruth and his family continued westward for four months. The Japanese portion of the tour was filmed by Jimmie Foxx and his wife using eight millimeter black-and- white film. A copy of the film has been digitized by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Moe Berg also brought a 16-mm Bell and Howell movie camera and made short films of important Japanese installations; this was thought to be one of Berg‚Äôs first missions as a spy. Many of the players were shadowed while on the street in Tokyo while their luggage was being searched back at their hotel. Legacy The tour was quite popular. The team of Japanese all-stars were kept together after the 1934 barnstorming tour and formed Japan‚Äôs first professional baseball team in December 1934, called Great Tokyo baseball club. The All-Star Japanese team was led by Matsutara Shoriki and was encouraged to continue with baseball in Japan. This team traveled to the United States in 1935, playing against amateur, college and Minor League teams. The team was later called Yomiuri Tokyo Giants, which still existed as of 2018. The 1934 tour was ‚Äúa big factor in making professional baseball possible in Japan‚Äù and helped cement the Babe‚Äôs popularity in Japan. The tour was covered in a book published in 2012. Items from the tour, including posters, jerseys and caps are held both in the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and in Cooperstown. A cap Ruth wore during the tour sold for over $300,000 in 2014.

He contributed mainly to the emerging disciplines of technology management and innovation study. Tschirky's activities in research and industry span throughout Europe, Japan and the United States. Life Hugo Tschirky was born in St. Gallen, Switzerland. He graduated as a mechanical engineer with a specialization in process, control and nuclear engineering, and received his Ph.D. in nuclear reactor technology from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, in 1968. He acquired a second Ph.D. in business administration in 1978. From 1968 to 1971, Tschirky worked as an engineer at the General Atomics Research Lab in San Diego on questions regarding the safety of fast breeder reactors. After that, he spent eleven years in CEO positions at the Swiss subsidiary of the optics company Carl Zeiss AG (1971 to 1975) and at Cerberus AG (1975 to 1982), the renowned Swiss manufacturer of ionization smoke detectors. In 1982, Tschirky was appointed professor of Science of Management at the Department of Management, Technology and Economics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich. From 1999, he also co-chaired the BWI Center for Industrial Management (at the time, the Center for Enterprise Sciences), where he was responsible for the postgraduate study program. In 1992 and 2000, Tschirky spent sabbaticals teaching and working at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Parallel to his teaching and research activities, Tschirky has acted as expert council in a number of affairs of national and international significance. Among them were the creation of the Swiss Paul Scherrer Institute, and the legal dispute between Iran and the French company Eurodif that centered around Iran's $1 billion loan for the construction of a uranium enrichment plant in Pierrelatte. After the collapse of the Schah's government, Iran had withdrawn from the nuclear cooperation program with Western countries, and sued Eurodif for reimbursement of its 10 % share in the company. Ongoing from 1979, the matter was finally resolved in 1991. In 2005, Tschirky became a member of the ¬´International Visiting Committee¬ª at the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering. Chaired by Lord Alec Broers, the committee's 14 representatives from universities and industry had been appointed to advise the department in strategy matters. Tschirky has maintained close ties to the business world by serving as a board member of various companies, among them Canon Switzerland, Jelmoli, Novartis Research Foundation, BB-Industrie, Dr√§ger Safety Schweiz AG, Unilever Schweiz AG, Bavaria Auto AG, Business Results AG, new medical technologies AG, ATV Advanced Technology Ventures AG, Connex Verkehr AG, Helbling Management Consulting AG, SONAC Inc (Japan), Global Advanced Technology Innovation Consortium (GATIC) (founder, 2002), and GATIC Japan KK. His current (2018) mandates are LogObject AG, Swiss 3D Tec AG, Swiss Blue Energy AG}}, and MSI Dr. W√§lti AG. Tschirky has served in the Swiss Armed Forces as a mountain infantry militia officer, completing his service as colonel. As long-time head of the Geb AK3 mountain army corps' train troop, he was involved in the ‚ÄúArmee 95‚Äù reorganization, advocating for preservation of the horse train. From 1982, Tschirky was a member of the Swiss Federal Armament Commission, and acted as the commission's president from 1999 until 2004. Work Tschirky has contributed to management theory with a focus on the management of technological change and innovation. Motivated by a perceived lack of recognition for technology issues in other approaches of general management, he developed the concept of integrated technology management and extended it to 'enterprise science', proposing that the management of technology-intensive companies must be informed by all relevant sciences, and particularly by technology awareness. Tschirky has also worked on the related topics of technology forecasting, technology acquisition and technology marketing, and he authored and edited studies on technology management practices in Japanese companies. Tschirky has also worked on 'structured creativity', which proposes theoretical foundations and an applicable code of practice for efficient innovation management in innovation- driven enterprises. Tschirky's works have been published in German, English, Japanese and Russian language. Through his long-standing research and teaching activities at several Japanese universities (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ritsumeikan University, National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and Tohoku University) as well as his counseling and boardroom work for Japanese companies, Tschirky is known and respected in Japan. Between 2007 and 2012, he acted as council of the president of the United Nations University in Tokyo. During his years at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Tschirky has advised many young scientists on their doctoral and postdoctoral work. He was the main initiator of EITIM, the European Institute for Technology and Innovation Management, a network of technical universities across Europe. EITIM was founded in 2000 and aimed to improve European innovation capacity through joint research and publication projects, jointly supervised dissertations, executive seminars and conferences. Since becoming professor emeritus in 2003, Tschirky has continued teaching. He has taught Executive Management programs at the ETH Z√ºrich and at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and he gave regular lectures at the Jo≈æef Stefan International Postgraduate School in Slovenia until 2011.

The winning firm or consortium will be granted certificate of public convenience and necessity and six radio frequency bands by the Philippine government which would help establish a third major player in the Philippine telecommunications industry. The Mislatel consortium led by Udenna Corporation and China Telecom was named the provisional winner of the bid on November 7, 2018. Background The Philippines' telecommunication industry is dominated by the duopoly of PLDT, Inc.‚ÄìSmart Communications and Globe Telecom. The situation has been cited by critics of the duopoly as the reason for the country's poor internet infrastructure and the country has consistently ranked at the bottom-tier among countries in terms of internet speed. In 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte has urged the two established telecommunications to improve their services and said that he would allow the entry of new competitors if they refused to comply. In his third State of the Nation Address in 2018, Duterte has directed the DICT and the NTC to name the third telecommunications provider before the end of that year saying that the firm should selection process should be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. A report by Open Signal, a wireless coverage mapping firm, released in November 2017, conducted a study on Long-term Evolution (LTE) technology in 77 countries where the Philippines ranked 69th in LTE availability and 74th in LTE speeds. Majority of the radio frequency spectrum in the Philippines has already been assigned to either PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom by the National Telecommunications Commission leaving only less than a third of frequency spectrum available to a potential major telecommunications provider although the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has said that the prospective telco provider can still operate in the country and noted that as of October 2018 that there is a pending bill in the Congress which seeks to redistribute unused spectrum frequencies by PLDT and Globe to other companies. President Duterte has invited Chinese firms to enter the bid a move which has been described as a \\"political decision\\" by then Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. Format Third Stakeholders Consultation on the third telecommunications provider bidding. July 6, 2018. The bidding for the third major telecommunications provider in the Philippines was overseen by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and an oversight committee. The highest committed level of service (HCLoS) selection model was adopted for the bidding with three selection criteria: national population coverage, minimum average broadband speed and capital and operational expenditures. The selection model was selected after a vote by 15 telecommunication companies in an impromptu survey during the third stakeholders consultation organized by the DICT on July 6, 2018. All but 2 companies favored the HCLoS model over the more traditional auction model. The final terms of reference was published by the DICT through Memorandum Circular 09-09-2018 on September 21, 2018 allowing interested firms to acquire bidding documents at each from the NTC starting October 6, 2018 with the deadline of submitting documents set on November 5, 2018 and by the same day participating firms as well as the \\"provisional new major player\\" would already be announced. A selection committee was to process the bidding documents of the provisional new major players and if the bid was ascertained to be valid, the company will be declared as the third telecommunications player. The winning company will have to submit prerequisite documents for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity within 90 days from the issuance of the confirmation order. =Selection criteria= The three selection criteria and their weight for the HCLoS selection process are: *Minimum average broadband speed (25%) ‚Äì internet speeds of at least 5 megabits per second (Mbps) must be provided by the winning company or consortium. One point was to be awarded per year for every 2 Mbps extra committed by the bidding company up to a minimum average speed of 55 Mbps at most. *National population coverage (40%) ‚Äì The winning company or consortium must be able provide service to 50 percent of the national population by the end of the fifth year after it won the third telecommunications provider slot or a 10 percent of annual increase in national population coverage for five years. At the maximum, the winner should cover 50% during the first year up to 90% by the fifth year. *Annual capital and operational expenditure (35%) ‚Äì At least or a maximum of must be invested by the winning company or consortium in the first year and for the succeeding four years; for a total of after five years. The bidding parties' offered commitments were judged based on the three selection criteria over a five-year commitment period which was used as a basis of their rankings =Bidder eligibility= Bidding companies must fulfill the following four eligibility requirements: *Minimum paid-in capital of *At least 10 years of experience in delivering telecommunications services on a nationwide scale *No relationship to the dominant telecommunication service providers (PLDT-Smart and Globe Telecom) and no outstanding liabilities with regulators *Bidders can be a single domestic firm or a consortium holding a congressional franchise to install, operate, and maintain telecommunications networks and services As per the terms of reference of the bid, the winning bidder are discouraged to have plans of merger or enter into a joint agreement with the existing two dominant players PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom. If they do so they are required to return awarded frequencies back to the NTC.

Foreign companies are allowed to submit bids by themselves but must partner with a local company once it commence operations in the country. Participating companies and consortium are also subjected to fees to ensure their financial capability to compete with the existing telecommunication players. * ‚Äì participation security * ‚Äì performance security * ‚Äì non-refundable appeal fee One of the companies which expressed interest to participate in the bid, NOW Telecom filed a petition before the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 24 against the NTC which seeks for an issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. since bidders are required to put up a participation security, performance security, and a non-refundable appeal fee. The court rejected the petition to nullify the financial provisions and found such as reasonable saying that these needed to ensure that the third major provider will have financial capability to compete against Globe and PLDT. =Bidding stakes= The winning bidder will be awarded: *A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) which has a validity of either 15 years or the length of the winning bidder's existing franchise, whichever is shorter *Six radio frequency bandwidth ‚Äì 700 megahertz (MHz), 2100 MHz, 2000 MHz, 2.5 gigahertz (GHz), 3.3 GHz, and 3.5 GHz. Bids=Uninterested firms= The following are companies which has expressed non-interest in participating in the bid. *Telstra ‚Äì Telstra initially planned to form a consortium with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) in 2016 but negotiations broke down and SMC sold its telecommunications asset to Globe and PLDT. In 2018, Telstra said that it has no interest to enter the mobile telecommunications market in the Philippines, consequentially the bid though it considers the Philippines an \\"important market\\" and maintains a customer service hub in the country. =Expressed interest= The following has expressed interest in participating in the bid but decided not to submit their bids for various reasons. *AMA Telecommunications ‚Äì Amatelco, a subsidiary of the AMA Education System backed by Middle-Eastern firms bought bidding documents on October 31, 2018 from the NTC. The firm is a holder of a 25-year congressional franchise on telecommunications which was granted in July 2016. *Converge ICT / Korea Telecom ‚Äì Converge initially expressed interest to participate in the bid but withdrew such plans on November 7, 2018 due to what it alleges an absence of a level playing field. It criticized the selection process of requiring bidders to commit certain minimum internet speed, coverage, and capital noting that existing players Globe and PLDT were not subjected to such requirements and questioned the involvement of a Chinese state-owned company speculating that the requirements may be ignored if their bid does not fulfill the given bid criteria. It planned to form a consortium with South Korean firm Korea Telecom which claims in 2018 to have been the first telecom provider to introduce 5G broad-scale trial service. *Mobitel ‚Äì a company owned by the A1 Telekom Austria Group. *Now Corporation ‚Äì NOW Corp expressed interest to participate but found the financial requirements of the bid as a \\"money making scheme\\" due to the bidding's monetary requirements.

In April 2018, the Villar Group announced plans to diversify and was considering investing in various industries such as the gaming and telecommunications industries. They decided not to pursue a bid after internal discussions of the management. *Telenor ‚Äì the Norway-based company, which already maintains presence in Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand, planned to participate in the bid with a local company. It announced in late-September that it was holding talks with potential local partners. It has touted its 4G and 5G technology services as its biggest advantage over other potential bidders. Telenor did not submit a bid. =Submitted bids= There were three submitted bids: *Mislatel ‚Äì A consortium of a franchise holder, Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. which consists of its locally based companies, Udenna Corporation and its subsidiary, Chelsea Logistics, and Chinese state-owned firm China Telecommunications Corporation, a parent company of China Telecom. Udenna at the time of the bidding was not a player in the telecommunications industry and Mislatel already has a franchise granted in 1998 although it has been dormant in the telecommunications industry. *Sear Telecom (TierOne and LCS Inc.) ‚Äì A consortium of LCS Holdings of politician Chavit Singson and TierOne Communications International backed by Chinese firm Fujian Torch Electron Technology, Singaporean company Miller Pte. Ltd., and Cambodia-based Southeast Asia Telecom. LCS Group of Companies through Gracia Telecoms and TierOne already doing business in Mindanao. They entered the bidding to augment their expansion plans. The consortium touts itself as the only bidder planning to use Satellite Internet access by deploying portable Wi-Fi hotspots connected via satellite. In an event they fail to win the bid, they still plan to become a major telecommunications provider in the country. *Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (PT&T;) ‚Äì A broadband service provider in Luzon which provides its services through a pure fiber cable network. In November 2017, the company has announced that it entered with negotiations with China Telecom and Datang Telecom Technology regarding plans to form a consortium for its bid. It was a major competitor of PLDT in the 1990s prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is the internet service provider of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Result The Mislatel consortium led by Udenna Corporation and China Telecom was named the \\"provisional new major player\\" on November 7, 2018. The other two submitted bids by the SEARS Telecom consortium and PT&T; were disqualified after the NTC alleged that they have submitted incomplete bidding documents. Both losing parties plans to file an appeal to the NTC. The NTC said that PT&T; failed to meet technical requirements it has set for bidders. The Sear Telecom consortium questioned the eligibility of the Mislatel consortium saying that it breached an alleged existing and exclusive binding agreement between the Mislatel franchise and Tier1. The Mislatel consortium insists its bid was valid said that the agreement meant for \\"small projects\\" was already terminated and the said agreement did not made any reference to the third telecommunications provider bid. This is refuted by Digiphil, as demonstrated by the documents between the two, and an Enforcement of Contract proceeding is underway in the Pasig Court. Mislatel was granted permission to operate in July 2019 and was renamed as Dito Telcommunity.

It was established by Ernest Young together with his father Henry and brothers Arthur, and Horace. It was one of Bundaberg's earliest independent sugar plantations and had one of its earliest sugar mills.  History  The origin of Bundaberg's sugar industry dates back more than 100 years to the introduction of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864. Faced with the high cost of importing sugar from overseas, the Queensland Government wanted to find a way to encourage people to invest in sugarcane growing. The Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864, was introduced into the Queensland Legislative Assembly by Charles Coxen, member for the Northern Downs. The proposed regulations of the Act permitted persons or companies to select land suitable for sugar in lots ranging from half a square mile to two square miles. The introduction of the Act brought about a renewed interest in sugar cane growing and people raced to accumulate land up and down the coast of Queensland. The Brown brothers, Alfred and Arthur, were one of many who acquired land under the Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864. In the early 1870s, the brothers acquired 13 square kilometres of land and developed the cattle property, Tantitha. Working under the Act the brothers divided up a central section of their property into three blocks, called Jamaica, Barbados and Mauritius and experimented with the growing of sugarcane. These subdivided sections later became known as Fairymead, after a friend of the family visited the plantation and described the place as being like a \\"fairy mead\\" on a misty morning. The Brown's abandoned their venture into sugar after the floods of 1875, which saw the land swamped and the cane trampled by cattle. They sold the 5 square miles of land devoted to sugarcane to the Young family in 1878. Arthur and Horace Young, with their younger brother Ernest, began to transform Fairymead into a profitable state-of-the-art sugar plantation. Like many others who had heard of the potentially profitable sugar industry in Queensland's north, Arthur, Horace and Ernest had no knowledge of the sugar industry except their father's theoretical experience. They had formerly held two sheep stations in New Zealand, but when rabbits devastated these stations in 1878, the brothers began an eight-month search for another suitable investment. Their original intent was to investigate the pastoral possibilities in Australia but they were immediately won over by the possibility of a profitable sugar industry in Queensland. Cutting of the sugar cane at Fairymead, circa 1896 Arthur and Horace began operations at Fairymead in 1880, while Ernest went to England to acquire some necessary equipment for the plantation. By 1883 the rougher pioneering work was done and the first major crop harvested. For the first two years, the Young's punted the juice from their crops to Millaquin plantation and sugar refinery. In 1884 they installed a clarification unit and boiling plant, which enabled them to refine their own sugar as well as the sugar crops of smaller plantations in the Bundaberg region. By the end of 1884 cane from the Fairymead plantation, processed by their own mill, was producing of sugar daily. The Young brothers were also responsible for the introduction of a number of innovative cane harvesting and crushing techniques, many of which are still in use today. In setting up Fairymead Mill the Young brothers chose to install rollers imported from Glasgow to crush the cane instead of the standard rollers. They installed a Relieux furnace to improve processing efficiency of the raw juice and in , they initiated the use of Fowler's tramway system to bring cane to the mill, introducing the now universal system of cane railways to the Bundaberg district. In 1902 the Young brothers established an irrigation system to help combat the effects of long periods of drought in the region and began working towards the mechanisation of the cane harvesting industry. In 1938 the Young Brothers took their first step towards the mechanisation of cane harvesting by financing the development of a new single-row cane-cutting machine. This machine was a significant advance in cane-cutting technology, capable of cutting over per day in straight cane. This investment paid off during the labour shortages of World War II. The rest of the district also benefited from Fairymead's reduced demand for cane cutters, who were made more available to service other sugar plantations in the region. Their second step was the development of the successful two-row cane-cutting machine. This machine was a post-war development thanks to the mechanical skills of Jim Vichie and the encouragement of Charles Young (son of Ernest and Margaret Young). In 1972 Fairymead Sugar Company merged with Gibson and Howes Pty Limited to form the Bundaberg Sugar Company Limited. Milliquin Sugar Company Pty Limited became part of the group in 1975. In the 121 years since the first primitive sugar juice mill crushed the area's first successful cane crop, Fairymead and the sugar industry has played a major role in the development and prosperity of Bundaberg and surrounding district. Fairymead Sugar Plantation was one of Australia's largest cane farms. Fairymead Sugar Mill closed in 2005, due to the milk sinking into the ground from the swap like soil from the previous flood. Most of the buildings were taken down as safety hazards but some of the old mill still remains. The middle of the mill is now used as a loco shed to house trains used for collecting cane Around the old mill, to be bought up to the Bingara mill which still runs today. Fairymead House Fairymead House, circa 1894 Fairymead House, a grand plantation home, was built in 1890 on land adjacent to the plantation. It was the principal residence of Ernest and Margaret Young and other members of the Young family for over 60 years. It is a good example of the grandeur of plantation accommodation in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1988 the Bundaberg Sugar Company Ltd gave Fairymead House to the City of Bundaberg as a building of \\"significant historical importance to the district\\" and as the Company's Bicentennial gift to the City. The Bundaberg City Council agreed to provide a site for the home and Fairymead was relocated to the City's Botanic Gardens on the corner of Young Street and Mt Perry Road. The house was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2002.

Much of her work uses these structures as metaphor. B. David Zarley, Chicago Contributor at New American Paintings wrote of her subjects, \\"they are impossible; affronts to reality and the realities of the physical world, they are the inevitable avatars of a vicious cycle of horror and pulchritude, one which has spun as long as civilization, powered by wind, sinew, and steam but with the desires of humanity always the engine.\\" Biography and career McGinnis grew up on a farm in central Illinois where her Irish-American ancestors have owned farms since the later half of the 19th century. Her mother's ancestors immigrated from Norway and Denmark in the later half of the 19th century. In Norway the family built luxury yachts for the British market. This ended when the steel hulled ships became more desirable.

He enjoyed a joke where he often greeted new guests by yelling to his wife, \\"Sally, have some more wolf steaks put on!\\" A story has been told that when he answered an attractive young female visitor's question, \\"And have I really eaten wolf steak?\\" in the affirmative, she replied, \\"Then I suppose I am a wolverine.\\" The assembled male guests, wishing to endear themselves to her, declared they were wolverines, too, and \\"wolverine\\" became a nickname adopted by the various pioneers who passed through the tavern; area legend asserts this is the origin of the nickname for the state. Ten Eyck built the tavern in 1826, and it burned down in 1869, as did its adjoining stables in 1906. Bricks from the tavern were later incorporated into a fireplace in Henry Ford's Fair Lane estate. = Political career = Ten Eyck served as treasurer of Wayne County from 1817 to 1825, and as the supervisor of Pekin Township‚Äînow known as Redford Township‚Äîin 1830 and 1831. His house was the site of the meeting to organize Dearborn Township after it was created on March 9, 1833, and was the township supervisor from 1833 through 1837. He also served as a U.S. marshal from 1837 to 1841. He was elected to the Michigan Senate and served in its first two terms, from 1835 through 1837. He later served one term in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1846. He was a Democrat. Ten Eyck was fervently anti-British, and as sheriff of Wayne County in 1838, he assisted a group of Canadians rebelling against British rule, by loudly announcing in front of rebel sympathizers that there was an unguarded collection of muskets in the basement of the jail, which they promptly raided that evening. He died on August 23, 1847, in Dearborn, and is buried in Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit. = Family = Ten Eyck married Sarah Kramer and they had seven children: William, Charles B., Catherine, Mrs. Jane Fisher, Mrs. Maria Schloss, Mrs. Sarah Tompkins, and Mrs. Helen Roberts.

Sam Lek was appointed to the office by King Binnya U of Hanthawaddy after he had recaptured Donwun, the ancestral home of the dynasty, for the king. Sam Lek proved a key loyal vassal until U's death in 1384. He refused to submit to U's eldest son and successor Razadarit, who had raised a rebellion against U in 1383‚Äì1384. Sam Lek remained defiant until he died in action in 1388. Early life and career=Background= Sam Lek was born Me Sam (, )This is a Mon name. ·Äô·Äû·Ä∂ is typically transliterated as Ma Than using modern Burmese pronunciation. to an aristocratic family in the Martaban Kingdom. He may have been a prince,(Shorto 2002: 578) calls him a prince but the Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005) does not mention Sam Lek being of royal background. and had at least one elder brother, Gov. Smin Zeik-Bye of Dala.(Pan Hla 2005: 60‚Äì61): This Smin Zeik-Bye was not the minister Zeik-Bye who served at the Pegu court from the 1370s until 1415. Sam Lek's brother Smin Zeik-Bye of Dala died in 1370. By 1370, he was a senior officer in the army of King Binnya U.Pan Hla 2005: 59, 61 =Military service= In 1370, the king, who had been fighting a two-front war against rebellions led by Byattaba of Martaban (modern southern Mon State), and Laukpya of Myaungmya (modern Ayeyarwady Region) since 1364, appointed him governor-general of Taikkala (about 10 km south of modern Kyaikto), with the title of Smin Sam Lek. Upon the appointment, Sam Lek took command of the king's southernmost garrison at Zoklari (near modern Taungzun village, west of Bilin), about 10 km south of Taikkala, and about 20 km northwest of Donwun, the northernmost rebel-held town. His assignment was to recover Donwun. Winning back Donwun had a great symbolic significance to Binnya U. The small town was not only the ancestral home of the dynasty but also served as U's wartime capital from 1364 to 1369 when the king was driven out by Byattaba's forces.Pan Hla 2005: 57 The king was particularly angry at how the rebel forces broke the social norm of the day. About 700 rebel troops entered the town disguised as mourners of Chief Minister Pun-So, who had just died. They had shaven their heads in the tradition of Mon people, and the town's guards let them in. The rebel forces then attacked the palace, and the king barely escaped. Sam Lek's opportunity came soon after his appointment. In late 1370 or early 1371, a son of Byattaba, the rebel leader, died in Martaban. Upon hearing that Donwun was also observing the mourning period, Sam Lek decided to try the same tactic. He and 300 men in their shaven heads marched to Donwun, and waited outside the town's main gate. The next morning, the town's guardsmen let them in. Sam Lek's men seized the governor's residence, killed the governor Nai Swe Ban, and took the town. The king was overjoyed. He gave Donwun to Sam Lek as a fiefdom,Shorto 2002: 578 and awarded him the royal regalia befitting a viceroy.The title of the office as described in the chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 61) was min (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏), which in its generic form means lord but can be translated as king, viceroy or prince, depending on the situation. Viceroy-general of Donwun=Loyal vassal of Binnya U= Sam Lek proved an able and loyal vassal. In the following years, he kept the northern Martaban province in Binnya U's realm, while Byattaba continued to rule the southern province. His job was made easier by the truce reached between the king and the two rebel brothers‚ÄîByattaba and Laukpya‚Äîsoon after the battle of Donwun. The rebel brothers agreed to acknowledge U as their overlord in exchange for U's recognition of their de facto independent rule.Pan Hla 2005: 62‚Äì63 Sam Lek proved a rare loyal vassal even when U gradually withdrew from governing the kingdom due to deteriorating health in later years. When U's eldest son Binnya Nwe revolted in 1383, Sam Lek remained firmly in the ailing king's camp. He refused to submit when Nwe, 16, ascended the throne with the title of Razadarit in 1384.Pan Hla 2005: 165 =In rebellion= Sam Lek's insurrection was one of the three main rebellions against Razadarit; the other two were by Byattaba and Laukpya. But the viceroys did not form a united front against the new king. Razadarit, who controlled only the Pegu province (modern Yangon Region and southern Bago Region), could not take any action, as he was trying to survive invasions by the northern Ava Kingdom in 1385‚Äì1387.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 195‚àí197Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 198‚àí199 For his part, Sam Lek did not consider himself a rebel.Pan Hla 2005: 171 To him, Razadarit, who was not the chosen heir of Binnya U, was the true rebel and not a rightful successor. Even when Razadarit, facing an imminent invasion, in desperation asked Sam Lek to send troops in 1385, Sam Lek could not bear to send help. On the other hand, unlike Laukpya who invited Ava to invade the country, Sam Lek never aided Ava, nor did he join forces with Laukpya or Byattaba. Fall from power and death Ultimately, Sam Lek's policy of neutrality left him isolated. When Ava did not invade in the dry season of 1387‚Äì1388, the first place Razadarit and the Pegu court looked to deploy their already mobilized forces was the northern Martaban province. Razadarit sent an ultimatum to Sam Lek to submit. Unfazed, Sam Lek replied that he was not a rebel, and that he would submit if Razadarit's forces could overcome other rebels en route to Donwun.Fernquest Spring 2006: 7 To be sure, he had no intention to submit. When Razadarit's armies conquered the northern province and showed up before Donwun's walls, Sam Lek, confident that his heavily fortified town could withstand the attacks, simply reneged on the pledge.Pan Hla 2005: 172 His confidence was not unfounded. Pegu forces could not take the heavily fortified Donwun despite taking heavy casualties. However, Donwun would soon fall to a ruse. Razadarit sent Commander Ye Thin Yan, a childhood friend and thwethauk(Harvey 1925: 178): thwethauk was a \\"blood-bond, a sacramental brotherhood of some round table as it were.\\" comrade of Sam Lek, pretending to have defected with 300 men. Sam Lek was initially distrustful. Ye Thin Yan convinced him that he had stolen loads of gold and silver from the king, and that his men would enter Donwun without any arms.Pan Hla 2005: 172‚Äì173 Sam Lek, who had tried a similar deception in 1370 or 1371, let the men in. At a predetermined time, Razadarit's forces from outside the town and Ye Thin Yan's men from the inside launched a coordinated attack. The gates were opened, and Sam Lek tried to flee to Martaban on a war elephant. The elephant went into musth, allowing Razadarit's forces to catch up with him. Commander Saw Bya Let, atop his own war elephant, killed the viceroy, who died on his elephant.Pan Hla 173 Aftermath According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle, Razadarit was saddened by the death of Sam Lek because he wanted an experienced commander like Sam Lek in his service. The king had actually issued a do-not-kill order during the chase, but the order did not make it to the vanguard forces in time. Nevertheless, Razadarit took Sam Lek's daughter May Hnin Kaythaya, who was already married, as a concubine before giving her to Commander Lagun Ein.Pan Hla 2005: 176 NotesReferencesBibliography  * 1388 deaths Hanthawaddy dynasty Burmese generals Burmese people of Mon descent ","title":"Sam Lek of Donwun"},{"id":"59030467","text":"Bundaberg Sugar is a company involved in all aspects of sugar manufacture, including growing and milling the sugarcane and refining and marketing the sugar.

She was the first female registered architect in Florida, the sixth woman admitted to the American Institute of Architects and the first from Florida. As an educator, she taught geography, biology, chemistry, Latin and mathematics in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ballard was also one of the first women to be elected to a public office in Florida, serving as Superintendent of Public Education for Palm Beach County, Florida for four years.  Biography  Agnes Ballard was born in Oxford, Massachusetts, on September 14, 1877, the daughter of Dana L. Ballard and Jane R. Carpenter, both originally from Vermont. She attended public schools in Worcester, Massachusetts, and went on to attend Wellesley College in 1902. She graduated from Worcester Normal School (a teacher training college) in 1905. = Early teaching career = Seeking a challenge after graduation she took a teaching job in Palmer, Michigan, but found she disliked the cold weather there. \\"I saw so much snow In one season I wanted to go somewhere where I never would see snow again.\\" So, in 1906, at age 29, she moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, where she got a job teaching geography, biology and chemistry at Palm Beach High School. In 1908, she moved to a nearby private school opened by Grace Lainhart, where she taught Latin and mathematics. Seeking a higher salary, she again moved north in 1910, this time to White Plains, New York, but again found the snow was not for her. She returned to Florida to teach in St. Augustine. She moved north once more when she became a private secretary (for the local YWCA, and then an Episcopal church) in La Crosse, Wisconsin. She would soon return to Florida for good, but this time not as a teacher. = Switch to architecture = A 1916 newspaper ad for Ballard's business During her time in La Crosse, she had apprenticed at the architectural firm of Percy Dwight Bentley. In 1913, she returned to Florida and continued to study architecture. In 1914, she was granted architecture license No. 6 by the State of Florida. She was not only the first woman to be a licensed architect in the state, but she received the first license beyond those the five-member licensing board in Tallahassee issued to themselves. In 1916, she became only the sixth woman to be granted membership in the American Institute of Architects. She ran an ad in the local city directory and became a regular fixture in the local society column. When she started as an architect, she used her home as an office and studio for her one-woman practice. Asked about her architecture projects, she said she had worked on \\"apartments, residences and hot dog stands.\\" She became acquainted with fellow architect Addison Mizner, who designed lavish homes in the area. When he organized a local architects' club, Ballard was the secretary. = Superintendent of schools = October 29, 1920, campaign rally advertisement After the 19th Amendment was adopted on August 18, 1920, friends asked Ballard to run for office in the election that fall. She ran for County Superintendent of Schools, alongside Clara Stypmann who ran for the school board. Ballard had worked as a teacher for the school district before, but her six years of architecture experience was also relevant because the district was booming and needed to build new schools. Both candidates won their elections, making them among the first women ever elected to public office in Florida. Ballard took office on January 4, 1921. During her term, Ballard led the district through \\"boom years of incredible growth.\\" She was appointed chairperson of the civic improvement committee of the Florida Association of Architects. Among the building projects that were begun under her was a vocational school at Canal Point, built for the then large sum of $8,000. She was elected President of the Royal Palm Educational Association, an alliance of the school districts of three Florida counties. But she was a \\"stern\\" leader and her term of office was a \\"rocky one.\\" She sought bond money to build new schools, but local voters were unenthusiastic. As a result she proposed the district buy an early version of a portable classroom. She once fired a male principal who had his students demonstrate at her home until police were called. In 1924, she had \\"had enough\\" and declined to run for re-election. Joseph A. Youngblood took over her post. = Later career = After her term ended, Ballard got into real estate investing and did well until a crash occurred in 1926. That sent her back to teaching and architecture. She contacted Youngblood (her successor) for a teaching job, and she was given one at Conniston Road School. By 1934, she was teaching Latin, algebra, history, English and civics at Palm Beach Elementary. She continued her education during the summer in Gainesville, Florida, and, in August 1936, the University of Florida awarded her a B.A. in Education. She made Phi Kappa Phi. In 1947, she retired from teaching after 19 years of service, taking up architecture again. At this time, she had two draftsmen working for her. In 1957, she retired from her architecture business and again ran for school board, this time at age 80, but failed in this attempt. After a local article chronicled her forgotten history, the Florida chapter of the American Institute of Architects voted to give her a posthumous award in July 2016. = Personal life = Ballard never married. She had one brother (Willis D.) and one sister (Ethel G.), both of whom she survived. Aside from English and Latin, she spoke five languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian. She sang and played the organ; she played chess. She was involved in many clubs and other activities, to the extent that her friends called her \\"Activity\\" Ballard. She occasionally travelled, visiting England and Scotland in 1908. She also took a trip to Europe in 1926, visiting Paris and the French Riviera.

A similar game called Luksong tinik is played by Filipino children. Hpan Khone (English: \\"High Jump Game\\") is a traditional children's game in Myanmar. The game is played mostly by females, though young boys will sometimes join in. Hpan Khone requires two teams comprising four to five players. There is an offensive team and a defending team. The offensive team must hop on one leg over five different human obstacles created by the ‚Äúdefending‚Äù team. With each round, the defending team adds an obstacle to make the jumps higher. Rules=Round One= In the first level, two members of the defending team sit on the ground facing each other, legs slightly spread, with the soles of their feet touching. The other team then hops one-legged, one-at-a-time, over the tangle of legs. For each team member who successfully jumps over the two feet, one point is given to the team. If the player touches the obstacle, they are not allowed to continue to the next level. =Round Two= Once each player has had a turn, the hurdle becomes a bit more difficult. The two players on the ground close their legs together, thus creating a wider obstacle. The rules remain the same: touch the obstacle and you are out. Jump successfully and you make it to the next level and give a point to your team. =Round Three= In the third round, the obstacle is doubled in height when the seated players place one leg above the other in such a way as that the toes of the bottom foot support the heel of the other. The wo players remain like this with their soles still touching. The jumpers who survive move on to round four and each earn a point for their team. =Round Four= Next, the obstacle is raised slightly when one of the players on the ground rests one of her palms on the toes of her highest foot. Her teammate sitting opposite her meets fingers with an outstretched arm. Successful attackers score a point for their team. Those who fail are out. =Round Five= In the last round, the players place another palm on top of the ones they already have outstretched. As with the other rounds, successful players score a point for their teams. When there are no attackers left, the teams switch places. Variant=The Philippines= A similar game, Luksong tinik (English: \\"Jump Over The Thorns of a Plant\\") is a popular game in the Philippines. This version originated in Cabanatuan city, Philippines This version is played by two teams with equal numbers of players. Luksong Tinik in Manila, 1910. Photographic Image from the Smithsonian Libraries [National Anthropological Archives] Each team designates a leader, the nanay (mother), while the rest of the players are called anak (children). The players chosen to be nanay are usually the ones who can jump the highest. The game involves players sitting on the ground and other players jumping over parts of their body. The nanay and anak jump over the other team's feet, which represent the tinik, or thorn. The two players on the ground who comprise the tinik add a foot (soles touching) or hand to the height of the tinik after all players have jumped the 1st round. The players set a starting point, wherein enough runway is given to ensure a high-enough jump in order not to hit the hands or feet of the players who make up the tinik. If a player accidentally hits the hands or feet of the tinik, they will be removed from that round or must replace the players on the ground as the new tinik.

Description The mallee typically grows to a height of approximately and has smooth mottled grey bark. The erect, multistemmed tree is able to resprout from its lignotuber after fire. The stiff, narrow and dull grey-green adult leaves form an open crown. The diamond shaped buds are found in the leaf axils of leaves in groups of seven. Each bud is in length and wide with white flowers. The cup-shaped fruit that form later have a flattish top and a width of . Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus platydisca was first described in 1998 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in an unpublished manuscript, from material collected on Jimberlana Hill north-west of Norseman. In 2006, the description was formally published by Ian Brooker and Dean Nicolle in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (platydisca) is from ancient Greek meaning \\"wide\\", \\"broad\\" or \\"flat\\" and the Latin discus meaning \\"disc\\", referring to the wide rim of the fruit. The species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus series Diversiformae, a group of mallees that all have adult leaves held erect, buds with a single unscarred operculum and pyramidal seeds. The other species in this series include E. erectifolia, E. diversifolia, E. todtiana, E. lateritica, E. pachyloma and E. buprestium. Distribution and habitat Jimberlana mallee is found on stony hills in a small area of the Goldfields- Esperance region of Western Australia just east of Norseman where it grows in clay-loam and granite soils. It is only found on two granite hills; Jimberlana Hill and Mount Norcott with around 200 individuals on Jimberlana and more on Mt Northcott.

The specific epithet rigidus means rigid or stiff. Description Bromus rigidus is an annual grass growing tall. The culms, leaves, and panicle branches are all pubescent or harsh. The erect or ascending panicle has short branches that terminate in four to nine flowered spikelets. The reddish spikelets are long, including the awns measuring long. The first glume has one nerve and the second has three. The lance-attenuate lemmas are unequal, with the lower having a long tooth on each side of the awn and the upper tapering to the beak. The scabrous lemmas are strongly ciliate. The anthers are approximately long. The common name \\"ripgut brome\\" refers to the heavy sclerotization of the species, creating a hazard to livestock. The seeds of the plant can penetrate the skin of livestock and the callus and awns can penetrate the mouth, eyes, and intestines of livestock. Bromus rigidus differs from the closely related Bromus diandrus in its shorter laminar hairs and more compact panicle with shorter spikelet branches. The elliptical abscission scars on rachillae and elongated lemma calluses of B. rigidus further distinguish the species from B. diandrus, with the latter possessing more short and circular scars and calluses. B. diandrus is susceptible to rust such as Puccinia bromoides whereas B. rigidus is unaffected. Habitat and distribution Bromus rigidus is common in waste places and rare near ports in the United States, occurring around Maryland and the District of Columbia and north to Massachusetts.

Hired to work at MI5, she is quickly scouted for an operation run by the elusive Perry Gibbons. Working out of two flats, the MI5 team reveal that they are spying on a group of low-level Nazi sympathisers who report to MI5 spy Godfrey Toby, believing he is a secret spy for the Gestapo. The walls are bugged with microphones and Juliet's job is to transcribe the audio recordings of their conversations. Juliet develops a crush on Perry, who seems to encourage speculation that they are having an affair but does not return her affections. Instead he recruits her to ingratiate herself to a woman named Mrs. Scaife, hoping that she will lead them to the Red Book, a rumoured ledger containing the names of influential Nazi sympathisers. Juliet is given the false name Iris Carter-Jenkins. She is also approached by Oliver Alleyne, Perry's boss, who asks her to spy on Godfrey. Juliet does so, but despite noticing Godfrey acting suspiciously does not report back to Oliver. While searching for the Red Book in Mrs. Scaife's house Juliet accidentally leaves behind her handbag, containing her real identity card, and asks Mrs. Scaife's maid, an orphan named Beatrice Dodd, to help cover for her. A few days later, Juliet is proposed to by Perry, who she doesn't realise is gay. The following morning Juliet is sought out by the police who believed she was dead as they found the body of a young woman with her identification papers. Juliet realises that the body is Beatrice Dodd and is frightened as the location her body was found in was one mentioned by Godfrey Toby's Nazi sympathisers. A few days later, Juliet takes part in a sting operation during which Mrs. Scaife is arrested. By 1950, Juliet is working at the BBC after the operation, and her relationship with Perry, quickly dissolved. However, she still has MI5 ties and allows her apartment to be used as a safe house for Soviet defectors. At work she receives an anonymous note telling her that she will never be able to pay for what she has done. Juliet grows paranoid, believing the note comes from one of Godrey's recruits. After Mrs. Scaife's arrest, Juliet and Godfrey were involved in killing Dolly, one of the low-level Nazi sympathisers, after she accidentally discovered their operation. However none of the other living members of the circle ever discovered what Juliet had done. On her way home from the BBC Juliet is attacked, but is relieved to find that her attacker is a former spy named Nelly Varga who was persuaded to work for MI5 after they kidnapped her dog, a dog Juliet was put in charge of who later died. Returning home Juliet finds a mysterious visitor waiting for her, a friend of Godfrey's, and realises she was being spied on for years by MI5 as she was a double agent for the Soviets, recruited at her MI5 interview. Godfrey's friend persuades her to betray her soviet handlers. Juliet realises she will never truly be free of either party. She tries to escape but is quickly caught by MI5 agents. However, Nelly Varga attacks her a second time, allowing her to escape, and Perry helps to smuggle her to Holland. Thirty years later, MI5 forcibly repatriates her to help flush out other Soviet spies, including Oliver Alleyne. In 1981, shortly after being repatriated, Juliet is hit by a car and dies.

History  The federal government, through different ministries, works with non-governmental civil society organizations to combat violence and discrimination, promote rights and promote citizenship for the LGBT population. In 1928, sex ed became mandatory due to the concern of safe sex, and being gay. Up until the 19th century, one could serve jail time for being homosexual, and it was still considered a mental illness until 1985. It was not until 2013 that same-sex marriage was legalized, and up until 1997, sex-change surgery was illegal, and doctors would be charged with malpractice. = 1988 Constitution = The 1988 Constitution of the Brazil was created on October 5, 1988. This document addressed women's rights and minority rights. The structure of the constitution puts a large amount of focus on human rights, which paved the way for future legislature that involved specifically LGBT rights.  Program  National conferences to promote unity between the state and the people were held in 2008 and 2011. The main goals are to: * reinforce non-governmental institutions to battle homophobia and encourage LGBT citizens * support members of the movements and provide education to defend the rights of citizens * educate citizens on the rights that they have * encourage a positive self-image, and push-back against any abuse of the rights that they have.Brasil Sem Homofobia Programa de Combate √† Viol√™ncia e √† Discrimina√ß√£o contra GLTB e de Promo√ß√£o da Cidadania Homossexual The program operates under the following principles: * ensuring that public policy is made by many Ministries and Secretaries that do not discriminate against LGBT * making accessible an education of the version of policies to be put in place about the violence and discrimination that specifically LGBT people face * reassurance that human rights include combating homophobia, and that the State of Brazil, along with society, is committed to the eradication of these violations of human rights. The program has been critiqued for not being as sustainable and conducive of large-scale social change due to lack of funding and focus on locality. In general, Brazil‚Äôs federal system gives the Ministry of Education less power when it comes to curriculum, and more power when it comes to creating policies concerning guidelines and directions. Growing conservatism from religious organizations in opposition to Brazil without Homophobia has also been a challenge. Evangelical Congressional groups called for the suspension of distribution of educational materials for its sexual diversity programs. These programs were in partnership with the Global Alliance for LGBT Education (GALE) and two non-governmental organizations, Pathfinder and Bra. President Rousseff cancelled the distribution on television, taking heat for her choice. Activists began supporting the Workers' Party‚Äôs development of LGBT rights. Conservatism was a key reason that the Ministries of Health Education did not install condom dispensers in secondary schools with sexual diversity even though the technical staff had approved it, although the technical staff approved an HIV prevention campaign targeting gay men in the 2012 Carnival: the campaign was cancelled. From these conferences held in 2008 and 2011 came the First National Conference of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, travestis, and Transsexuals, which was held in June of 2008. In 2009, the Inter-Ministerial Technical Commission created the National Plan for the Promotion of LGBT Citizenship and Human Rights in order to battle stereotypes and discrimination on the basis of gender or sexuality, and to start writing policies to encourage human rights, and discourage homophobia. The Special Secretariat for Human Rights helped with the creation of human rights referral centers, which prevent and combat violence caused by homophobia and provides aid to victims.  Education  The Brazilian Ministry of Education's efforts to address discrimination and violence in the public school system began in the mid-1990s with initiatives at the state and municipal level. In December of 1996, Brazil instituted a National Curriculum. The curriculum was made to create inclusive environments, and made sex ed mandatory in schools. The ministry worked to eliminate homophobia by trying to implement workshops and classes for state school teachers about preventing homophobia and respecting sexual diversity as a part of this curriculum. The Brazilian Ministry of Education implements educational policies stemming from Brazil without Homophobia during national conferences, birthing the ‚ÄúSchool without Homophobia‚Äù program in 2008, which was signed by the National Education Development Fund. They provide subsidies to teachers with pedagogical material in order to address the issues of homophobia within the school system. In part of the effort, The Brazilian Ministry of Education funded a nationwide study that found various acts of homophobic violence and humiliation in 501 public schools. This violence and humiliation explains why travesties in high school often feel excluded and struggle with attendance.

Cushenberry started customizing in 1947 in a small shop set up in the back of a Wichita, Kansas, service station owned by his parents. His first custom was a 1948 Frazier coup√©. Newly married, he moved to Monterey, California, in 1954. At first, his body shop did work paid by insurance companies, as well as some \\"mild customizing\\". In late 1959, he began work on his first showcar, El Matador, as a rolling advertisement. He scrounged parts from Seaside Auto Wreckers, operated by Vick Irvan (father of Ernie Irvan) El Matador started life as a 1939 Ford, and debuted in February 1961 at the Oakland Roadster Show. Another Cushenberry project, a '59 Chevy called Exodus, built for Tony Cardoza, was shown at the 1961 Monterey Kar Kapades. Every body panel was altered in some way, setting a new trend in customizing. In 1962, collaborating with artist Don Varner, Cushenberry built Silhouette, his first full-on show car, from scratch. He hand-hammered 20-gauge steel on a shortened 1956 Buick chassis (which also supplied the a Buick nailhead V8 later fitted with Stuart Hilborn, with a front-hinged bubble canopy supplied by Acry Plastics. It was candy-painted, mixed with black, red, and gold. Silhouette debuted at the 1963 Oakland Roadster Show and earned Cushenberry his first Master Builder Award. In 1963, he began Marquis for Gene Boucher, which took two and a half years to complete. Paint was done by Don Mathews and Naugahyde interior by Bill Manger. The same year, Ford hired Cushenberry, along with other customizers, to produce styling variations on their new Ford XL 500 convertible; Cushenberry's, dubbed The Astro, emphasized the round taillights. Cushenberry was also part of Ford's Custom Car Caravan. The Batmobile in 2003 During the 1960s, Cushenberry also did the 1958 Impala Limelighter and The Popo, a 1940 Ford built in collaboration with George Barris. Bob Cresp still owns this car. By 1966, the public had lost its taste for radical customs like Silhouette and Red Baron, so Cushenberry turned his attention to restoration work, and to repair for high-priced imports. He built a dune buggy, The Gypsy, which was never shown (and which he owned in 1998). Around this time, he was hired by AMT to design model kits.Gosson, Scotty. Show Rod Model Kits. A Showcase of America's Wildest Model Kits. Forest Lake, Minnesota: CarTech Publishing, 2015. For the car used in the Batman TV series, Barris hired Cushenbery in October 1965 to do the metal modifications to a primer-painted, white-striped Lincoln Futura concept car. The conversion into the Batmobile was completed in three weeks at a cost of US$30,000. They car was shown in a network presentation reel, and leased to 20th Century Fox Televisionand Greenway Productions for the series. thumb One of the last known custom cars to be completed by Cushenbery was the Surfin'Bird, a 1956 Ford Thunderbird, radically modified for 93 KHJ Boss radio's 'Big Kahuna' promotion in 1966. Per the promotion, Bill Cushenbery was contracted by the Big Kahuna to build a custom outta-sight Surfin'Bird to be given away by the radio station in early August of 1966, and was given $5,000 dollars to complete the project. The Boss radio jocks ran multiple promotional spots for the contest. At the sound of the Big Kahuna's Cockatoo, hopeful listeners would call in for chance to win the car. Contestants were given a tiki charm with a numbered tag that would be used to draw the winner. Several radio spots were created with fake auto body \\"grinding noise\\" in the background, to simulate being in Cushenbery's shop, while the Big Kahuna in his trademark Hawaiian pidgin english (Mahalo Nui Loa Cushenbery), requested features to be added to the car. These may be the only known audio recordings of Bill Cushenbery's voice. The starting point of the car was a 1956 Ford Thunderbird. The car was built in Cushenbery's Burbank shop and had a tight deadline for completion. Sources stated that Bill hired a friend that worked at the Barris shop to assist with the build. Bill supposedly worked on the \\"Ferrari front\\", while the other man (possibly Steve Tate) worked on the \\"Stingray rear.\\" thumb This car clearly shows the flamboyance of 1966, with a look that mimics other wild customs of the time period, like the Dean Jeffries \\"Monkeemobile\\". The Surfin'Bird was given away August 8th, 1966 on KHJ-TV Channel 9 The Dick Curtis 18 to 34 show at 5:30 pm. It is unknown to date who the original winner was or if any of the footage from that broadcast exists. The Surfin'Bird was displayed at the \\"A World On Wheels\\" Auto Show at the RoseBowl in Pasadena on August 7th, one day prior to the giveaway. Currently, no photos of the completed car are known to exist other that the mock up shots on KHJ promotional materials.

QSL are closely related to time-energy uncertainty relations. In 1945, Leonid Mandelstam and Igor Tamm derived a time-energy uncertainty relation that bounds the speed of evolution in terms of the energy dispersion. Over half a century later, Norman Margolus and Lev Levitin showed that the speed of evolution cannot exceed the mean energy, a result known as the Margolus‚ÄìLevitin theorem. Realistic physical systems in contact with an environment are known as open quantum systems and their evolution is also subject to QSL. Quite remarkably it was shown that environmental effects, such as non-Markovian dynamics can speed up quantum processes, which was verified in a cavity QED experiment. In 2017, QSLs were studied in a quantum oscillator at high temperature. In 2018, it was shown that QSL are not restricted to the quantum domain and that similar bounds hold in classical systems. QSL have been used to explore the limits of computation and complexity.

During the War of 1812, he helped pay the ransom of a number of prisoners held by Native Americans following the River Raisin Massacre. He served in the Michigan Senate in the early years of its existence.  Biography  John McDonellMcDonell himself spelled his name with one \\"n\\" ; other sources, e.g., , spell it with two. was born in Scotland in 1780.McDonell cites 1780 as his birth year in ; other sources, e.g., , list it as 1779. His father was a supporter of the Stuart claim to the British throne, which made him unpopular with the government and prompted him to move his family to the United States in 1785. The family landed at Philadelphia, then moved to Albany, New York, where his father became a citizen and McDonell received his education. After a fire destroyed his father's business, McDonell was sent in 1798 to work as a clerk in his uncle's mercantile house in York, Canada. He started his own business in 1807, and moved to Detroit in 1809, though he retained property in Canada. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1810. = War of 1812 = During the War of 1812, McDonell raised a cavalry company on Canadian soil to fight on behalf of the Americans. Following the River Raisin Massacre, he paid the ransom of many prisoners that were brought to Detroit by their Native American captors. Among those whose freedom he purchased was a future congressman, Gustavus Bower. In 1815, after the war, McDonell traveled to Sandwich, Ontario, (now Windsor) on business, and was arrested and imprisoned on charges of high treason against the British Government, for his actions on behalf of America during the war. He managed to escape, but a grand jury indicted him on the charges, and after he failed to appear for trial, he was declared an outlaw. Although the intercession of the American ambassador to Great Britain eventually led to the outlawry judgment being dropped in 1826, he had lost all of his property and outstanding business debts owed to him in Canada. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for compensation for these losses in 1834. = Political career = McDonell was appointed an associate judge in the county court in Wayne County on January 17, 1817, and served as chief justice of the court from January 13, 1830, until the court was abolished on April 15, 1833, when its business was transferred to the circuit courts. He was also appointed by the territorial governor to serve as an auctioneer in Detroit from 1817 to 1818. McDonell was one of Wayne County's representatives on the Michigan Territorial Council from 1828 through 1835, and served as its president of the council in 1834. He was a delegate to the convention charged with drafting a state constitution in advance of Michigan's application for statehood, and also to the first Convention of Assent called to determine whether Michigan would accept the terms proposed by Congress for Michigan's statehood‚Äîtaking the western part of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for a strip of land that had been the subject of the Toledo War with Ohio. After the convention rejected the proposal, people requested that Governor Stevens T. Mason call a second convention to reconsider; he refused, but declared that the people themselves could call for such a convention. McDonell was one of several Wayne County residents who signed a statement calling for such a convention, which eventually approved the proposal and removed the last obstacle to Michigan's statehood. Following the adoption of the state constitution and the creation of the Michigan Legislature, McDonell represented Wayne County as the senator from the 1st District in the Michigan Senate from 1835 until his resignation on March 23, 1838. He also served as an alderman of the city of Detroit in 1837. From 1839 to 1841 he was the customs collector in Detroit. He served as a regent of the University of Michigan from 1835 to 1837. McDonell died on October 1, 1846.

They disbanded around 1970 but have occasionally reunited for one-off appearances in subsequent years, most recently in 2015, while Helen (formerly \\"Bernie\\") continues to perform intermittently as a solo artist. Biography Siblings Marie, Francie and Helen (then known as Bernadette or \\"Bernie\\") Grehan were immersed in Irish traditional music from an early age via their parents' pub, Grehan's in Boyle, and as teenagers developed a reputation for their exuberant renditions of traditional and composed Irish songs and tunes, also featuring Francie's playing on mandolin and ukulele-banjo (actually a mandolin-banjo since it has 8 strings), Helen on guitar and both Helen and Marie on spoons, with which they frequently entertained the patrons. Young up- and-coming singers such as Christy Moore were attracted by their energy and their talents; in his 2012 book \\"One Voice\\" Moore wrote: In around 1965 the sisters moved to Dublin to develop their playing and singing career, where they were included in The Dubliners' (at the time unfinished) short musical/comedy film O'Donoghue's Opera, and in 1966 released a single \\"Patsy McCann\\"/\\"Woman Of Our Town\\" plus an EP The Grehan Sisters for Rex records, a subsidiary of Decca. In 1967 they signed to the London-based Transatlantic Records, who were keen to capitalise on their recent success with releases of the Dubliners by signing another Irish group,Billboard, the U.S.-based music trade magazine, 2 September 1967.

In the U.K. they released an LP On the Galtymore Mountains (1967) featuring a mix of traditional music and Irish rebel songs, at which time Marie was 23 years old, Francie 22 and Helen 18.Liner notes to The Grehan Sisters: On the Galtymore Mountains, 1967 They released two more singles, this time on Transatlantic, and contributed two newly recorded songs to a 1968 Transatlantic sampler Here's To The Irish.

As of 2018, all three are still alive and well and have reunited on occasion for special performances. In 2014 the Grehan Sisters and Christy Moore headlined a tribute concert in Boyle to the late John Reilly, a traditional singer associated for some years with their parents' pub, and in 2015 they were guests of honour and recipients of the Annie McNulty Award at the opening of the South Roscommon Singers Festival, while Helen continues to perform intermittently as a solo artist featuring her own songs.

Life Her education was notable because of the discrimination she suffered due to her gender, She attended Mount Holyoke College which she found empowering and she briefly went into teaching before returning to the college to run the YWCA. By 1919 she had a B.D. from the Union Seminary where she deepened her interest in teaching the bible which she had started whilst at the YWCA. She was not allowed to sit with the other graduates because she was the only woman and she was obliged to sit with the wives. She had the highest marks at the seminary and she was awarded a travelling fellowship. She used this to allow her to study at Cambridge University in the UK. It was only later that she found that although Cambridge allowed women to study it refused to give her a degree or to formally acknowledge her studies. Luckily she received letters of recommendation from her Cambridge tutors and that enable her to enrol for her doctorate. After she qualified in 1924 she was one of two women who were the first to teach at the University of Chicago. She was already a Professor of Religion at Vassar College where her teaching had resulted in that title in 1923. In 1926 she married Professor Eugene Lyman. She was his second wife and she became a step mother to his two children. She stopped being the professor at Vassar and began to teach religion at Barnard College and the bible at the Union Seminary in 1927. She held both of these positions until 1940 when she decided to join her husband when he retired. In 1958 she had a public disagreement with Billy Graham concerning his interpretation of the bible.

She was the first woman to hold a tenure-track position in mathematics at Cornell University, and is an associate professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota. Contributions Gaal's dissertation work was in the foundations of mathematics. It proved that two different systems for set theory that had previously been proposed as foundational were equiconsistent: either both are valid or both lead to contradictions. These two systems were Zermelo set theory and Von Neumann set theory. They differed from each other in that von Neumann had added to Zermelo's theory a notion of classes, collections of mathematical objects that are defined by some property but do not necessarily form a set. (Often, intuitively, proper classes are \\"too big\\" to form sets; for instance, the collection of all sets cannot itself be a set, by Russell's paradox, but it can be a class.) Gaal's work showed that introducing this extra notion of a class is a safe step, one that does not introduce any new inconsistencies into the system. Gaal is also the author of two books: *Classical Galois Theory With Examples (Markham Publishing, 1971; third ed., Chelsea Publishing, 1979; reprinted 1998) *A Mathematical Gallery (American Mathematical Society, 2017) Early life and education Gaal was born in Vienna on January 17, 1924, the daughter of a gynecologist and the sister of Gertrude M. Novak, who became a physician in Chicago. She and her two sisters escaped Nazi Germany, and moved with their family to New York City. After graduating from Hunter College with an A.B. in 1944, Gaal earned a doctorate in 1948 from Harvard University, through Radcliffe College. Her dissertation, On the Consistency of Goedel's Axioms for Class and Set Theory Relative to a Weaker Set of Axioms, was jointly supervised by Lynn Harold Loomis and Willard Van Orman Quine. Later career Gaal lived in Berkeley, California in 1950‚Äì1951. She and her husband, mathematician Steven Gaal, both moved to Cornell University, beginning as instructors in 1953 but then in 1954 being promoted to assistant professors. This step was the first time the Cornell mathematics department had offered a tenure-track position to a woman. She also became the first woman at Cornell to advise the doctorate of a mathematics student, Angelo Margaris.

He was a member of the Michigan Senate in its first term, and a portion of his farm became the campus of the University of Michigan.  Biography  Rumsey was born in Sharon, Litchfield County, Connecticut, on July 7, 1784, the son of Revolutionary War veteran William Rumsey and Elizabeth Walker. The Rumseys moved to Hubbardton, Vermont in 1787 or 1788. About 1808, Henry Rumsey moved to land he had purchased from the Holland Land Company in Genesee County, New York, and his younger brother Elisha Walker Rumsey moved to the county as well by 1818. Elisha Walker Rumsey traveled west and co-founded the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1824, and Henry followed his brother to Ann Arbor shortly thereafter. In 1825, Henry purchased of land from James Noyes for $300 (). Following Elisha's death in 1827, Henry, as the executor of his estate, was ordered to pay up to $800 for the building of a town jail that Elisha had promised; it was completed in 1828 but burned down a few years later. In January 1830, Rumsey was part of a group of eight men who set out west from Ann Arbor to mark a new road along with the commission that was surveying it. They went as far as a cabin near the Grand River, where Rumsey was elected president of an informal \\"convention\\" to decide on a name for the place. They chose the name Jacksonburgh, which was later shortened to Jackson, Michigan. = Political career = Rumsey served as the first supervisor of Ann Arbor Township in 1827 and again in 1834, and was elected as a representative to the first Michigan Territorial Council, from 1827 to 1829. He was elected to the Michigan Senate in 1835, for its first term under the new state constitution, and served until 1839. He was a member of the Democratic Party. On June 5, 1837, the Regents of the University of Michigan traveled from Detroit, where most of them lived, to Ann Arbor for a three-day meeting. A land company had been established in Ann Arbor for the purpose of donating of land on which to establish the University of Michigan, an arrangement which had allowed Ann Arbor to triumph over several other communities in the selection of a site. During this session, the regents chose 40 acres of Rumsey's farm as their preferred location, and soon built a single university building and four professors' residences. He died in Ann Arbor on April 8, 1855, and is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery. = Family = Rumsey married Durinda D. Foster on February 12, 1812, and they had four children: Minerva E., Melville L., Volney, and Julius Caesar Rumsey. Durinda died on July 4, 1852, in Ann Arbor.

MECC results in net negative carbon emission wastewater treatment by removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the treatment process in the form of calcite (CaCO3), and production of profitable H2 gas. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions contribute to significant regional climate change due to the compound's contribution to the greenhouse gas effect in the atmosphere. Most mitigation goals to remove CO2 from the atmosphere are based on high levels of CO2 produced by fossil fuel combustion as a basis for energy production. The use of fossil fuels emits CO2 and other toxic compounds such as SOx and NOx in the process of combustion. Economic growth is reliant on energy production for transportation and industrial production of goods and services, the amount of CO2 emitted is predicted to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Net emissions of greenhouse gases of anthropogenic actions Wastewater processing reflects a small percentage of greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, wastewater treatment consumes \\"3% of total electricity within the U.S.\\" At least 12 trillion gallons of wastewater are treated in the United States alone per year, which contributes to 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Microbial electrolysis carbon capture (MECC) is a process that contributes to sustainable energy practice in both private and public sectors. MECC takes advantage of properties inherent to wastewater, such as organic content, to remove carbon dioxide and produce calcite precipitate and hydrogen gas.  Background  Wastewater treatment plants are held accountable by The 2004 Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative for their emissions of greenhouse gases by the use of electricity to treat wastewater. For example, energy is required for the aeration process that releases volatile compounds from the water, and also for the mixing and transportation of polluted and recycled fluid moving throughout the process. The electricity generation process itself necessary for wastewater treatment produces CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide. The aerobic treatment step of the water releases N2O and CO2, similar to the particle settling step, and the activated sludge step releases both CO2 and methane. The activated sludge step in wastewater treatment releases compounds such as methane and CO2. Microbes in wastewater have the potential to enhance mineralization of CO2. Mineralization of CO2 into CaCO3 immobilizes CO2 which prevent leakages by stabilizing underground pressure and reducing permeability of the cap rock. By Le Chatelier's principle, increasing Ca2+ availability and increasing pH will increase the rate of mineralization. Negatively charged surfaces on microbes have a high affinity for cations such as Ca2+ and, though metabolic function, increase saturation of CO2 in solution. In addition, bacterial ureolysis (hydrolysis of urea) increases pH of the solution.  Technology of MECC using wastewater  The microbial electrolytic process uses wastewater as a source of charged ions and outputs hydrogen gas through the use of the microbial electrolysis cell. The wastewater itself provides electrolytes and is used to dissolve minerals. It is in the wastewater where reactions occur that bind CO2 molecules to make new substances. On the anode, microorganisms called exoelectrogens interact with organic compounds to split hydrogen and produce CO2. The resulting electrons travel through the circuit to the cathode, where they reduce water, to produce H2 gas and OH‚àí ions. The increased cathode pH dissolves silicate minerals, releasing metal ions such as Ca2+. Protons (H+) produced at the anode act with these metal ions to capture and ultimately mineralize CO2 into carbonate. Due to the high production of H2 gas, and the ability for the system to recycle up to 95% of the gas, the result is a gain of 57-63kJ/mol CO2 , or a gain of 63kJ per mol of CO2 captured. The CO2 sequestered and H2 produced with this method, as well as being \\"net energy positive\\" are specifically mentioned as the highlights of the process, as well as the opportunity to use recycled materials such as HCO3‚àí produced by the MECC which is useful for water treatment plants. The water leftover can be given to the external CO2 emissions plants (such as coal power). An advantage of the MECC process over other alternative approaches like anaerobic digestion is that MECC works well at low temperatures, small- scale, and low COD concentrations. The economics section describes current economic disadvantages of this process.  Economics of MECC  Microbial electrolytic carbon capture has yet to be implemented in present wastewater plants, therefore economic cost and benefits are current projections based on research of the technology rather than operational data. Lu et al. 2015 summarize the potential economic benefits of MECC use in their 2015 article in which they define the method of MECC. Their results estimate a ‚Äú$48 per ton CO2 mitigated‚Äù net cost for MECC technology applied to wastewater plants. This estimation factors in the parasitic energy costs, operational costs and initial capital required to perform MECC, as well as potential cost offsets such as revenue due to water treatment, H2 production, and reduction in fossil fuel consumption for commercial manufacturing of H2 and treatment of wastewater. The projected net cost of $48 per ton of mitigated CO2 is lower than estimated costs for pulverized coal power plant post-combustion carbon capture absorption using MEA and geologic sequestration ($65/t-CO2), which is currently the most prolific Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technique. The MECC cost projection is also lower than the cost of many other CCS technologies: the direct air CO2 capture methods (about $1000/t-CO2),House, K. Z.; Baclig, A. C.; Ranjan, M.; van Nierop, E. A.; Wilcox, J.; Herzog, H. J. Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The economics of MECC approach to carbon capture will benefit from future investigation in optimizing design and materials used. Further research is needed to predict the scope of costs and setbacks related to engineering and running a functional MECC system within current wastewater plants. Critics of MECC discuss inefficiencies of the process, installation, materials, and potential setbacks that may result in economic losses.McCarty, Perry L., Jaeho Bae, and Jeonghwan Kim. \\"Domestic wastewater treatment as a net energy producer‚Äìcan this be achieved?.\\" (2011): 7100-7106. Although MECC is projected to be cheaper than other existing carbon capture techniques, it is considerably more expensive (on the order of 800 times more expensive) than present wastewater treatment technology and therefore faces a substantial barrier to implementation in public and private wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, the efficiency of Microbial Fuel Cell technology, which is analogous to the microbial system used within MECC, has been criticized for its unpredictability due to relying upon the chemical and nutrient content of varying wastewater, as well as the health of living microbes.Logan, B. E. Microbial Fuel Cells; John Wiley & Sons: Hoboken, NJ, 2008. Inefficient MFCs lead to greater operation costs as cost offset fluctuates with departure from maximum efficiency of the system.

The preregistration of studies can help to prevent publication bias, reduce data dredging, and identify otherwise undisclosed HARKing. It has gained prominence as a potential solution to some of the issues that are thought to underlie the replication crisis in science.  Process  In the standard preregistration format, researchers prepare a research protocol document prior to conducting their research. Ideally, this document indicates the research hypotheses, sampling procedure, sample size, research design, testing conditions, stimuli, measures, data coding and aggregation method, criteria for data exclusions, and statistical analyses, including potential variations on those analyses. This preregistration document is then posted on a publicly available website such as the Open Science Framework or AsPredicted. The preregistered study is then conducted, and a report of the study and its results is submitted for publication together with access to the (anonymised) preregistration document. This preregistration approach allows peer reviewers and subsequent readers to cross-reference the preregistration document with the published research article in order to identify (a) any ‚Äúexploratory‚Äù tests that were not included in the preregistration document and (b) any suppressed tests that were included in the preregistered protocol but excluded from the final research report. The registered report format requires authors to submit a description of the study methods and analyses prior to data collection. Once the method and analysis plan is vetted through Stage 1 peer review, publication of the findings is provisionally guaranteed. The associated study is then conducted, and the research report is submitted to Stage 2 peer review. Stage 2 peer review confirms that the actual research methods are consistent with the preregistered protocol and that quality thresholds are met (e.g., manipulation checks confirm the validity of the experimental manipulation). Studies that pass Stage 2 peer review are then published regardless of whether the results are confirming or disconfirming, significant or nonsignificant. Hence, both preregistration and registered reports involve creating a time-stamped non-modifiable public record of the study and analysis plan before the data is collected. However, the study and analysis plan is only subjected to a formal peer review before data collection in the case of registered reports.  Journal Support  Over 200 journals offer a registered reports option (Centre for Open Science, 2019), and the number of journals that are adopting registered reports is approximately doubling each year (Chambers et al., 2019). Psychological Science has encouraged the preregistration of studies and the reporting of effect sizes and confidence intervals. The editor-in-chief also noted that the editorial staff will be asking for replication of studies with surprising findings from examinations using small sample sizes before allowing the manuscripts to be published. Nature Human Behaviour has adopted the registered report format, as it ‚Äúshift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them‚Äù. European Journal of Personality defines this format: ‚ÄúIn a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.‚Äùhttps://www.ejp- blog.com/blog/2017/2/3/streamlined-review-and-registered-reports-coming-soon Note that only a very small proportion of academic journals in psychology and neurosciences explicitly stated that they welcome submissions of replication studies in their aim and scope or instructions to authors. This phenomenon does not encourage the reporting or even attempt on replication studies. Overall, the number of participating journals is increasing, as indicated by the Center for Open Science, which maintains a list of journals encouraging the submission of registered reports.  Criticisms  Critics of preregistration and registered reports have argued that these approaches inhibit unplanned, exploratory analyses (Coffman & Niederle, 2015). In response, preregistration advocates have argued that exploratory analyses are permitted. Preregistration merely makes the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory analyses clearer (Wagenmakers et al., 2012). Hence, preregistration is ‚Äúa plan, not a prison‚Äù (Dehaven, 2017) However, critics argue that, if preregistration is merely a plan, and not a prison, then researchers should feel free to deviate from that plan and engage in unplanned, exploratory analyses without being accused of inappropriate research practices such as p-hacking and inflated familywise error rates (e.g., Navarro, 2020). Critics have also argued that the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory analyses is unclear and confusing (Devezer et al., 2020; Rubin, 2020; Szollosi & Donkin, 2019), and that concerns about abstract, atheoretical, familywise error rates are unfounded (Rubin, 2020; Szollosi et al., 2020). Finally, some critics have argued that preregistration may actually harm science by providing a false sense of credibility to research studies (Szollosi et al., 2020).

Until 2017, it was run by the former Acting United States Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. FACT's website states that the organisation is \\"dedicated to promoting accountability, ethics, and transparency in government and civic arenas by hanging a lantern over public officials who put their own interests over the interests of the public good.\\" Overview The conservative group Donors Trust was the source of $500,000 of FACT's revenue in 2015 and $800,000 in 2016. As a 501(c)(3) organization it is not required to disclose donors however Charles Koch has acknowledged giving to DonorsTrust. FACT paid Whitaker $1.2 million, with the vast majority of the payments from 2016 to 2017. FACT has largely focused on Hillary Clinton and the e-mail scandal or other Democratic representatives such as Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, Representative Patrick E. Murphy of Florida and Representative Ted Strickland of Ohio. FACT lobbied against the confirmation of one-time Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and filed an FEC complaint against Democratic voter data firm Catalist in 2015. Despite claiming to be nonpartisan, the organization called for ethics investigations into or filed complaints about forty-six different Democratic politicians, officials, and organizations, compared to only a few Republicans. During his tenure, Whitaker wrote opinion pieces that appeared in USA Today and The Washington Examiner, and appeared regularly on conservative talk-radio shows and cable news. In 2017, Whitaker as executive director of FACT wrote: > The most disturbing aspect of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs continued blame game is that > she still doesn‚Äôt think there was anything wrong with recklessly handling > highly sensitive and classified information, intentionally instructing her > staff to do the same and then lying to the entire world about it at the > United Nations of all places. In addition, FACT filed a complaint in August 2017 with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Alexandra Chalupa, a consultant working for the DNC who had been investigating Paul Manafort and Donald Trump's ties to Russia. Whitaker made the complaint at the direction of the White House. FACT acted in close concert with Senator Chuck Grassley, who also made a complaint with the DOJ. FACT's complaint was based on the claim that Chalupa had met with Ukrainian officials in an effort to expose ties among Trump, Manafort, and Russia. As of December 2018 the FEC had given no indication whether it would investigate the issue. Chalupa denied any wrongdoing. In 2016, Whitaker defended ExxonMobil as the executive director of FACT when the Attorneys General United for Clean Power Coalition started their investigation into the firm for not disclosing climate change risks. Whitaker called the investigation \\"both unconstitutional and unethical\\". The investigation has since matured leading to four counts of fraud being filed against ExxonMobil. In 2018 FACT scrutinised a pro Rick Scott Political action committee. FACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015. FACT paid America Rising at least $500,000 for research from 2015 to 2017. FACT also had close working relationship with America Rising, sharing information and political communication strategy. The foundation last year paid $134,119 to Creative Response Concepts, a conservative political public relations company and has paid a total of $500,000 to the agency. Some experts such as Daniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, have questioned the status of FACT saying that it may have Violated Tax-Exempt Status. FACT has called for ethical investigations or filed complaints against over 46 individuals or organizations, the vast majority of whom are either Democrats or associated with Democratic causes. Personnel Kendra Arnold is the Executive Director and was previously the General Counsel from 2014 onward. FACT's treasurer was Neil Corkery from 2015 to 2016 whose wife established the Judicial Crisis Network. Neil Corkery is now treasurer for Public Interest Legal Foundation. Corkey was part of the three person board of directors at FACT including Whitaker. William (Bill) Gustoff serves on the board of directors of FACT was a former law partner of Matthew Whitaker for Whitaker Hagenow & Gustoff LLP (which changed its name later to Hagenow & Gustoff LLP).

The Church was built in 1100 and is a national monument. It is considered one of the best preserved Romanesque buildings in the province.  Location  The St. Peter and Paul Church is situated in the centre of Brebbia, in the region of Lombardy. The town was the seat of a castle of the Milanese Archbishops in the medieval period.  History  The Church of St. Peter and Paul is one of the best preserved Churches in Italy. It was built in the XII century, by Julius of Novara, who was allied with the Romanic army. They decided that they wanted to replace an already existing Church with a much bigger one, on the same location. The St. Peter and St. Paul Church was built under the Roman influence and is characterized by a strong Romanesque style. The church features various artworks, including paintings and frescos dedicated to Queen Mary, St.Peter and St.Paul, the patrons of the town. St. Paul and Peter Church is associated with the myth of St. Julius, the founder of the Church. The myth tells that Julius came with his brother from Greece to evangelize the area close to Orta Lake, and decided to destroy the Temple of Minerva and build the Brebbia Church. The Church has undergone various renovations, including the change of the central nave in the XVII century, which now includes more complex trusses, and the restyling of the artworks. = Origins = The Church is located on or near the site of an earlier Roman Temple, dedicated to Minerva, built to celebrate a victory against the Celts, who occupied the cities of Milano and Como. Following Teodosio's decision to adopt the Catholic religion, the Romans replaced Minerva's Temple with a Christian church. This original Church was subsequently replaced with the current church of St. Peter and Paul. The construction of the new Church was due partially to increasing population in the region. = The title of \\"Pieve\\" = During the 5th century, after several barbaric invasions against the town of Brebbia, the Church gained importance and was granted the title of \\"Pieve\\", becoming the centre of the archbishops of Insubria. The Church lost the title of Pieve in 1567 D.C, when it was passed to the city of Milan. = Similarities with regional church architecture = The Church evidences architectural analogies with other Churches of the area. These Church were also built around the 12th century and include: ; Church of S. Antonio of San Fedele Intelvi; Church of S. Vittore di Bedero; and . These Churches are characterized by a Romanesque architecture and were based on three naves and one apse. The apse are all located at the end of the main nave. Art critics have advanced the hypothesis that all of these were build under the main guidance of Julius of Novara, due to the similarity in style. = Besozzi's family = The Church of St Peter and Paul contains several references to Besozzi's family. This family gained power in the XII century, and financed the construction of various churches and monuments, including the Church of St Peter and Paul in Brebbia. This funding allowed the family to gain power in the area and to obtain favourable treatment in the affairs of the Catholic Church. The family had a coat of arms characterized by a golden flying eagle, which features in the church's Crucifixion's fresco.  Architecture  232x232px St. Peter and Paul Church has a typical Romanesque architecture: it is elementary and characterized by three naves and one apse, located at the end of the main nave and orientated to the east. There is a transept that comes out from the secondary naves. The main nave was originally characterized by a truss, substituted in the XVII century by a vault. This renovation work destabilized the building and because of that it required further structural modifications, which include the addition of tie-rods and metal slabs. These additions still remain visible on the church exterior. = Exterior = The wall of the Church is made of great blocks of serizzo, granite and Angera's stone; they are positioned in a linear horizontal order. leftThe front of the Church shows the sloping roofs, that come from the elevation of the main nave of 1600. The original structure of the Church was made in a hut shape. The elevation of the nave is hidden by the plastering. The front of the Church is divided into three parts as it is inside. In the high side of the front there is an oculus, located in the middle, and two single-lancet windows in the secondary naves. The architects decided to complete the front with two doors: the main door is located in the centre, and it has a secondary door beside, which is smaller. On the south side of the building, there is a door in the middle of to two single-lancet windows, similar to the ones in the front. The door is particularly decorated and is used as the main entrance of the church. The transept is opened by two single-lancet windows located in a low level, and an oculus in the middle. The apse is closed by the transept, and it is divided into three parts by two half pedastals. Each part is defined by a single-lancet splayed window with an arch and solid Angera's stones. The single-lancet window of the central part is bigger than the others and more elegant. It is similar to the door in the south side of the building. The north side of the building is plain with no windows.298x298px = Interior = The interior has three naves on square pillars. Originally it had a trussed roof on the central nave. The semi- columns that start from the level of the capitals have been used to support the fall of the seventeenth-century vaults. The wide eastern apse has an ogival-shaped basin that still has 15th century frescoes. From the inside of the church, the problems related to the restructuring of the church are evident. The naves are characterized by three spans, and the main nave is twice the size of the secondary naves. The pillars of the Church are characterized by having different shapes. They bear a wide cross vault, located in the centre of the transept. This area is the only one that was originally covered by the vault, to emphasize the holy part of the Church.  Artwork = The apse = The frescoes can be found in the apse and in the southern nave of the Church. The apse is dominated by a basin, which is the most important feature of the complex as it highlights the altar and catches the eye of the visitors whom enter the church. The frescoes have been subject to several changes and were replaced by new frescoes with more modern features. This coverage can be seen by the different thicknesses on the wall. Understanding the original frescoes is difficult, because documentation is scarce and most of them date back to the early XV century. The pastoral visit in 1569 was led by Leonetto Chiavone. It resulted in a statement saying that the altar was placed under a painted and ornamented vault. In the pastoral visit of 1581, the apse is described as full of frescoes, but with corroded images due to the antiquity. Descriptions of these frescoes are missing and it is impossible to define which of the visible frescoes are original ones. During post 1939 restorations some antique frescoes were uncovered that were obscured during restoration work in the XVI century. The only datable fresco is the Crucifixion, located at the top right of the central window. The sides of the cross are faded but remain to show the date in Roman numbers. The coat of arms of the Besozzi family is still visible. The work is very simplified due to the characters covering all available places with a clean and dark outline. There are also decorations visible in the ornaments on the vests and in the rays above the aureole of the angels and saints. Above the arch which introduces the presbytery, the Master of the Fissiraga Tomb has painted an intense gothic model Crucifixion. Its dramatic look is contained in the gestures of Mary and John, in the gestures of the angels that gather the Blood of Christ from the chalice, and with the solemnity that contrasts with the desperate flights of their respective Varesini around the cross. The fresco that is placed on the left side of the central window represents the Madonna Enthroned with the Child and Saint Peter. The throne of Virgin Mary has gothic elements, like turrets and pinnacles that make it look like a sacred edifice. The theme of Virgin Mary as mother is the image of the Church that is usually suggested, but Saint Peter acquires a particular importance in this fresco. The state of conservation of the artwork is precarious due to the disappearance of many graphic details. These were originally described as numerous, but currently only remain in the vest of the Child and in its borders. 245x245px Under the Crucifixion fresco there is a fragmentated fresco, with different stylistic characteristics. The plaster on which the fresco is painted has a lower thickness, showing that the artwork is more antique. It is estimated to date between the end of the XIII century and the start of the XIV century. The visible part represents figures of Saints, of which on the right is Saint Peter with the keys and the book, and Giovanni Battista dressed in skins and a symbol of the Angel of God in his hand. The usage of the lines is nearly obsessive: the beards, hair, alignments of the face, margins of the clothes and the aureoles. The veins of the wood of the cross are underlined by dark lines and the artist ornamented the superior border with flowers. Similar characteristics can be found in a fragment of Ambrose, highlighted under two saints from 1400 in the lower band of the left arch. Part of the face, the aureole and the three scourges are visible. Around the figure there is a partially conserved frame similar to the Crucifixion. A group of figures of Saints was found in the southern nave during the restorations in 1963-64. The altar of Saint Stephen should have been situated here, numerous times named in the pastoral visits in the end of 1500. When in 1716 the current altar of the Immaculate was erected, these frescoes were partially destroyed and occulted behind a wall of bricks. It is possible to distinguish the central part of a figure that wears a dalmatic, which is an attribute of Saint Stephen. A nearly complete figure exists to the left of the altar. This Saint, maybe Paul, has the same frontal presentation of Ambrose, the same graphics in the hair and vests, and the same design in the aureole.  The apsidal basin  This part of the basin is very damaged. The whole inferior zone is crossed by a large fracture and few traces of colour appear. The visible figures are ruined in severl places, and the decorative borders appear to be reworked. 248x248px The big central figure of Christ dominates the whole church, and it is the most important point of doctrinal view. Its right hand is elevated in the gesture of benediction, while the left holds the book with the script: EGO SUM LUX MUNDI VIA VERITAS ET VITA (‚ÄúI am the light of the world, the street, the truth, and the life‚Äù). It is the Christ in Majesty, represented by an iconography typically medieval, that in the Varesotto and in other areas of Lombardy continues to be used until the end of 1400. In the church there is a true angelic concert, structured in overlapping files, making it look like a process of successive works. In the space between the basin and the upper part of the mandorla, the first group of standing angels can be found that hold thuribles. On the left ones it is still possible to read the beginning of the announcement to the pastors: GLORIA IN ECCELSIS DEO ET IN TERRA PAX (‚ÄúGlory to God in the high skies and peace on earth‚Äù). The bodies of these angels are elongated and folded in order to fit the form of the architecture. Very different are the musician angels which are seated directly below. Some of their instruments are recognizable: two little organ, a tambourine, a big flute, different harps of various shapes and other stringed instruments like the rebec, lute and psaltery. These are instruments used to compose an orchestra with a delicate sound. The last visible order is formed again of standing angels. Some play instruments, but most look in the direction of Christ, holding the banners of the Resurrection, with the crosses and borders decorated. The loss of the lower order makes it difficult to evaluate the complex significance of the frescoes of the basin. = The Apostles and Crucifixion = Directly under the basin, there is a series of Apostles, disposed in couples at the side of the Crucifixion. The last one has been deprived of its lower part during renovations to the central window. The lateral windows had to be already present when it was painted as the disposal of the figures takes consideration of their existence. The Apostles that are beside the Crucifixion have been partially mutilated during the course of restoration in order to highlight the two most ancient frescoes, which are the Madonna Enthroned with St. Peter and the Crucifixion of 1368. The presence of the Apostles in this zone of the apse recalls the decoration of numerous other churches of the Varesotto. The painter set the Apostles in a landscape background, and a few ondulated signs may evidence the reflections of water on a lake. The clothes have decorations that do not take into account the arrangement in fold of the fabric. Some of the faces have a frontal presentation, others still have the typologies of the basin. This is the case of Matthew the Apostle, directly to the right of the Crucifixion, of which the face has the same marked contours and the same curved lines in the drawing of the eyes and the hair that distinguish most of the angels. Probably already from 1500, due to the substitution of the tile background to the landscape background. Above the lateral windows that interrupt the series of Apostles, are located two half-length portraits, one female and one male, characterized by a headgear of common use during the 15th century. The two figures are disposed in profile, framed by a white suspended drape decorated with a motive of dark vertical and horizontal lines. Under the windows are faint outlines of additional paintings, although the colour has completely vanished. The frescoes of the lower part of the apse are the most illegible ones due to the fading of colour and the overlap of different layers of plaster. These images, dating from the late XV or early 16th century, may have represented a group of Saints disposed in couples like the Apostles. The represented saints are those who are most loyal and dear, like Saint Stephen, protector against the plague, together with Saint Victor. The clothing and the pose revoke late-gothic elegance, even though the floor suggest from the last quarter of the XV century. Saint Sebastian is not pierced by arrows, but he is limited to holding two darts in his hand, as a sign of identification. Different are Saint Anthony and Saint Bishop. Frontally disposed, nearly twins in the traits of the face, they are painted in the usual chromatic range of ochre, of brick and dark green. These same colours are also found in the floor tiles. = History of The Passion of Christ = On the southern wall next to the Saint Sebastian altar, there are a series of paintings depicting the history of The Passion. The conservation status of these frescoes is precarious, due to the conditions of the masonry and the minimum thickness of the plaster. The six upper paintings were torn in 1963 due to moisture damage. Five of the paintings were restored and reallocated to their original positions. The sixth one is not longer visible. The lower septa paintings are less spotty than the upper ones but have colour drops, damp patch and traces of retouching. The thirteen paintings tell in images the events that the liturgy celebrates in Holy Week. This starts with the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem and continues to the Harrowing of Hell. 417x417px #Triumphal entry into Jerusalem. The painting is damaged on the top. The lower part of the donkey and of the figure of Christ are still recognizable. # Last Supper. The lack of colours does not make it clear that John lays his head on the breast of Jesus. The painter has placed his characters all around the table, adopting a widespread pattern in Lombardy. The diamond floor in the foreground is played on the tones of ochre and green to give an idea of perspective. # Foot washing. It is the best preserved painting of the upper order and introduces some changes compared to most of the current iconography. The apostle kneeling before Christ is not Peter but John. The physiognomy of Peter and his gesture of surprise with his hands raised is attributed to the character on the right side. # Agony in the Garden. The scene is damaged and the characters are barely visible. The characters below are the three sleeping apostles and in the top is Christ with the cruciform halo. # Taking of Christ. A big damp patch on the right side does not prevent the reading of the painting. Is represents a soldier holding a torch and Judas kissing Jesus. # Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. The sixth painting is no longer visible today, and the interpretation is based on following the chronological order of the liturgy. # Christ in front of Pilate. The painting is almost illegible. Christ is at the centre with his hands tied, and is led by Pilate, who is seated under a canopy. # Flagellation of Christ. A large part of this painting has a lack of colors. Christ is tied to a column and sided by two torturers, who are dressed in fifteenth-century costumes. # Christ Going to Calvary. This painting is still very bright. Behind Christ there is a group of armed men carrying the cross. # Crucifixion of Jesus. This painting has faded significantly. There are a lack of colors in the surface and a gap on the right side of the painting. It is the most important scene of the cycle and occupies the central position of the lower paintings. It covers more than twice the space in comparison to the other paintings. The iconography has typical elements of the Lombardian tradition, like the angel and the demon that pick up the robbers souls. # Lamentation of Christ. This painting is corroded over the whole surface and especially on the bottom part. The Grievers are arranged as in a bas-relief and is crushed between the mass of the sepulchre and the cross. # Resurrection of Jesus. The frame is the same of the previous one, but the composition obtain a vertical lush from the figure of Christ. # Harrowing of Hell. This scene is generally found in the most complete cycles of the passion of Jesus. On the upper margin of the thirteenth painting there is an inscription, which is unreadable in some parts: HOC OPUS FECIT FIERI... DE BEXUTIO CANONIC // RESIDENS ISTIUS ... CL ... ABD DE MLO PINXIT (\\"This work was made to performed by... of Besozzo, canon // resident of this (church) ... and painted by Abbondio of Milan\\").  Mythology  According to tradition, the first church in Brebbia, with the name of Santa Maria, was founded around the 5th century by Saint Julius of Novara and his brother Giuliano. They grew up in the region Lake Maggiore and Lake Orta, where there is an island is named after Julius. A legend tells that during the construction of the church a carpenter, that was participating in the construction of the church, accidentally cut off his thumb with an axe and Saint Julius appeared and re-attached the thumb to his hand. It is also known that the reason why Saint Julius and his brother travelled, in the 4th century from the Greek island Aegina, was to evangelize the area around the Lake Orta, and to build the first Christian church, called Basilica of St. Julius built on the St. Julius Island in the Lake Orta. = Minerva's temple = The church was built on an ancient temple dedicated to the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare Minerva, also known as Athena for the Greeks. The legend says that it was St. Julius himself who destroyed the previous existing temple, to establish the dominance of the Christian religion by building a Christian church on the same territory. On the northern side of the church there is a stone with a Roman engraving on it that confirms the past existence of the temple of Minerva. The stone is quite ruined by time, but the following sentence in Latin is still clear to read: This is an example of a Christian church built on top of an ancient Pagan temple. The peculiarity lies in the fact that the substitution of the place, from Pagan to Christian, was highlighted by this epigraph.

Her mother, Vickie Felton, returned home on the morning of August 27, 1992, to find Occhi missing and evidence of blood in the house. Searches in and around Tupelo proved fruitless. On September 9, 1992, Occhi's eyeglasses were mailed to her home in an envelope, addressed to her ex-stepfather; law enforcement deemed this action a ruse to distract detectives in their search efforts. In November 1993, a human skull discovered in a soybean field was erroneously attributed to Occhi, but this link was later retracted and the skull was positively identified as that of an adult woman who had gone missing in an adjacent town. Despite numerous searches, Occhi's whereabouts remain unknown. Her case has received media coverage from Nancy Grace and 20/20, as well as an extensive independently-produced podcast in 2017. Timeline=Background= Leigh Marine Occhi was born August 21, 1979 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Donald Occhi and Vickie Felton, both members of the United States Army. The couple met while serving in California, and married in 1977. The couple eventually divorced in 1981. Donald Occhi relocated to Germany, but remained in contact with his daughter, who visited him there. Occhi resided in the United States with her mother, settling in Tupelo, Mississippi. =Disappearance= On the morning of August 27, 1992, Leigh Occhi, then age 13, was left at her home at 105 Honey Locust Drive in Tupelo, when her mother departed for her job at approximately 8:00 a.m. Occhi had planned to attend an open house at her middle school that day with her grandmother. At the time, Occhi's father resided in Virginia. Shortly after arriving at her office, Felton was notified that a storm related to Hurricane Andrew was headed for Tupelo, and phoned her house to inform her daughter some time before 9:00 a.m. When Occhi failed to answer, Felton became worried and left her job to check on her, driving approximately back to her home. According to Felton, upon returning home, she found the garage door open and the light on; entering the house, she noticed blood smeared on the side of the wall. \\"I started calling for Leigh and going through all the rooms,\\" Felton said. \\"Then I went into her bedroom. Her favorite blanket was crumbled up on the floor and I was very scared.\\" After seeing this, Felton called 9-1-1 at approximately 9:00 a.m. =Investigation=Initial search efforts Upon further inspection of the house, law enforcement found additional pools of blood in Occhi's upstairs bedroom, as well as significant portions smeared in the hallway, bathroom, and on her bedroom door. The blood found in the bathroom indicated to law enforcement that a perpetrator had attempted to clean the scene. Felton claimed that several of her daughter's articles of clothing were missing; inside a laundry hamper in the house, detectives discovered a bloodied nightgown belonging to Occhi. Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre stated: \\"Because it looked like the blood had dripped down onto her nightgown, you would think the injury had to be above the neck possibly.\\" The house showed no signs of forced entry. Immediately following Occhi's disappearance, organized searches were conducted around Tupelo, mainly through wooded areas, but they proved fruitless. Occhi's father, Donald, felt that his daughter \\"was dead the day my ex-wife called me and told me she was missing. My theory is that some bastard beat that child to death in that house.\\" He also stated that, while searching for his daughter in Tupelo in September 1992, he was told by several locals to \\"look at her mother\\"; however, he commented: \\"I already was doing that. I don‚Äôt know if her mother was involved.\\" Additionally, rumors circulated alleging that Occhi's stepfather, Barney Yarboroughwhom her mother had recently separated fromwas abusive toward Occhi. Yarborough was ruled out by law enforcement, however, after providing a substantiated alibi and passing a polygraph examination. Mailing of eyeglasses On September 4, 1992, eight days after Occhi went missing, a worker at a McDonald's in Booneville told law enforcement that they had seen a girl resembling Occhi in a car in the restaurant drive-through; however, the child in question was determined to have been someone else. Five days later, on September 9, a package containing Occhi's glasses was mailed to their residence at Honey Locust Drive, addressed to Yarborough. The package was postmarked from Booneville. After this development, the FBI became involved in the search for Occhi, and performed DNA testing on the stamps adhered to the envelope in which the glasses were mailed. However, it was determined they had been adhered with water rather than saliva. Aguirre stated he felt the glasses were mailed as a distraction: \\"There was no ransom letter or anything like that that came with those glasses. It was just those glasses. You would think if it was an actual kidnapping, you would have expected a little more to come along with that.\\" Erroneous attribution of remains On November 9, 1993, it was reported in the Jackson Clarion-Ledger that a Monroe County coroner had positively confirmed via dental records that a human skull found in a soybean field was that of Occhi. Several days later, however, the identification was retracted. In this retraction, it was stated the state medical examiner would perform further forensic testing on the skull, which had been uncovered by a farmer in a ditch along the soybean field. It was subsequently determined that the skull belonged to 27-year-old Pollyanna Sue Keith, a woman who had gone missing in March 1993. =Subsequent developments= After Yarborough passed his polygraph examination, Felton was administered three separate examinationsone with local law enforcement, and two with the FBI. Independent examiners stated she showed deception on all of them. In 2017, Aguirre stated that Felton was still considered a person of interest: \\"You still can‚Äôt eliminate her. There are still too many unanswered questions for Vickie, and I don‚Äôt know if that is unusual for somebody to go off to work and say, well I just left Leigh but I‚Äôm going to call and check on her. Why check on her that soon after she just left her?\\" Felton disputes that she had any involvement in her daughter's disappearance, and has openly stated that she believes a man named Oscar McKinley ‚ÄúMike‚Äù Kearns was responsible for her daughter's kidnapping. Kearns was convicted in 1999 for kidnapping a couple and raping the woman, and, nine months after Occhi disappeared, kidnapped a ninth-grade girl he had met through a Tupelo church, raping her in Memphis, Tennessee. For the latter crime, Kearns was sentenced to over eight years of incarceration, but served only half of his sentence, and was released in 1997 before committing the kidnapping and rape that resulted in his subsequent conviction. Publicity Occhi's disappearance has been covered by Nancy Grace and was also featured on the Geraldo Rivera Show and 20/20. In 2017, the disappearance was the subject of a six-episode podcast titled 13: The Search for Leigh Occhi.

History Stokes and Pearce originally met in high school, and met both Sinclair and Luketina-Johnston when all four attended classes at the University of Auckland, studying jazz. Prior to The Beths, Luketina-Johnston was performing swing under the moniker of Sal Valentine. Stokes, Pearce and Sinclair were all a part of his backing band, The Babyshakes, for various tenures. The Beths were formed in early 2015, and released their first single \\"Idea/Intent\\" via SoundCloud in July of that year. In March 2016, the band independently released their debut EP, Warm Blood. The EP spawned a single, \\"Whatever,\\" which was released with an accompanying music video in May 2016. A new single, \\"Great No One,\\" was released in October 2017. The song was the first to be lifted from the band's debut album, Future Me Hates Me. Prior to the album's release in 2018, the bands announced their signing to Carpark Records in the US (who also reissued Warm Blood internationally) and to Dew Process in Australia. The album was released globally on 10 August 2018, followed by an international tour supporting the release. The title track was nominated as one of five finalists for the 2018 Silver Scroll award in New Zealand. In 2018, Luketina-Johnston permanently departed from the band to focus on Sal Valentine.

Headquartered in Harare, Telecel Zimbabwe is the third largest mobile telecommunications network service provider in Zimbabwe with the government of Zimbabwe being the major shareholder. Telecel is the first mobile phone network in Zimbabwe to attain ISO 9001: 2000 certification. History Telecel Zimbabwe began operating in 1998. It was formed as a partnership between Telecel International, which is a subsidiary of Cairo- based Orascom Telecom Company, a telecommunications company with operations in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and North America which in turn is owned by telecommunications giant Vimpelcom, and the Empowerment Corporation, which is a consortium of Zimbabwean business organisations. Shareholding Telecel shareholding consists of James Makamba, through Kestrel Corporation, the Indigenous Business Women Organisation, but the shareholding is personalised through Jane Mutasa's Selporn Investments, Zimbabwe Miners‚Äô Federation, Affirmative Action Group, War Veterans‚Äô Association and Zimbabwe Farmers‚Äô Union. Government of Zimbabwe owns 60% shareholding through ZARnet which it bought from Telecel International. At one point the regulatory authority, the Posts and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz), cancelled the company's licence because of the failure to reduce the foreign shareholding. However, the company appealed against this. In 2013 its licence was renewed for a further 20 years but on the understanding that steps would be taken to alter the shareholding. The country's Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act also requires foreign ownership of Zimbabwean companies to be limited to a maximum of 49%, with the remaining 51% being in the hands of indigenous Zimbabweans. The chairman of Telecel Zimbabwe is Dr. James Makamba, who represents the Empowerment Corporation on the board of directors. Network Coverage Telecel's network coverage covers more than 85% of the country, including all its towns, cities and tourist resorts, as well as many smaller centres and rural areas. Products and services Telecel offers voice services as well as 3G data services. Some of the products and services as well as value added services currently on offer include: *Emergency Credit *Teletunes *Telecel Business *Telecel Red *telecash *Roaming *Data Bundles *Voice Bundles *Airtime transfer *Conference calls *Missed call alert *Call me back *Mega Bonus Reloaded *911 Road Assist Telecel launched to its subscribers an electronic wallet service called telecash. telecash, a mobile financial service. Criticisms and Controversies Telecel has come in for criticisms on a number of fronts, mostly due to issues related to its licensing, shareholding structure and use of foreign consultants and suppliers, as well as its slowness in complying with local empowerment legislation. It has also been criticised by one of its competitors for competing in a manner it considers unfair by lowering its prices through various promotions to a level that other networks find difficult to compete with. =Licence= Telecel's licence was renewed in July, 2013 for a 20-year period. Controversy came from the fact that Telecel's shareholding had not yet met the 49% - 51% split in favour of local shareholders as required by Zimbabwe's Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act. Telecel has said it plans to rationalise the shareholding from the current 60% - 40% split in favour of foreign ownership to the minimum requirement of 51% or more in favour of local shareholding. =Employment of foreigners= Telecel has in the past come under criticism in the local Press and from the Affirmative Action Group, an indigenisation lobby group, for making use of the services of expatriates in jobs which, it is argued, could be done by Zimbabweans. There was criticism in particular over the appointment of foreigners to the chief executive post. This criticism died down after, in July 2012, Telecel appointed as chief executive Francis Mawindi, a Zimbabwean chief executive officer who had been previously France Telecom Orange head of business operations for global services in the Americas based in New York, in the United States. There has been criticism too of the secondment of foreigners from Orascom to fill other key positions at Telecel Zimbabwe. Telecel says these are consultants on time-limited contracts whose role in part is to pass on their skills and experience to Zimbabwean personnel. =Dispute between Telecel Zimbabwe and Econet Wireless = In mid-2013 there was a delay in the time between when Telecel's original licence expired and when its new licence was issued. It continued operating during this period. Econet then issued a public statement in which it stated that because Telecel did not hold a current licence it was under no obligation to interconnect it with its network. It went on to point out that it had spent a considerable sum on its licence and suggested that the fact that Telecel had not yet paid its licence fee enabled Telecel to engage in unfair competitive practices. Telecel subsequently obtained its licence and Econet had to interconnect with its network once more. Telecel has argued that the real reason for being disconnected was because Econet was feeling the pressure from Telecel's aggressive promotions which were eating into their market share and to disrupt Telecel's massive subscriber base growth rate. Corporate Social Responsibility Mother Of Peace AIDs orphans Telecel Zimbabwe has a corporate social responsibility programme that is focused on education for children, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or have physical disabilities. Among the children's institutions that receive assistance from Telecel are Jairos Jiri Centre, Ruvimbo School, Sibantubanye Special School, Shungu DzeVana Trust and Mother of Peace orphanage in Mutoko. Telecel has also been involved in providing school furniture and sports equipment for disadvantaged schools throughout Zimbabwe. In addition to assistance for children with disabilities, Telecel also provides ad hoc event-based sponsorships. The most recent ad hoc sponsorship was the lighting of the Victoria Falls bridge in time for the UNWTO General Assembly in August 2013. The general assembly was co-hosted by Zambia and Zimbabwe. In addition to children in need, Telecel sponsors many arts and cultural activities. One notable sponsorship is the Telecel Harare International Festival of Arts (HIFA) Main stage. Telecel also sponsors drag racing, jazz festivals, and the Kariba International Tiger fishing tournament (KITFT).

The festival organizes every 3 years the international Xavier Darasse organ competition in his honor.  Life  Born in Toulouse in a musician family (his mother was an organist), Darasse was a student of Maurice Durufl√©, Rolande Falcinelli, Jean Rivier and Olivier Messiaen at the Conservatoire de Paris. In parallel with his career as a concert organist, he was a professor at the and then at the Conservatoire de Lyon, the organ class being \\"relocated\\" to Toulouse. His repertoire extends from early music to contemporary repertoire. In 1976, after a serious road accident, during which he lost his right arm (which he was successfully transplanted without being able to regain his motor skills), he had to put an end to his career as a concert performer. He then devoted himself to teaching the organ, as well as composition, with among other things \\"Instants √©clat√©s\\" in 1983 for the Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse. He was appointed director of the Conservatoire de Paris in 1991. He died prematurely of cancer in 1992, leaving unfinished an opera adapted from Oscar Wilde's the Picture of Dorian Gray. Darasse listened to the organ in a new way. He favored the breath (continuous or interrupted), the articulated discourse (the importance of touch and digital articulation), and registers and colours (the heritage of his professor of musical analysis, Olivier Messiaen). During his short career, Darasse was one of the most eclectic organists of his generation, sensitive as much to early music, whose mysteries he knew, as to contemporary organ music, of which he was one of the great promoters. He recorded on the organ of the Robert Boisseau organ of the one of the first disks of \\"contemporary\\" organ music in the very late 1960s (works by Luis de Pablo and himself). Very close to Antoine Tisn√© and Iannis Xenakis, he premiered in Germany and France the only work of the latter for organ: Gmeeoorh (1974).

It was built from 1843 to 1846 for Frederick Wright Unwin. It is also known as Unwins. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Frederic Wright Unwin constructed this building between 1843-46. Each tenement of three stories contained dwelling, kitchen and shop. The land on which Unwin's stores now stands was originally part of Sydney's first hospital and gardens. The site of 77 George Street was originally granted to William Carr and George John Rogers by Sir George Gipps in 1838. Land occupied by 79-85 George Street had been granted to John Piper in June 1828 by the Governor of the Colony. Pre-1869 occupants were Raphael (clothier and outfitter), Nom Hing & Co. (merchants), Sun Kung Wor (merchants); 1869 - \\"Brecknock Arms\\" hotel; 1881 - 'Steam Packet Hotel'; 1889 - \\"Pacific Hotel\\". 79 George Street: 1855 - the 'American Hotel'; 1860 - doctors surgery, surgeons Frederick McKeller, Egan Myles, George Hamilton and William Shaw; 1879-98 - Tin War & Co., importers, managed by Tin War and Chin Fook. 81 George Street: 1857 - hairdressers and boarding house; 1867-74 - the \\"Steam Tug and Manly Beach Steamers\\" office; 1880 - 'Plimsoll Hotel'; 1887 - \\"Phoenix Hotel\\". 83 George Street: 1855 - Brockstein & Cohen, watchmakers, jewellers, opticians; 1871-82 - tenants included Mark Burge and Neil Quinn, bootmakers, and the pawnbroker, Duffey; 1887-95 - Post & Telegraph Office (C. L. Tucker, postmaster); 1895-1910 - restaurant managed by Mrs M. A. Dutton. 85 George Street: 1855 - Theodore Matthews, nautical instrument maker; 1861-76 - George Costin, hairdresser and tobacconist; 1876-1900 - tenants included an oilskin maker, outfitter, bootmaker, importers, Sun Yee Lee & Co. and Gee Ick, and restaurateurs F. P. Warner and Mrs E. Archdeacon. The earliest Chinese tenants to lease one of the buildings of the Unwin's Stores were Chinese merchants, Nom, Hing & Co (1861‚Äì63); Nom, Woh & Co (1864 - 66) and Sun Kung Wor (1867‚Äì68) who all leased 81 George Street (equivalent to present day 77 George Street). The next Chinese occupant was Tin War & Co. who leased 79 George Street from 1877 to 1897. In the Sands Directory, they are recorded as \\"Tin War & Co., merchants\\" (1877‚Äì82) and as \\"Tin War and Chin Fook, store keepers\\" (1883‚Äì97). The manager of Tin War & Co., Jasper Ung Quoy, was questioned at the Royal Commission into Chinese Gambling and Immorality. (Gambling Commission: 103ff.) A self-proclaimed respectable businessman, Ung Quoy, had being living in Australia up to 21 years and was the secretary of the Chinese society, Pow on Tong. He claimed to be against gambling and 15 years prior to the Commission's inquiry, he was elected by other respectable businessmen to investigate Chinese gambling in Sydney. However, Quong Tart's clansmen halted his investigations. When questioned about his business, Ung Quoy informed the Commission that Tin War & Co. were importers and acted as agents for the shipping firm E. And A. Company. Tin War & Co. also sold opium without a licence, even though it was illegal for Chinese to sell or import opium. Ung Quoy claimed that all the custom collectors and police knew about it and that Tin War only sold the item in bulk. When questioned whether Tin War & Co. conducted any gambling within its cellar, Ung Quoy responded: ' What do you ask me that for? I am as good as a European'Gambling Commission: 106 and denied any gambling activity when asked again. Other Chinese businesses also leased buildings of the Unwin's Stores while Tin War & Co. operated at 79 George Street for 20 years. Sun, Yee, Lee & Co. leased 85 George Street from 1882 to 1886, except in 1884 when they occupied 83 George Street and 85 George Street was leased to Yee Sung Loong & Co. for one year. Gee Ick & Co., importers, leased 85 George Street from 1888 to 1895 and also opened other branches in Wexford Street, Campbell Street and Hay Street. From 1898 to 1905, there are no listed Chinese occupants in the Unwin's Stores. In 1906, 83 George Street was leased for two years to On War Jang, grocers, and in 1909 the same store was leased to Ping Fong & Co., grocers. In 1913, King Nam Jang, grocers, leased 85 George Street. King Nam Jang was started by Lo King Nam, who as a 16-year-old migrant arrived in NSW from South-east China in 1877. Under the name of Young Cumines, he was one of the earliest successful applicants for naturalisation in 1882, supported by his employers, the Cumines family. His adopted European surname is a family name still used by his descendants today. In the 1880s, Lo King Nam moved to The Rocks and established a providoring business and guesthouse.Lydon 1991: 17; SMH 2002; 30 He raised seven children in The Rocks and at least one of his grandchildren was born in 85 George Street. Lo King Nam returned to China in 1921 and died there in 1939. The well-known business created by Lo King Nam provided fresh food and supplies to ships that were trading between Australia and China.Lydon 1991: 17 It was a business that involved the whole family and they became well known in the Rocks. Dolly Bonnette, a resident in The Rocks since the 1920s, remembers the proprietors as \\"Mr and Mrs King\\" and they were a store that served only to a Chinese clientele. She claimed to often visit the back of the store in Kendall Lane to play with their daughters and their sons would assist the customers.Iacono 1991 Dolly also recalls that King Nam Jang provided temporary accommodation for \\"Anybody that had nowhere to go... or that they were drunk or anything... a shilling a bed for the night\\". She also mentions that at King Nam Jang, they housed newly arrived Chinese men (only men according to Dolly) until they could be sent further inlands to their relatives and usually to work in the market gardens. The men who stayed for a night or for a while longer would walk around the back to Kendall Lane in order to access their accommodation in the basement via ladders. Lydon describes the alterations as 'The basements were closed in and outbuildings were constructed in the rear yards to provide more space'Lydon 1999: 73 Lydon suggests that the act of enclosing themselves and \\"manipulation of their environment\\" was response against white hostility that judged their lifestyle and customs and attempted to assimilate them into European society. Workers of King Nam Jang also had occasional interaction with the Australian government. They were often used as interpreters by the Department of Immigration and during World War II; the NSW Government paid the Cumines family to house Chinese refugees from New Guinea at King Nam Jang.Fitzgerald 1996: 44, 138 However, they were not always seen in a positive light. During World War I, King Nam Jang was suspected of harbouring deserters and stowaways.Fitzgerald 1996: 138 In 1924, Dick King, manager of King Nam Jang, was involved in a suspicious incident of custom officers rivalry. Senior Boarding Officer L.L. Clifford suspended Inspector Donohoe from duty because a packet of electrotype was apparently recovered from one of Donohoe's drawers. In Clifford's report to his superiors, he claimed that the packet read \\"Lam Kee Macao Opium\\" and that it was addressed to \\"King, Nam, Jang, 85 George Street, North\\". Clifford insinuated in his report that Donohoe and King were conspiring to smuggle opium into the country. However a recent translation of the Chinese Characters on the packet indicate that \\"opium\\" is not mentioned at all. King Nam Jang was in business for nearly 90 years when it first began in 1913. Lo King Nam's descendants are involved and well known within the Australian Chinese community. Henry Cumines, Lo King Nam's grandson, was born in 85 George Street in 1921 and would help out in the store.Smith 1990: 14 - 15 He went on to become a successful businessman and ran an export company in the Pacific Islands. Henry died in 2002. Kong Chong, owner of a Chinese laundry, leased 81 George Street in 1917. The business was listed to the end of the Sand's Directory except in 1923 where Abraham Chernow, a second hand dealer, was listed as the occupant. *Archaeological History 77-79 - Lease to William BalmainAR033-036; AR044-045; AR145; AR149 by 1800.

Description  Unwin's Stores comprise a row of sandstone commercial buildings, originally with residences over, fronting George Street. These five sandstone buildings, originally built as shops and dwellings, were erected by Frederic Wright Unwin between 1843 and 1846. They were constructed during a depression in the Colony's economy, in the decade prior to the discovery of gold. Thus, their architectural style reflects not only the prevailing style, Colonial Georgian, but also the relative austerity of the area during this period.See also: 4500096 Style: Georgian; Storeys: Three plus basement; Facade: Sandstone; Roof Cladding: Corrugated iron (Coachhouse [south section]: slate roof); Shingles (originally); Floor Frame: Timber (hardwood).

Heritage listing  As at 1 April 2011, the Unwin's Stores and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The row of buildings known as Unwin's Stores makes an important contribution to the outstandingly well-preserved group of nineteenth century shops which comprise the George Street North streetscape. They provide evidence of the city's maritime and business development on Sydney's main thoroughfare in the second and third quarters of the nineteenth century, and had a central location and role in this development. Their uses include a mixture of storage and the operation of a range of maritime businesses, residences, public houses and other small businesses characteristics of the area. The buildings illustrate the layout and nature of the early commercial area in terms of form, scale, materials and detailing. Despite modification, the buildings demonstrate the early subdivision in 1841 by Frederic Unwin, and the use of space demanded by urbanization. They demonstrate the scale and use of the city in the 19th century. A great deal of the original 1840s fabric survives and the surviving structures above and to a lesser extent, below ground offer physical evidence of more than a century and a half of use. Unwin's Stores constitute a continuing resource for investigation and public interpretation, demonstrating the \\"realities of inner-city working class life in the 19th century\\". The buildings and associated garden walls demonstrate construction methods used in the 1840s. The site offers evidence which potentially contributes to a range of research themes, particularly the economic, political, social and physical development of the first urban settlement in Australia. The Unwin's Stores should be considered of high local significance in regards to Chinese Australian heritage as it has had long-term Chinese occupation since 1861. The location of the stores, being situated within the vicinity of Circular Quay and The Rock's Chinatown, has made it to be considered by Chinese merchants as a prime position for conducting business. One of the businesses to occupy a building of the Unwin's Stores was Tin War & Co. from 1877 to 1897. Tin War's manager, Jasper Ung Quoy, was one of the witnesses called upon in the Royal Commission against Chinese Gambling and Immorality. Another well-known business was King Nam Jang, which was owned and run by the Cumines family, who at present day have up to five generations that has lived in Australia. The buildings' associations with the first hospital and the Surgeon-General's Residence, with F W Unwin, with the Chinese community, with the early development of Sydney Cove and the development of Sydney's first commercial area are all significant. The continuity of small- scale commercial use up to the present day is significant. Unwin's Stores was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This building is probably the longest continuously occupied row of shops in Australia. The yards portray the early subdivision in 1841 by F W Unwin. There is an important association with this very historic precinct of Sydney, in particular George Street, The Rocks. The Unwin's Stores should be considered to be of high historical significance in regards to Australian Chinese heritage. This is due to the long-term Chinese occupation recorded for different buildings of the Unwin's Stores. The first Chinese tenants to lease one of the stores were in 1861. Its location near Circular Quay and The Rock's Chinatown made the Unwin's Stores a favourable position to conduct business to a Chinese clientele and ships docking in Sydney. While little is known about majority of the tenants, others such as Jasper Ung Quoy and the Cumines family are better known and documented. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Unwin's Stores should be considered of high local significance in regards to Chinese Australian heritage as it has had long-term Chinese occupation since 1861. The location of the stores, being situated within the vicinity of Circular Quay and The Rock's Chinatown, has made it to be considered by Chinese merchants as a prime position for conducting business. One of the businesses to occupy a building of the Unwin's Stores was Tin War & Co. from 1877 to 1897. Tin War's manager, Jasper Ung Quoy, was one of the witnesses called upon in the Royal Commission against Chinese Gambling and Immorality. Another well-known business was King Nam Jang, which was owned and run by the Cumines family, who at present day have up to five generations that has lived in Australia. The Unwin's Stores can be considered to have high historical association significance with Jasper Ung Quoy. Ung Quoy was the manager of Tin War & Chin Fook (79 George Street) and his testimony at the Royal Commission into Chinese Gambling and Immorality provides some insight into the Chinese - European relationship in Australia at the turn of the century. He was an advocate for the prohibition of gambling although when trying to fight it, he himself came across obstacles in his investigation. When questioned by the Royal Commission whether Tin War offered any gambling in its basements, his outburst about being \\"as good as a European\\" demonstrates that it was not enough for Chinese to be honest and hard-working but also necessary for them to be assimilated into European culture to be consider of high moral standing. 85 George Street also has high historical association significance with the Cumines family. Lo King Nam began leasing the building in 1913 and King Nam Jang became the home and birthplace for family members. Older residents of The Rocks recalled their business and their services as either an interpreter or guesthouse was employed by the government. The enclosed nature of their basement and the decision to cater only to a Chinese clientele further demonstrate the hostility felt by the Chinese migrants from the European community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The courtyards illustrate clearly the usage of the rear yards in connection with the early commercial buildings, i.e. the construction of cellars, fireplaces, stores, and covered ways. The treatment of the original and later fabric used in the construction, i.e. rough coursed stonework and stretcher bond brickwork. It conveys the typical spatial areas to the rear yards of the buildings in commercial precincts in terms of form, scale, materials and detailing. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The association with Frederic W Unwin and precinct of Surgeon General's residence . The association with the early development of Sydney Cove. The Unwin's Stores are of high social significance to the Australian Chinese community. Its buildings represent a long-term occupation by Chinese migrants since 1861. The alternations of 85 George Street's rear yard remembered by Dolly Bonnette demonstrate the difficult process of social acceptance of the Chinese neighbour by the European community. 85 George Street hold high social significance for the Cumines Family and perhaps also to the Chinese migrants and World War II refugees who were housed at King Nam Jang temporarily. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The courtyards portray the early method of construction in stonework of cellars and boundary walls, and brickwork of stores, W.C. Later methods of alterations and additions are shown by building off the original walls, rather than rebuilding. Jane Lydon conducted an archaeological investigation of the rear of the Unwin's Stores in 1991, however, the rear yards of 83 and 85 George Street were not a part of the excavation. From the 1991 excavation, only a small amount of Chinese objects were recovered from the phases of Chinese occupation. Any possible future construction in the rear yards of the Unwin's Stores, specifically 85 George Street has the potential to yield Chinese artefacts and to contribute to the current research on Chinese in the Rocks and NSW. The Cumines Family, along with other member of the Australian Chinese community such as Allen Yip often do presentations on their predecessor's experience of early Sydney and Australia. With the assistance from these members of Australian Chinese community there is potential for further and more intimate research to be conducted on the Chinese migratory experience to the existing body of work. Recent publication on Chinese within Sydney include Shirley Fitzgerald's' Red Tape, Gold Scissors' and Jane Lydon's 'Many Inventions: The Chinese in The Rocks 1890-1930.' The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The continual Chinese occupation of a building can be considered quite rare within Sydney, as witnessed in 85 George Street by King Nam Jang. Another site of continual Chinese occupation is 50 - 54 Dixon Street, Haymarket, which has been owned by Goon Yee Tong, Loon Yee Tong and Luen Fook Tong societies since 1917 and rooms of this building have been used as their clubrooms up to the present day. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Unwin's Stores can be considered to be representative of long-term occupation of a building or set of buildings for Chinese business.

By the mid-twentieth century, he was perceived to be a powerful man whose wealth was amassed through his relationship with the spirits from the water, known in Xhosa as ooMam‚ÄôMlambo. Little material evidence attests to his supernatural powers, with only oral accounts available to describe his talents. What was widely known amongst black South Africans at the time was that he was a millionaire with 23 wives and had an expansive clientele that included J.G. Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd.  Upbringing  Sethuntsa was born in Ha Ramokakatlela, a remote village in Lesotho. He relocated to Kokstad in the 1920s. Little is known about Sethuntsa‚Äôs upbringing, but he claimed that his parents worked on Paul Kruger‚Äôs farm, with his father working as Kruger‚Äôs coachman. It was widely known that Sethuntsa held a deep reverence for Paul Kruger, the South African Republic‚Äôs first president. To this day, statues of Paul Kruger can be found at Sethuntsa‚Äôs compound in Mount Nelson, Lusikisiki. He claimed to have discovered Paul Kruger‚Äôs lost treasure chest rumoured to be worth millions, a substantial contributor to his wealthy lifestyle.  Rise to fame  While he was still working as a young farm worker, Sethuntsa got into a dispute with the farm owner. As a result the farm owner punished him. A tornado struck the farm, resulting in the destruction of the farm owner‚Äôs house. Khotso claimed responsibility for this, a story that also appeared in ‚ÄòThe Kokstad Advertiser‚Äô newspaper. As a result of this event, his fame and legend as a powerful medicine man began to grow. It was believed that Sethuntsa enjoyed a relationship with the ‚Äòspirits of the water‚Äô, known in Xhosa as abantu bomlambo. These were believed to be two different snakes that Sethuntsa communed with; inkanyambo which was believed to provide good health, luck and prosperity while mamlambo had the ability to shapeshift into a beautiful yet dangerous serpentine mermaid that could provide power and wealth. These ‚Äúspirits‚Äù inspired a procedure known as ukuthwala that was meant to result in extreme wealth for Sethuntsa‚Äôs clients. Ukuthwala in southern African traditional beliefs is often associated with the act compromising your soul and/or human relationships in order to gain wealth. Locals in Kokstad and Pondoland both feared and loathed Sethuntsa for his perceived power. Every year Sethuntsa celebrated Kruger Day by holding a massive feast. His connection to Kruger was so deep that he told people that he had conversations with Paul Kruger in his dreams. It was also believed that Paul Kruger was the one who told Sethuntsa which horses to bet on in the Durban July Handicap Horse Races. Sethuntsa won the Durban July three years in a row from 1954 to 1956. Sethuntsa was also famous for purchasing luxury Cadillacs with a suitcase full of cash every year at the Kokstad Agricultural Show.  Political ties  Sethuntsa had relationships with key Nationalist Party leaders, including D. F. Malan, J. G. Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd. He was known to be a supporter of the separate development policies that gave way to the apartheid system in 1948. On eve of the 1948 elections, it is believed that Verwoerd, who was still the minister of Bantu Affairs, held a secret meeting with Sethuntsa, where Verwoerd was given special muti by Sethuntsa that would deliver the elections to the Nationalist Party. The counter narrative was that Sethuntsa enjoyed close ties with Verwoerd and the Nationalist Party because he was the Broederbond‚Äôs intelligence agent within the Tranksei region. Sethuntsa was forcibly removed from his palace in Kokstad due to the Bantu-Self Government Act under new apartheid legislation that came into effect in 1957. He was relocated to Lusikisiki.  International acclaim  By the mid-1960s Sethuntsa was reported to have amassed a lot of wealth, with nine houses and 16 farms under his name.\\"Transkei muti millionaire now exporter\\" ‚ÄòThe Rand Daily Mail‚Äô. Word of his special gifts reached as far as the United States, with African-Americans writing to him in search of charms and medicines that may assist in alleviating their health problems.  Death  Sethuntsa died in Durban at the age of 74 due to heart failure.

It is thought to have been built in 78 or 79 CE by a relative of the Emesan dynasty. The remains of the mausoleum were blown up with dynamite by the Ottoman authorities 1911, in order to make room for an oil depot. According to Andreas Kropp, the monument may be considered to have been a \\"hybrid creation\\" and a \\"fascinating one-off experiment\\" that resulted from \\"the cultural choices which the ruling class of Emesa had to face when attempting to reconcile Roman allegiance and Near Eastern tradition.\\" Location Inner view, 1907 In the 18th century, Richard Pococke described the monument as standing \\"about a furlong to the west\\" of what is now the Old City of Homs. The mausoleum was near the train station that exists now. The greater part of the necropolis of Emesa was made to disappear by 1952 in order to build the municipal stadium known today as Khalid ibn al-Walid Stadium, after excavations begun in August 1936 had uncovered a total of 22 tombs.. Owner C≈ìnotaphe de Caius C√¶sar drawn by right In the 16th century, Pierre Belon described a monument that was inscribed with the Greek letters of an epitaph of \\"Caius C√¶≈øar\\" ‚Äì which may have made it a cenotaph of Caius Julius Caesar Vipsanianus. It is however believed that Belon misread the inscription from this monument. Pietro Della Valle found in the inscription a ŒìŒëŒôŒ© ŒôŒüŒ•ŒõŒôŒ©, but not \\"Caesar\\"; later Pococke, who made the first summary drawing of the mausoleum, found that \\"on the ea≈øtern side the fir≈øt word is ŒìŒëŒôŒüœπ\\". Louis-Fran√ßois Cassas' reproduction of an inscription bearing the name \\"CAIUS C√ÜSAR\\" on plate 23 of Voyage pittoresque de la Syrie, published 1799, is considered to have been a fantasy of the artist. In the 19th century, William Henry Waddington copied a Greek inscription said to have belonged to the monument and a copy of the latter by Dr. Skender Effendi (hereafter reproduced with the characters Œï, Œû and Œ©): Carlos Chad has given the following translation of the inscription reconstituted by Waddington: \\"Caius Julius Sampsig√©ram, de la tribu Fabia, dit Seilas, fils de Caius Julius Alexion, a construit de son vivant ce tombeau, pour lui-m√™me et les siens, l'an 390 [of the Seleucids]\\", id est in 78 or 79 CE. The builder of the mausoleum may have been related to the Emesan dynasty through Gaius Julius Alexion. According to Maurice Sartre, the owner's Roman citizenship, attested by his tria nomina, strongly supports relatedness to the royal family. The lack of allusion to royal kinship is best explained if the dynasty had been deprived of its kingdom shortly before the mausoleum was built and the said kingdom had been annexed to the Roman province of Syria, which occurred very likely between 72 and the construction of the mausoleum. As worded by Kropp, \\"what the builder was really keen on stressing is that he was a Roman citizen bearing the tria nomina.\\" Architecture Upon completion, the monument was about 25 meters high and, as worded by Kropp, \\"retained the basic formal characteristics of a traditional nefesh, i.e. a pyramidal stele, albeit on an immense scale\\", comparable with those of Kamouh el Hermel (in Lebanon) and the Tomb of Hamrath at Suwayda (also destroyed). The outer walls and the roof were conceived in opus reticulatum, which is considered a rarity in the Orient, following a purely Roman construction technique using concrete which certainly necessitated the intervention of workers of Italian origin or having undergone a specific training. It was also unusual that opus reticulatum not be covered by stucco; according to Kropp, Sampsigeramus may have ordered to leave it visible as a statement that he was \\"on good terms with the rulers of the world, that is the Roman people and in particular with the Roman emperor\\".

Early life  Jean Lennox Bird was born in Hong Kong on 8 July 1912, the second daughter of Lt Col. Lennox Godfrey Bird, an architect who designed several buildings in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Her father retired in 1935, and the family returned home, eventually settling at the Old Farm, in Beech, near Alton, Hampshire England. Bird started flying at the age of eighteen and took lessons, alongside her father, at the Hampshire Aeroplane Club in Hamble, during a visit home. Both qualified on 2 October 1930. War-service By the time Second World War broke out in 1939 Bird was an experienced pilot. She was commissioned into the Women‚Äôs Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as Assistant Section Officer (ASO) in 1940 and remained there for a year until invited to join the ATA. Bird joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) on 1 August 1941 and soon qualified as a First Officer. The aircraft she ferried included: Hurricanes, Spitfires, Wellingtons, Beaufighters, Mosquitos and Dakotas. She served with the ATA until the organisation closed down at the end of the war, on 30 November 1945. Post-war In 1946, Bird piloted a single-engine air taxi from Durban, South Africa to Britain to help a young bride attend her wedding in Croydon.Anne Grant, \\"Women Pilots of the Solent\\", SolentAviatrix In September 1949 Bird was commissioned into the Women's RAF Volunteer Reserve (WRAFVR), as a Pilot Officer, as were a number of the ATA women pilots. During their 5-year commissions, several women took up the opportunity to become fully qualified RAF pilots and Bird duly became the first woman ever to wear the brevet of an RAF Pilot: the 'Wings'. She was awarded her wings, amid some publicity, at Redhill Aerodrome on 20 September 1952. By the time she qualified, Bird had 3,000 hours in more than 90 different types of aircraft. The next target was to gain membership of the all-male RAF Club in Piccadilly. Pilot Officer Bird's application was apparently successful, but membership was rejected when this officer's gender was discovered. When the force was re-established during the Cold War, Bird then became a member, from December 1955, of the 3rd Hants (Alton) Battalion of the Home Guard, one of 16 women to do so. She also worked with the Women‚Äôs Junior Air Corps, training young women to fly, and was also a glider pilot. The Meridian Air Maps Miles Aerovan Bird's main occupation in the 1950s was in the developing field of photographic aerial survey, working for Meridian Air Maps. On 29 April 1957, she was surveying the proposed route of a new road, when her 'Aerovan' twin-engined freight plane crashed and she was killed. The coroner's verdict was accidental death, although evidence was given that the aircraft had been fitted with an incorrect spare part. Bird is commemorated by the Jean Lennox Bird Trophy of the British Women Pilots‚Äô Association. This Chinese antique, a carving in jade to recall her early flying-days in Hong Kong, is awarded annually to a British woman pilot who has also made a noteworthy contribution to aviation. First five Jean Bird, Benedetta Willis, Jackie Moggridge, Freydis Leaf and Joan Hughes were the first five women to be awarded their wings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MEeNqq48_E The next to gain wings was Julie Ann Gibson in 1991.

The vehicle was envisioned by Mendeleev during his time working at the Kronshtadt Marine Engineering School in Saint Petersburg, Russia, from 1911 to 1915. Its purported purpose was to be a \\"landship\\" immune to all enemy fire and able to cross large battlefields while providing heavy artillery support to troops using a 120 mm gun. The proposed tank was one of the heaviest tank designs of all time; at 173.2 tons it would have been nearly the same weight as the World War II German Panzer VIII Maus superheavy tank.  Design  The Mendeleev Tank was of a complete rectangular construction, with its main gun at the front, a machine gun turret mounted to the roof just aft of the middle and tracks protruding directly from the bottom of the hull. The tank was supposed to have a crew of eight operating it. = Armament = The Mendeleev Tank was exceptionally well armed for tank design concept at its time. It was slated to have a Canet naval gun with 51 rounds of ammunition, mounted directly at the front of the tank,much larger than the common calibres of tanks in both World War I and World War II. For comparison, the armament of the British Mark IV tank was two 57 mm QF 6-pounder 6 cwt Hotchkiss guns. The gun was able to swivel left and right as well as elevate and depress. In addition, the gun was supposed to feature a recoil system rather than be placed on a fixed rigid mount, a concept very advanced for the time. The Canet gun would be used to provide direct artillery fire against enemy units, making the Mendeleev Tank essentially a mobile artillery platform. The tank was also equipped with a light machine gun installed in a turret that was rotatable as well as being able to be retracted when not in use to lower the silhouette of the vehicle. = Propulsion = Mendeleev designed a novel form of tracked propulsion of the vehicle that differed vastly from other designs of the time. His plans for the vehicle featured a continuous track whose circumference enveloped the entire side of the vehicle. The advanced part of this design was the use of a pneumatic piston suspension that allowed the individual road wheels to be lowered or elevated to a desired height. This would've allowed for very stable traversal of rough or uneven terrain as well as Mendeleev's idea of allowing the tank to completely lower the hull onto the ground, turning the tank into a mobile fortress that could bunker down when need be, protecting the most vulnerable area of the vehicle; the running gear. This feature also was supposed to combine with a special device which could move it on rails, where it could even move by its own, or with the aid of a locomotive. To propel the vehicle, the Mendeleev tank was supposed to use a petrol gasoline engine from a submarine with 250 horsepower, giving the 173.2 ton vehicle a power to weight ratio of 1.44 hp/t. The vehicle was supposed to be able to reach a maximum speed of 24 km/h, though whether this would be achievable in actuality is unknown. = Protection = The Mendeleev tank featured extremely heavy armour for a vehicle of its time, with armour made from heavy steel plating that likes of which were found on warships that ranged from 150 mm thick at the front to 100 mm thick around the sides and rear. In comparison, tanks in WWI were armoured only for protection from rifle fire and machine guns having maximum armour thickness of 30 mm on the German A7V 30 mm, while the far more numerous British Mark IV had armour 12 mm thick. The planned armour of the Mendeleev was thicker than found in WWII such as the formidable German Tiger II heavy tank which had around 150 mm of armour at the front. The Mendeleev's exceptional protection came at the cost of weight, with the tank weighing in at 173.2 tons, making it even heavier than the German K-Wagen, a similar superheavy tank design that almost saw fruition.  History  The initial design is thought to date back to as early as 1898. It was worked upon in 1911, and presented in 1916. However, the vehicle was never constructed due to the little support it received by backers or the government. Mendeleev even attempted to construct the vehicle himself, but it was never started, causing the design to remain as only a series of plans and drawings.

Samuels was born in Kingston upon Hull and spent time in the United States. He moved to London in 1885, where he joined the Socialist League, and was involved in riots in the West End of London the following year. Samuels gradually came to prominence in the Socialist League. In 1889, he was elected to its council, and represented the party at an anarchist congress in Paris. Later in the year, he spent time in Leeds, attempting to organise Jewish workers in the clothing trade. David Nicholl, editor of the Socialist League's newspaper, Commonweal, was imprisoned in 1892. The following May, Samuels worked with Thomas Cantwell, Joseph Presburg, Carl Quinn, John Turner and Ernest Young to relaunch the paper, with funding from Max Nettlau and Fauset Macdonald. Samuels was appointed as its editor. In the role, he championed attacks on property, and saw every theft as a weakening of government authority. Samuels also called for attacks on employers, and praised a bombing at the Liceo Theatre in Barcelona, which killed thirty people. These writings prompted frequent public criticisms, including some made in the House of Commons, which Samuels reprinted in Commonweal, but Samuels was not arrested and no attempt was made to stop his activities. Samuels' praise for indiscriminate violence led to increasing criticism from other anarchists. Nicholl, who had been released in September 1893, was a leading critic, claiming that Samuels was a spy for the police, or a puppet of one. From December 1893, Samuels began moderating his language, and he won re-election as editor of the Commonweal at the end of the month, defeating Nicholl. That month, he also attended a congress of the Scottish Labour Party, and was permitted to make a short speech. He was impressed by the organisation, and particularly by its leader, Keir Hardie. Commonweal soon closed, and Samuels devoted his time to supporting unemployed workers. In 1895, he joined Hardie's new organisation, the Independent Labour Party, and he won election to its London Executive Committee.

A Black nor'easter is a persistent and potentially violent north-easterly storm that occurs on the east coast of Australia during spring and summer, usually about two days a year. It is not a convection wind, but a storm system that develops offshore which can last several days. This is heralded by the rapid build-up of dense black cloud that can convert to a gale in well under one hour, and also bringing with it a heavy rainfall event usually accompanied by a thunderstorm. This type of storm was first recorded during the 1800s. Background Northeasterly sea breezes are a common occurrence on the NSW coast during summer, generated by temperature imbalances between the sea and the land. A broader synoptic pattern however can greatly intensify these onshore winds, which results in a \\"Black Nor'easter\\", so-named because of its dark grey to virtually black clouds and the moist gale force winds (around 60 kilometres per hour) brought on by intense high-pressure systems, thus eventually bringing thunderstorms, dramatic rainfall and at times hail.Stormageddon Reporter: Anja Taylor. ABC News Australia. Tuesday, 19 July 2016 =Formation= On a hot sunny day in Sydney, the land heats up rapidly during the morning. The prevailing early morning wind is a light south-west offshore breeze (a katabatic wind) that blows from land to sea, but as the land heats up a north-east convection wind develops. A typical sea breeze, it starts shortly after sunrise on the coast and gradually pushes inland as the day proceeds, typically reaching the city by mid to late morning and the Greater Western Sydney area by early to mid afternoon. Though it doesn't dramatically decrease the temperatures as the southerly buster does, it would bring heavy rain, thunder and even hail at times. Referred as an anticyclone intensification, the nor'easter causes a sharp leap in wave heights from the east-northeast for the east coast, conjuring a strong north-east air current and east-north east storm waves over the western Tasman Sea. The winds ofttimes produce large waves and, when combined with an east coast low, they bring forth the most intense storm wave environment. The north-east wind field leading warm moist tropical air to the subtropics and mid-latitudes can combine with a higher level cut off low from the Southern Ocean. Incidents Due to the strong winds caused by the Black Nor'easterly storms, a number of people in New South Wales (especially in Sydney) have been killed by falling trees.Man killed by falling tree in Federal as wild weather lashes northern NSW by By Donna Harper - ABC NewsSydney storm: Man killed after tree falls on moving car by BBC NewsMan dies when tree falls on moving car in Sydney during wild storm by The Guardian Furthermore, such storms also bring torrential floods, strike down power lines (where thousands of homes and businesses would be left without electricity) and collapse roofs. Notable storms In February 2010, Sydney received some of the highest and heaviest rainfalls in 25 years which were accompanied by violent thunderstorms and gusty winds that cut out power and damaged homes. The heavy rain was caused by remnants of ex- tropical Cyclone Olga and by a massive amount of moisture blowing in on north- east winds which slammed into a low pressure trough.

Bridges, piers, and walkways were felled as well. Almost every north facing beach endured some level of erosion, from unsophisticated scouring of the foredune to waves devouring into the brown dirt.

Since they were juveniles, the teens weren't arrested, but were instead told that they would have to surrender to the police by 10PM that day. Kyle Anger, the mastermind behind the crime, reportedly attended church that day and had dinner at a restaurant with his family before surrendering to the police. All of the teens surrendered to the police by 8PM that day.https://www.theday.com/article/20171024/nws13/171029623 =Victim= The victim, 32-year-old Kenneth White, was seated in the passenger seat. White, a construction worker, was riding with a co-worker. The rock fractured his skull, chest, and caused other facial injuries. He left behind his fianc√©e and four children, the youngest being five years old. =Trial and convictions= The teenagers throwing rocks that night were arrested and charged with second- degree murder. Four of the five teenagers, who were part of the group throwing rocks at cars driving on Interstate 75 that night accepted plea deals to a reduced charge of manslaughter. In 2019, the judge rejected a request that they be sentenced as juveniles and ordered that the four be sentenced as adults. The individual who threw the rock that killed White (Kyle Anger) pled guilty to second degree murder. He received a sentence of 3 years to 20 years in prison, with credit for 740 days already served. Ohio rock throwing death Marquise Byrd, 22, a resident of Warren, Michigan, was killed on Interstate 75 near Toledo, Ohio when four teenagers dropped a sandbag from a bridge onto the car in which he was a passenger. The boys were crossing the highway on a bridge when they noticed rocks lying on the bridge, and decided to throw them at passing cars, and also threw two sandbags, running away when the second sandbag made a loud sound as it hit a vehicle. After Byrd's death, one of the teenagers, a thirteen-year-old, confessed to throwing the sandbag that killed Byrd. Press reports compared Byrd's death to the death of Kenneth White two months earlier on the same interstate highway. =Victim= The victim, 22-year-old Marquise Byrd, was seated in the passenger seat. =Legal proceedings= The judge in the case, Denise Navarre Cubbon, initially sentenced the four teenagers to serve time at the Department of Youth Services. She sentenced three of the teenagers (14 at the time of the killing) to serve terms of four years, and for the thirteen-year-old throwing the sandbag to serve until he turned 21. However, she suspended those sentences in favor of brief terms in the Lucas County Youth Treatment Center in the hope that clemency would prepare them to go on to lead productive lives. =Impact= As a result of this crime, fencing was installed along the overpass from which the sandbag was thrown to prevent future attacks. Furthermore, Ohio began to require fencing on highway overpasses to prevent deaths and injuries caused by youths throwing rocks at vehicles.

From the 1860s to the October Revolution of 1917, the house was the residence of the local Governor. During the Soviet era, it was initially the headquarters of the Ufa Soviet, and was later occupied by medical institutions. Since 1999, it has housed the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Bashkortostan. History The building that was to become the Governor's House was commissioned by a private resident of Ufa. A project of local architect A. A. Gopius, it was designed along the lines of the earlier neoclassical style of Andreyan Zakharov or William Heste. Construction of the house began in 1832, and by 1838 the building work had been largely concluded. However, the house then stood without a roof for a long time until it was finally completed in 1849‚Äì50. The house's completion also brought to an end the development of Ufa's Cathedral Square, an integrated neoclassical urban ensemble. According to a plan devised by William Heste, the Square evolved to become Ufa's entire administrative centre, consisting of the Government Offices (1839), Male Gymnasium (1830s), (1827), and, most importantly, the . In 1859, the house was purchased by the Treasury for official use as a Governor's residence. Its first gubernatorial inhabitant was , son of the famous writer Ivan Aksakov. From 1861, Grigory Aksakov was first civil Governor of Orenburg Governorate, of which Ufa was the provincial city, and in May 1865, he became the head of the newly formed Ufa Governorate. At the turn of the twentieth century, the life of the Governor's House could be summarised, predictably, as: \\"Breakfasts in the dining room, evening parties by the fireside, theatre plays in the hall.\\" The building was also occupied by a range of committees and societies. In 1904, the first post office boxes were installed in Ufa; Box No. 1 was installed nearby. After the October Revolution of 1917, the Ufa Council (Soviet) of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies and the provincial revolutionary committee moved in. On 1 May 1918, Gubernatorskaya Street was renamed as Sovetskaya Street, and the house became the \\"House of Soviets\\". By the mid 1920s, however, the building had come to be occupied by medical institutions; it later housed the general dispensary, emergency station and polyclinic. During the 1990s, the building was reconstructed, and unfortunately the main staircase and many interior and exterior details were lost: so, e.g., the columns of the main fa√ßade were deprived of their Ionic order capitals. Since 1999, the building has housed the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Bashkortostan. Architecture The building stands out among Ufa's buildings for its simplicity and proportion of forms. Its main fa√ßade, fronting Sovetskaya Street, is a symmetrical composition, decorated with cast-iron cast dragons that served as brackets for street lamps. At the centre of the facade is an avant-corps with four Ionic columns, and a triangular pediment. The site of the Governor's House slopes downwards from Sovetskaya Street at its western end. The basement facing that street becomes the ground floor of the building as it extends to the east along Tukayeva Street, where that floor is notable for the austerity and rigour of its rustic design. Also facing Tukayeva Street is the entrance to the building, which is sheltered by a large cast-iron decorative canopy. The two floors above that level face both streets, and are more elegant, with decorative mouldings and, on the top floor, arched windows. Initially, the house's interior configuration was that of a residential building: the main floor, at the Sovetskaya Street level, featured a drawing room, study and a hall, with the bedroom located in the mezzanine. Below that level were the kitchen, laundry and other utility rooms. At the time the house became the Governor's residence, the city lacked a theatre building, and therefore the house also featured a stage with decorations, boxes and even green rooms. Later, an office and a two-story gallery were attached to the eastern end of the house, and its interior was reconstructed.

Since 2015, this feature has been legally required in California for smartphones. A number of initiatives have been created around this aim, for example Secure Our Smartphones (S.O.S.), a New York State and San Francisco initiative started by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. The initiative is co-chaired by Schneiderman, Gasc√≥n and Boris Johnson, and has 105 members. Background and implementation  Smartphones are expensive devices with high resale value, and are therefore often the target of theft, with thieves selling them to cartels for resale. One attempt to address this is a \\"kill switch\\" which would deter theft. In the United States, Minnesota was the first state to pass a bill requiring smartphones to have such a feature, and California was the first to require that the feature be turned on by default. The California law requires the kill switch to be resistant to reinstallation of the phone's operating system. The CTIA initially resisted the legislation, fearing that it would make phones easier to hack, but later supported kill switches. There is evidence that this legislation has been effective, with smartphone theft declining by 50% between 2013 and 2017 in San Francisco.

The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was followed by yet another change in perspective. The physical encounter broadened the hitherto theoretical confrontation with the art and culture of Eastern Europe. Friendship developed with representatives of the local avant-garde of the time, such as Boris Groys, IRWIN, Andrei Filippov, Yuri Albert, Vadim Zahkarov and Luchezar Boyadjiev. Curatorial projects and lectures consolidated Oroschakoff's reputation as expert in the East-West art dialogue: Kr√§ftemessen (Munich 1994) with Margarita Tupitsyn, Boris Groys and Viktor Misiano; Bulgariaavantgarde (Munich 1998) with Iara Boubnova; 4th Internationale (Almaty 1998) with Yerbossyn Meldibekov and Kanat Ibragimov.Andrew Solomon, \\"Works from the Underground.

Clark is best known for his book The Real Toy Story, which examines the world toy market and the battle companies have to win over consumers. During his career he wrote several books in both the fiction and non-fiction sectors that have been published in over 20 countries (LINK). His works included thrillers, documentaries, magazine, and newspaper articles. In the 1960s, Clark wrote a series of articles that appeared in the Observer, focusing on American Mafia's infiltration of London's casinos.These articles were credited for the changes that were made to the UK's gambling laws.Society of Authors obituary, 3 November 2018 One of Clark's espionage novels, The Sleeper, was described by Kirkus Reviews as 'mind-lingering entertainment that boosts Clark high up in the stark, lean, British-suspense echelons.'Kirkus Review of The Sleeper, 1 March 1980 Life and Family Clark was born to father, Horace, and mother, Hilda, on 29 July 1937 in Moseley, Birmingham, England. His father was a 'working class' television engineer and his mother was a housewife. After studying at Handsworth Grammar School, Clark flew to Spain with the desire to be the next Hemingway. He had the ambition to write from a young age and wrote his first (unpublished) novel when he was 16.Robert Chesshyre, Eric Clark obituary, Guardian, 19 November 2019 He then started his career in journalism, making his mark as a reporter before continuing as a fine writer of multiple different topics. In 1958, Clark married Frances Grant, however, it later ended in divorce. In 1972, Clark married Marcelle Bernstein. Together they had three children, Rachael, Charlotte and Daniel. He also has 4 grandchildren, Madeleine, Cecilia, Tabitha and Iris. Together, Clark and Bernstein decided to become freelance writers, and earned their living as self-employed authors. Clark's style of writing was that of unadorned and spare prose, while his wife preferred to use more adjectives and write in a 'flowery' manner. In 1974, he received his first prospective commission. British Member of Parliament, Enoch Powell, had asked Clark to write a biography for him in exchange for access to his papers. At their meeting in Powell's London flat, Powell expressed his surprise that Clark had married someone of Jewish heritage, and Clark consequently rejected the offer. He later discovered that the intended purpose of the proposed biography was to promote Powell should Britain require a leader in the subsequent turmoil of a possible break down of civil order. Clark was a member of the Society of Authors (SoA) for over 30 years and in the later years became part of their management committee. He was also a fellow of the English PEN, a member of the National Union of Journalists, the Authors Guild, the Mystery Writers Association, and the International Thriller Writers organisation. At the age of 81, Clark died on 22 October 2018. Career=Non-Fiction= Clark started working for local papers, including the Erdington News and the Birmingham Post, before moving to The Daily Mail. In 1958, he joined The Guardian, where he wrote authoritative backgrounders to major events of the time, such as the Great Train Robbery. From 1964-72, Clark worked for The Observer, where he served as Home Affairs Editor and head of the Investigative Unit. Here, his exposure of London's casinos led the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, to introduce swingeing new controls that cleaned up the British gambling scene and sent many American 'businessmen' scurrying home.' In 1967, Clark contributed a chapter 'Underworld' to Len Deighton's London Dossier published by Jonathan Cape and Penguin. The book's cover described it as 'an alternative new way of taking the city apart.'Nick Jones, 'Len Deighton's London Dossier', Existentialist Ennui blog, 19 December 2011 In 1969, Clark's first book was Everybody's Guide to Survival: A Handbook on Danger - How to Prevent It or Live through It. His solution to the problem of escaping from a submerged car led to a 1968 television appearance on ATV's 'Tonight with Dave Allen'. 'A tank was rigged up in the studio car park: the about-to-be- submerged pair discovered to their horror that the car, an old banger, leaked like a sieve. 'If things go wrong we'll smash the tank,' the director assured them. 'Do that and you'll kill us both,' said Eric. He and Allen were nevertheless lowered in ‚Äì and survived.' In 1973, Clark wrote Corps Diplomatique, later published in the US as Diplomat. The book showed how 'the old school of diplomacy is dying. Modern communications have diminished the diplomat's autonomy... the U.S. State Department has recently demonstrated some iconoclastic feminism, and egalitarian recruiting has undercut the aura of aristocracy... Clark occasionally chides the vestigial formalities such as calling cards...suggesting that, after all, diplomats are nothing more than 'glorified journalists.' His portrayal of espionage, propaganda, and posts behind the Iron Curtain and at the U.N. is dispassionate and objective.'Kirkus Review of Diplomat,1 May 1974 In 1988, Clark released The Want Makers, a look at the rise of advertising, revealing how deeply the industry has come to affect every area of life. This was another international investigation, based on firms in London, Tokyo, and New York. In the book, Clark describes 'in exhaustive detail an industry that targets as captive customers children, who spend more time watching TV than in school and can zero in on consumer 'grazers' 18‚Äì30 years old, who eat lightly and often and buy more of everything than anyone else. He shows us tobacco and liquor advertisers who subtly evade regulation, giant pharmaceutical companies with identical therapies that push their own brand names on doctors through gifts, entertainment and a barrage of trade ads, and political TV spots that overwhelm democracy in national elections.'Publishers Weekly Review of The Want Makers In 2007, The Real Toy Story was published. Clark contrasted the ruthless pragmatism of the international toy industry with the cozy lovable image of the products it sells. He interviewed 200 industry insiders, from lone inventors to heads of multinational companies, and also investigated the Chinese sweatshops, where 80% of the world's toys are made:Publishers Weekly Review of The Real Toy Story > 'This is where toys are produced for a few cents each by vast numbers of > young migrants toiling in sweatshop conditions. This is the hidden face of > the toy industry, without which it could not exist. The Pearl River Delta, > China. The workshop of the world.

Shifts can last more > than 15 hours a day, seven days a week...'Extract from The Real Toy Story > published in The Telegraph, 24 March 2007 =Fiction= Between 1977 and 1985, Clark wrote five espionage novels. The first, Black Gambit, influenced by John le Carr√©, concerns a plan to rescue a Soviet dissident under house arrest by substituting a double for him. Kirkus Reviews described the book as 'revamped escape-from-behind-the-Iron-Curtain... (with) the quiet, cumulative force and the clean, cinematic through-line that more convoluted spy-thrillers miss out on.'Kirkus Review of Black Gambit, 10 February 1977 Clark's second novel, The Sleeper, which was published in 1980, was judged by Kirkus to be his most successful: 'Clark's quietly impressive spy debut, Black Gambit (1977), had everything but original twists‚Äîand now he has those too, in a swift, cleanly knotted festival of ironies... Dark-edged characters, shards of raw action, implicit moral dilemmas left and right, plus a last-page punchline guaranteed to elicit a gasp or groan.' With Send in the Lions, in 1981, Clark set the story of a plane hijack in the near future: 'It's 1985, and a terrorist band (including cool-killer Karen, a Dutch diplomat's daughter) hijacks a Concorde jet carrying, among others, a US movie queen, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, the son of billionaire Andrew Muntwick... and an ugly little nobody named Ross whom Karen loathes on sight. And when the plane is forced to land in Algeria, the terrorists and these prime hostages disappear...How will the governments react?...'Kirkus Review of Send in the Lions, 1 June 1981 The reviewer found the book 'more like a film scenario than a full-scale novel... swiftly readable but disappointingly sketchy.' Clark's last two novels, Chinese Burn (1984) and China Run (1985) were both set in China. According to Kirkus, Chinese Burn had 'none of the grabs of Clark's best suspense (The Sleeper)--but readers may forgive the predictability... in order to enjoy the richly detailed, well-researched Chinese backgrounds.'Kirkus review of Chinese Burn, 7 January 1984 Publications=Non-Fiction= * Len Deighton's London Dossier (Chapter 10), 1967< * Everybody's Guide to Survival, 1969 * Corps Diplomatique, 1973 * Diplomat: The World of International Diplomacy, 1974 * The Want Makers: The world of advertising: how they make you buy, 1988 * The Real Toy Story, 2007 =Fiction= * Black Gambit, Morrow, 1977 * The Sleeper, 1980 * Send in the Lions, Hodder and Stoughton, 1981 * Chinese Burn, Hodder and Stoughton, 1984 * China Run, Little Brown & Co, 1985  References  British investigative journalists British spy fiction writers 20th- century British novelists 2018 deaths 1937 births People from Moseley ","title":"Eric Clark (author)"},{"id":"59034605","text":"Penny Squibb (born 9 February 1993) is an Australian field hockey player.

History  From 1110 until the French Revolution, the castle and village belonged to the Archbishops of Narbonne. It was the seat of one of the bailiwicks of the Archbishopric and shows that the prelates were integrated into feudal society and that the ecclesiastical power was exerted on seigneuries. The archbishops had to defend their properties against their neighbours, before and after the Albigensian Crusade. Villerouge was the centre of a vast domain, because the Archbishop of Narbonne was the lord of many villages in the region and he collected tithes, taxes or duties there. To collect these revenues and to control his vassals, the archbishop had a baillif and Villerouge was in the centre of the bailiwick. The archbishops of Narbonne tried to fortify this place which is imposing in its robustness. The large tower or keep of the south-eastern corner comprises three superimposed rooms, with very thick walls, in which staircases were arranged, leading to a crenelated terrace. The structure was certainly built in the 12th century, perhaps in the third quarter.Lucien Bely, Conna√Ætre les Cathares Editions Sud Ouest, 2006 The castle played an important role during the Albigensian Crusade. The last Cathar \\"bon homme\\", Guillaume B√©libaste, was burnt alive there on 24 August 1321. The castle, now in ruins, has been classified as a monument historique since 1976.

It is published by Cambridge University Press and edited by the Institute of Economic and Social Research of the UCLouvain. The Journal of Demographic Economics publishes four issues a year. The Journal of the Demographic Economics (JODE) welcomes both empirical and theoretical papers on issues relevant to Demographic Economics with a preference for combining abstract economic or demographic models together with data to highlight major mechanisms of the interplay between demographics and economics. JODE intends to be the premier demography & economics outlet for empirical contributions that are firmly grounded in theory as well as theoretical papers that are motivated by empirical regularities and findings. The editor-in-Chief of JODE is David de la Croix (UClouvain) and Murat Iyigun (University of Colorado at Boulder) is the Co-Editor. According to the Journal Citation Reports, JODE has an impact factor of 1.026 in 2017.  History  The first issue of the Journal of Demographic Economics appeared in March 2015, but its history can go back as far as 1928. Journal of Demographic Economics was born after the Institute of Economic and Social Research decided to transform its publication Recherches √âconomiques de Louvain ‚Äì Louvain Economic Review into an international journal focusing on demographic economics. Louvain Economic Review was a non-specialized academic journal of economics and published papers in French and English. The first issue of Recherches √©conomiques de Louvain ‚Äì Louvain Economic Review was published in February 1961 and its last issue was published in December 2014. Before 1961, the institute of Economic and social research had another publication called ‚ÄúBulletin de l‚ÄôInstitut des Sciences √âconomiques‚Äù. The first issue of Bulletins de l‚ÄôInstitut des Sciences √âconomiques was published in December 1929. The first editorial was signed by Paul van Zeeland.  First issue honoring Gary Becker  The first issue of the Journal was assembled to commemorate Gary Becker. Becker is one of the most influential scientists of the twentieth century, as recognized by the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences awarded to him in 1992. The issue includes eight mini essays penned by economists and demographers, some of whom former Becker students, to dissect Gary Becker's influence on and legacy in various different subfields of demographic economics. An introductory piece by Aloysius Siow precedes these essays and sets in personal perspective the impact Gary Becker has had on the economics profession in general and demographic economics in particular.

Like the FEG P9R, it combines the design and operation of the Browning Hi-Power with the trigger mechanism of the Smith & Wesson double action trigger. Design The Norinco NP-18 is a Chinese copy of the FEG P9R. The handgun uses the 9x19mm Parabellum round, which is common in this type of guns. It has a heavy duty forged (not cast) steel frame and slide, which makes it one of the most solid, robust self-loading pistols that are actually in the market, because, unlike the casted steel, the forged steel is made with strength and toughness in mind. It has a chrome-lined barrel to extend the barrel life, make it easier to clean, and better protect it from corrosion and erosion than a non-chromed barrel. Because it's a handgun, one doesn't need to worry about the little difference of accuracy between a chromed and a non-chromed barrel (which has better accuracy). The gun has a slide-mounted safety/decocker, which makes it slightly more safe than other types of safeties or decockers, because, when the safety is engaged, it also decocks the hammer, preventing accidental shots. As an inspiration of Smith & Wesson, the NP-18 has a double-action trigger. With this system, the gun can be fired with the hammer cocked or decocked. The gun has a ten-round double column magazine, similar to that of the Browning Hi-Power, which was one of the first guns to adopt the double column magazine. The gun frame has a blue finished steel and a plastic grip that can easily be replaced by taking out a couple of screws.

Its publications included Llyfr Hwiangerddi y Dref Wen (the standard Welsh nursery rhyme collection), Y Geiriadur Lliwgar (Welsh children‚Äôs dictionary), the ‚ÄúWelsh History Stories‚Äù series and the ‚ÄúFrom Start to Finish‚Äù series on religions (both series being issued in both Welsh and English). Boore translated many Dref Wen books into Welsh, from a variety of languages. In 1997 Boore received the Mary Vaughan Jones Award for his ‚Äúnotable contribution to the field of children‚Äôs books in Wales over a period of years‚Äù and in 2016 was elected to the Gorsedd of Bards of the National Eisteddfod of Wales for his ‚Äúspecial contribution to Wales and the Welsh language‚Äù. Boore retired in 1999. Boore won the short story competition in the 1971 National Eisteddfod and the Prose Medal at the 1972 Pantyfedwen Eisteddfod. He has published one collection of short stories, one children‚Äôs novel, and, since his retirement from publishing, a series of five travel books.

It was first published on 2 October 2008 by The Bodley Head, and a later edition with more pages was released on 29 February 2012. The volume debunks and explains various myths about the period. The informal book is confined to the 14th century in England, with passing references to the Continent. Mortimer goes into details about food, clothing, building materials, the layout of houses, but also covers things like laws, customs, travel, entertainment. It is ground-breaking in historical literature in that it is written entirely in the present tense.  Illustrations  All the illustrations in the volume were provided by British Library.  Reception  The book is one of the best-selling social history titles of the twenty-first century, reach no. 6 on the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction bestseller list at Christmas 2009. According to , it has sold more than 250,000 paperback copies in the UK, 100,000 copies in the USA and is published in several other languages. On first publication it was widely praised. Sue Arnold, writing in The Guardian, commented 'After The Canterbury Tales this has to be the most entertaining book ever written about the Middle Ages.' The historian Alison Weir stated,'It\`s an incredible tour de force, a vivid and page-turning evocation of an age that is long-gone yet has been brought to life again in vibrant and robust fashion thanks to Ian Mortimer\`s impeccable scholarship and pacy writing.' Professor Steohen Howe, writing in The Independent, remarked that it was 'Perhaps the most enjoyable history book I've read all year.' A review written by Kathryn Hughes for The Guardian praised the book's different approach and abundance of trivia, adding that 'It is Monty Python and the Holy Grail with footnotes and, my goodness, it is fun... The result of this careful blend of scholarship and fancy is a jaunty journey through the 14th century, one that wriggles with the stuff of everyday life... (A) deft summary of life in the high medieval period.' The Washington Post's short review by Aaron Leitko vaunted the book as \\"Fodor's-style framework\\" and a travel book that gets into \\"heart of a different time zone\\". Tom Holland, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was a lone critical voice. He described the volume as an \\"old- fashioned study\\". Holland also proposed that Mortimer felt embarrassed to write a book about what was \\"familiar to a reader in the 19th century\\". Mortimer addressed Holland's criticism by implying that Holland had failed to understand the book, going as far as to call Holland's review \\"bizarre\\". In his reply, Mortimer assumed that Holland wanted the book to be \\"semi- fictionalised\\" and explained that such an approach would trivialise his work, as the volume is intended to be useful to students, but also hoped to stand the \\"test of time\\". Sequels The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England: a Handbook for Visitors to the Sixteenth Century was published in 2012 by Viking Press and The Time Traveller's Guide to Restoration Britain: Life in the Age of Samuel Pepys, Isaac Newton and The Great Fire of London by The Bodley Head in 2017.

The group was founded in 1914 by Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, and some of its early meetings were attended by Viscount Bryce. Bryce chaired the Committee on Alleged German Outrages, and its 1915 report, popularly known as the \\"Bryce Report\\", became the focus of much of the group's work. The group concluded that, in order to minimise future atrocities, nations should agree a binding treaty, which would compel them to take disputes to arbitration, and provide sanctions against both signatories and non-signatories, to compel them to accept this arbitration. Some group members disagreed with these conclusions; for example, Arthur Ponsonby objected to all use of force, while John A. Hobson believed that any international organisation would be ineffective unless it had the power to reduce international inequalities. While the Bryce Group was small, it proved highly influential, as through its links with the League to Enforce Peace it influenced Woodrow Wilson's thinking. Late in 1915, the group merged into the Fabian Society Research Committee, and thereby its proposal became a key part of Labour Party international policy. Membership of the group overlapped with that of the League of Nations Society, and also the 1917 Club. Over the next decade, most of its members joined the Labour Party.

Although social media accessed via desktop computers offer a variety of opportunities for companies in a wide range of business sectors, mobile social media, which users can access when they are \\"on the go\\" via tablet computers or smartphones, benefit companies because of the location- and time-sensitive awareness of their users. Mobile social media tools can be used for marketing research, communication, sales promotions/discounts, informal employee learning/organizational development, relationship development/loyalty programs,Kaplan, Andreas M. (March‚ÄìApril 2012). \\"If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4\\". Business Horizons. 55 (2): 129‚Äì139. doi:10.1016/j.bushor.2011.10.009. and e-commerce. *Marketing research: Mobile social media applications provide companies data about offline consumer movements at a level of detail that was previously accessible to online companies only. These applications allow any business to know the exact time a customer who uses social media entered one of its locations, as well as know the social media comments made during the visit. *Communication: Mobile social media communication takes two forms: company-to-consumer (in which a company may establish a connection to a consumer based on its location and provide reviews about locations nearby) and user-generated content. For example, McDonald's offered $5 and $10 gift-cards to 100 users randomly selected among those checking in at one of its restaurants. This promotion increased check-ins by 33% (from 2,146 to 2,865), resulted in over 50 articles and blog posts, and prompted several hundred thousand news feeds and Twitter messages. *Sales promotions and discounts: Although customers have had to use printed coupons in the past, mobile social media allows companies to tailor promotions to specific users at specific times. For example, when launching its California-Cancun service, Virgin America offered users who checked in through Loopt at one of three designated taco trucks in San Francisco or Los Angeles between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. on August 31, 2010, two tacos for $1 and two flights to Cancun or Cabo for the price of one. This special promotion was only available to people who were at a certain location at a certain time. *Relationship development and loyalty programs: In order to increase long-term relationships with customers, companies can develop loyalty programs that allow customers who check-in via social media regularly at a location to earn discounts or perks. For example, American Eagle Outfitters remunerates such customers with a tiered 10%, 15%, or 20% discount on their total purchase. *Informal employee learning/organizational development is facilitated by the social media Technologies such as blogs, wiki pages, web forums, social networks and other social media act as Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) tools, and their users perceive change in organizational structure, culture and knowledge management. The prerequisite for the successful use of social media are motivated employees who want tu use the new technologies. It is central for companies to understand the factors that determine the willingness to use social media. *e-Commerce: Social media sites are increasingly implementing marketing-friendly strategies, creating platforms that are mutually beneficial for users, businesses, and the networks themselves in the popularity and accessibility of e-commerce, or online purchases. The user who posts her or his comments about a company's product or service benefits because they are able to share their views with their online friends and acquaintances. The company benefits because it obtains insight (positive or negative) about how their product or service is viewed by consumers. Mobile social media applications such as Amazon.com and Pinterest have started to influence an upward trend in the popularity and accessibility of e-commerce. E-commerce businesses may refer to social media as consumer-generated media (CGM). A common thread running through all definitions of social media is a blending of technology and social interaction for the co-creation of value for the business or organization that is using it. People obtain valuable information, education, news, and other data from electronic and print media. Social media are distinct from industrial and traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, television, and film as they are comparatively inexpensive marketing tools and are highly accessible. They enable anyone, including private individuals, to publish or access information easily. Industrial media generally require significant resources to publish information, and in most cases the articles go through many revisions before being published. This process adds to the cost and the resulting market price. Originally social media was only used by individuals, but now it is used by both businesses and nonprofit organizations and also in government and politics. One characteristic shared by both social and industrial media is the capability to reach small or large audiences; for example, either a blog post or a television show may reach no people or millions of people. Some of the properties that help describe the differences between social and industrial media are: # Quality: In industrial (traditional) publishing‚Äîmediated by a publisher‚Äîthe typical range of quality is substantially narrower (skewing to the high quality side) than in niche, unmediated markets like user-generated social media posts. The main challenge posed by the content in social media sites is the fact that the distribution of quality has high variance: from very high-quality items to low-quality, sometimes even abusive or inappropriate content. # Reach: Both industrial and social media technologies provide scale and are capable of reaching a global audience. Industrial media, however, typically use a centralized framework for organization, production, and dissemination, whereas social media are by their very nature more decentralized, less hierarchical, and distinguished by multiple points of production and utility. # Frequency: The number of times users access a type of media per day. Heavy social media users, such as young people, check their social media account numerous times throughout the day. # Accessibility: The means of production for industrial media are typically government or corporate (privately owned); social media tools are generally available to the public at little or no cost, or they are supported by advertising revenue. While social media tools are available to anyone with access to Internet and a computer or mobile device, due to the digital divide, the poorest segment of the population lacks access to the Internet and computer. Low-income people may have more access to traditional media (TV, radio, etc.), as an inexpensive TV and aerial or radio costs much less than an inexpensive computer or mobile device. Moreover, in many regions, TV or radio owners can tune into free over the air programming; computer or mobile device owners need Internet access to go to social media sites. # Usability: Industrial media production typically requires specialized skills and training. For example, in the 1970s, to record a pop song, an aspiring singer would have to rent time in an expensive professional recording studio and hire an audio engineer. Conversely, most social media activities, such as posting a video of oneself singing a song require only modest reinterpretation of existing skills (assuming a person understands Web 2.0 technologies); in theory, anyone with access to the Internet can operate the means of social media production, and post digital pictures, videos or text online. # Immediacy: The time lag between communications produced by industrial media can be long (days, weeks, or even months, by the time the content has been reviewed by various editors and fact checkers) compared to social media (which can be capable of virtually instantaneous responses). The immediacy of social media can be seen as a strength, in that it enables regular people to instantly communicate their opinions and information. At the same time, the immediacy of social media can also be seen as a weakness, as the lack of fact checking and editorial \\"gatekeepers\\" facilitates the circulation of hoaxes and fake news. # Permanence: Industrial media, once created, cannot be altered (e.g., once a magazine article or paper book is printed and distributed, changes cannot be made to that same article in that print run) whereas social media posts can be altered almost instantaneously, when the user decides to edit their post or due to comments from other readers. Community media constitute a hybrid of industrial and social media. Though community-owned, some community radio, TV, and newspapers are run by professionals and some by amateurs. They use both social and industrial media frameworks. Social media has also been recognized for the way they have changed how public relations professionals conduct their jobs. They have provided an open arena where people are free to exchange ideas on companies, brands, and products. Doc Searls and David Wagner state that the \\"...best of the people in PR are not PR types at all. They understand that there aren't censors, they're the company's best conversationalists.\\" Social media provides an environment where users and PR professionals can converse, and where PR professionals can promote their brand and improve their company's image by listening and responding to what the public is saying about their product.  Performance benefits  There are four channels by which social media resources can transform into business performance capabilities: # Social capital represents the extent to which social media affects firms' and organizations' relationships with society and the degree to which the organizations' use of social media increases corporate social-performance capabilities. # Revealed preferences represent the extent to which social media exposes customers' likings (e.g., \\"likes\\" and followers) and increase a firm's financial capabilities (e.g., stock price, revenue, profit), or for non-profits, increases their donations, volunteerism rate, etc. # Social marketing represents the extent to which social-marketing resources (e.g., online conversations, sharing links, online presence, sending text-messages) are used to increase a firm's financial capabilities (e.g., sales, acquisition of new customers) or a non-profit's voluntary sector goals. # Social corporate networking involves the informal ties and linkages of corporate/organizational staff with other people from their field or industry, clients, customers, and other members of the public, which form through social networks. Social corporate networking can increase operational performance capabilities in many ways, as it can enable sales staff to find new clients; help marketing staff to learn about client/customer needs and demand, and teach management about the public perceptions of their strategy or approach. # Influence on consumer decisions With the ever-increasing technological development of social media, this has affected consumers' decision to buy the product or service provided by companies. On the other hand, social media has become an important factor in increasing the sales of brands, whether large or small, since the beginning of the Internet revolution. There is much research to prove this, based on the actions taken by the consumer through 2017. There will be many reports at the beginning 2018 confirming the degree to which social media has become effective in marketing companies and the importance of focusing on them. # Increase website traffic. One of the benefits of social media is driving traffic to the website. If the account consists of content from the website, it will help to increase page views. The existence of the link to the website helps the audience learns more about the brand. There are four tools or approaches that engage experts, customers, suppliers, and employees in the development of products and services using social media. Companies and other organizations can use these tools and approaches to improve their business capacity and performance. # Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach to managing a company's interaction with current and potential future customers that try to analyze data about customers' history with a company and to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth. One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials, and social media. Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate CRM, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs. However, adopting the CRM approach may also occasionally lead to favoritism within an audience of consumers, resulting in dissatisfaction among customers and defeating the purpose of CRM. # Innovation is defined by Michael Szycher as a \\"new idea, device, or method,\\" or the use of better solutions that accommodate new needs or solve new problems. To accomplish this, more effective products, processes, services, technologies and business models are required by markets, governments and society. Innovation is something original that occurs via the engineering process and is able to break into a market and is similar to invention. In industrial economics, innovations work to meet a growing consumer demand. # Training in social-media techniques, tactics and unwritten rules may not be needed for \\"parseltongues\\", such as workers who are already comfortable and experienced with using social media. However, for workers who are not familiar with social media, formal or informal training may be needed. Brand management and engagement is done differently on social media platforms than over traditional advertising formats such as TV and radio ads. To give just one example, with traditional ads, customers cannot respond to the ad. However, if an organization makes a major gaffe or politically incorrect statement on social media, customers and other regular citizens can immediately post comments about the ad. # Knowledge management could take place in traditional small businesses (such as coffeehouses and ice cream parlours) just by using the owner-proprietor's own memory of his key customers, their preferences, and their client-service expectations. However, with the shift to national or even multinational e-commerce businesses which operate online, companies are generating far more data on transactions for a single person or even a team to grasp just in their memory. As such, 2010-era global e-commerce firms typically use a range of digital tools to track, monitor and analyze the huge streams of data their businesses are generating, a process called \\"data mining\\".  Monitoring, tracking and analysis of consumers  Companies are increasingly using social media monitoring tools to monitor, track, and analyze online conversations on the Web about their brand or products or about related topics of interest. This can be useful in public relations management and advertising campaign tracking, allowing the companies to measure return on investment for their social media ad spending, competitor-auditing, and for public engagement. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, more in-depth tools. Social media tracking also enables companies to respond quickly to online posts that criticize their product or service. By responding quickly to critical online posts, and helping the user to resolve the concerns, this helps the company to lessen the negative effects that online complaints can have about company product or service sales. In the US, for example, if a customer criticizes a major hotel chain's cleanliness or service standards on a social media website, a company representative will usually quickly be alerted to this critical post, so that the company representative can go online and express concern for the sub-par service and offer the complaining person a coupon or discount on their next purchase, plus a promise to forward their concerns to the hotel manager so that the problem will not be repeated. This rapid response helps to show that the company cares about its customers. The \\"honeycomb framework\\" defines how social media services focus on some or all of seven functional building blocks. These building blocks help explain the engagement needs of the social media audience. For instance, LinkedIn users are thought to care mostly about identity, reputation, and relationships, whereas YouTube's primary features are sharing, conversations, groups, and reputation. Many companies build their own social \\"containers\\" that attempt to link the seven functional building blocks around their brands. These are private communities that engage people around a more narrow theme, as in around a particular brand, vocation or hobby, rather than social media containers such as Google+, Facebook, and Twitter. PR departments face significant challenges in dealing with viral negative sentiment directed at organizations or individuals on social media platforms (dubbed \\"sentimentitis\\"), which may be a reaction to an announcement or event. In a 2011 article, Jan H. Kietzmann, Kristopher Hermkens, Ian P. McCarthy and Bruno S. Silvestre describe the honeycomb relationship as \\"present[ing] a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups\\". Social authority Social media marketing becomes effective through a process called \\"building social authority\\". One of the foundation concepts in social media has become that you cannot completely control your message through social media but rather you can simply begin to participate in the \\"conversation\\" expecting that you can achieve a significant influence in that conversation. However, this conversation participation must be cleverly executed because although people are resistant to marketing in general, they are even more resistant to direct or overt marketing through social media platforms. This may seem counterintuitive but it is the main reason building social authority with credibility is so important. A marketer can generally not expect people to be receptive to a marketing message in and of itself. In the Edelman Trust Barometer report in 2008, the majority (58%) of the respondents reported they most trusted company or product information coming from \\"people like me\\" inferred to be information from someone they trusted. In the 2010 Trust Report, the majority switched to 64% preferring their information from industry experts and academics. According to Inc. Technology's Brent Leary, \\"This loss of trust, and the accompanying turn towards experts and authorities, seems to be coinciding with the rise of social media and networks.\\" References Social media Business models ","title":"Social media use by businesses"},{"id":"59035214","text":"Marijan ƒåabraja (born 25 February 1997) is a Croatian football player.

The 294th overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 14, 2018. The episode is the second part of a two-episode story in which former U.S. Vice President Al Gore is enlisted by the main characters in response to a rampage by a demonic being called ManBearPig. It serves as a parody of climate change denial. Plot In continuation from the previous episode, the demonic monster ManBearPig (a creature first referenced in the episode of the same name) continues his rampage through the town of South Park, brutally murdering and consuming citizens in broad daylight. Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick are in a jail, having been arrested by Sergeant Yates, who believes that the recent murders were the result of school shootings perpetrated by the four boys. Exploiting their guard's obsession with the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (a pastime popular among the townsfolk that serves as a recurring reference throughout the two- episode story), Stan and his friends escape jail. When Stan learns that his grandfather, Grampa Marsh, has been talking about ManBearPig since Randy was 14, Stan confronts him. Grampa Marsh reveals that when he and his friends were young and foolish, and South Park was a smaller town, they made a deal with ManBearPig for luxurious things like expensive cars and premium boutique ice cream, not thinking about the future, or what this would mean for their grandchildren. Sergeant Yates continues to deny the existence of ManBearPig, insisting that the gruesome crimes are the result of school shootings. Stan and his friends reconvene in the woods with their allies, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Satan, whom the group summoned in the previous episode, to inform them of ManBearPig's origin. After contending with the haughty and self-satisfied Gore's continued self-aggrandizement, Cartman convinces Satan that it is time that he did something for the people of South Park, who lately have been doing a lot of his work for him. Satan confronts ManBearPig in a furiously violent brawl in the middle of town, but is fatally beaten, and ascends to heaven as an angel. Grandpa Marsh takes refuge with Stan and his friends at South Park Elementary, where they are again surrounded by the police. However, Sergeant Yates appears and admits that he has been a fool by denying ManBearPig's existence, and did not realize this until he saw the effect that his stubbornness had on his marriage. Yates muses that it is never too late to do the right thing, and ask Stan and his friends if they know what that is. Stan says that they do, and will put an end to the deal once and for all. He and his friends are given power of attorney to represent the town, and enter sit-down negotiations with ManBearPig and his attorney to void their prior deal. ManBearPig agrees to leave the town and never return in exchange for compensation, including the town's agreement to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2, but the town's reluctance to do this leads to continued negotiations, and increased demands by ManBearPig. Reception Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode an 8.3 out of 10, and summarized in his review, \\"The latter half of Season 22's epic two-parter definitely lacks the novelty of the first. That's to be expected given how much this episode leans on the same ManBearPig and Red Dead Redemption material. Still, it manages to escalate that conflict in amusing ways while further hammering home the climate change metaphor.\\" John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode a B grade, and commented in his review, \\"It was a bit reminiscent of episodes like 'The Biggest Douche in the Universe,' where the public's willingness to completely ignore the obvious truths being laid before them in order to continue believing what they want to believe is played for laughs. While South Park's politics have evolved over the years, one of its most firmly held beliefs is that people are idiots, and that was fully on display in 'Nobody Got Cereal.'\\" During filming of his appearance on The Daily Show, Al Gore was asked about the way South Park had portrayed him and ManBearPig in the two episodes, and replied, \\"I thought it was a hell of a statement by South Park, and I appreciated it a lot.\\" See also *An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (2017) *Climate change adaptation and mitigation ReferencesExternal links *\\"Episode 2207 'Nobody Got Cereal?'

It is the only feature-length film production Cage was ever involved in. The film has no plot and consists of black-and-white images depicting a composed and chance- determined play of electric light. It can be accompanied by the orchestra piece 103. Described as \\"film without subject\\" and \\"abstract study in light and shade\\", it was completed in 1992 only weeks before Cage's death. One11 has garnered acclaim from film and music critics alike. Hailed for its dream-like, meditative quality as well as its striking visuals and sounds, the film originally aired on German television and has been presented at various theatrical venues and exhibitions since its premiere in September 1992. Content One11 is a film without a subject consisting of ever-evolving patterns of light and shade against a fixed backdrop. Filmed in black and white, chance operations were used with respect to the camera shots and editing. It is musically accompanied by the orchestral work 103. The film and the musical piece are of the same duration and run in parallel, without relating directly to each other; both are 90-minutes long, divided into seventeen parts. Each of the parts is based on approximately 1200 random operations devised by a computer and determining the lighting and the movements of a crane-mounted camera. The title refers to a chronological order in Cage's repertoire: it is the 11th composition that Cage wrote for a single performer ‚Äì in this case, the camera. Cage stated the film has \\"no plot, no characters, nothing\\", hoping it would \\"give pleasure without having any meaning whatsoever\\". He wanted it to be \\"free of politics, economics and even of oneself\\". Production For a long time, John Cage had resisted the idea of creating a film. But the German-born Los Angeles film composer Henning Lohner convinced him to make a feature-length film for cinema and TV. Cage reportedly said, laughing, \\"if I have the opportunity to do something then I jump at it, instead of hesitating, because there isn't much time left!\\" As early as in 1952, John Cage had started to address both the perception of emptiness and the random quality of what happens in a prescribed space in his piece 4:33, which consisted entirely of silence. Forty years later, having spoken about silence musically, Cage now wished to treat it visually ‚Äì through a film about light itself. Cage said, \\"I think light gives me the pleasure that sound gives. [...] [I]n this day of violence and overpopulation, war and economic collapse, I think it gives us something to enjoy.\\" He commented on the filming of One11 by saying, \\"Of course the film will be about the effect of light in an empty space. But no space is actually empty, and the light will show what is in it. And all this space and all this light will be controlled by random operations.\\" This concept was implemented professionally in a Munich television studio in 1992 under the direction of Henning Lohner. It was shot in 35mm black-and-white by cameraman Van Theodore Carlson. Filming began on April 22 at a large TV studio in Munich, with a crew of about a dozen TV engineers and technicians. Working with 35 mm cameras on a tripod, crane or hand-held, Carlson often changed their lens openings, as required by the score. The work was completed only weeks before John Cage's death in 1992. The film premiered in Cologne, Germany, on September 19, 1992, accompanied by the live performance of the orchestra piece 103 by the WDR Symphony Orchestra of the German Radio. In the DVD released by Mode Records, viewers can choose between two different performances of Cage's orchestral 103 to accompany the film: the version recorded at the premiere by the WDR Symphony Orchestra as well as a version by the Spoleto Festival Orchestra. Reception One11 received critical acclaim. Shortly after its premiere, famous French filmmaker Louis Malle called the film \\"very strong, very daring, and finally completely mesmerizing.\\"https://www.cineinfinito.org/cineinfinito-59-john-cage/ Writing for BBC Music Magazine, Barry Witherden said, \\"What makes it art is the mediation of artists\\", while The Solute hailed the work's \\"antiquated magic\\", stating that the film has \\"the feel of a dream or meditation from an age that's already gone.\\" Peter Dickinson called One11 in the Gramophone magazine \\"a splendid project carried out with dedication by all concerned\\" and praised the \\"remarkable quality of these uniquely pure visual images, studies in light ranging from total black to total white. ... The play of lights brings up slowly moving circular objects eerily reminiscent of distant moons transmitted from outer space posing the eternal questions of existence.\\" Dickinson concluded that \\"Cage's formulae for removing personal taste have paradoxically produced mesmeric images that only he could have devised.\\" In his review for The Wire magazine, Philip Clark wrote: \\"The black and white grainy quality of the picture allows for a rich palette of tones and textures, and the images are so disarmingly striking that your eyes can't help but listen carefully. ... The sounds are otherworldly and hovering. ... Cage himself looks frail and died shortly after One11 appeared. But what an extraordinary valedictory throw of the dice.\\" The blog The Sound of Eye called the film \\"a masterpiece\\", writing, \\"while One11 is certainly one of the most accomplished and beautiful exercises in [Cage's] repertoire, it can also be said be seen as the most lucid and transparent demonstration of its conceptual and philosophical principles. A rare sense of timelessness emerges from these plays of light, and the film's pristine beauty can surely entrance anyone not interested or learned in Cage theory.\\" Reviewing the film in 2014 with regards to the John Cage exhibit \\"Neither\\" in London, writer and broadcaster Morgan Quaintance said that the work was \\"exceptional\\", writing for Art Agenda: \\"At the exhibition's core is, thrillingly, an underexposed work by Cage that was also his last. What's more remarkable is that One11 and 103 (1992), a combined 90-minute film and sound work, exposes a different, more somber and mysterious dimension of the influential composer's output. Made in collaboration with German filmmaker Henning Lohner, the film is an abstract study in light and shade.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1992 films American black-and-white films Compositions by John Cage ","title":"One11"},{"id":"59035298","text":"The League of Nations Society was a political group devoted to campaigning for an international organisation of nations, with the aim of preventing war. The society was founded in 1915 by Baron Courtney and Willoughby Dickinson, both members of the British Liberal Party, and Baron Parmoor, a member of the Conservative Party. The group campaigned for the establishment of the League of Nations, its interest mostly motivated by pacifism, and opposition to World War I. The society was influenced by the proposals of the Bryce Group, and many of that group's members also held membership of the society. However, it differed from the Bryce Group in proposing that the future international league should be able to impose sanctions in order to enforce arbitration decisions, not just to compel nations to take disputes into arbitration. The society grew quickly, appointing Margery Spring Rice as its secretary, and within a couple of years had several thousand members. By 1917, Woodrow Wilson supported the principle of a League of Nations, and less radical supporters of the idea formed the League of Free Nations Association. In 1918, the two organisations merged, forming the League of Nations Union.

It has a firing pin block safety (which grants more safety to the user than the old manual safety, similar to that of the Browning Hi-Power, which did not decock the hammer), squared off trigger guard (for better handling of the weapon), a ring hammer (for easy cocking and decocking of the hammer), and tri-dot sights (for better aiming capabilities than the old system of front blade and a rear square notch). The CZ 85 itself is also a modernized and upgraded version of the CZ 75 itself. The NZ-85B also has some improvements over its original gun.https://www.marstar.ca/html/reflibrary/Manuals/norinconz85bnp40.html The NZ 85B, like a lot of Chinese copies of guns, has a heavy duty forged (not cast) steel frame and slide, what makes it one of the most solid, robust self- loading pistols on the market. Unlike the casted steel, the forged steel is made with strength and toughness in mind.https://gunsgunsguns.net/norinco- nz-85-b/ It has a chrome-lined barrel to extend the barrel life, make it easier to clean, and protect it more from corrosion and erosion than a non- chromed barrel. Because it's a handgun, one doesn't need to worry about the little difference of accuracy between a chromed and a non-chromed barrel (which has better accuracy). The gun has a slide-mounted safety/decocker, which makes it slightly more safe than other types of safeties or decockers, because when the safety is engaged, it also decocks the hammer, preventing any kind of accidental shots. The NZ-85B has a double-action trigger. With this system, one can shoot the gun with the hammer cocked or decocked. This gun has a ten-round double column magazine, similar to that of the Browning Hi-Power, which was one of the first guns to ever adopt the double column magazine. The gun's frame has blue finished steel and it has a plastic grip that can easily be replaced by taking out a couple of screws. In addition to all these common stats of Chinese copied guns, the NZ 85B also has slide rails in the inside rather than the outside of the frame, a system said to increase accuracy and smooth operation.https://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=75683 Similar pistols *CZ 85 *CZ 75 See also *CZ 52 *Norinco *List of pistols References 9mm Parabellum semi-automatic pistols Semi-automatic pistols of the People's Republic of China ","title":"NZ 85B"},{"id":"59035376","text":"Rodolfo Kumbrevicius (Chinese: ÁΩóÂ§öÁ¶è) is a former Brazilian footballer.

Among the eight was Jesse Jackson, a college freshman. As a result of the staged sit-in, the library system in the city integrated. Background Jesse Jackson, one of the Greenville Eight arrested for staging a sit-in at the public library in Greenville, SC. By 1960, public libraries in Columbia and Spartanburg integrated without much controversy, but the library system in Greenville remained segregated. Jesse Jackson, a Greenville native, who later became known for his civil rights activism, returned home from college over Christmas break during his freshman year at the University of Illinois. While in Greenville, Jackson required a book to write a research paper. The book Jackson needed was not available at the colored library branch, a one-room, dilapidated house on East McBee Avenue. Many of the books at the colored library were outdated and in poor condition. The librarian at the colored branch wrote Jackson a note and told him to visit the white-only branch as the librarian there was her friend. Upon arriving at the main branch, Jackson went to the rear of the building where the librarian was speaking with a few police officers. Jackson showed the librarian the note; the book Jackson needed was on the shelf inside, but the librarian said he would have to wait six days before he could use it. Jackson attempted to plea with the librarian, but the policeman took her side, adding, \\"you heard what she said.\\" Angry, Jackson vowed to return in the summer to \\"take action\\" and use the library. On March 1, 1960, twenty black high school students entered the whites-only library branch and attempted to utilize the facility. To counter the protest, officials closed the library for the day. Two weeks later, seven students returned to protest the library's segregation policies, and they were arrested for disorderly conduct, though their actions were never brought to trial. On July 14, Jackson and five other students stood on the steps of the library. After police threatened the protesters with arrest if they entered the building, the protesters left. The News and Courier, a white newspaper in Charleston, South Carolina, wrote in response to the incident, \\"Third time this year that groups of Negroes have invaded the quiet of the public library.\\" Reverend James S. Hall Jr., the vice president of the Greenville South Carolina NAACP, who had counseled the Jackson, noted that the entire point of the protest was to be arrested. He added that they but would likely be released without further incident after arrest. Two days later, Jackson returned to the library with seven other neatly dressed students. The Protest On July 16, 1960, eight African American college students entered the whites-only branch of the public library. The eight students silently browsed the shelves and sat down to read. Several white patrons in the library left upon seeing the student protesters. A librarian immediately instructed the students to leave, but when they refused, he called the police. The sit-in lasted approximately 40 minutes before the police arrived and arrested all eight protesters. Donald J. Sampson, the first African-American lawyer in Greenville, arrived after the students had been in jail for approximately fifteen minutes, and the court released the students on a $30 bond. They were each charged with \\"disorderly conduct.\\" =Result= On July 26, 1960, Sampson filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of South Carolina. Sampson claimed that the reason the students were arrested was that \\"we still have a bunch of illiterate white trash who don't know enough but to have these students arrested.\\" The NAACP condemned Sampson's words. Under the threat of a lawsuit, the Greenville City Council voted to close both the white and colored branches of the library. Greenville Mayor J. Kenneth Cass added, Charles Cecil Wyche of the district court dismissed the case, stating that any ruling was irrelevant since the libraries were closed. But he contended that if the library system reopened in its segregated form, it would be \\"liable to further discrimination lawsuits.\\" On September 19, the city reopened the libraries quietly after receiving many grievances from citizens throughout the city. The mayor, refusing to publicly admit that the libraries were integrated, added, \\"The city libraries will be operated for the benefit of any citizen having a legitimate need for the libraries and their facilities. They will not be used for demonstrations, purposeless assembly, or propaganda purposes.\\" Ultimately, the sit-in staged by the Greenville Eight resulted in the library system's integration, and the charges against the students were later dropped. Simultaneous sit-in protests happened throughout the city in the early 1960s, and school desegregation began by the late 1960s.

Early life and career Hidalgo was born in Bogota, Colombia, on February 19, 1991. Her family left Colombia when she was five years old, and lived in Peru and Mexico City before moving to Houston, Texas, when she was 15 years old. Hidalgo graduated from Seven Lakes High School in Greater Katy, Texas, and then attended Stanford University, graduating with a degree in Political Science in 2013. Her honors thesis was titled, \\"Tiananmen or Tahrir? A Comparative Study of Military Intervention Against Popular Protest.\\" That same year, Hidalgo became a U.S. citizen. Upon graduation from Stanford University, Hidalgo received the Omidyar Network Postgraduate Fellowship to work with an international organization. She moved to Thailand where she worked for the Internews Network, an international non-profit dedicated to training journalists and advocating for press freedom. After returning to the United States from Thailand, Hidalgo worked as a medical interpreter at the Texas Medical Center in Houston and volunteered for the Texas Civil Rights Project. During this time, Hidalgo was accepted into the Master's/Juris Doctor Joint Program in law and public policy at Harvard University Kennedy School of Government and New York University School of Law. Though Hidalgo originally planned to pursue a career in health care and criminal justice, the 2016 election inspired her to put her degree on hold and run for public office instead.  County Judge of Harris County =2018 election= Hidalgo ran for County Judge of Harris County in the 2018 elections. She ran unopposed in the Democratic Party primary election and faced incumbent Ed Emmett in the general election. Hidalgo ran on a platform focused on flood control, criminal justice reform, and increasing transparency and accountability in local government. Hidalgo defeated Ed Emmett on November 6, 2018, to become the first woman and Latina elected Harris County Judge. Her victory was considered an upset and attracted national attention, with a large and diverse coalition of activists and organizations leading her to a nearly 19,000 vote victory. = Tenure = Hidalgo championed cash bail reform in Harris County. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hidalgo implemented public health measures early to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In March 2020, she ordered the closure of bars and restaurants. In April 2020, Hidalgo required Harris County members to wear face masks in public. Her public health measures were strongly criticized by Republicans at the state and federal level. Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, criticized Hidalgo's action and said that local officials could not enforce mask mandates. By June, as cases in Texas climbed, Abbott ordered his own face mask mandate. Hidalgo appeared in video montages during the 2020 Democratic National Convention.https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/21/dnc-2020-texans/ Recognition Hidalgo was featured on the cover of Time in January 2018 alongside dozens of other women that ran for office in one of the biggest elections for women. Hidalgo was criticized after a news conference in March 2019 in which she spoke in English and Spanish about the health implications of a massive chemical fire. She was addressing constituents and reporters from English and Spanish language media outlets. A commissioner from Chambers County posted a negative comment on social media: ‚ÄúEnglish, this is not Mexico.‚Äù Her director of communications issued a statement noting that a third of the residents of Harris County are Spanish speakers: > \\"Judge Hidalgo represents all of Harris County and given the county's > composition and her bilingual skills, she will continue to communicate as > broadly as possible especially when public safety is at stake.\\" In December 2019, Hidalgo was named one of Forbes 30 under 30 in Law and Policy.

Released on 8 November 2018 on Steam and Nintendo Switch, the game centers around the player's character avoiding various traps and obstacles in order to be able to die peacefully. Development Rage in Peace started out as a prototype developed during the \\"Indies vs PewDiePie\\" Game Jam in 2014. Although the game did not make top 10 out of the 800 submissions to be played in PewDiePie's channel (it ranked 17th), it was played on his stream regardless, causing other YouTube channels to play the game as well and drawing interest into it. The game is the first video game title released by Rolling Glory, which largely operates as a creative digital services firm and had only 2 employees working full-time on the game. Its developers remarked in an interview that the game was intended to remind the players \\"of their own mortality in a non-scary way\\", with them also stating that the game was loosely inspired by Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho's stories. The game's soundtrack was done through collaboration with an Indonesian indie label. At the end of July, it was announced that Rage in Peace would also see a Nintendo Switch release. The game was released on both Steam and the Nintendo eShop on 8 November 2018. Prior to the full release, the game's demo was made available on platforms such as itch.io, indieDB and Game Jolt.

Several thousand semi-wild ponies run free, along with several thousand cattle and lesser numbers of donkeys, sheep and (in autumn) pigs. These are owned by the commoners who pay an annual grazing fee known as the ‚Äòmarking fee‚Äô. There are currently five New Forest agisters employed by the Court of Verderers, each with responsibility for a specific forest area. The post of agister is medieval in origin, the name deriving from the word ‚Äòagist‚Äô meaning 'to take in to graze for payment'. Originally agisters were known as ‚Äòmarksmen‚Äô, from their role in collecting the marking fees - a role which they still have today. Agisters spend much of their time out on the forest, often on horseback, checking the condition of the land and of the commoners‚Äô ponies and other stock. They are on call 24 hours a day to deal with problems such as stuck, straying or injured animals. They also watch out for breaches of the verderers‚Äô bylaws and for the presence on the forest of unauthorised animals. Each year between mid August and early November the agisters organise regular ‚Äòpony drifts‚Äô, in which the commoners get together to gather in their ponies for an annual welfare check. Rounded-up ponies are recorded and checked by the agisters against the marking fees paid by their owners. Any pony that the owner wishes to sell or to take in for the winter can be removed from the forest at this point. The remaining ponies have their tails clipped in a distinctive manner to identify those normally living in a particular agister‚Äôs area, and they are turned back out for another twelve months.

She showed very good form when trained in France, winning three races including the Prix Penelope and finished second in the Prix de Diane. When transferred to race in the United States in 2018, she improved to become one of the best female racehorses in North America, winning the Jenny Wiley Stakes, Diana Stakes, Beverly D. Stakes and Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. She was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Female Turf Horse of the year. In 2019, she repeated her wins in both the Diana and Beverly D., setting a course record in the latter race. Background Sistercharlie is a bay mare with a white blaze and a long white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by the French-based Ecurie des Monceaux. In October the yearling filly was put up for auction in the Aqrana sale at Deauville and was bought for ‚Ç¨12,000 by the bloodstock agency NATAF Paul. She subsequently entered the ownership of White Birch Farm & Mme J Cygler and was sent into training in France with Henri-Alex Pantall. She was sired by Myboycharlie who won the Anglesey Stakes and the Prix Morny as a two-year-old in 2007. His other foal have included the Group 1 winning mares Euro Charline (Beverly D. Stakes) and Jameka (Caulfield Cup). Her dam, Starlet's Sister, showed little racing ability, failing to win in three starts in France. She was a great-granddaughter of Alea who produced Noalcoholic and was the female-line ancestor of the Preakness Stakes winner Red Bullet. Racing career=2016: two-year-old season= Sistercharlie began her racing career in a maiden race over 1900 metres on the polytrack surface on 17 December in which he started at odds of 5.1/1 in a twelve-runner field. Ridden by Pierre-Charles Boudot she won by a short head from Tres Belle, with the pair finishing four lengths clear of the rest. =2017: three- year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Sistercharlie finished fourth behind Music Lover over 2000 metres on heavy turf in the Listed Prix de Rose de Mai at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 11 March. On 2 April, over 2100 metres on better ground at the same track she started at odds of 5/1 for the Listed Prix Durban in which she was ridden by Maxime Guyon and won by three quarters of a length from Palombe. Three weeks later, over the same course and distance, the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix Penelope. With Guyon again the saddle she was made the 4.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Rhythmique and Palombe in a seven-runner field which also included Music Lover. After being retrained towards the rear she produced a sustained run in the straight, took the lead 70 metres from the finish and won by a length from the Freddy Head-trained Listen In. On 18 June at Chantilly Racecourse Sistercharlie was stepped up to Group 1 class for the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres and started at odds of 12.1/1 in a sixteen-runner field. Ridden by Boudot she was repeatedly blocked as she attempted to make progress in the straight but finished strongly to take second place, a length behind the winner Senga. Shortly after the race Sistercharlie bought privately by Peter Brant and was transferred to the stable of Chad Brown in the United States. On her debut for her new connections she ran in the Belmont Oaks a Grade I race over ten furlongs at Belmont Park in July. Ridden by John Velasquez she started the 7/4 favourite but was beaten a neck into second by the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf winner New Money Honey. After her run at Belmont the filly picked up a serious lung infection which kept her of the track for the rest of the year. =2018: four-year-old season= Sistercharlie was ridden by Velasquez in all of her 2018 races. She began her third campaign in the Grade I Jenny Wiley Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Keeneland Racecourse on 14 April and was made the 3.4/1 second choice in the betting behind the Argentinian mare Donna Bruja. The other nine runners included Off Limits (Matriarch Stakes), La Coronel (Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes) and Cambodia (Yellow Ribbon Handicap). After racing in mid-division, Sistercharlie took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win by two and a quarter lengths from her six-year-old stablemate Fourstar Crook. Velasquez said \\"She sat really well. By the three-eighths pole, I knew I was in a good position‚Äîjust looking for where I was going to shoot through. I got through ... and had the best horse\\". At Belmont Park on 8 June Sistercharlie started odds-on favourite for the New York Stakes but was beaten a head by Fourstar Crook, to whom she was conceding two pounds in weight. The Diana Stakes over nine furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on 21 July start favourite ahead of six opponents including New Money Honey, A Raving Beauty (Just A Game Stakes), Proctor's Ledge (Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes). Sistercharlie raced in fifth place before making a strong late challenge on the outside and took the lead in the final stride to win by a nose from the outsider Ultra Brat. Chad Brown commented \\"This isn't her ideal distance, nor was the mile and a sixteenth in the Jenny Wiley. But just with sheer class, heart, and ability, she can do it\\". On 11 August, in the Beverly D Stakes over nine and a half furlongs at Arlington Park, the filly started 1.6/1 favourite ahead of eight opponents including Fourstar Crook, Donna Bruja, Daddys Lil Darling (American Oaks) and the Irish filly Athena (Belmont Oaks). Sistercharlie was restrained towards the rear before producing her customary late run on the outside, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by half a length from Fourstar Crook. After the race Velasquez said \\"She's a really good horse, but she has some quirks. She can run, though\\" while Brow commented \\"She's the type of mare any trainer would love to have\\". On 3 November Sistercharlie contested the 20th running of the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf over eleven furlongs at Churchill Downs and started at odds of 5/1 in a fourteen-runner field. The British-trained Wild Illusion started favourite while the other European challengers were Princess Yaiza (Prix de Royallieu) Athena, Magic Wand (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Eziyra (Blandford Stakes). The only other American contenders seriously considered in the betting were Fourstar Crook and A Raving Beauty. After racing in mid-division as A Raving Beauty set the pace, Sistercharlie moved upon the outside approaching the final turn before launching her challenge in the straight. She overtook Wild Illusion and A Raving Beauty in the last hundred yards to win by a neck and three quarters of a length. After the race Brown said \\"She's all class, this horse, and she knows where the wire is. She showed her heart there in the last stages\\". Peter Brant said \\"This mare has had so much bad luck and she's overcome it... she's just overcome everything and she's very special, very special to me and very special to my family and I'm sure very special to Chad\\". Pedigree *Through her dam, Sistercharlie was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Miswaki, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

RISE precisely tracks the location of the lander to measure how much Mars's axis wobbles as it orbits the Sun. These observations will provide new constraints on the core radius and help determine whether the core of Mars is mostly liquid, and which other elements, besides iron, may be present. This study will also help scientists understand why Mars's magnetic field is so weak, as compared to Earth's. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 and landed on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia on 26 November 2018. Overview  The Insight lander with its solar panels deployed in a cleanroom The Principal Investigator for RISE is William Folkner of JPL, who led the 1997 investigation of Mars's core using the radio link between Earth and NASA's Mars Pathfinder (also included the Sojourner rover). RISE uses the spacecraft's radio connection with Earth to assess perturbations of Mars's rotation axis to within 10 centimeters.Mars InSight Landing Press Kit. (PDF) NASA. Published: November 2018.NASA's InSight Passes Halfway to Mars, Instruments Check In. D. C. Agle, NASA News. 20 August 2018. These measurements can provide information about the size and composition of Mars's core.The Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment on the InSight Mission to Mars. William M.

Online The radio science equipment is largely the same as used for the Mars Exploration Rover mission, and it includes two medium-gain horn antennas (MGAs) on the lander deck, and an X band radio transponder (8 GHz) and transmitter inside the lander, where electronics can be shielded from the harsh conditions of space.The Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) for the InSight mission to Mars. (PDF) W. M. Folkner, S. W. Asmar, V. Dehant and R. W. Warwick. 43rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2012. Although the lander will communicate all other science data in UHF to relay orbiters, the X band can be used directly with Earth in case of some problems with relay through an orbiter. In principle, after InSight lands on Mars, the lander reflects a signal sent from Earth, revealing its exact location and velocity in space.Mars InSight Mission - RISE. NASA/JPL. Accessed: 12 November 2018. In doing so, the experiment measures changes in the signal, known as the Doppler effect as Mars -and the lander on it- move around the Sun. Scientists can use this information to understand how much Mars wobbles in its orbit, which relates to the nature of its iron-rich core. A planet with a liquid core will wobble more as it spins, compared to one that is solid at its core. The sensitivity is such that RISE can also detect the rotation changes caused by the seasonal redistribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice as it sublimates in the summer and condenses at the poles, causing tiny changes in the rotation rate of Mars, translating into a variation in the length of its days.  Objectives Interiors of Earth, Mars and the Moon (artist concept) The goals of the RISE experiment are to deduce the size and density of the Martian core through estimation of the precession and nutation of the spin axis. The precession and nutation estimates will be based on measurements of the relative velocity of the InSight lander and tracking stations on Earth known as the Deep Space Network. The perturbations resemble the wobble of a spinning top and occur on two time scales. The longer wobble, called precession, takes about 165,000 years and it is directly related to the mass and diameter of the iron-rich core. The shorter-period wobbles, called nutations, occur on time scales of less than a year and are extremely small. Since they are determined by the density of the core, they will help determine if the core is mostly liquid or solid. This study will also help scientists understand why Mars's magnetic field is so weak, as compared to Earth's.

Social media platforms encompass websites such as Facebook, YouTube, WeChat, Instagram, Quora, QQ, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, Baidu Tieba, LinkedIn, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, and VK. Political processes and activities include all activities that pertain to the governance of a country or area. This includes political organization, global politics, political corruption, political parties, and political values. The internet has created channels of communication that play a key role in circulating news, and social media has the power to change not just the message, but the dynamics of political corruption, values, and the dynamics of conflict in politics. Through the use of social media in election processes, global conflict, and extreme politics, diplomacy around the world has become less private and susceptive to the public perception. Background= Participatory role = Social media have been championed as allowing anyone with an Internet connection to become a content creator and empowering their users. The idea of ‚Äúnew media populism‚Äù encompasses how citizens can include disenfranchised citizens, and allow the public to have an engaged and active role in political discourse. New media, including social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, can enhance people's access to political information. Social media platforms and the internet have facilitated the dissemination of political information that counters mainstream media tactics that are often centralized and top-down, and include high barriers to entry. Writer Howard Rheingold characterized the community created on social networking sites: > \\"The political significance of computer mediated communication lies in its > capacity to challenge the existing political hierarchy‚Äôs monopoly on > powerful communications media, and perhaps thus revitalize citizen-based > democracy.\\" Scholar Derrick de Kerckhove described the new technology in media: > \\"In a networked society, the real powershift is from the producer to the > consumer, and there is a redistribution of controls and power. On the Web, > Karl Marx‚Äôs dream has been realized: the tools and the means of production > are in the hands of the workers.\\" The role of social media in democratizing media participation, which proponents herald as ushering in a new era of participatory democracy, with all users able to contribute news and comments, may fall short of the ideals. International survey data suggest online media audience members are largely passive consumers, while content creation is dominated by a small number of users who post comments and write new content. Others argue that the effect of social media will vary from one country to another, with domestic political structures playing a greater role than social media in determining how citizens express opinions about stories of current affairs involving the state. Most people see social media platforms as censoring objectionable political views.https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/08/19/most- americans-think-social-media-sites-censor-political-viewpoints/ = As a news source = See also Social media and political communication in the United States. Adults in the United States who have access to the internet are increasingly getting political news and information from social media platforms. A 2016 Pew Research study found that 62% of adults get news on social media. 361x361px In addition, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, lead the social media platforms in which the majority of the users use the platforms to acquire news information. Of all United States adults, 67% use the platform with 44% who use the platform to get news. 365x365px According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report in 2013, the percentage of online news users who blog about news issues ranges from 1‚Äì5%. Greater percentages use social media to comment on news, with participation ranging from 8% in Germany to 38% in Brazil. But online news users are most likely to just talk about online news with friends offline or use social media to share stories without creating content. The rapid propagation of information on social media, spread by word of mouth, can impact the perception of political figures quickly with information that may or may not be true. When political information is propagated in this manner on purpose, the spread of information on social media for political means can benefit campaigns. On the other hand, the word- of-mouth propagation of negative information concerning a political figure can be damaging. For example, the use of the social media platform Twitter by United States congressman Anthony Weiner to send inappropriate messages played a role in his resignation. = Attention economy = Social media, especially news that is spread through social media sites, plays into the idea of the attention economy. In which content that attracts more attention will be seen, shared, and disseminated far more than news content that does gather as much traction from the public. Tim Wu from Columbia Law School coins the attention economy as ‚Äúthe resale of human attention.‚Äù A communication platform such as social media is persuasive, and often works to change or influence opinions when it comes to political views because of the abundance of ideas, thoughts, and opinions circulating through the social media platform. It is found that news use leads to political persuasion, therefore the more that people use social media platforms for news sources, the more their political opinions will be affected. Despite that, people are expressing less trust in their government and others due to media use- therefore social media directly affects trust in media use. It is proven that while reading newspapers there is an increase in social trust where on the contrary watching the news on television weakened trust in others and news sources. Social media, or more specifically news media- plays an important role in democratic societies because they allow for participation among citizens.Therefore, when it comes to healthy democratic networks, it is crucial that that news remains true so it doesn't affect citizens‚Äô levels of trust. A certain amount of trust is necessary for a healthy and well functioning democratic system. Younger generations are becoming more involved in politics due to the increase of political news posted on various types of social media. Due to the heavier use of social media among younger generations, they are exposed to politics more frequently, and in a way that is integrated into their online social lives. While informing younger generations of political news is important, there are many biases within the realms of social media. In May 2016, former Facebook Trending News curator Benjamin Fearnow revealed his job was to \\"massage the algorithm,\\" but dismissed any \\"intentional, outright bias\\" by either human or automated efforts within the company. Fearnow was fired by Facebook after being caught leaking several internal company debates about Black Lives Matter and presidential candidate Donald Trump. = As a public utility = A key debate centers on whether or not social media is a public good based on the premises of non-rival and non-excludable consumption. Social media can be considered an impure public good as it can be excludable given the rights of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to remove content, disable accounts, and filter information based on algorithms and community standards. Arguments for platforms such as Google in being treated as a public utility and public service provider include statements from Benjamin Barber in The Nation > > \\"For new media to be potential equalizers, they must be treated as public > utilities, recognizing that spectrum abundance (the excuse for > privatization) does not prevent monopoly ownership of hardware and software > platforms and hence cannot guarantee equal civic, educational, and cultural > access to citizens.\\" Similarly, Zeynep Tufeckig argues online services are natural monopolies that underwrite the \\"corporatization of social commons\\" and the \\"privatization of our publics.\\" One argument that displays the nature of social media as an impure public good is the fact that the control over content remains in the hands of a few large media networks, Google and Facebook, for example. Google and Facebook have the power to shape the environment under personal and commercial goals that promotes profitability, as opposed to promoting citizen voice and public deliberation.  Government regulation  Proponents and aims for regulation of social media are growing due to economic concerns of monopolies of the platforms, to issues of privacy, censorship, network neutrality and information storage. The discussion of regulation is complicated due to the issue how Facebook, and Google are increasingly becoming a service, information pipeline, and content provider, and thus centers on how the government would regulate both the platform as a service and information provider. Thus, other proponents advocate for ‚Äúalgorithmic neutrality‚Äù, or the aim for search engines on social media platforms to rank data without human intervention. Opponents of regulation of social media platforms argue that platforms such as Facebook and Twitter do not resemble traditional public utilities, and regulation would harm consumer welfare as public utility regulation can hinder innovation and competition. Second, as the First Amendment values are criticized on social media platforms, the media providers should retain the power to how the platform is configured.  Effect on democracy  Social media has been criticized as being detrimental to democracy. According to Ronald Deibert, \\"The world of social media is more conducive to extreme, emotionally charged, and divisive types of content than it is to calm, principled considerations of competing or complex narratives\\". On the contrary, Ethan Zuckerman says that social media presents the opportunity to inform more people, amplify voices, and allow for an array of diverse voices to speak. = Democratization = The Arab Spring  During the peak of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the Internet and social media played a huge role in facilitating information. At that time, Hosni Mubarak was the president of Egypt and head the regime for almost 30 years. Mubarak was so threatened by the immense power that the Internet and social media gave the people that the government successfully shut down the Internet, using the Ramses Exchange, for a period of time in February 2011. Egyptians used Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a means to communicate and organize demonstrations and rallies to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak. Statistics show that during this time the rate of Tweets from Egypt increased from 2,300 to 230,000 per day and the top 23 protest videos had approximately 5.5 million views. =Disinformation= Though fake news can generate some utility for consumers, in terms of confirming far-right beliefs and spreading propaganda in favor of a presidential candidate, it also imposes private and social costs. For example, one social cost to consumer is the spread of disinformation which can make it harder for consumers to seek out the truth and, in the case of the 2016 Election, for consumers to choose an electoral candidate. Summarized by a Congressional Research Service Study in 2017, > ‚ÄúCyber tools were also used [by Russia] to create psychological effects in > the American population. The likely collateral effects of these activities > include compromising the fidelity of information, sowing discord and doubt > in the American public about the validity of intelligence community reports, > and prompting questions about the democratic process itself.‚Äù The marginal social cost of fake news is exponential, as the first article is shared it can affect a small number of people, but as the article is circulated more throughout Facebook, the negative externality multiplies. As a result, the quantity demanded of news can shift up around election season as consumers seek to find correct news, however the quantity demanded can also shift down as people have a lower trust in mainstream media. In the American public, a Gallup poll in 2016 found ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äô trust in the mass media ‚Äòto report the news fully, accurately and fairly‚Äô was, at 32%, the lowest in the organization's polling history.‚Äù In addition, trust in mainstream media is lower in Republican and far-right political viewers at 14%. About 72% of American adults claim that social media firms excessively control and influence the politics today, as per the June 16-22 survey conducted by Pew Research Center. Only 21% believe that the power held by these social media firms over today‚Äôs politics is of the right amount, while 6% believe it is not enough. = Advertisement = Political advertisements‚Äîfor example, encouraging people to vote for or against a particular candidate, or to take a position on a particular issue‚Äîhave often been placed on social media. On 22 November 2019, Twitter said it would no longer facilitate political advertising anywhere in the world. = Election interference = The 2016 United States Presidential Election was an example in which social media was used by the state actor Russia to influence public opinion. Tactics such as propaganda, trolling, and bots were used to leak fake news stories that included an \\"FBI agent had been killed after leaking Clinton‚Äôs emails\\" and \\"Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump.‚Äù Studies have found that pro-Trump news was as many as four-time more than pro-Clinton fake news, and a third of the pro-Trump tweets were generated by bots. = Election results = In October 2020, Twitter announced its new policy that candidates will be forbidden to claim victory until their election win has been credibly projected by news outlets or officially certified. Role in conflict There are four ways social media plays a significant role in conflict:. # Social media platforms allow information to be framed in mainstream platforms which limits communication. # Social media enables news stories to quickly go viral and later can lead to misinterpretations that can cause conflict. # Strategies and the adaption of social media has caused a change in focus amongst leaders from administrative dynamics to new media technology. # Technological advancements in communication can increase the power of persuasion leading to corruption, scandals, and violence on social media platforms. Map of 2011 Arab Spring ProtestsThe role of technological communication and social media in the world can lead to political, economic, and social conflict due to its unmonitored system, cheap interface, and accessibility. = Non-state actors and militant groups = As the world is becoming increasingly connected via the power of the Internet, political movements, including militant groups, have begun to see social media as a major organizing and recruiting tool. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL, ISIS, and Daesh, has used social media to promote its cause. ISIS produces an online magazine named the Islamic State Report to recruit more fighters. ISIS produces online materials in a number of languages and uses recruiters to contact potential recruitees over the Internet. ISIS in Iraq and Syria In Canada, two girls from Montreal left their country to join ISIS in Syria after exploring ISIS on social media and eventually being recruited. On Twitter, there is an app called the Dawn of Glad Tidings that users can download and keep up to date on news about ISIS. Hundreds of users around the world have signed up for the app, which once downloaded will post tweets and hash-tags from accounts that are in support of ISIS. As ISIS marched on the northern region of Iraq, tweets in support of their efforts reached a high of 40,000 a day. Support of ISIS online is a factor in the radicalization of youth. Mass media has yet to adopt the view that social media plays a vital link in the radicalization of people. When tweets supportive of ISIS make their way onto Twitter, they result in 72 re-tweets to the original, which further spreads the message of ISIS. These tweets have made their way to the account known as active hashtags, which further helps broadcast ISIS's message as the account sends out to its followers the most popular hashtags of the day. Other militant groups such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban are increasingly using social media to raise funds, recruit and radicalize persons, and it has become increasingly effective. = Weaponization by state actors = Social media platforms have been weaponized by state-sponsored cyber groups to attack governments in the United States, the European Union, and the Middle East. Although phishing attacks via email are the most commonly used tactic to breach government networks, phishing attacks on social media rose 500% in 2016. As with email-based phishing attacks, the majority of phishing attacks on social media are financially motivated cyber crimes that install malware. However, cyber groups associated with Russia, Iran, and China have used social media to conduct cyberattacks and undermine democratic processes in the West. During the 2017 French presidential election, for example, Facebook detected and removed fake accounts linked to the Russian cyber group Fancy Bear, who were posing as \\"friends of friends\\" of Emmanuel Macron associates to steal information from them. Cyber groups associated with Iran, China, and Russia have used LinkedIn to steal trade secrets, gain access to critical infrastructure, or recruit spies. These social engineering attacks can be multi-platform, with threat actors initiating contact on one platform but continuing communication on more private channel. The Iranian-backed cyber group COBALT GYPSY created a fake persona across multiple social media platforms and initiated contact on LinkedIn before moving to Facebook and email. In December 2019, a chat and video calling application developed by the United Arab Emirates, called ToTok was identified as a spying tool by the US intelligence.

It used a HEAT type charge. This weapon was used by the CQC units of the Imperial Japanese Army. The weapon itself was a conical hollow charge anti-tank mine, placed inside a metallic container and attached to the end of a wooden stick. The weapon was officially adopted by the Japanese Army in 1945; in that year it caused its first victims in the Pacific Theater, where it commonly saw action against American armour. Later that year, some Japanese Imperial Army manuals of the weapon were discovered by US troops.  Design  The weapon itself was a conical hollow charge attached to one end of the weapon, which was a wooden stick used to hold the weapon during its transport and use. The mine had equally spaced three legs facing forwards, all around the conical explosive base of the weapon. The detonator of the weapon was situated at the end of the conical base. The mine was 30.48 cm in length, and the wooden stick was 99.06 cm, which made the total length of the weapon 129.54 cm. The mine had a diameter of 8 cm, and its body was about 3.175 cm in diameter. Its total weight was 6.48 kg, of which 2.948 kg were explosives. Operation To use the mine, the soldier would remove the security pin, and then charge the enemy armour, just like in a bayonet charge, making the top of the mine collide with the objective. The weapon needed to be held by the center with the left hand and by the bottom with the other hand. When the legs of the mine hit the objective, the handle was pulled forward, cutting a pin and making the detonator move forward to the detonator charge. This would set off the mine, blowing up its user and, probably, the targeted enemy armour. Armour penetration The mine was capable of penetrating about 150 mm of RHA at an angle of 90¬∫, and up to 100 mm at an angle of 60¬∫. However, the mine would almost always impact at 90¬∫ because the impact angle with the objective would be decided by the weapon's user, and he would probably aim for a 90¬∫ armour plate. Combat record The weapon was used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the later stages of the Second World War in the Pacific Theater against American armour, until the end of the war in 1945, the same year that the weapon was introduced into service. However, no report has been given which shows that it actually worked as a weapon. The U.S. Intelligence reports in March 1945 that they met this weapon for the first time in Leyte island, The Philippines in 1944, and later in Manila as well. It also reports that \\"To date all attempts by the enemy to use the Lunge Mine against our tanks have met with failure\\" and rates it as \\"Perhaps the oddest of these antitank charges\\". In Vietnam it seems to be an icon of the First Indochina War, specifically during the Battle of Hanoi, together with a Battalion Commander Nguyen Van Thieng who tried to use it; however, \\"the bombs failed to explode. In the end, he was shot and heroically sacrificed\\".Explanatory board for replica of lunge mine held by a soldier at Vietnam Military History Museum, Hanoi; verified in December, 2019 There are also some records of this weapon being used by the North Vietnamese soldiers during the Vietnam War, where it was also used against American armoured vehicles .

The first labour party organised on the basis of a Parliamentary constituency, it successfully backed Tom Mann as secretary of the Independent Labour Party, and Victor Grayson as the local Member of Parliament. Its successor is the Colne Valley Constituency Labour Party. Establishment On 16 November 1890, members of the Slaithwaite branch of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants decided to form a trade union club. Following a series of organising meetings, they secured a cellar on Nabbs Lane, naming it the Social Democratic Club, and displayed a red flag inside. By 1891, there was considerable interest in trade union candidates for elected offices, independent of existing political parties, inspired by the example of the Bradford Labour Union. In mid-July, the Yorkshire Factory Times published a letter signed \\"A Colne Valley Voter\\", which called for a labour candidate in the Colne Valley Parliamentary seat at the next general election. At the Social Democratic Club, on 21 July 1891, a meeting was held, chaired by G. W. Haigh. James Bartley of the Bradford Labour Union was present, along with Allan Gee and Ben Turner, leading figures in the locally-based West Riding Power Loom Weavers' Association. On the proposal of two local trade unionists, George Henry Cotton and George Garside, the meeting agreed to form the Colne Valley Division Labour Union. Unlike the Bradford Labour Union organisation, it would cover a single Parliamentary constituency, and it was agreed to invite Tom Mann to contest it at the next general election. The first committee of the organisation consisted of George Garside (president), Kossuth Pogson (treasurer), George W. Haigh (secretary), W. H. Barber, Joseph Baxter, George Henry Cotton, Savile Hirst, Walter May, Ephraim Sykes, and James Sykes, with Sam Eastwood co-opted shortly afterwards. By the end of the year, some sympathetic non-trade unionists had also joined, including France Littlewood and Ben Shaw. Garside was the leading figure in the party's organisation, while Gee was its main publicist, writing regularly for the Yorkshire Factory Times in its support. Early growth Over the first couple of years, the party worked to establish branches throughout the constituency; by the end of 1892, there were labour clubs in Slaithwaite, Honley, Marsden, Milnsbridge, Golcar and Longwood, which organised social events, and also lectures. While trade unions were generally weak in the area, in Mossley, the cotton industry unions had a substantial membership, and with the support of Mossley Card and Blowing Room Operatives' Association leader Matthew Burrow Farr, the party held a meeting in November 1892 attended by 500 workers. Leonard Hall, organising secretary of the British Labour Amalgamation, was also supportive, and ran a joint recruitment campaign. In addition, the party held public meetings, and approached prominent individuals who it believed might support it. The party's first electoral contest was the West Riding County Council election of 1892. From five possible candidates, the party selected George Garside, and he won the seat with 55.1% of the vote, defeating the Liberal Godfrey Woodhead. The party agreed to cover Garside's transport costs and loss of wages for attending council meetings. Following this, Tom Quarmby was elected to Linthwaite School Board unopposed, on a platform of providing free books and providing education free of charge, while Pogson and Edwin Hoskins failed to win election to the Slaithwaite School Board. Mann showed some interest in contesting the Parliamentary seat, attending meetings of the party in August and October 1891, but initially he favoured focusing on trade unionism. He again showed interest early in 1892, after he lost the election to become general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, but ultimately he did not stand, probably due to financial concerns. The CVLU sent questionnaires to both candidates in the seat in the 1892 UK general election, but reported that it could not recommend either, and so played no part in the election. Despite this, Mann continued to regularly visit and speak in support of the CVLU, and early in 1893 he finally agreed to stand in the next election. General election contests and the ILP The CVLU broadly supported the formation of the national Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893, but followed Mann's lead in initially remaining separate. It affiliated in January 1894, naming Mann as its delegate, and successfully nominated him to become the ILP's first general secretary. For the 1894 urban district council elections, except where ILP candidates were standing, the CVLU resolved to support any candidates who supported trade unions and open council meetings. Littlewood won election in Honley, but fourteen other labour candidates were defeated. The 1895 council election was more successful, with Garside holding his seat with 61.4% of the vote, while Farr won the Yorkshire ward in Mossley, and Sanderson Hoyle was only narrowly defeated in the Cheshire ward. This gave the party hope for the 1895 UK general election, but Mann was easily defeated, taking only 13.4% of the vote. Disappointed by the result, he withdrew from his connection with the CVLU, and contested by- elections in other seats he felt were better prospects. In 1897, the CVLU interviewed five possible successors to Mann as Prospective Parliamentary Candidate: Pete Curran, J. R. Clynes, Bruce Glasier, Leonard Hall and E. J. Sale. Sale was soon removed from contention, replaced by Frank Smith, but by 1899 the party decided not to run any candidate. By then, membership had slumped to only 83 and several branches had ceased functioning, but despite this, the party maintained its positions on the county council and school board, and increased its district council representation. Colne Valley Labour League and Victor Grayson The party was reorganised in 1900, becoming the Colne Valley Labour League (CVLL), and its membership again began increasing, particularly once the Labour Party performed well in the 1906 UK general election. By 1907, it had 691 members, and it was determined to stand a candidate in the 1907 Parliamentary by-election. It considered seven possible candidates: Edward Black, Charlie Glyde, Victor Grayson, T. E. Moorhouse, William Pickles, Ben Riley and Russell Williams. Moorhouse was disqualified for having held membership for less than a year, Black and Glyde were deemed unsuitable, and Williams withdrew, preferring to contest Huddersfield. William Crawford Anderson and Ben Turner were added to the list late on. A delegate meeting voted for Anderson and Grayson as its two preferred options, to go forward to a ballot of all members. However, Anderson decided to withdraw, and Grayson was thereby selected. The ILP sent a delegation of J. Howard and Philip Snowden to decide whether to give financial backing to the candidacy; they recommended it do so, but the ILP decided to wait on a decision of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee, and that ultimately decided not to support it. Grayson therefore stood as the candidate of the Colne Valley Labour League, and narrowly won the election on a strongly socialist platform. Grayson was accepted as part of the Labour Party group in Parliament, but the lack of ILP backing for the election campaign led the CVLL to drift away from the ILP. In 1908, it renamed itself as the Colne Valley Socialist League, emphasising its political principles. The party sponsored Grayson in the Parliamentary seat at the January 1910 UK general election, again without Labour or ILP backing, causing Littlewood to resign, but Grayson was easily beaten, taking third place. The following year, the CVLL followed Grayson in defecting to the new British Socialist Party, but soon fell into dispute with the new organisation and resigned. After a few years of independence, in 1918 it affiliated to the Labour Party, which had decided to establish constituency labour parties. The Colne Valley Socialist League thereby became the Colne Valley Divisional Labour Party.

Roberson was working for the bar as a security guard when four people were non-fatally shot by a gunman. After Roberson subdued and pinned the shooter to the ground, he was shot by a Midlothian police officer arriving at the scene. Covey was placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting was investigated. Witnesses stated that Roberson was wearing a vest that had the word \\"SECURITY\\" printed on it, while an Illinois State Police (ISP) preliminary investigation stated he was wearing plain black clothing with no markings identifying him as security. The ISP report stated the Midlothian officer gave Roberson \\"multiple verbal commands\\" to drop his gun and get on the ground, while witnesses said the officer shot Roberson \\"not even five seconds\\" after ordering Roberson to drop the gun he had in his hand.  Jemel Roberson  Jemel Roberson was a security guard at the Manny's Blue Room bar in Robbins, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. At the time of his death, Roberson had a 9-month old son. Roberson himself was an aspiring police officer. He was a 2010 graduate from the Lane Tech High School in the Chicago area, where he played on the school's basketball team. Apart from working as a security guard, Roberson was also an organist for several local churches, and was supposed to play at the New Spiritual Light Baptist Church later on the day of the shooting. According to the Cook County Sheriff's Office, Roberson was licensed to carry a gun.  Shooting  Around 4:00 am multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Midlothian police responded to 911 calls of a shooting at Manny's Blue Room Bar in Robbins, Illinois. Prior to police arrival, a security guard had requested a group of drunk men to leave the bar and an armed suspect had returned and opened fire. In response armed security guards returned fire, and Roberson apprehended the suspect outside the bar. Eyewitnesses claimed that Roberson had the suspect pinned to the ground with his knee when police arrived and fatally shot Roberson, after multiple bystanders shouted warnings that Roberson was a security guard. An eyewitness told reporters that after the shooting another officer turned to the officer involved and said; \\"Man you didn't have to do that, you didn't have to do that. We know these guys. We told you they're security.\\" A statement by the Midlothian police chief said: \\"Upon arrival Officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar. A Midlothian Officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced dead at an area hospital.\\"  Investigation and legal proceedings  The Illinois State Police are handling the investigation into the fatal shooting of Roberson. The officer was placed on a paid administrative leave in the meantime. The officer has been with the Midlothian police department for almost seven years, assigned to the patrol division, and is also a SWAT team leader. The police department initially argued that Roberson ignored \\"verbal commands\\" before the shooting, but later released a second statement claiming that the shooting was a case of \\"friendly fire,\\" and that Roberson‚Äôs death was a tragic accident. After previously identifying Roberson as an \\"armed subject\\" in reports, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney issued a November statement calling Roberson \\"a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation.\\" On November 12, 2018, an autopsy showed that Roberson was shot multiple times, and the death was ruled homicide. The same day, the Roberson's mother filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Village of Midlothian and the officer who shot Roberson. Protests Shortly after the death of Roberson, multiple protests ensued in Midlothian, but most were centered around the Midlothian Police Department and Village Hall. Later on, amidst the George Floyd Protests, Midlothian residents would protest the shooting of Roberson once again.

He served as deputy prime minister (1994, 1996‚Äì97) and minister of education (1995‚Äì97) of Thailand. Life and career Rangsitpol completed a bachelor's degree in political science at Thammasat University in 1960 and the Management Development Program of Asian Institute of Management, Manila in 1976. He started working as a sales representative for Caltex Oil Thailand in 1961, being promoted to sales supervisor, district manager, general sales manager and general manager over the following decades. He finally served as chairman and managing director of that company during the early 1990s. Rangsitpol was Senator in 1987, National Legislative Assembly in 1991, and Senator Thai Senate in 1992. Between 1993 and 1994 he was the governor of the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA). In 1994, Rangsitpol joined the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of retired general Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and was appointed deputy prime minister in Chuan Leekpai's cabinet in October of the same year. Together with Chamlong Srimuang and transport minister Vichit Surapongchai he formed a team to tackle Bangkok's traffic problems. However, he lost that position after a few weeks. Sukavich was appointed minister of education in Banharn Silpa-archa's cabinet in July 1995. In addition, he was the secretary-general of the NAP from 1995 to 1997. He was alleged to have contributed 100 million baht to the party's campaign fund. Rangsitpol as Minister of Education launched a series of education reforms in 1995. The aim was to enhance the quality of education from 1995 to achieve educational excellence by 2007. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996, representing Bangkok's 13th constituency. After New Aspiration's electoral victory, Sukavich again was a deputy prime minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's cabinet in addition to his post as Minister of Education. Moreover, he served as Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) council president in 1996. When Rangsitpol was appointed education minister in 1996 he became embroiled in a long-running scandal over the purchase of overpriced computers for schools, but was cleared of any wrongdoing during a subsequent defamation suit. Sukavich was also criticised for keeping in force a ban on \\"gender/sex deviant\\" and \\"wrong-gendered\\" (i.e. homosexual and transsexual) students at the Rajabhat teacher training institutes, saying that \\"homosexuals are no different to drug addicts who need treatment. ... I do not want these people to be role models for children.\\" He retired from the ministerial post in August 1997, being replaced by his intra- party rival Chingchai Mongcoltam, who lifted the anti-gay ban. Rangsitpol also lost the deputy premiership in November 1997 when Chavalit was ousted by a no- confidence vote during the Asian financial crisis. In 2001 Rangsitpol was re- elected as member of parliament, being number three of the New Aspiration Party list. Together with party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and most of the NAP lawmakers, he switched to the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) of prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra later in the same year. In 2005, he was re-elected once again, this time a representative of the TRT party list. As one of 111 executive members of the TRT, he was banned from political activities for five years after the 2006 coup d'√©tat. He expressed no wish to return to politics after the ban expired.

In 2013, the rifle range which was constructed during WWI, along with Fort Caswell itself, was designated as a National Register of Historic Places property. Location A little over two miles west northwest of Fort Caswell which sits on the east end of Oak Island, the site is located in a residential section known as Caswell Dunes. Open to the public, it can be reached by turning off Caswell Beach Rd. onto Pinehurst Dr. and proceeding north for about 200 yards to Foxfire Trace. Construction Fort Caswell Rifle Range The structure is mostly below grade and composed of three sections of concrete walls which range from 8\\" to 1‚Äô thick and in total measure in length. Sloping from north to south and open on top, the 9.5‚Äô north wall is 3‚Äô higher than the south wall; the structure's width varies among the three sections. The 14‚Äô long eastern section originally had a roof and served as a storage room for target supplies and tools. It had a doorway leading to the 76‚Äô long center section, which essentially served as a walkway between the storage room and the 94‚Äô long target area at the western end. A door opening connects the center and western sections. \\"May 20th, 1918\\" is inscribed in the ¬∑south wall of the middle section. History WWI Centennial Memorial Plaque Fort Caswell Rifle Range Monument The US War Department approved construction of the rifle range on January 21, 1918 for small arms training of soldiers. After World War II, it was declared surplus and sold, and over the years left untended, the range walls were undermined due to tree roots and water infiltration. Of special concern were the load-bearing supports across interior doorways which were cracking and separating from the walls. In 2012, work started on restoring the range, which involved among other things using contracted labor and volunteers to initially stabilize the walls. Currently, Friends of Fort Caswell Rifle Range, a non-profit formed in 2015, is carrying on this task with the full support of the Town of Caswell Beach and the Caswell Dunes Homeowners Association. On April 5, 2018, the U.S. World War I Centennial Commission and the Pritzker Military Museum and Library announced that the 1918 Fort Caswell Rifle Range was one of the one hundred WWI memorials chosen for a restoration grant and honored with the official national designation as \\"WWI Centennial Memorial\\". And then on November 11, 2018, the 100th Anniversary of the WWI Armistice Day, the Brunswick County WWI Monument recently erected on site, was dedicated to commemorate the veterans who fought in the war.

She was widowed before she was 20 years old, with a large estate, upon which she founded a Cistercian order convent, England's only convent to be Cistercian at the time of its founding. In 1252, she rebuked King Henry III for not paying her money she was owed. Biography De Warenne was born between 1226 and 1230, her father was William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey and her mother was Maud Marshall, Countess of Norfolk, both of whom had been widowed previously and married in 1225. The de Warenne's also had a son in 1231, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. Through her grandfather, Hamelin Plantagenet, the illegitimate half-brother of Henry II, Isabel was a cousin of king Henry III. In 1234, somewhere between the ages of eight and 12, she was married to Hugh d‚ÄôAubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel, and the couple moved to Marham, Norfolk. D'Aubigny died in 1243, by which time De Warenne's father and uncles had died, leaving her as a teenage widow with a small fortune. She retained the title \\"Countess of Arundel\\", despite the Arundel estates being distributed amongst D'Aubigny's sisters. She was a religious patron and in 1249 she founded Marham Abbey in Norfolk on part of her land, the only English convent that was part of the Cistercian order at its founding. In 1252, upon the death of Thomas of Ingoldisthorpe, King Henry III took possession of his lands. However Thomas was a tenant of de Warenne's, and owed her a quarter of a knight's fee, so de Warenne requested the value from the King. Henry refused and De Warenne complained about this behaviour to his face, suggesting that the Magna Carta was being ignored. She then left the Henry's court, without obtaining permission. Henry would pay back the debt a year later, and forgive the fine that she had been charged in appealing the case.

Once Yusuf ibn Tashfin decided to become independent, he chose Mazdali, his second cousin and made him one of his most effective collaborators, to subdue and pacify the Maghrib and al-Andalus.  Biography  Mazdali belonged to the Banu Turgut clan of the Lamtuna, a Berber tribe belonging to the Sanhaja confederation. His grandfather Hamid and Ibn Tashfin‚Äôs grandfather Ibrahim were brothers. = Under Yusuf ibn Tashfin = After the foundation of Marrakesh, ibn Tashfin sent Mazdali in 1073, at the head of an army, to the region of Sal√©, whose tribes he submitted, without struggle or siege. Satisfied with this result, Yusuf put him, two years later, in 1075, at the head of another army which also subjected Tlemcen without resistance and deposed its ruler, the emir al-'Abbas ibn Yahya al-Zanati. In 1076, Mazdali was to perform, a sensitive diplomatic mission. Ibrahim, son of Abu Bakr ibn Umar and governor of Sijilmasa, came to Aghmat to claim the power from which his father had been dispossessed. As soon as he heard it, Yusuf sent Mazdali, who met with Ibrahim. By his skill, Mazdali unraveled the crisis, dissuading Ibrahim from maintaining his claims. He offered him presents that he accepted, as his father had done, and returned him to the Sahara. Under the order of Ibn tashfin in 1079, some 20,000 Almoravid soldiers were sent, under the command of Ibn Tilankan. The Almoravid forces marched up the Moulouya valley, where they faced the enemy, an armed force from the Bani Ya'la, somewhere between the Moulouya river and the Za river. Mazdali crushed the Zanata enemies and executed Mali ibn Ya‚Äòla, amir of Tlemcen's son. Nevertheless, Mazdali did not choose to conquer Tlemcen, because between him and Tlemcen stood the powerful tribe Bani Iznasan who held the town of Oujda. Then, Ibn Tilankan went back to Marrakesh to announce his victory. In 1091, Yusuf ibn Tashfin appoints him Governor of Cordova, taken on March 27. Little is known about the activity of Mazdali for ten years, before finding him in the early spring of 1102 at the head of an army that besieged Valencia successfully. Valencia was ruled by El Cid's widow, Jimena D√≠az, after his death on 10 July 1099. She appealed to King Alfonso VI for help, but he came merely to provide her and other people haven in his capital Toledo. Yusuf decided, in the same year, 1102, to appoint him governor of Tlemcen, with full power to resolve the conflict existing between the previous governor, Tashfin ibn Tinaghmar and the Emir of Bougie, who were making war on one another. Mazdali managed to reconcile the Emir of Bougie, Al Mansur with the power of Almoravids and remained in the governorate of Tlemcen, until the death of Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1106. = Under Ali ibn Yusuf = He then went to Marrakech, to take an oath to the new Amir Ali ibn Yusuf, passing through Fez where he advised Yahya ibn Abi Bakr, nephew of Ali, to give up his pretensions to the throne. In 1111, he was appointed governor of Granada. He attached to his jurisdiction the provinces of Cordoba and Almeria, then set up an expedition against Guadalajara, which he attacked the following year in 1112, without succeeding in taking it. He raided its surroundings and returned to Cordoba, laden with booty. But his enemies accused him of negligence with Ali ibn Yusuf. He was dismissed and transferred to Marrakesh, where he must justify himself to the Amir. Cleared of these accusations, he was restored to the governorate of Granada and Cordoba. He crosses the Straits, goes to Seville and with the assistance of Syr ibn Abi Bakr and the armies of Granada and Cordoba, he began a retaliatory raid on Toledo. In July 1114, Mazdali attacks La Sagra, ransacking Peginas, Cabanas and Magan; he routed the following month Rodrigue Aznar at Polgar. But he had to fall on the battlefield in March 1115, fighting Castilians near Mastasa, a day north of Cordoba. His body was brought back to Cordoba the next day.

Some employers use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees. Ethical implications This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider discrimination. Except in the states of California, Maryland, and Illinois, there are no laws that prohibit employers from using social media profiles as a basis of whether or not someone should be hired. Title VII also prohibits discrimination during any aspect of employment including hiring or firing, recruitment, or testing. Social media has been integrating into the workplace, and this has led to conflicts within employees and employers.[107] Particularly, Facebook has been seen as a popular platform for employers to investigate in order to learn more about potential employees. This conflict first started in Maryland when an employer requested and received an employee's Facebook username and password. State lawmakers first introduced legislation in 2012 to prohibit employers from requesting passwords to personal social accounts in order to get a job or to keep a job. This led to Canada, Germany, the U.S. Congress and 11 U.S. states to pass or propose legislation that prevents employers' access to private social accounts of employees.[108] Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand them to give forth their username or password for a social media account. Laws that forbid employers from disciplining an employee based on activity off the job on social media sites have also been put into act in states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, North Dakota, and New York. Several states have similar laws that protect students in colleges and universities from having to grant access to their social media accounts. Eight states have passed the law that prohibits post secondary institutions from demanding social media login information from any prospective or current students and privacy legislation has been introduced or is pending in at least 36 states as of July 2013. As of May 2014, legislation has been introduced and is in the process of pending in at least 28 states and has been enacted in Maine and Wisconsin. In addition, the National Labor Relations Board has been devoting a lot of their attention to attacking employer policies regarding social media that can discipline employees who seek to speak and post freely on social media sites. If a young person posts photos on social media of themselves using drugs, this could adversely affect their chance of getting some types of jobs. Use of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites. A 2014 survey of recruiters found that 93% of them check candidates' social media postings. Moreover, professor Stijn Baert of Ghent University conducted a field experiment in which fictitious job candidates applied for real job vacancies in Belgium. They were identical except in one respect: their Facebook profile photos. It was found that candidates with the most wholesome photos were a lot more likely to receive invitations for job interviews than those with the more controversial photos. In addition, Facebook profile photos had a greater impact on hiring decisions when candidates were highly educated. These cases have created some privacy implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employee's Facebook profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation of Facebook policy. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users. 26 states now have laws against an employer requiring a current or potential employee to give the employer their username and password. This is a breach of privacy and an encroachment of freedom of speech. A private post on social media should not be a deciding factor for employment as it is taken out of context and is not a direct representative of who the individual is. You are allowed to protest against something you believe is wrong but can be punished by your employer for doing so online.

Created by Ludhiana Pathak's Writer's Galaxy Studios, it premiered on 1 October 2018. Starring Shaheer Sheikh and Sonarika Bhadoria, the show explores the historical love story of Prince Salim and Anarkali. Plot Prince Salim (Uzair Basar) visits an old dargah with his father Akbar (Shahbaz Khan) and mother Jodha Bai (Gurdeep Kohli). The Saint blesses them and foretells that Salim will be a great warrior with the capability of becoming a great king, and that one day Salim will turn against Akbar. Akbar promises that he will never allow such things to happen. When dacoits attack the village of Agra, a girl named Saifu (Naisa Khanna) and her aunt Jhillan (Shruti Ulfat) save Salim as they flee. On learning that Saifu saved Salim's life, Akbar renames Saifu as Anarkali, which means 'blossomed pomegranate'. The seer also foretold that Anarkali will be the reason of the feud between Akbar and Salim. As they return to Agra, Salim and Anarkali become best friends. While Jodha and Akbar are happy to see Salim with his new-found friend, Akbar's first wife, Ruqaiya, (Tasneem Sheikh) and Akbar's mother Hamida (Aruna Irani) are enraged to see the niece of a servant playing with Salim. When Ruqaiya plots to kill Salim, Anarkali saves him once more. Later, after Salim begins misbehaving when Ruqaiya puts rohypnal in his milk, Akbar decides to send him to the battlefield for 12 years until he is grown-up. Salim leaves the castle and is angry with his father's decision. However, Anarkali tearfully bids adieu to Salim and decides to write him letters throughout the 12 years in which all of this takes place. =12 Years Later= Prince Salim (Shaheer Sheikh) is now grown up and he is a brave and talented warrior who can single-handedly kill ten soldiers. Though ferocious, Salim has the soft heart of Jodha, and knows how to forgive. Salim's best friend is the Hindu warrior, Mahabbat (Meherzan Mazda), with whom Salim shares all his secrets. Anarkali (Sonarika Bhadoria), who is also grown-up, is a shy, soft-spoken, beautiful servant of Agra palace, and extremely close to Jodha. She writes letters to Salim every week, although she never gets a reply from him. Though Anarkali loves Salim, she never expresses her desires. She knows that as a servant, she can never even dream of becoming the queen of Salim's heart. Although Ruqaiya hates Anarkali and frequently tries to defame her, Anarkali has nothing harsh against anyone. Jodha receives the news of Salim's homecoming and requests Anarkali to decorate Salim's room. Salim returns and after meeting Jodha, he expresses his desire to meet Anarkali. Salim meets Anarkali at the terrace and is absolutely smitten with her. Although Anarkali is reluctant to see Salim again, Salim insists upon meeting her. This gives Ruqaiya an opportunity to make Anarkali fall in Salim's eyes. The next day, Ruqaiya orders Anarkali to dance with another dancer at a party arranged to celebrate Salim's homecoming. Salim is absolutely furious to see Anarkali as a rakkasha (prostitute) and slaps her in front of everyone. Salim leaves, followed by Mahabbat. However, Mahabbat succeeds in making Salim understand that he was always in love with Anarkali. Salim decides to confess his feelings to Anarkali, who then requests that Salim leaves her alone, fearing that her worst nightmare will come true. A stubborn Salim tries to win over Anarkali and is successful. At last, Salim decides to give up, but before he does, he decides to make Anarkali confess her true feelings for him. He orders Mahabbat to arrange a party in the jungle, and to order Anarkali to come with them. Salim also arranges a dancer named Firdous to make Anarkali jealous. While Firdous's dances, Salim notices Anarkali's jealousy, but she still remains silent. Salim orders everyone to get out of the tent except Anarkali. Salim asks her why she was still silent. Anarkali replies that she is just a servant and cannot tell Salim what to do and what not. A frustrated Salim decides to make the tent catch fire and kill himself. However, this incident makes Anarkali weak, and she confesses her love for him. Hamida, after receiving the news of the fire incident, decides to meet Salim but is stunned to see him hugging Anarkali. She comes to know about their affair and decides to end it. Firdous, as revealed is a plot planted by Ruqaiya, tells her about Salim's love for Anarkali. Ruqaiya asks Firdous to create a rift between them, but Firdous refuses and says she will not come between the two lovers. Ruqaiya kills Firdous. Akbar calls Nigris Jaan to teach dance to Anarkali. Firstly, Nigris behaves rudely with Anarkali but later, when she realises her love for Salim, she starts helping her. Then, Maan Bai, Salim‚Äôs cousin enters and is successful in marrying him. She becomes Salim‚Äôs first wife and starts creating the rift between Salim and Anarkali, but is unsuccessful. She even tries to kill Anarkali but Anarkali is saved by Salim. Maan Bai tells Akbar about their affair; he becomes furious and tells Anarkali to go away from Salim if she wants to save her life. But, later she is stabbed in her stomach and dies in the arms of Salim.

She originally traded between England and Riga, where the Russian government seized her in 1800. The seizure gave rise to two court cases, one concerning a crewmember's claim for wages during her detention and one arising out of her owner's sale of Fishburn during the detention.

Emperor Paul I of Russia, in the context of the Second League of Armed Neutrality and the British Mediterranean campaign of 1798, on 18 November 1800 placed an embargo on all British shipping to Russia. The Russians seized some 200 British vessels in Russian ports, imprisoned some 4000‚Äì5000 crewmembers, and sequestrated some ¬£1,500,000 in British property. The embargo lasted until 28 May 1801,Fisher (1802), pp.3-4. some two months after Paul's assassination in March 1801. The embargo interrupted the grain trade with the Baltic at a time when Britain was in the grips of weather- induced crop failures. The bread shortage precipitated the British government's decision in November 1800 to send a naval force to the Baltic once ice and weather conditions permitted. It also led the government to have the British East India Company (EIC) charter 28 vessels, comprising 14,785 tons (bm), to sail from England between December 1800 and February 1801 to bring back rice from Bengal.Hardy (1800), p.217. Fishburn sailed before the announcement of the Russian embargo 18 November and on her arrival on 29 November the Russian government seized her. Her crew were taken prisoner and marched 150 miles up country, together with the crews of other British vessels. After six months they returned to Fishburn, reloaded her cargo, and sailed her back to Plymouth, where she arrived on 10 August 1801. A seaman on Fishburn, John Andrew Fisher, sued for ¬£40 for back wages for the period of his detention. The jury on the first and second trials awarded him the sum. A judge in a subsequent hearing upheld the prior verdicts.Fisher (1803), pp.124-127.

Social media is becoming more accessible and easier to use, meaning that the age of students who are able to understand and use social media are getting younger and younger. Integrating social media into education has been a controversial topic during the 2010s in which people have continued to debate on whether or not these types of medias have a place in the classroom . Many parents and educators have been fearful of the repercussions of having social media in schools and there are concerns that social media tools can be misused for cyberbullying or sharing inappropriate content. As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and schools have gone so far as to block popular social media websites. However, despite apprehensions, students in industrialized countries are (or will be) active social media users. As a result, many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. The Peel District School Board (PDSB) in Ontario is one of many school boards that has begun to accept the use of social media in the classroom. In 2013, the PDSB introduced a \\"Bring Your Own Device\\" (BYOD) policy and have unblocked many social media sites. Fewkes and McCabe (2012) have researched about the benefits of using Facebook in the classroom. Some schools permit students to use smartphones or tablet computers in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research.  Integration of social media = Benefits = Social media can help to aid teachers in communicating with students even when they are outside of the classroom. Use of social media platforms can provide students with unlimited resources and texts from credible sources that they can utilize to their advantage in essays, projects, and presentations. They can also be used as a means of giving and receiving feedback at any time. This way students can easily access comments made by teachers and peers with a click of a button instead of rifling through pages and pages of notes and handouts. Social media can be seen as a sort of an archive of ideas and other medias that can be retrieved by their users day or night. Because feedback can be submitted so quickly over social media it has bridged a gap in communication between students and teachers that is unmatched. Since students are able to view and respond almost immediately it has been seen that this increase in communication has led to deeper understanding of class material. = Disadvantages = It is important to be cautious when using social media especially in the classroom. Although it's not recommended to ignore social media all together people should still have an understanding of the negative impacts it can have on society. Critics are unsure about how social media will affect the teacher student relationship and commonly express concern about how attention keeping this type of learning is. It is a fear that students will become caught up in the chaos of social media instead of focusing on their school work. With this comes the idea that one day a persons intelligence might depend on these social medias instead of using them to help aid their foundations of thought. The overuse of this technology, while convenient, can also harm expression of critical thought going forward. Putting young students onto social media sites for the purpose of education can also be detrimental to their mental health. According to a survey taken of teens and young adults increased use of social media can lead to anxiety, depression, and lack of self esteem. These issues can affect how a person functions normally and can be detrimental to education. If a student is overcome with mental health issues due to constant social media use then it can be hard for them to focus on their schoolwork. Social media usage in higher education has its limitations, such as dominance of educators in interactions between staff and students, privacy concerns, anti-social interactions and discriminatory behaviour.  Restrictions on social media  Although there was some backlash from state educators, Missouri passed a law that prohibited teachers from communicating privately with students over social media platforms in 2011. Legislators who helped pass this were worried that online communication between underage students and faculty would lead to inappropriate relationships that would cause issues in the classroom. Missouri is not the only state that has taken strides toward limiting social media usage however, and while communication is an important tool teachers utilize certain situations can be misconstrued by outside sources if said communication reaches a more personal level. Due to this stigma teachers are forced to keep all communication with students professional regardless the platform it takes place upon. Facebook Using Facebook in class allows for both an asynchronous and synchronous, open speech via a familiar and regularly accessed medium, and supports the integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Further, it allows students to ask more minor questions that they might not otherwise feel motivated to visit a professor in person during office hours to ask. It also allows students to manage their own privacy settings, and often work with the privacy settings they have already established as registered users. Facebook is one alternative means for shyer students to be able to voice their thoughts in and outside of the classroom. It allows students to collect their thoughts and articulate them in writing before committing to their expression. Further, the level of informality typical to Facebook can also aid students in self-expression and encourage more frequent student-and-instructor and student-and-student communication. At the same time, Towner and Munoz note that this informality may actually drive many educators and students away from using Facebook for educational purposes. From a course management perspective, Facebook may be less efficient as a replacement for more conventional course management systems, both because of its limitations with regards to uploading assignments and due to some students' (and educators') resistance to its use in education. Specifically, there are features of student-to-student collaboration that may be conducted more efficiently on dedicated course management systems, such as the organization of posts in a nested and linked format. That said, a number of studies suggest that students post to discussion forums more frequently and are generally more active discussants on Facebook posts versus conventional course management systems like WebCT or Blackboard (Chu and Meulemans, 2008; Salaway, et al., 2008; Schroeder and Greenbowe, 2009). Further, familiarity and comfortability with Facebook is often divided by socio-economic class, with students whose parents obtained a college degree, or at least having attended college for some span of time, being more likely to already be active users. Instructors ought to seriously consider and respect these hesitancies, and refrain from \\"forcing\\" Facebook on their students for academic purposes. Instructors also ought to consider that rendering Facebook optional, but continuing to provide content through it to students who elect to use it, places an unfair burden on hesitant students, who then are forced to choose between using a technology they are uncomfortable with and participating fully in the course. A related limitation, particularly at the level of K-12 schooling, is the distrust (and in some cases, outright prohibition) of the use of Facebook in formal classroom settings in many educational jurisdictions. However, this hesitancy towards Facebook use is continually diminishing in the United States, as the Pew Internet & American Life Project's annual report for 2012 shows that the likelihood of a person to be a registered Facebook user only fluctuates by 13 percent between different levels of educational attainment, 9 percent between urban, suburban, and rural users, only 5 percent between different household income brackets. The largest gap occurs between age brackets, with 86 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds reported as registered users as opposed to only 35 percent of 65-and-up-year- old users. Twitter A chart showing the content of \\"Tweets\\"‚Äìmessages posted online on Twitter. By far, the largest categories of \\"Tweeting\\" were \\"pointless babble\\" and \\"controversial\\" topics. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking. Domizi (2013) utilized Twitter in a graduate seminar requiring students to post weekly tweets to extend classroom discussions. Students reportedly used Twitter to connect with content and other students. Additionally, students found it \\"to be useful professionally and personally\\". Junco, Heibergert, and Loken (2011) completed a study of 132 students to examine the link between social media and student engagement and social media and grades. They divided the students into two groups, one used Twitter and the other did not. Twitter was used to discuss material, organize study groups, post class announcements, and connect with classmates. Junco and his colleagues (2011) found that the students in the Twitter group had higher GPAs and greater engagement scores than the control group. Gao, Luo, and Zhang (2012) reviewed literature about Twitter published between 2008 and 2011. They concluded that Twitter allowed students to participate with each other in class (by creating an informal \\"back channel\\"), and extend discussion outside of class time. They also reported that students used Twitter to get up-to-date news and connect with professionals in their field. Students reported that microblogging encouraged students to \\"participate at a higher level\\". Because the posts cannot exceed 140 characters, students were required to express ideas, reflect, and focus on important concepts in a concise manner. Some students found this very beneficial. Other students did not like the character limit. Also, some students found microblogging to be overwhelming (information overload). The research indicated that many students did not actually participate in the discussions, \\"they just lurked\\" online and watched the other participants. YouTube YouTube is a frequently used social media tool in the classroom (also the second most visited website in the world). Students can watch videos, answer questions, and discuss content. Additionally, students can create videos to share with others. Sherer and Shea (2011) claimed that YouTube increased participation, personalization (customization), and productivity. YouTube also improved students' digital skills and provided opportunity for peer learning and problem solving Eick et al. (2012) found that videos kept students' attention, generated interest in the subject, and clarified course content. Additionally, the students reported that the videos helped them recall information and visualize real world applications of course concepts. In the early 2000s right as YouTube was getting its start a man by the name of Salman Khan began uploading lecture videos. As his videos grew more popular Khan Academy was born and Salman began to expand his lecture topics in order to reach a wider audience of students. Today Khan Academy is still in use and its continuing positive impact on education is seen as well. MSE Media MSE Media is an education media company which provides free online promotion and marketing for secondary and higher education, developing careers and skills. Students have easy access to events relating to careers, education, and skills, all around the world with regional focus in UK, USA and India. It is a peer-to-peer teaching, learning and sharing platform where students receive information on school, university, educational events, important socio-environmental issues, and academia.

During the Revolution of 1905‚Äì07, it was replaced by the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire. Creation Established during the ministerial reform by manifesto of September 8, 1802. Initially consisted of ministers, their associates (deputies) and the state treasurer. Soon the Committee of Ministers became the \\"supreme seat of the Empire\\". This was facilitated by the personal presence at its meetings of Emperor Alexander I, who rarely did not attend its meetings in 1802‚Äì1804. During the absence of the emperor, special Ukases were granted extraordinary powers to the Committee of Ministers. Composition By the highest order on March 31, 1810, the chairmen of the departments of the State Council were introduced to the Committee of Ministers on all important occasions. The chairmen of the State Council were members of the Committee from August 27, 1905, but in fact they were present in the Committee since 1865, since the Grand Dukes Konstantin Nikolayevich (Chairman of the State Council in 1865‚Äì1881) and Michael Nikolaevich (Chairman of the State Council in 1881‚Äì1905) were members of the Committee on Special Highest Commandments. The Chief Procurator of the Holy Synod was a member of the Committee from December 6, 1904, and before that (from 1835) he was called to meetings only when discussing religious matters. However, the Chief Procurators actually attended the Committee from 1865, since Count Dmitry Tolstoy (member of the committee from 1865 to 1880) held other ministerial posts at the same time, and the Chief Prosecutor of the Synod in 1880‚Äì1905 Konstantin Pobedonostsev was a member of the Committee on Special Highest Commandment. Since the epoch of Nicholas I, heirs of the throne were appointed as members of the Committee upon reaching a certain age. Tsesarevich Alexander Nikolaevich (future Alexander II) was appointed to the Committee in 1841 at the age of 23 years, Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich (future Alexander III) ‚Äì in 1868 at the age of 23 years, Tsesarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich (future Nicholas II) ‚Äì in 1889 at the age of 21 years. Tsesarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich died in 1865 at the age of 21, not being an appointed member of the Committee. Since 1812, outsiders also became members of the Committee of Ministers (for the first time, Vice Admiral Alexander Shishkov). In 1892, Grand Dukes Vladimir Alexandrovich and Alexei Alexandrovich were appointed members of the Committee. Since 1893, the State Secretary was a member of the Committee of Ministers. In general, in the post- reform era, members of the Committee were simultaneously from 19 to 24 persons. Competence The competence of the Committee of Ministers had little in common with the widespread modern concept of the cabinet and its range of functions. All the ministers (and chief superintendents in parts) were independent of each other, were responsible for the activities of their departments alone and had independent reports from the emperor. The Committee of Ministers was not responsible for the activities of individual ministries, nor for the coherence of their policies. Its competence has developed historically and consisted of extremely diverse groups of questions, most of which were petty and unimportant. A detailed list of the terms of reference of the Committee has continuously changed, with the total number gradually increasing. Formally, the competence of the Committee consisted of two types of cases: *The current affairs of the ministerial administration (affairs, \\"the resolution of which exceeds the limits of the authority entrusted in particular to each minister, and requiring the highest resolution\\"; matters requiring the consideration of various departments); *Cases especially assigned to the Committee of Ministers by law. These norms were very general in nature, and the actual list of cases considered by the Committee was chaotic; only in 1905 the first attempt was made to systematize the subjects of the Committee. In general, the activity of the Committee was divided into three areas: *Important interdepartmental issues of public administration; *\\"Odious\\" questions that were formally within the jurisdiction of one ministry, but for which the ministers did not want to take personal responsibility and sought to shift it to the board; *Petty issues, the list of which was formed in a rather random way (primarily as a result of the evasion of individual ministries from taking on the solution of these tasks); This group of questions has always been the largest. The most important subject that was under the authority of the Committee was railway affairs. Decisions on the granting of concessions for the construction of railways, the establishment of railway companies, the state guaranteeing their shares and bonds, the redemption of railways to the treasury and the like had, since the era of Alexander II, of paramount state and economic importance. Since 1891, the Committee has considered these cases in joint meetings with the Department of Economy of the State Council. The minor matters that loaded the Committee were varied and extensive. The most numerous were cases of individual assignment of pensions to retired officials. By the beginning of the era of Alexander II, the existing rates of normal pensions in the civil service were outdated and did not provide pensioners with an acceptable standard of living. From the middle of the 19th century, more and more pensions were granted according to individual Highest Commandments. In 1883, a system of so-called \\"reinforced\\" pensions was developed. But these pensions were also assigned on an individual basis, and were individually considered by the Committee of Ministers, which substantially overwhelmed his clerical work. The second large group of cases was consideration of the statutes of joint-stock companies. Joint-stock companies, the institution of which was regulated by law in 1833, were approved by law, that is, an individual law for each individual society. The competence of the Committee of Ministers included consideration of all charters deviating from the requirements of the law, and since the outdated law allowed only registered shares, and almost all founders wanted to issue bearer shares, the Committee considered almost all charters of newly established companies by the end of the 19th century. The number of such cases reached 400 in the years of the greatest economic activity. The Committee was responsible for the case of Old Believers and sectarians. Since 1882, the Committee has moved away from the consideration of this group of questions that have come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Synod. However, even in this area, the competence was poorly outlined by law ‚Äì in 1894 the Minister of Internal Affairs, Ivan Durnovo, passed through the Committee the Regulations on Stunde, thereby avoiding consideration of the issue in the liberal-minded State Council. The committee considered the annual reports of the governors, the governor-generals and the report of the state controller for the execution of the state list of expenses and incomes. Usually, the discussion of these reports took place slowly and did not lead to significant consequences. The scandal with the abuses of the Minister of Communications Apollo Krivoshein (1894), which led to his dismissal, revealed by the State Control, can be considered as an exception. Having displaced the Permanent Council from the field of legislation, the Committee of Ministers in the field of administration appropriated the rights of the Senate, which remained \\"governing\\" by name only. In the sphere of the criminal court, the Committee of Ministers sometimes acted as an accusation chamber, deciding whether to bring it to court, or as an auditing authority, demanding that it take to review the decisions of the courts to itself; sometimes it went into court cases that were not yet completed in lower instances; sometimes, mainly in civil cases, it also acted as the highest appellate instance in relation to the Senate, accepting complaints from individuals about its decisions. It ceased to be a judicial authority only in 1864. Usually, the Committee of Ministers was engaged only in preliminary discussions of issues. Its conclusion, adopted unanimously or by a majority of votes, was entered in a journal, which was submitted to the emperor for approval. The peculiarity of the journals was that they detailed, with adduction of detailed arguments, stated not only the position of the majority, but also the position of the minority (if there was no unanimous decision), as well as the special opinions of individual members of the Committee (if they wanted to declare them). The Office of the Committee has compiled journals, trying in the most neutral manner and as meaningful as possible to present the meaningful arguments of the diverging opinions of the parties. The journals were not so much a transcript of the meetings as an analytical note drawn up by the office of the Committee; the opinions expressed in the meetings were reformulated, and in many cases more successful examples and arguments were selected for them. The task of journals in the divergence of opinions was not to convince the emperor that the majority was right, but to objectively present to him the whole range of opinions expressed. This practice completely coincided with the practice of keeping similar journals of the State Council. The accession of the emperor to the minority opinion was not uncommon. The journal, which ended with the phrase \\"the Committee believes:\\", followed by the text of the proposed legislation of the Committee, when approved by the emperor, acquired the force of law called the Highest Approved Regulation of the Committee of Ministers. Chairman of the Committee of Ministers During the first years of the existence of the Committee of Ministers, the Russian Emperor chaired the meetings, and in his absence, the members of the Committee of Ministers alternately, starting with the senior in rank, each for 4 meetings. In 1810, the chairmanship was granted to State Chancellor, Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, who was then chairman of the State Council. Since 1812, the post of chairman of the Committee has become an independent post, which until 1865 was necessarily combined with the chairmanship of the State Council. According to the established tradition, the chairmanship of the Committee was the last in the public service honorary position, to which dignitaries were appointed, who had become too old to fulfill the many troublesome duties of the minister. A number of the Committee's chairmen (first of all, Prince Alexander Chernyshyov, Count Alexey Orlov, Count Dmitry Bludov) were characterized by contemporaries as \\"barely alive\\", \\"in a pitiful condition\\". Modest Korf jokingly wrote about Prince Alexander Chernyshyov in his diary: ‚ÄúLook, exactly alive!‚Äù. Prince Pavel Gagarin died in this position at the age of 83 years. The relocation of the active and influential Finance Minister Sergei Witte to the post of chairman of the Committee of Ministers was considered by his contemporaries (and Witte himself) as a political collapse and a type of honorable resignation; According to a common joke, Witte \\"fell up\\". =List of chairmen= #Nikolay Rumyantsev (1810‚Äì1812) #Nikolai Saltykov (March 1812 ‚Äì September 1812) #Sergey Vyazmitinov (1812‚Äì1816) #Pyotr Lopukhin (1816‚Äì1827) #Viktor Kochubey (1827‚Äì1832) #Nikolay Novosiltsev (1832‚Äì1838) #Illarion Vasilchikov (1838‚Äì1847) #Vasily Levashov (1847‚Äì1848) #Alexander Chernyshyov (1848‚Äì1856) #Alexey Orlov (1856‚Äì1860) #Dmitry Bludov (1861‚Äì1864) #Pavel Gagarin (1864‚Äì1872) #Pavel Ignatyev (1872‚Äì1879) #Pyotr Valuyev (1879‚Äì1881) #Michael von Reutern (1881‚Äì1886) #Nikolai von Bunge (1887‚Äì1895) #Ivan Durnovo (1895‚Äì1903) #Sergei Witte (August 29, 1903 ‚Äì April 23, 1906) Reorganization By decree of Emperor Nicholas II of October 19, 1905, a government was created ‚Äì the Council of Ministers, which united the ministers into a single cabinet (previously each minister reported directly to the emperor on the affairs of his department). The first chairman of the Council of Ministers was appointed Chairman of the Committee of Ministers Sergei Witte. The Committee of Ministers was not liquidated when the Council was created: these departments existed in parallel for as long as 6 months (Count Witte remained Chairman of the Committee). The Committee of Ministers was liquidated only on April 23, 1906, together with Witte‚Äôs resignation as chairman of the Council of Ministers. The functions of the Committee of Ministers were transferred to the State Council and the Council of Ministers.

Career  Povilaitis is now a staff policy attorney with the Michigan Domestic and Sexual Violence Treatment and Prevention Board. =Prosecution of Larry Nassar= Povilaitis, then a Michigan assistant attorney general who prosecuted cases and ran a statewide cold-case sexual assault project, built a case against Larry Nassar with Michigan State University Police Det. Lt. Andrea Munford after former gymnast Rachael Denhollander filed a complaint and spoke publicly in September 2016 against Nassar, prompting other women to come forward. Povilaitis brought ten charges against Nassar involving nine victims between 1998-2015 in two counties before he pled guilty. The charges were only a part of the case: more than 140 others filed civil lawsuits against Nassar, with MSU officials fielding all but fifteen of them. Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and other Olympic gymnasts, also accused Nassar of sexual assault during nationally televised interviews or on social media. In January and February 2018, more than 200 women spoke before two Michigan county judges about the impact that Nassar's abuse had on their lives, and their testimonies were broadcast around the world. Povilaitis has won some awards for her work including the first Outstanding Advocate for Victims of Crime award and the 2018 Glamour Women of the Year.

Life Giovanni Alberto Badoer was born in Venice on 12 May 1649Other sources, such as Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, have 12 March 1649 as birth day of a family of the patrician nobility. He was a nephew of Alberto Badoer, bishop of Crema, who was his teacher from the age of five. It was always the bishop of Crema who started his ecclesiastical career, personally providing him with tonsure, as well as ordering a subdeacon in 1663. In 1673, together with his uncle bishop, he accompanied the new Cardinal Pietro Basadonna to Rome for his investiture cardinal. Returning to Crema, he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral and abbot commendatore of San Pietro di colle. After the death of his uncle (1677), he moved to Padua where he met the bishop of that town, Saint Gregorio Barbarigo who deeply influenced his Christian life. Badoer was ordained priest by that bishop in 1677. He earned the doctorate in utroque iure from the University of Padua and he was named a Canon of Cathedral of Padua in 1681. In 1684 the Doge of Venice appointed him as Primicerius of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. On 27 Sept 1688 the Venetian Senate elected him as Patriarch of Venice. The episcopal consecration followed on 14 November in the Venetian Church of San Lorenzo by the hands of Gregorio Barbarigo who came specifically to Venice for that ceremony. During his years as a patriarch, he assiduously visited the churches, monasteries and seminaries of his diocese, working for the formation of the clergy. Badoer founded the Conservatory of Santa Maria delle Penitenti reserved for women who had abandoned prostitution. On 7 June 1706 Badoer was transferred by Pope Clement XI to the Diocese of Brescia, because that diocese was subject to some heretic influences coming from North Europe. In the meantime, on 17 May 1706 he was appointed Cardinal priest with the title of San Marcello, which in 1712 he modified to the title of San Marco. He was particularly noted for his opposition to Quietism and had positions near to the ones of the Jesuites. In particular Badoer opposed in Brescia the priest Giuseppe Beccarelli charging him of Quietism and having him condemned by the Ecclesistic Trubunal to seven years for heresy. When the Council of Ten reviewed that process, the punishment was increased to life imprisonment because the Beccarrelli was found guilt also of child sexual abuse. Badoer died in Brescia on 17 May 1714 and he was buried in the New Cathedral of that town.

Upon release, it received mostly positive reviews from critics, with some criticism for a lack of deviation from Bain's established style.  Background  The EP's lead single, \\"Saw You in a Dream\\", was inspired by an experience Bain had dreaming of someone she had known who had recently died. The title track \\"Saw You In a Dream\\" was released as a single on 26 April 2017.  Musical style  The EP has been described as dream pop, electropop, and indie pop. The EP includes a combination of 80s-esque synth beats, acoustic guitars, layered vocals, and melancholic lyrics.  Reception  Saw You in a Dream received mostly positive reviews for its composition, symphonic arrangements, and Bain's development of a distinctive style compared to the varied and experimental style of her previous releases. Nicole Almeida of Atwood Magazine positively reviewed the EP, commenting that Bain \\"talks about love, friendship, loss, and life through mesmerizing and descriptive lyrics which, when coupled with her hypnotizing melodies, result in honest and heartwarming songs.\\" The single \\"Saw You in a Dream\\" was especially well- received for its heartfelt lyrics and contrastingly upbeat melodies. \\"Count to Nine\\" was also praised for its dreamy quality, and complex progression.

Its dating is based on stylistic motifs such as the naturalistic details similar to those of the Recanati Annunciation. It also shows similarities to nativities painted around the same time by Girolamo Savoldo, whom Lotto met in Venice. It seems to have been commissioned by Braccio II and Sforza Baglioni, two noblemen from Perugia, who were the models for the two shepherds. They may have met the artist in the Marche during a pilgrimage to Loreto. A ring on Mary's right hand is probably an allusion to the Holy Ring, a relic in Perugia Cathedral, which supports the idea that the work was produced for that city. This provenance is solely based on an account from 1824 by the art-dealer who that year sold it to Paolo Tosio, a count from Brescia.

The district is focused on Main Road near its junction with River Road, in the central northern part of the town, and has served as the community's center since its incorporation in 1793. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999; it features a variety of mainly Greek Revival and later Victorian architecture, as well as some 20th-century Colonial Revival buildings. Description and history Gill was originally a part of Deerfield, and was first settled as part of that jurisdiction in the early 18th century. It was set off as part of Greenfield in 1753, and was separately incorporated in 1793. At that time, the town's citizenry decided to erect the Congregational church near the town's geographic center, and it became the nucleus of the new town's center, standing on the north side of Center Street. The church was completed in 1796 and given a Greek Revival makeover in 1846. The center's first institutional building was a schoolhouse built in 1793; it was replaced in 1824 by one that is still standing. The district is more than in size, and is anchored by the triangular town green, which is bounded by Center, River, and Main Roads. In addition to the Congregational church and school, the district is home to Gill's Greek Revival town hall, a late 19th-century commercial building, and the Colonial Revival public library. Residential architecture is predominantly Greek Revival in character, with a few examples of older Federal style and later Italianate architecture. One unusual building is the former Methodist church, built in 1827 and converted into a residence.

Henry Prellwitz (1865‚Äì1940) was an American artist known for allegorical paintings and waterscapes of Peconic Bay, New York. Family and education Arthur Henry Prellwitz was born in New York, where his Prussian parents had emigrated. Prellwitz studied art at the Art Students League of New York, where his chief mentor was Thomas Wilmer Dewing; he later became its director. He also studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. In 1892, he set up his studio in the Holbein Studios building on West 55th Street in Manhattan, where his future wife, the artist Edith Mitchill, also had a studio. They married in 1894 and had a son, Edwin. By the mid 1890s, he was teaching portrait painting at the Pratt Institute, where one of his students was the Cubist artist Max Weber. Art career In 1899, Henry and Edith moved to the north shore of Peconic Bay on Long Island, where their artist friends Irving Ramsay Wiles and Edward August Bell were already established. They painted plein air paintings and also worked in adjoining studios at High House, their Peconic Bay home. Prellwitz painted Impressionist and Tonalist waterscapes of Peconic Bay and allegorical figure paintings such as the 1904 Lotus and Laurel. He exhibited mainly on the east coast and at expositions like the St. Louis World's Fair, where he won a silver medal. He won the Third Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design (NAD) in 1893 for The Prodigal Son, and his Venus won the Thomas B. Clarke Prize at the 1907 NAD exhibition for the best figure composition by an American citizen painted in the United States. Both Prellwitzes disappeared into obscurity for several decades after their deaths in the early 1940s. Rediscovered in the 1980s, they have been called one of the best-kept secrets in art history. Prellwitz's work is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, the Parrish Art Museum, and other institutions. ReferencesFurther reading * Pisano, Ronald G.

Through the history there were different hypothesis which classified it, besides in Chakavian, instead in Shtokavian, because it is a transitional dialect.Sanja Holjevac, Govor Barban≈°tine (prilog za opis jugozapadnoga istarskoga ili ≈°tokavsko-ƒçakavskoga dijalekta), Lina Pli≈°ko, Govor Barban≈°tine, 2001, ƒçasopis Fluminensia, god. 13 br. 1-2, str. 149-154Josip Lisac, Nastanak i razvoj jugozapadnoga istarskog dijalekta, 2003, ƒçasopis Nova Istra, br. 8Josip Lisac, Tri dijalekta triju narjeƒçja kao najizrazitiji primjeri migracija u hrvatskome jeziku, 2009, Hrvatski dijalektolo≈°ki zbornik, br. 15, str. 149-150Lina Pli≈°ko, Jugozapadni istarski ili ≈°takavsko-ƒçakavski dijalekt u svjetlu Hrastina istra≈æivanja, 2009, Hrvatski dijalektolo≈°ki zbornik, br. 15, str. 111-124 It is the most widespread Chakavian dialect in Istria. Origin and history The subdialect is a mixture of Chakavian and Shtokavian elements. It is considered that it emerged in Istria after the 16th-century migration of speakers who originated from Dalmatia, mainly from the hinterland of Makarska Riviera where mostly was spoken Shtokavian dialect of Ikavian pronunciation with Chakavian characteristics, which with emigration and consolidation of speakers on the ≈†ibenik-Zadar territory assimilated additional Chakavian elements. It is considered that the place of origination was not situated at the sea, but also not very far from it. The emigration was caused by the Ottoman conquest of Western Balkans, and immigration in Istria was conducted by Venice Republic due to poor population density after late medieval de-population of the peninsula. It is argued that the territory around Zadar (Ravni Kotari) was only an intermediate station for the migration to Istria. To this subdialect is related Slavomolisano dialect of Molise Croats from Zabiokovlje, although it has less Chakavian elements. In different territories there exist different dialects transitions and boundaries, and with its origination from Dalmatian-Herzegovinian region in which initially prevailed Shtokavian elements while later and present-day Chakavian elements, it can be considered as a postmigrational or transitional subdialect. According to the linguist Josip Ribariƒá, the Chakavian elements cannot be interpreted with the neighborhood of native Chakavian speakers in Istria because Northern Chakavian subdialect does not have these elements, and as such in the Southwestern Istrian dialect was \\"saved reflection of the Shtokavian-Chakavian dialect spoken at the end of the 15th, during the 16th and the first half of the 17th century spoke on the Dalmatian mainland\\". According to philologist Lina Pli≈°ko, \\"the main language layer features Ikavian Chakavian from Zadar hinterland, but were also preserved features of assimilated Ikavian ≈†takavian speakers originating from Makarska (Podbiokovlje) region, who arrived to Istria in a migrational wave with Ikavian Chakavian speakers, and in more-or-less number also language features of Ekavian Chakavian speakers (Northern Chakavian, Buzet, and partly Middle Chakavian subdialect). The subdialect was first mentioned by Ribariƒá in 1916. In the second half of the 20th century, to the dialect was attributed a larger number of Shtokavian elements and hence was also classified among Shtokavian Ikavian subdialects, a thesis first argued by Polish linguist Mieczys≈Çaw Ma≈Çecki (1930), which was mostly supported by Serbian linguists, Aleksandar Beliƒá, Pavle Iviƒá and Radosav Bo≈°koviƒá. However, a comprehensive research made by Mate Hraste in 1964 held for determination of Shtokavian languages in Istria found that Southwestern Istria \\"is not Shtokavian nor Shtokavian- Chakavian, as was called by Ribariƒá, but Chakavian-Shtokavian, because in it even today prevail Chakavian elements, and not Shtokavian. Shtokavian is only Premantura, Banjole, Vintijan, Vinkuran and Valdebek, although even in those places there are ƒåakavian adstrata which was introduced from the hinterland during the centuries to the present day. The language of all these places even today is mostly Chakavian\\". According to it, and work by Dalibor Brozoviƒá, Iviƒá in 1981 argued that if the subdialect is classified among Chakavian subdialects it belongs to the Chakavian subdialects of the Southeastern group. Speaking area Istrian dialects location according to Dalibor Brozoviƒá. Southwestern Istrian in purple color. According to Pli≈°ko, the subdialect is spoken \\"from the very South (Premantura), along the Western coast of Istria until the delta of river Mirna (Tar), along Eastern line Muntrilj ‚Äì Kringa ‚Äì Sveti Petar u ≈†umi ‚Äì Kanfanar until Sveti Ivan in Vi≈°njan, along Western coast of river Ra≈°a until Barban, then line Rakalj ‚Äì Marƒçana ‚Äì Muntiƒá ‚Äì Valtura ‚Äì and South Jadre≈°ki ‚Äì ≈†i≈°an ‚Äì Li≈ænjan ‚Äì Medulin\\". To this subdialect also belongs the so-called Vodice oasis of ten villages (Vodice, Jelovice, Dane, Trstenik, Ra≈°por, ƒårnehi located in municipality of Lani≈°ƒáe, and Golac, Brdo, Gojaki, Zagrad in municipality of Hrpelje-Kozina) in Northeastern part of Istria (ƒÜiƒáarija), located in Croatia and Slovenia, which was described by Ribariƒá. It can be divided into smaller units: the main area in the Southwest, Premantura area in the South, and Vodice oasis in the Northeast. From the prosody perspective of accent, rhythm, intonation, etc., it can be divided into typological areas: central, border, northwestern, Vodice oasis, southern.David Mandiƒá, Naglasni sustavi jugozapadnoga istarskog dijalekta Main features In this subdialect the yat is i (Ikavian): lip, divojka, mri≈æa, sriƒáa, in comparison to Shtokavian Ijekavian lijep, djevojka, mre≈æa, sreƒáa.Dalibor Brozoviƒá: ƒåakavsko narjeƒçje, u separatu Jezik srpskohrvatski / hrvatskosrpski, hrvatski ili srpski, JLZ Miroslav Krle≈æa, Zagreb, 1988. It has little Ekavian which is mainly a borrowing from neighbouring Istrian Chakavian subdialects or from Slovenes dialects. It is mostly Shtakavian (\\"ognji≈°te\\", \\"da≈æditi\\"), but it is not generally because ≈†ƒáakavian examples are not rare. Chakavian features are partly of Southeastern and Southwestern type, brought and received in Istria. Josip Lisac quotes these features; \\"sequence w + semitone give partly u- in Shtokavian way, which is also in Chakavian Southeast, for e.g. u, unuki. Partly is Vazam 'Uskrs', vajka 'uvijek', valje 'odmah', and that is Chakavian result, specifically Northwestern Chakavian subdialects. Doƒçetno -l mainly regularly gives a, which is Shtokavian feature, however, it is also well represented in Chakavian under strong influence of Shtokavian. Especially interesting are reflexes prsl. ƒè, was it j, ƒë, ƒè, ≈æ, also type mlaj≈æi. Example of type mla≈æi actually are Shtokavian result (d≈æ) spoken in a Chakavian way. J is Chakavian represented in many Western Shtokavian dialects. Phoneme h mainly is well conserved, but there are also deviations ... Usually, it is everywhere except around Premantura conserved ƒçr-, as it is common in Chakavian, exceptionally in Shtokavian. Usually are a regular short plural of single-word nouns of masculinity, as it is in Chakavian and Kajkavian, sometimes also in Shtokavian. Generally is said for e.g. dva kantuna, tri kantuni, ƒçetiri kantuni, as it is common in Chakavian. Characteristically are substitute words ƒça i za≈°to, ƒça probably as acquired feature, za≈°to as old. Distinct Chakavian element bin, bi≈°, bi, bimo, bite, bi characterize the subdialect, even in Premantura in the South there's bimo and bite\\". Accentuation is different depending on the place although there are some common features. It has a three-tone system, while in the area of Vodice oasis is two tonic (except in the village of Trstenik where is one tonic, similar to the Buzet dialect). According to general features, it is part of a dialectical continuum and the encounter of Western Shtokavian and Southern Chakavian, with several divisions within the subdialect older than the 16th- century migration to Istria. According to Lisac, it was primarily formed \\"in the hinterland of Makarska Riviera. That's the territory where predominantly was spoken Shtokavian, slightly Chakavian, and main features are ≈†takavism and \\"-a\\" in verb adjective in working, along non-Neoshtokavian accentuation ... The place of origination was not located by the sea (because it would be ≈†ƒáakavian), but also not very far from the sea (because it would have \\"-l\\" instead of \\"-a\\").  Lexicon  It has more Italianisms (kampanja \\"polje\\", korta \\"dvori≈°te\\") than in Dalmatia. Toward North of Istria and the boundary with Slovenian language area it also has some Germanisms (≈æajfa \\"sapun\\", gmajna \\"pa≈°njak mjesne opƒáine\\"). The lexicon generally indicates to a common origin nevertheless on separated majority in Southwest and Vodice oasis in Northeast. There's a visible closeness to the dialect of Molise Croats in Italy. Vodice oasis also has some innovations recorded in Northern Chakavian, Burgenland Croatian, Kajkavian and Slovene dialects, but there are also many Chakavian autochthonisms.

History  It was first recorded in the 19th century, when it was in the Castelbarco collection in Milan. It was then sold to Sir William Martin Conway in 1887 and moved to his home at Allington Castle in Kent. Its next owner was Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi, who on 4 October 1934 sold it to Samuel H. Kress, who took it to the USA and gave it to the National Gallery of Art in 1939, where it still hangs. Portrait of a Woman Its dating is based on stylistic similarities to Lotto's Allegory of Virtue and Vice, a cover Lotto had produced for his own Portrait of Bernardo de' Rossi. It was probably a cover itself, possibly for Portrait of a Woman (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon). Lotto was then a young protege of de' Rossi, who had gathered a small circle of writers and artists around him. Radiography has shown a partial under-drawing for a different image, probably a Hercules at the Crossroads, another theme on the choice between vice and virtue.  Description  The background landscape recalls D√ºrer's watercolours and Giorgione's landscape paintings. A young woman in white and gold leans against a laurel tree in the centre, possibly referring to Daphne, and ignores two satyrs (one female, one male), symbolising intoxication and lust.

Earlier in her career (up until the early 1990s) she published under her former married name, Zuleyma Tang Halpin.  Early life and education  Tang-Mart√≠nez was born in Venezuela on March 9, 1945. She and her family lived in ethnically segregated camps that were operated by an American oil company. Her father was a company accountant, permitting Tang-Mart√≠nez to be among the very few Venezuelans to be raised and attend school in the American camps. In 1960, she was sent by her parents to attend a Catholic, all-girls, boarding high school in Tampa FL because the oil camp schools did not go beyond the 8th grade. She completed high school in 1963; the nuns at the high school convinced her to go to college as a pre-med student, despite the fact that her parents had planned only on her finishing high school - as she was the first in her family to complete a high school education. She received her bachelor's degree cum laude from Saint Louis University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in biology. She moved to the University of California, Berkeley for her graduate studies, earning a master's degree in 1970 (specializing in cancer research) and a PhD in 1974 in Zoology (specializing in animal behavior). Tang-Mart√≠nez was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia. For her dissertation she developed the habituation-discrimination technique in order to study individual discrimination by odors in the Mongolian gerbil Meriones unguiculatus.  Career  Tang-Mart√≠nez was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis in 1976, the institution where she spent the rest of her career. She was very active in professional societies, especially with the American Society of Zoologists (now the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology) where she was elected as Chair of the Division of Animal Behavior. In the Animal Behavior Society, her primary scientific organization, she served as Chair of the Animal Care Committee, the Latin American Affairs Committee, and the Diversity Committee. In 1991 she was elected to the 4-year presidential sequence, serving as ABS President from 1993-1994. . She studied social behavior, communication, and kin recognition of animals, as well as various aspects of dispersal, particularly with regards to how social structure impacts the genetics of populations. In 1987 she co- edited Mammalian Dispersal Patterns: The Effects of Social Structure on Population Genetics with Diane Chepko-Sade. More recently, she has challenged the theory of Angus John Bateman and Robert Trivers that male fruit flies behave more promiscuously due to their ability to produce millions of small sperm, and that this explains universal differences between male and female sexual behavior. . She has argued against the universal application of Bateman's principle particularly with regards to the stereotypes of male and female sexual behaviour in humans. Her research was discussed in Angela Saini's Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That‚Äôs Rewriting the Story. She described the relationship between sociobiology and feminism as 'complex and multidimensional'. Tang-Martinez and her students studied a broad range of topics and species, including the social systems of rodents (gerbils, voles, hamsters, black-tailed prairie dogs, eastern chipmunks, deer mice, and capybaras), as well as other mammals ( e.g., raccoons, otters). Examples of her research include using habituation- discrimination to study the ability of voles and other mammals to detect individually-distinct odors. Tang-Martinez became Associate Professor in 1982 and full Professor in 1994. She was Director of Women's Studies between 1989 and 1990, and interim chair of her Biology departmetn in 1990. She has been concerned about students as higher education becomes more corporate. In 1993 she became President of the Animal Behavior Society. During her term in the presidential sequence of ABS (a 4 year commitment), she created the ethnic diversity fund, which supports scientists from underrepresented groups to attend academic conferences. She also founded the Latin American Affairs Committee and served as its first Chair . Currently (2020) she is the Animal Behavior Society historian and serves as an ex-officio member on the Executive Committee of the society. In her duties as Historian, she organized the first ever symposium on the history of animal behavior, which was subsequently published as a special issue in the society journal, Animal Behaviour (vol. 164). . She retired in September 2011 and was made Founders Professor of Biology. In 2014 she edited (jointly with Ken Yasukawa) the first volume of the series Animal Behavior: How and Why Animals Do The Things They Do. She remains part of a National Science Foundation proposal to develop the next generation of animal behavioural scientists (as Co-PI of \\"Weaving the Future of Animal Behavior\\") . = Awards and honours = * 1995 Scientists of Color, University of California at Berkeley O'Neil Ray Collins Distinguished Minority Scientist * 1995 St. Louis Educational Equity Coalition Educational Equity Award for Higher Education * 2002 Alzheimer's Association of St. Louis, Volunteer of the Year Award for contributions to public policy * 2006 Animal Behavior Society Exceptional Service Career Award * 2009 Animal Behavior Society Quest Award * 2011 Animal Behavior Society, elected a Fellow * 2011 Hispanic Business magazine, selected as one of the top 100 most influential Hispanics in the USA and one of the top 8 most influential academics ''  Personal life  Tang-Mart√≠nez married her long-term partner, Arlene Zarembka, in Canada in 2005. In 2014, she and Arlene campaigned for marriage equality as a plaintiffs in a successful lawsuit demanding that the state of Missouri recognize their Canadian marriage. She is an advocate for Hispanics, other under-represented groups, and women in the sciences. She also is very civically involved: she serves as a commissioner on the St. Louis County Older Adults Commission, is a volunteer with the Alzheimer's Association of Greater St. Louis, serves on the research ethics committee of the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Washington University in St Louis Medical school (for the \\"Adult Children\\" research project of the ADRC), is a member of a dialogue group, Shalom Amigos (American Jews, Latin American Jews, and non- Jewish Latinos), and serves on the board of directors of the UMSL Retiree Association.

It is located in C√¥te Saint-Luc, an on-island suburb of Montreal, Quebec. Established by members of the Labour Zionist Poale Zion movement in 1913, the school soon divided into two institutions, the Peretz Schools and the Jewish People's Schools. The two reunited in 1971, and Bialik High School was founded shortly thereafter. The JPPS‚ÄìBialik school system currently offers both English and French sections, as well as the International Baccalaureate Primary Years and Middle Years Programmes. History=The Peretz Schools= On 20 October 1910, the Fifth Poale Zion Convention held in Montreal passed Chaim Zhitlowsky's resolution for the establishment of a secular Yiddish-based school system across North America to transmit the movement's core Zionist and socialist ideals. A supplementary school called the National Radical School was established in 1913 in Montreal's Jewish immigrant quarter of the Mile End, meant as a secular alternative to the traditional synagogue schools of the 1870‚Äì1910s and the Talmud Torah system. The school expanded to over two hundred students by 1914. The school was not officially tied to the Poale Zion party, and by 1914 the party had lost control of the school to the Jewish Labour Bundist genosen. In 1918, the National Radical School was renamed the Jewish Peretz Schools (, Yiddishe Peretz Shuln) after writer I. L. Peretz, and purchased its first building on Cadieux Street near Prince Arthur Street. The secular Jewish curriculum was centred on the Yiddish language and literature, as well as on Jewish history and folklore. Principals and teachers invited international Yiddish figures into the classroom; guests of the Peretz Schools during the 1920s and 1930s included Aaron Glants-Leyeles, Sholem Asch, Peretz Hirschbein, David Pinski, Shmuel Niger, and Chaim Zhitlowsky. By the mid-twenties, both Hebrew and the study of Jewish tradition were introduced into the Peretz Schools' curriculum. Moving to a renovated factory on Duluth Street, the school added a kindergarten in 1941, and established a full-day school in 1942. The school remained on Duluth until 1960 when it moved to Wavell Road in C√¥te Saint-Luc following the westward migration of the Jewish community. =The Jewish People's Schools= J. I. Segal with afternoon school class of Jewish People's School, . The emphasis on Yiddish over Hebrew at the National Radical School was hotly debated, and a group of dissident activists emerged. In 1914, a group of educators led by Dr. Yehuda Kaufman, Moshe Dickstein and Abraham Parnass, broke away from the National Radical School to establish the independent Jewish People's Schools (, Yidishe Folks Shuln; ). Classes initially took place in a house, with volunteers as teachers. The new school emphasized the equal importance of Hebrew and Yiddish in Jewish life, and placed greater emphasis on Jewish tradition than did the National Radical School. The school would eventually settle on St. Urbain Street near St. Cuthbert Street in 1920, staying there until 1952. A second building (designed by architect Maxwell M. Kalman) opened in 1926 on the corner of Waverly and Fairmount, remaining there until 1963. In 1927, the Jewish People's Schools established itself as an all-day Jewish school, the first in Montreal since the synagogue schools of the 1880s‚Äì1900s. The school taught public school curricula along with Jewish education, history, and literature, Hebrew and Yiddish, and the ideology of the Labour Zionist movement, at the cost of ten cents per week. As the Jewish community migrated westward, a new branch was built at Van Horne Avenue and Westbury Avenue in 1956. While the Jewish People's Schools moved in the direction of Outremont's middle-class element, the Peretz Schools continued to serve more of the working class elements of the Jewish community. =Modern history= Except for the Peretz Schools' continued stress of Yiddish over Hebrew, by the 1920s the overall philosophy, educational objectives and pedagogical approaches of the Peretz and Jewish People's Schools were essentially the same. Still, despite the efforts that were made to reunite the schools beginning in the 1920s, ideological differences prevented the Peretz and Jewish People's Schools from merging for half a century. In 1971, financial necessity (as well as the retirement of their two long-term principals) led to the merger of the Jewish People's School and the Peretz Schools. The unified educational system created Bialik High School a year later, offering a comprehensive curriculum of both secular and Jewish education for secondary students. In 2003, the elementary school's Wavell and Van Horne branches were consolidated and the Wavell location sold. A merger of JPPS‚ÄìBialik schools with UTT‚ÄìHerzliah was announced in February 2011, but was soon rejected. JPPS‚ÄìBialik decided in 2016 to sell the elementary school's building on Van Horne and move its elementary students to the Bialik High School campus in C√¥te Saint-Luc, due to declining enrolment.

He was born blind and has advocated for greater accessibility of science to disabled students. Wedler even suggests that visually impaired chemists could have an advantage over sighted colleagues, due to the need to mentally imagine the structure of organic compounds; \\"I've been visualizing things my entire life\\".  Education  While at high school in his native Petaluma, California, Wedler was told by a teacher that his blindness made laboratory chemistry an impossibility. Initially dissuaded from entering science due to such concerns about his disability, Wedler studied both chemistry and US history at university so that he could pursue a PhD in the latter. Upon meeting Dean Tantillo, who worked alongside him to support Wedler's education and research in his lab group, Wedler started a PhD in Organic Chemistry at University of California, Davis. Wedler's research output has included journal articles advocating practical approaches to make chemistry research possible for the visually impaired, discussing education, safety, software and even the functioning of service animals in the lab. This includes involvement in the creation of software to extract 3D printable-models of molecules from 2D maps available in the literature. Furthermore these models are annotated in braille with information such as bond length. Wedler has conducted computational chemical analysis of the compounds involved in the flavouring of wine, as well as markers for the refinement of olive oil. Career Wedler founded and remains CEO of the not- for-profit Accessible Science. Through this Wedler ran chemistry camps aimed at visually impaired high school students. These camps focused on skills such as utilizing campers' sense of smell to determine the progression of chemical reactions. Wedler further assures blind people considering a career in chemistry that \\"nobody can see atoms, and honestly most reactions in higher- level chemistry are clear, so there's no reason you can't think about chemistry\\". He gave a TEDx Talk in Sonoma County about the role of sensory experience in his life and how important it is to maximise the experiences of taste and smell. After completing his PhD in 2017 Wedler co-founded Senspoint, a consultancy for sensory experiences. Achievements Wedler was presented with a National Achievement Award in 2011 by Learning Ally, an organisation focused on opening typed literature to visually impaired or dyslexic audiences. For his role in promoting chemistry and science to blind people Wedler became a Champion of Change as part of an initiative run by the White House under Barack Obama. He was recognised for his contributions to the category of 'Stem Equality For Americans With Disabilities'. Forbes recognised Wedler as one of their 30 Under 30 in the Food and Drink category, emphasising his role in leading blind wine tastings in California. Wedler regularly runs blind wine tasting at Francis Ford Coppola Winery in Wine Country, blindfolding the participants so that they can embrace the aroma and flavours of wine without the 'distraction of sight'.

Mount Kidd is situated within Spray Valley Provincial Park, and its nearest higher peak is The Tower, to the southwest. Mount Kidd is a landmark that can be seen from Highway 40 in the Kananaskis Village area, and from the Kananaskis Country Golf Course which lies at the eastern base of the mountain. History In 1907, Dr. Donaldson Bogart Dowling, an engineer with the Geological Survey of Canada, named the mountain for John Alfred (Fred) Kidd, who was a resident of nearby Morley, Alberta.Mount Kidd PeakFinderScrambles in the Canadian Rockies, 3rd edition, by Alan Kane, Rocky Mountain Books 2016, page 174 From 1902 to 1907, Kidd ran the Morley general store and outfitted expeditions and geological survey crews such as Dowling's with supplies. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1947 by R. C. Hind and J. F. Tarrant. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1953 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. In June 1986, Mount Kidd was the scene of the first of three related airplane crashes known as the Rescue 807 Crashes. In August 2010, James Hoshizaki stepped onto a snow cornice to pose for a photo when it gave way, resulting in an avalanche that swept him down about 200 metres to his death.Climber dies in Alberta mountain plunge CBC News Geology Mount Kidd is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The Lewis Overthrust extends over 450 km (280 mi) from Mount Kidd south to Steamboat Mountain, located west of Great Falls, Montana. Mount Kidd marks the northern end of the Lewis Thrust Fault. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Kidd is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold snowy winters and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C (‚àí4 ¬∞F) with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí22 ¬∞F). Weather conditions during winter make Mount Kidd one of the better places in the Rockies for ice climbing. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Kananaskis River which is a tributary of the Bow River, and thence the Saskatchewan River. Climbing Mount Kidd has two summits, a north and south peak, each with scramble routes. The more massive north peak is the true summit at 2,958 metres (9,705 ft), whereas the lesser south peak rises to 2,895 metres (9,498 ft). Additionally, Mount Kidd has a 5.7 rock climbing route on its northeast buttress,Sean Melbourne Dougherty, \\"Selected alpine climbs in the Canadian Rockies\\", Rocky Mountain Books, 1991 as well a 5.8 route called The Fold on the south peak.Journal Alpin Canadien, Volume 79, 1996, pg 104 In 1985, Rudi Kranabitter and Ferdl Taxbock made the first ascent of this now-classic route.

Since that time, Djibouti has taken out three different kinds of loans or credit lines from the IMF. A Stand-By- Credit, an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility plan.  Background  Map of Djibouti Located strategically between Eritrea and Ethiopia, Djibouti is a main port city that is home to foreign military bases. Djibouti is also the country that blocks Ethiopia's borders from touching the Red Sea. For many years Djibouti was known as a poor African nation, however with recent mass foreign investment, as well as public infrastructure projects, and loans from the International Monetary Fund and other international banks, Djibouti is flourishing into a growing economy with intentions to become an economically strong African country. Presently, Djibouti has seen tremendous GDP growth, reaching 6.7% in 2017.  1996 - 2007  In 1996 the IMF extended the first Stand-By-Credit to Djibouti. It was the first line of credit that Djibouti had obtained from the IMF, and its total amount was for $6.7 million US dollars for a total loan period of 14 months which was to be used to fund multiple infrastructure projects. These projects included the infrastructure for their port, the airport, electric, water, and telecommunications throughout the nation. Even in 1996, when the first loan was received by the IMF, an evaluation had been done and it was determined that there was a need to secure funding for health and education. There was also a study that was to be conducted the decipher the lengths to which poverty entrenched the economy and the impact it had on the nation. The deal that Djibouti and the IMF made with each other was that the IMF would help with providing them a line of credit in order to fix their economy, fund infrastructure, and help them begin in a restriction-free trade and exchange deal in order to allow them to obtain foreign currency. In exchange, in order to ensure a balance of payments, the IMF imposed the conditions of i) cutbacks to the nominal wage bill ii) reduction in defense and security personnel (which the World Bank was requested to help with), and iii) reform of the civil service system. In 1997 and 1998 Djibouti filed for two extensions of their Stand-By-Credit loan, in order to give them more time for restructuring. In the Fall of 1999 was the first ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility) loan that was granted to Djibouti from the IMF. This loan was valued at $26.5 million US dollars. It was determined by the IMF that Djibouti had made significant progress from 1996 - 1998 in order to be able to grant them long term loan like the ESAF. The goal was to maintain yearly GDP growth at a steady 3%. At the conclusion of the ESAF loan, which concluded in 2004, there was a 4-year gap until another IMF staffer was able to release another evaluation of Djibouti.  2008 - 2012  In 2008, the IMF approved a $20 million PRGF (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility) loan, which was to be aimed primarily at fighting poverty in the region. During the past few years it had been established that Djibouti had maintained a healthy amount of growth due to foreign investment in their port, in order to take on a new loan from the IMF. This loan would be extended until 2012.  2013 - Present  A 2015 capture of GDP growth from Djibouti With the increase of Chinese investment, an approved Chinese military base, a massive influx of Chinese foreign investment, as well as supplementations of funds by the IMF, Djibouti has been able to maintain a steady increase in GDP growth while maintaining a low inflation rate. Funds received from China came with the understanding that Djibouti, along with many other countries, would help in the structuring and establishing of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative in their respective countries. The IMF continues to fund Djibouti's ventures however, it has less of a need for loans from the IMF with the constant flow of foreign investment. Presently Djibouti holds $12.03 million in outstanding payments owed.

Revealed in September 2018, Meltan is both the first Pok√©mon exclusively obtainable in Pok√©mon Go and the first Mythical Pok√©mon to evolve. Design and characteristics Meltan is a small Pok√©mon measuring tall. Its head is shaped like a hexagonal yellowish nut, with single, round, black eye within it. Its body is a fluid, grey blob of liquid steel, and it has a single red coloured tail-like protrusion which resembles an electrical cord. According to its description at the Pokemon.com website, Meltan is a curious Pok√©mon which has the ability to utilise its metallic limbs to corrode and absorb metal, generating electricity in the process which it uses as an energy source and for combat, firing the electricity from its eye. Meltan can be evolved in Pok√©mon Go, making it the first evolvable Mythical Pok√©mon. Its evolution, Melmetal, is significantly more massive, with a vaguely humanoid shape and a height of around . Although Melmetal retains Meltan's greyish liquid metal body and hexagonal nut head, Melmetal's design also features several other hexagonal nuts in place of its limbs and joints. Its Pokemon.com description noted that \\"Melmetal was worshiped in ancient times as a Pok√©mon with the power to create metal\\". Appearances=In the video games= Meltan's initial appearance in Pok√©mon Go on 22 September 2018 Meltan first appeared in Pok√©mon Go following the global Chikorita \\"Community Day\\" event on 22 September 2018, with players in the Asia Pacific region being the first to encounter them in-game. Meltan's name was shown as \\"???\\", and capturing it would result in it transforming into Ditto or Chikorita. Several days later on 25 September, The Pok√©mon Company released a trailer introducing the Pok√©mon as Meltan, and confirmed that the Pok√©mon would link Go to the Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! games on the Nintendo Switch. Junichi Masuda in an interview with Eurogamer noted that the reveal method was planned by TPC and Niantic in order to give players a strong first impression of Meltan being cute. A second trailer, released in October, revealed that Meltan could only be captured in Go and can be obtained by transferring a Pok√©mon from Go to the Let's Go games. Later in October, a trailer revealed Meltan's evolution, Melmetal, which can only be obtained by evolving Meltan in Go. In November, following the release of the Let's Go games, Go launched a \\"Special Research Quest\\" which allowed players to capture Meltan without playing the Let's Go games. Meltan can also be transferred into Pok√©mon Sword and Shield through Pok√©mon Home as of February 2020. =Other media= Meltan is featured in the Pok√©mon anime series, with a Meltan joining the team of protagonist Ash Ketchum, and evolved together with its fellow hordes into a Melmetal. Reception Before its initial appearance, data miners had previously discovered Meltan's model, labelled as \\"Kecleon\\" while being designated \\"Pok√©mon 891\\". When Meltan was initially \\"revealed\\", many players assumed that Meltan was a placeholder and was accidentally revealed through a glitch. Prior to its name being made public, players gave it nut-related nicknames such as \\"Nutto\\". Emma Schaeffer of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented on the release method, noting that the unexpected addition when many players were looking at their screens, combined with Niantic's past glitch history, caused it to become much more popular than other Pok√©mon revealed in the normal manner.
