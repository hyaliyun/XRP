Evidence-based Scheduling is based on at least two core ideas: including all time spent, and using a Monte Carlo completion date prediction method. Evidence-based scheduling is an example of an evidence-based practice. Including all time spent One of the core ideas of evidence-based scheduling, that adds to the normal estimation practices, is the idea of including all time spent, regardless of relevance. Most people, when estimating, measure the time they actually spend on a project – classic Time Accounting categories such as cited in McConnell's Software Project Survival GuideSoftware Project Survival Guide do not allow for accounting for non-project activities. While McConnell goes on to include less obvious activities such as holidays, sick days and project support, he and most others identify such as activities to be separately recorded. However, recording and attempting to budget for secondary activities often leads to political pressure to drop such activities. In practice, people find themselves unable to avoid them and compensate by working overtime. Similarly, as Spolsky points out,Evidence Based Scheduling – Joel on Software your bosses' stories about his fishing trips, or model helicopter, are both a time-sink and politically dangerous to put on a time-reporting system. The key insight in evidence-based scheduling is that the only thing which needs measuring is the actual delivery of tasks. Over time, it is assumed that all other distractions will average out. For the purposes of estimation, variations due to interruption will show up as inaccuracies in estimation and will be compensated for by statistical analysis. The reasons for anomalies may come out if the organisation wishes to dig deeper into why people have irregular estimates. The appeal of this idea is simplicity – the amount of evidence to be created is simply the elapsed time between completing tasks and, another vital point, time spent debugging is applied back to the original task. Monte Carlo method Another core idea is the use of the Monte Carlo method to predict project completion dates. This method evaluates how reliable previous estimates have been. Instead of a single completion date, the method results in multiple possible completion dates, each with an associated probability of being correct.

The reaction is :A + e^- ->[M]A^- where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a third body is required (the molecularity of the reaction is three). Electron capture can be used in conjunction with chemical ionization. Electron-capture mass spectrometry Electron-capture mass spectrometry (EC- MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that uses electron capture ionization to form negative ions from chemical compounds with positive electron affinities. The approach is particularly effective for electrophiles. In contrast to electron ionization, EC-MS uses low energy electrons in a gas discharge. EC-MS will cause less fragmentation of molecules compared to electron ionization. =Negative ion formation=Resonance electron capture Resonance electron capture is also known as nondissociative EC. The compound attaches an electron to form a radical anion. The energy of the electrons are about 0 eV. The electrons can be created in the Electron Ionization source with moderating gas such as H2, CH4, i-C4H10, NH3, N2, and Ar. After the ion captures the electron, the complex formed can stabilize during collisions and produce a stable anion that can be detected in a mass spectrometer. :AB{} + e^- -> AB^{-bullet} Dissociative resonance capture In dissociative resonance capture, the compound fragments resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD). ECD forms an anion fragment and a radical fragment. The energy of the electrons are from 0-15 eV, but the optimum energy can vary depending on the compound. :AB{} + e^- -> A^-{} + B^{bullet} Ion-pair formation With electrons of energy greater than 10 ev, negative ions can also be formed through ion-pair formation. :AB + e− → A− + B+ + e− Calibration of the mass spectrometer is important in electron capture ionization mode. A calibration compound is needed to ensure reproducibility in EC-MS. It is used to ensure that the mass scale used is correct and that the groups of ions are constant on a regular basis. Fragmentation in ECI has been studied by tandem mass spectrometry. The technique can be used with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Electron capture detector Diagram of a gas chromatograph coupled to an electron capture detector ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species An electron capture detector most often uses a radioactive source to generate electrons used for ionization. Some examples of radioactive isotopes used are 3H, 63Ni, 85Kr, and 90Sr. The gas in the detector chamber is ionized by the radiation particles. Nitrogen, argon and helium are common carrier gases used in the ECD. Argon and helium need to be combined with another gas, such as methane, in order to prevent immediate conversion into metastable ions. The combination will extend the lifetime of the metastable ions (10−6 seconds). The methane will cool the electrons during the collisions. The addition of methane will enhance the ability to form negative ions under high pressure because it will adjust the thermal energy to be similar to the energy distribution of the ions. Methane is the most common gas used because it can produce many positive ions when it collides with electrons. These positive ions will then form low energy electrons used for ionization: :2CH4+ + 2e^- -> CH4+ + CH3+ + H + underbrace{2e^-}_{(secondary)} + underbrace{2e^-}_{(primary)} An ECD is used in some gas chromatography systems. Applications EC-MS (Electron-capture mass spectrometry) has been used for identifying trace levels of chlorinated contaminants in the environment such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and other polychlorinated compounds. Pesticide derivatives, nitrogen containing herbicides, and phosphorus-containing insecticides have also been detected in EC-MS. Bile acids can detected in various body fluids by using GC-EC-MS. Oxidative damage can also be monitored in trace amounts by analyzing oxidized phenylalanine using GC-EC-MS. Advantages EC-MS is a sensitive ionization method. Forming negative ions through electron capture ionization is more sensitive than forming positive ions through chemical ionization. It is a selective ionization technique that can prevent the formation of common matrices found in environmental contaminants during ionization. Electron capture ionization will have less interference from these matrices compared to electron ionization. Electron capture mass spectra can distinguish between certain isomers that EI-MS cannot. Limitations Different energies in the ion source can cause variations in negative ion formation and make the mass spectra difficult to duplicate. Results shown in the mass spectrum can vary from instrument to instrument. The temperature of the ion source needs to be monitored. An increase in fragment ions occurs at higher temperatures. Lower temperatures will lower the energy of electrons. Set temperatures can vary, but it is important for electron energy to approach thermal levels for resonance electron capture to occur. Pressure of the added enhancement gas needs to be determined. Increasing the pressure will help stabilize the anions and extend the lifetimes of the negative ions. If the pressure is too high, not as many ions can exit the ion source. Analysis should be done using low sample loads for GC-EC-MS. The amount of sample will affect the ion abundance and cause variations in data.

He then played guitar at school and college dances. Along with local boys, he formed a blues band, the Mason–Dixon Line. In 1967, Haycock met Colin Cooper and joined his soul band The Gospel Truth. In 1968, they founded a new band, the Climax Chicago Blues Band, and then they eventually changed its name to the Climax Blues Band, in 1970. The band's original line-up consisted of Haycock (lead guitar, vocals), Cooper (harmonica, vocals), Derek Holt (guitar, vocals), Richard Jones (bass), Arthur Wood (keyboards), George Newsome (drums). During the early 1970s, the Climax Blues Band went through a few personnel changes, before arriving at their most stable, creative, and successful line-up, which consisted of Haycock, Cooper, Holt (switched to bass guitar), and John Cuffley (drums). In 1976, the line-up with keyboardist Richard Jones wrote the band's biggest hit \\"Couldn't Get It Right\\". The song included the vocal harmonies of Haycock and Holt, behind Cooper’s lead. Haycock, an underrated vocalist, sang lead on several of the band's tracks, particularly on the Sense of Direction (1974), Stamp Album (1975), Gold Plated (1976), Shine On (1978), and Flying The Flag (1980). albums. The band with the core line-up of Haycock, Cooper, Holt, and John Cuffley toured heavily in the 1970s and 1980s. During much of this period, Haycock played concerts with his rare trademark instrument, a gold-plated Veleno guitar, which was also on the cover of the album Gold Plated. Holt and Cuffley left in 1983. Haycock and Cooper went their separate ways after their final Climax Blues Band album together, 1983's Sample and Hold. In May 2012, the Major League Productions Ltd record label released an until-then unknown vault recording of a 1976 live performance, featuring the Climax Blues Band at the top of their game: Climax Blues Band / World Tour 1976. Haycock provided some insightful liner notes for the CD's insert, and the recording further demonstrates the tight musicianship that was found in the band's line-up at that time. In March 2015, a 4-CD retrospective was released entitled Live, Rare, and Raw 1973-1979, featuring the band at the height of their powers, in a variety of Live settings. This release would parallel the ferocity and acclaim of Climax Blues Band's 1973 album, FM/Live. The band produced more than 15 successful albums in their heyday. Post Climax Blues Band Though another group of musicians, which at one time was led by late former bandmate Colin Cooper, is currently calling themselves \\"Climax Blues Band\\", their lineup does not consist of any founding members, and has not found the commercial success or following that the original, \\"true\\" Climax Blues Band enjoyed during Haycock's years with the band. Cooper died in 2008. In 1984, the band members went their separate ways, and Haycock went on to record several solo projects, the first of which was the album Total Climax (1986) recorded with his new band, Pete Haycock's Climax. Pete Haycock's Climax toured extensively in Europe, including Communist East Germany, as well as a well-received tour in Australia, also releasing The Soft Spot (1987). During this period, Haycock was asked by former Climax Blues Band manager, Miles Copeland, to record an instrumental album for I.R.S. No Speak, Guitar and Son, and Night of the Guitars, a live album from the tour of the same name. After that tour, in 1989, Haycock teamed up with Holt and guitarist Steve Hunter to record an album under the name the H Factor. The Pete Haycock Band consisted of the musicians from the Total Climax lineup, and went on to record a live album titled Livin' It in 1992. Copeland also signed Gary Numan to I.R.S. with whom Haycock collaborated with on the 1988 album Metal Rhythm. Haycock was approached by Bev Bevan, formerly of Electric Light Orchestra, to join the newly formed Electric Light Orchestra Part II. The group toured and recorded with Haycock in the early 1990s, releasing both a live CD and video of their performance with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. They recorded and toured together until 1993. Film scores In the early 1990s, Haycock was asked by Hans Zimmer to collaborate on film scores for K2 (1991), and Toys (1992). Other film scores they worked on were for Drop Zone (1994), and The Dilemma (2011), among others. Haycock's slide guitar contributed to Thunderbird, the theme music for the 1991 film, Thelma & Louise. Haycock was asked by Zimmer to re-create his performance, with a live symphony orchestra for the recording of Wings of a Film, which was a compilation album of Zimmer's successful film scores. Haycock began composing music of his own for film and television. Along with Holt, he composed music for the 1992 film One False Move. More scores would follow, and Haycock helped produce recordings for other artists. Charity projects In 2005, Haycock supplied all the music for the Hollister Independence Motorcycle Rally DVD charity project, for producer Jeff Byler, with proceeds benefiting Emmaus House, a shelter for battered women and children. When the DVD's producer suggested a follow-up soundtrack to the project, Haycock went back into the studio to complete the album that became Bikers' Dozen, which featured a vocal performance by John Fiddler (Medicine Head). Haycock signed on as a major contributor to the LovePower and Peace charity CD project in 2009, which was spearheaded by fellow musician Robin George, and was built around George's hit song, \\"LovePower and Peace\\". Haycock contributed many trademark slide guitar tracks and donated studio time to the project, a charity effort to benefit children with cancer and other terminal diseases. This collaboration, which included the donated talents of scores of veteran musicians, also resulted in the forming a \\"super group\\" called The LovePower Band, which landed a major record deal and completed its first album, which was released in 2011. Return to the stage After an absence from the stage and live performances, Haycock formed a new band, Pete Haycock's True Blues (featuring Glen Turner). In 2008, they toured Europe and released their first recording together: Pete Haycock's True Blues Live (featuring Glen Turner). In April 2009, Haycock, in an interview talked about the early days with the Climax Blues Band, the transition to studio work (with and without Hans Zimmer), and his return to the stage with his new band, after an absence from live performances of fourteen years. Haycock continued to record, and perform live, and had been a featured guest performer with the Siggi Schwarz' band, and was on the same bill with ZZ Top and Johnny Winter in 2012. 2013 found Haycock coming full-circle with the formation of a super- group recording and scheduled for touring as Pete Haycock's Climax Blues Band featuring Robin George, with Haycock being joined by a lineup of musicians including George, with whom he had collaborated on the LovePower Band, and other projects. Haycock envisioned this project as a return to the \\"true\\" Climax Blues Band, and he had just completed the new album, Broke Heart Blues, before his death.Robin George Remembers Pete Haycock. Death Haycock built a recording studio in Frankfurt, Germany where he lived for several years until his death. He died of a heart attack on 30 October 2013 in Frankfurt. The news was posted on the group's official website. He was 62.

It was published serially in Perkins Gilman's periodical The Forerunner and then in book form, both in 1911.Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Moving the Mountain, New York, Charlton Co., 1911. The book was one element in the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that marked the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Kenneth M. Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Matthew Beaumont, Utopia Ltd.: Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England, 1870-1900, Leiden, Brill Academic Publishers, 2005. The novel was also the first volume in Gilman's utopian trilogy; it was followed by the famous Herland (1915) and its sequel, With Her in Ourland (1916). Genre In a brief Preface, Gilman plainly identifies her novel with the established utopian literature; she cites The Republic of Plato and the original Utopia of Sir Thomas More, along with Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888) and H. G. Wells's In the Days of the Comet (1906). Gilman pointedly calls her book \\"a short-distance Utopia, a baby Utopia, a little one that can grow.\\" Gilman casts her protagonist into a reformed future, but without the \\"element of extreme remoteness\\" found in other books. Bellamy had thrust his hero Julian West 113 years ahead, from 1887 to 2000; his predecessor John Macnie hurled his narrator a full 7700 years into the future in The Diothas (1883). Gilman, in contrast, moves her character John Robertson only three decades ahead, from roughly 1910 to around 1940. (Bellamy was the most famous author of his era to employ this trick, and his many imitators and opponents used it in their sequels and responses. Yet the tactic of moving a character forward in time can be found in American literature as far back as Mary Griffith's 1836 story Three Hundred Years Hence.)Polly Wynn Allen, Building Domestic Liberty: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Architectural Feminism, Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; p. 89. Perkins's strategy had previously been employed by Bradford Peck, who propelled his hero 25 years forward in The World a Department Store (1900). Perkins sends a man forward in time to a better world, but gives him deep difficulties in adjusting to it. Here again she was not the first author to try the tactic: W. H. Hudson's A Crystal Age (1887) and Elizabeth Corbett's New Amazonia (1889) take the same general approach. Synopsis The novel opens with a brief scene written in the third person: at a remote location in Tibet, a man in local costume, backed by a group of native people, confronts a woman at the head of an exploratory expedition. There is a sudden sense of realization as the man and woman recognize each other as siblings; the man collapses, overcome by shock. The story then switches to a first-person account, written by John Robertson after his meeting with his sister Ellen. Thirty years earlier, at the age of 25, Robertson had been traveling through rural Tibet; wandering away from his party, he had gotten lost and had fallen over a precipice. He was nursed back to health by local villagers, but his memory was deeply impaired. It was only when his sister found him that he regained his recollection. He returns to the United States with her, to face a society that is vastly different from the one he knew in his youth. Around 1920, while Robertson was living obscurely in Tibet, America had adopted a system of economics described as being \\"beyond Socialism\\", a strain of nationalism that answered all the questions posed by socialism without actually being socialist, renovating its society and culture; and from there it had continued to develop into a more efficient nation, through \\"social evolution\\" and a vague \\"new religion\\". Robertson is surprised to learn that his sister is the president of a college – and is astounded to realize that she is a married college president. He meets his brother-in-law and nephew and niece, and is repeatedly challenged in his traditional attitudes. He is not a feminist; on the ship homeward he meets an attractive and vivacious young woman, and thinks of her, \\"My sister must have been mistaken about her being a civil engineer. She might be a college girl – but nothing worse.\\"Moving the Mountain, p. 37. (Page citations refer to the 1911 book edition.) Most of the book consists of John Robertson being instructed, by his family members and others, in the new, rational, well-organized social order. Gilman's America of 1940 is a country with no poverty or prostitution, \\"no labor problem – no color problem – no sex problem – almost no disease – very little accident – practically no fires,\\" a place in which \\"the only kind of prison left is called a quarantine,\\" where problems of deforestation and soil erosion are being remedied, and in which \\"no one needs to work over two hours a day and most people work four....\\"Moving the Mountain, p. 48. The central chapters in the book deliver Gilman's program for reforming society. She concentrates on measures of rationality and efficiency that could be instituted in her own time, largely with greater social cooperation – equal education and treatment for girls and boys, day-care centers for working women, and other issues still relevant a century later. Yet Gilman also allows for technological progress: electric power is the motive force in industry and urban society, power generated largely by the tides (a technology that is only being developed in the early twenty-first century in the real world), plus \\"wind-mills, water mills\\", and \\"solar engines\\".Moving the Mountain, pp. 60, 172. The sky is full of \\"airships\\". People now practice a \\"new humanitarianism\\". Vegetarianism is in fashion, hunting is out, and zoos are no more. (Gilman's concept of animal rights, however, provides for the elimination of predators, to save their prey.) Tobacco and alcohol are also out of fashion, because emancipated women condemn those habits. Robertson does not find it easy to accept the new social order; his sister gently mocks him as an example of \\"An Extinct Species of Mind\\", as exotic as a \\"Woolly Mammoth\\".Moving the Mountain, p. 41. He even longs for the noisy, dirty, crowded chaos of the cities of his youth, in preference to the clean, quiet, \\"beautiful\\" cities of 1940. In his discontent, Robertson travels to his home state of South Carolina to visit his Uncle Jake, an old farmer and a determined reactionary who rejects the radical improvements of the past thirty years. Uncle Jake still practices subsistence farming with his elderly wife and middle-aged spinster daughter Drusilla. Robertson remembers his cousin Drusilla, ten years his junior, as a darling child – and is shocked by the harsh and deprived life she lives. His \\"thirty years in Tibet,\\" which had weighed heavily upon his thoughts, now seem like \\"a holiday compared to this thirty years on an upland farm in the Alleghanies of Carolina.\\"Moving the Mountain, p. 288. He convinces Drusilla to marry him, to salve his own loneliness and to give her a better life – and in doing so Robertson comes to accept the superior modern world he had previously resisted. Eugenics and social control In Moving the Mountain as in other of her works, Gilman entertains concepts of eugenics, often to the detriment of personal liberties. The raising of children and related matters are subject to social regimentation. As her protagonist John Robertson comments at one point, \\"I've glimpsed a sort of 'iron hand in a velvet glove' back of all this.\\"Moving the Mountain, p. 108. New laws \\"check the birth of defectives and degenerates\\" and \\"criminals and perverts\\" are sterilized. Indeed, Gilman goes further in this book than she does elsewhere in her canon; it has been noted that this is the only one of her works \\"in which Gilman sanctioned the killing of social 'undesirables' by the state.\\"Ruth Roach Pierson, Women and Peace: Theoretical, Historical, and Practical Perspectives, New York, Routledge, 1987; p. 160. Gilman's fictional transformation of America had its dark side: one informant explains to John Robertson that \\"We killed many hopeless degenerates, insane, idiots, and real perverts, after trying our best powers of cure.\\"Moving the Mountain, p. 259. Yet new methods of treatment make such extreme measures less necessary; the character in the book who speaks these words is a reformed alcoholic and cocaine addict who has become a university professor of ethics. Wells and feminism Gilman notes the influence of H. G. Wells in her Preface – but she also takes a sharp dig at him for his limited understanding of the feminist position. :\\"That turbid freshet of an Englishman, Wells, who did so much to stir his generation, said, 'I am wholly feminist' — and he was! He saw women only as females and wanted them endowed as such. He was never able to see them as human beings and amply competent to take care of themselves.\\"Moving the Mountain, pp. 106-7.

Bernardo de la Torre sailed under the instructions of Ruy López de Villalobos, who sent him in August 1543 on board of the San Juan de Letran (St. John of Lateran) to try to find a return route to the Mexican Western coast from the Philippines. This was the fourth such failed attempt to find the route that would be known as the Manila galleon once it was finally established in 1565. De la Torre reached 30°N but then, like his predecessors, was forced back by storms. In the course of his journey, De la Torre sighted for the first time some islets like modern-day Okinotorishima (which he named Parece Vela) and, possibly, Marcus Island along some of the Bonin Islands (which he called Islas del Arzobispo, \\"Archbishop Islands\\") including Chichijima (which he called Farfama) and the Volcano Islands subarchipelago (which he called Los Volcanes) which include the island of Iwo Jima. His explorations, among others, were mentioned in Juan de Gaetano's chronicle of his own exploration, entitled Viaje a las Islas de Poniente (\\"Voyage to the Islands towards the West\\", 1546). According to some sources, Bernardo de la Torre was the person who changed the name of what used to be known as Islas de Poniente (\\"Islands towards the West\\") to Felipinas or Philippines, to honour then Prince of Asturias and subsequent Spanish King Philip II of Spain. Other sources credit Villalobos instead. De la Torre was the first European to circumnavigate Mindanao and, in general, added a great deal to European knowledge of the Islas de Poniente.

Cherry once said, paraphrasing: \\"It's hard to get New Yorkers worked up about things. They take life in stride. They've seen it all. After I found God, I rushed home to share it with my parents. 'Mom, I found the Truth!' 'That's nice, dear. Do you want butter on your peas?'\\" Biography Born and raised in New York City, Cherry as a teenager was in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom during which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. A few years later Cherry acted on a desire for religious freedom as fervent as Dr. King's desire for African-American political and social equality. He joined the LDS Church in 1968 while in the US Air Force. By his own account in several speeches in Provo, Utah, given about 1975, his military status became an obstacle to his religious expression, although it is not to the grand majority of Mormons in the military. Cherry insisted on his own version of the dream: he sought a discharge. His course of action seen as dereliction of duty, he was punished by his superiors. When told the only immediate discharge he could have would be dishonorable, he persisted. The honors of men meant little to him, only the approval of God. After difficulties, they released Cherry to pursue his faith. In the early 1970s Cherry was part of the Mormon-rock band Sons of Mosiah, which had Orrin Hatch as their manager.Ron Simpson, \\"Utah's Songwriting Senator: Orrin Hatch Blends Politics and Music\\", Meridian Magazine, April 2009. He expressed his religious zeal in part by doing a BA and an MBA at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he was an original member of the Young Ambassadors, a touring performing group. In 1978, after LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball received divine revelation allowing black Mormon men to receive the Priesthood and act on behalf of God on Earth, Cherry sought and was called on a Mormon mission to Oakland, California. He later served in high local church callings. In 1985 Jessie Embry hired Cherry to interview black Mormons as part of BYU's LDS African-American Oral History Project. Doing this, Cherry met Janice Barkum, whom he married in the Salt Lake Temple in 1987, and with whom he has had three children. He was still directing this oral history project in 1988 when he spoke at the Charles Redd Center in a meeting on the tenth anniversary of the revelation of the priesthood.Ensign article on 10th anniversary meeting Cherry has had an occasional acting career in LDS produced or oriented movies. He played an IRS agent in Mormon Kieth Merrill's 1981 film Harry's War. He was also cast as a freed slave in the Mormon inspirational film Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration.

State is a landmark case in Ohio constitutional law in which the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the state's method for funding public education was unconstitutional. On March 24, 1997, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in a 4-3 decision that the state funding system \\"fails to provide for a thorough and efficient system of common schools,\\" as required by the Ohio Constitution, and directed the state to find a remedy. The court would look at the case several times over the next 12 years before it relinquished jurisdiction, but the underlying problems with the school funding system remain to this day. Background Following Ohio's 1851 constitutional convention, voters approved a new constitution that included provisions requiring a \\"thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State.\\". In 1923 the Supreme Court defined \\"thorough\\" and \\"efficient\\" in the landmark Miller v. Korns case Hignett, Christen (2005). \\"Ohio's Public School Funding System: The Unanswered Questions and the Unresolved Problems of Derolph\\". Capital University Law Review 33 (739): 744. Historically, Ohio's public schools have been funded with a combination of local property tax revenue and money from the state. This led to disparities in the quality of education in more affluent districts, where high property values led to greater funding, and urban and rural districts, where low property values left students with funding shortfalls and dilapidated facilities. Funding became even more difficult for districts in 1976, when House Bill 920 went into effect, essentially freezing the revenue from property taxes. A millage tax would usually generate more revenue as the value of property in a district increased, but HB 920 required county auditors to cut the tax rate to bring in the same amount of revenue each year. Even as inflation increased costs for schools, their revenue could not keep up, which forced them to ask voters to approve new levies every few years. Over the next 30 years, the state's school districts would send nearly 10,000 levies to the ballot. Voters grew weary of the constant campaigns, and unaware of the intricacies of the funding scheme, they often questioned why schools were constantly running out of money. Districts in both poor and affluent areas found the funding system unsustainable, and in 1988, superintendents from districts in underfunded areas in southeast Ohio formed the Coalition of Rural and Appalachian Schools to work together to address the problem. Lacking the funding to mount a serious legal challenge, they invited districts from around the state to join a new coalition: The Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding. The coalition, a council of governments representing nearly every school district in the state, was formed in 1991. It filed a complaint in the Perry County Court of Common Pleas on December 19, 1991, on behalf of Nathan DeRolph, a 15-year-old freshman at Sheridan High School and 550 school districts in the state. Represented by Bricker & Eckler LLP, the coalition named the state, the Ohio Board of Education, its superintendent, and the Ohio Department of Education as defendants in the suit, which alleged that the funding system did not meet the constitutional standard for thoroughness or efficiency and presented an exhaustive body of evidence demonstrating that the system produced unequal, inefficient, and inadequate results. The allegations went mostly unchallenged by the state, which in fact produced its own witnesses to testify to the inadequacy of the funding system. Held at the Perry County Courthouse in New Lexington,Thrane, Susan W. County Courthouses of Ohio. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2000, 119. the case produced a 30-day trial, a transcript more than 5,600 pages long and 450 exhibits before the trial judge, Linton D. Lewis, Jr., ruled on July 1, 1994 that Ohioans had a fundamental right to a state-funded education and that the state’s system for providing that education was unconstitutional. Furthermore, he ordered the board of education to devise a means for the General Assembly to eliminate wealth-based disparities in education. Although the board voted not to appeal, the attorney general’s office, which represents the state, filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in Canton. The appeals court’s 2-1 decision, handed down on August 30, 1995, held that a previous ruling by the state supreme court permitted disparities in education if the state provided for a basic education. Two months later, the coalition appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. DeRolph I=Prologue= In the days before the court heard the case, there was uncertainty on both sides as to how the justices would rule. The justices could be pigeonholed on certain issues but on education, their leanings were harder to categorize. Senate President Pro Tempore Richard Finan said that a ruling for the plaintiffs would be a \\"worst- case scenario\\" for the legislature because any solution put forward would be challenged as well while William L. Phillis, the director of the coalition, cast the decision as one between educating children for a rapidly evolving world or letting them fall behind. The case reached the Ohio Supreme Court on September 10, 1996. Chief Justice Thomas Moyer tripled the length of oral arguments, by letting each side present for ninety minutes. Bricker's Nicholas A. Pittner argued for the schools while Solicitor General Jeffrey Sutton defended the state. Pittner reiterated arguments that unequal funding and dilapidated buildings left some students with less opportunity than others. Sutton conceded that there were problems with the system but argued that they should be fixed locally, not by the court. He said that the state constitution guaranteed students an education for free, not the best possible education for free. Justices peppered both sides with questions, asking whether anyone should be held to account for funding inadequacies and focusing also on school facilities around the state, which Pittner noted were sometimes in such poor condition that they did not meet even the state's minimum standards for a humane prison. =The decision= By the time the justices adjourned to deliberate, two justices, Andrew Douglas and Paul Pfeifer, had decided that the funding system was unconstitutional and needed to be changed. Meanwhile, Justice Deborah L. Cook was adamant that the court should not be involved in school funding decisions and \\"never budged from that position,\\" but neither side had made that claim. A majority emerged among Justices Douglas, Pfeifer, Alice Robie Resnick, and Francis E. Sweeney, Sr. Meanwhile, Chief Justice Moyer and Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton indicated they were likely to join Cook but expressed more flexibility, depending on the language of the majority opinion, which was randomly assigned to Sweeney. Although formal deliberations had lasted about only half an hour, the justices continued to discuss the case one on one, as Sweeney tried to coax Moyer and Stratton into the majority. However, in the end, the decision was carried by the narrow, 4-3 majority that emerged after oral arguments. The March 24, 1997 ruling did the following: *it found the funding scheme for elementary and secondary education to be unconstitutional. *It ordered an end to the \\"school foundation program\\" and the reliance on property taxes for school funding *It provided the state 12 months to solve the problem. *It awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiffs. *It remanded the case to the trial judge. Resnick, Pfeifer, and Douglas each wrote separate concurring opinions. For the minority, Moyer's dissent acknowledged problems with school funding but questioned whether they actually violated the state constitution and argued that they were matters for the legislature to handle. =Reaction= The next day, Gov. George Voinovich, Senate President Richard H. Finan and House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson called a press conference to denounce the ruling. Voinovich suggested that his administration might defy the decision, and he classified the ruling as \\"judicial activism\\" and \\"a thinly veiled call for a massive, multi-billion tax increase.\\" Editorial boards at the largest papers in the state joined in, perhaps prodded by the governor's aides who argued that the decision put too much power in the hands of an unknown rural judge, echoing complaints by Republican Party lawmakers. The Plain Dealer wrote that \\"almost any other outcome would have been preferable.\\" The Columbus Dispatch called the ruling \\"one highly injudicious lurch\\" and dismissed claims that most districts in the state were underfunded. The Cincinnati Enquirer went as far as calling for a constitutional amendment that would trump the ruling, saying that otherwise, \\"education policy for 11 million Ohio residents will be dictated in a rural flyspeck on the state map.\\" The next week, the state filed a motion to reconsider, asking the court (1) whether property taxes could still be used to fund schools at all, (2) whether school funding debts remained valid even though repayment provisions extended beyond the court's deadline to find a new funding system, and (3) to retain jurisdiction over the case instead of sending it back to the trial court. The coalition opposed the motion, saying that the ruling was clear enough and that the state needed to instead get about the business of providing additional funding. Later that month, the court issued a ruling clarifying that property taxes could still be used if they were not the primary revenue source for school funding, debts remained valid, and the case would return to the trial judge, but appeals of his decision would bypass the Court of Appeals and go directly back to the Ohio Supreme Court.

Scott Caldwell, and Cliff DeYoung. The plot concerns a female-dominated society following the death of the majority of the world's men. Plot Sometime in a dystopian future, World War III with Afghanistan breaks out. An incurable biological weapon called the \\"Y-bomb\\", which targets the male Y-chromosome, is used and results in the eventual deaths of 97% of the world's men. Feeling that they are better off without men, the planet's women decide to outlaw men because they were too violent. Years later, scientist Hope Chayse, fearing for the future of the species, conducts a cloning experiment to produce a new male, Adam, genetically enhanced to mature from baby to adult in weeks and to refrain from violence. When Adam reaches maturity, he soon finds himself on the run from the FBI, and hiding out with small rebel bands of the last surviving men on Earth. =End= The house Adam and Hope are hiding in is burnt to the ground. Kara gives Hope her car and tells her to run away. She makes up a story about the bodies in the house being Hope and Adam's, while Doe escaped in her car. Three months later, Esther visits Hope, now working as a waitress in Virginia. Esther tells her that the test was positive—-Hope is pregnant with a son, since she and Adam had sex the night before he died. Main characters *Hope Chayse (Julie Bowen) - A CTU graduate student in Genetic Engineering who invented Adam, initially hoping to satisfy her heterosexual desire. She used genetic engineering, eliminating the genes connected to violence and aggression. Her product, Adam, is a \\"new type of man\\" that has no tendency of violence. *Adam (Paul Francis) - A man created by genetic engineering who reaches full maturity in 33 days and stops aging. He escapes from Hope to explore \\"the city\\" by himself only to find out that he is in a world that abhors men. He meets a teenage girl, who takes him to her sister Lilah, a cross-dressed pimp. Lilah tricks him by taking him to Mother May, owner of a high class brothel where she employs a number of older surviving men. *Agent Kara Hastings (Tamlyn Tomita) - An FBI agent who is determined to capture Adam and restore a violence- and man-free society. She is under the supervision of Director Elizabeth Riggs played by (Veronica Cartwright), who is running for President. Once, during a raid of Mother May's brothel, Hastings finds Riggs is a customer there. She is persuaded to make a deal with Hope to bring Adam back safe, so he can be presented at a scientific conference. *Esther (L.Scott Caldwell) Hope's professor, who opposes the idea of engineering a man. She eventually helps Hope to cure Adam of the Y-chromosome plague, injected into him by Riggs. *John Doe - Leader of the Reclaimers, a small group of old men living in a deserted football field who hope to reclaim the government one day. He blames women for the Y-bomb, made to annihilate men. Doe holds Adam hostage in exchange for women (inmates from the Federal Prison), hoping that they will let his men reproduce. However, when Hope, Kara and Esther try to use Doe's blood to cure Adam (due to his immunity), Doe takes Hope hostage and tries to rape her. Adam, although sick, picks up a gun and points it at him.

He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended South Hills High School and the Carnegie Mellon Managerial School. Biography A close ally of former Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri, Gigliotti was the Special Assistant to Director of the Pittsburgh Department of Public Works during the 1980s and served as a board member of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, also known as Alcosan. He was a Democratic chairman of Pittsburgh's 19th Ward. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1988. Gigliotti was known as a popular and friendly politician who had the \\"gift of gab.\\" During his tenure, Gigliotti was known as the House Democratic Caucus' \\"point man\\" for the proposed expansion of riverboat gambling. Over a period of 3 years in the late 1990s, Gigliotti extorted thousands of dollars from government contractors, who had hoped to gain contracts from Alcosan, where Gigliotti sat on the board. In 1998 and 1999, he took $17,100 in bribes in exchange for his influence over the awarding of a sludge recycling contract. Gigliotti then demanded 10 percent of the profits and then $2,000 a month from the contract. He also extorted plane fare and tickets to Disney World from an Alcosan engineering firm. In 1999, he tried to sell confidential Alcosan bid information to several competing firms. One of those firms included governmental informant Ernest Smalis, who recorded Gigliotti say, \\"[Expletive] the people.\\" In April 2000, he pleaded guilty to federal extortion, mail fraud, and tax evasion charges and was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison by United States federal judge Gustave Diamond, who said that \\"Gigliotti treated his political power and influence as a commodity to be sold for personal profit, which he did without restraint or regret.\\" Following the sentencing, the prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney told Gigliotti, \\"Frank, from everything I've been told, you're a loving father and grandfather. I hope your family carries you through this.\\" It was later discovered by The Morning Call that his political committee \\"Friends of Frank Gigliotti\\" had paid $3,000 to the Manifesto & Donahoe law firm in contravention of Pennsylvania's campaign finance laws, which states that such funds must be used \\"for the purposes of influencing the outcome of an election.\\" The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette noted that just prior to his resignation, Gigliotti clandestinely inserted \\"language into a bill to eradicate funding for Pittsburgh City Court.\\" Following his release from prison, Gigliotti took a job as a parking attendant with Alco Parking in Pittsburgh.

Cooper (August 21, 1927 – January 28, 2002) was an African-American activist during the Civil Rights Movement, businessman, and journalist. He was the publisher and editor-in-chief of The City Sun. Biography Cooper was born in 1927 in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Boys High School and Adelphi University. From 1951 through 1971, he was an executive of the F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company. In 1965, Cooper brought suit under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 against racial gerrymandering. African Americans and Latinos made up the majority of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in which he lived, but the neighborhood was divided among five congressional districts, each represented by a white Congressmember. Cooper opposed districts drawn in what he described as \\"so tortuous, artificial and labyrinthine a manner that the lines are irrational and unrelated to any proper purpose\\". His lawsuit, Cooper v. Power, was successful. It resulted in the creation of New York's 12th Congressional District and the election in 1968 of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress. In the 1970s, Cooper left the business world to become a journalist. He started the Trans-Urban News Service (TUNS) in 1977, with the dual goals of training minority journalists and producing reporting that was relevant to their communities. The Public Relations Society of America gave TUNS its top award in 1979 for its multi- part series on racial tensions between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights. Cooper wrote a weekly column, \\"One Man's Opinion\\", for the Amsterdam News and also wrote for The Village Voice. Cooper founded The City Sun, a weekly newspaper that covered issues of interest to African Americans in New York City, in 1984. According to The New York Times, The City Sun had a circulation of 18,500 in 1987. Financial difficulties forced Cooper to shut down The City Sun in 1996. Cooper was recognized as Journalist of the Year by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987 for his work at The City Sun. Cooper died in Brooklyn in 2002 of a stroke.

The first part of its name is derived from the founder's last name (Ishii), the second is an alternative reading of the characters for Nagakatsu, the founder's first name.A Guide to Kamakura, Choshoji , accessed on January 31, 2008 Nichiren, Matsubagayatsu and Chōshō–ji Kamakura is known among Buddhists for having been during the 13th century the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism. Founder Nichiren wasn't a native: he was born in Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture, but it was only natural for a preacher to come to Kamakura because at the time the city was the cultural and political center of the country.Mutsu (1995/2006:258-271) He settled down in a hut in the Matsubagayatsu district where three temples (Ankokuron-ji, Myōhō–ji, and Chōshō-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honor of being the sole heir of the master. All three say they lie on the very spot where he used to have his hut, however none of them can prove its claims. The Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book to Kamakura commissioned by Tokugawa Mitsukuni in 1685, already mentions a strained relationship between Myōhō–ji and Chōshō-ji.Kamiya (2006:141) However, when the two temples finally went to court, with a sentence emitted in 1787 by the shogunate's tribunals Myōhō–ji won the right to claim to be the place where Nichiren had his hermitage. It appears that Ankokuron-ji didn't participate in the trial because the government's official position was that Nichiren had first his hut there, when he first arrived in Kamakura, but that he made another near Myōhō–ji after he came back from his exile in Izu in 1263. What Chōshō-ji claims are the remains of the hut lie near the entrance of the Zaimokuza Reien cemetery, outside the temple's premises.The place is now occupied by a small temple, branch of Chōshō-ji. The temple was built by Ishii Nagakatsu, lord of this land in 1263, ten years after the other two. Even if it were built with Ankokuron-ji and Myōhō–ji by Nichiren when he entered Kamakura, the present temple is a later reconstruction by someone else. Whatever the truth, Chōshō- ji seems therefore to be the party in the dispute with the weakest arguments. Features of the temple Chōshō-ji's Hokke-dōNext to the temple's gate stands a huge statue of Nichiren himself surrounded by four Deva Kings, who are there to protect and serve him. Because at the time of his persecution Nichiren was saved by a white monkey, believed to be a retainer of god Taishakuten, the great building behind the statue (the Taishaku-dō) is dedicated to him. A little above the Taishaku-dō stands the Hokke-dō, a small building which is the temple's de facto main hall. The building, originally built during the Muromachi period, is an Important Cultural Property. It contains three more Important Cultural Properties, a gong (waniguchi), a lacquered dining table (kakeban), and a candle stand (shokudai). Every year on February 11 the temple hosts the Ceremony during which Buddhist priests douse themselves with cold water to pray for the country's safety.Kamakura Shōkō Kaigijo (2008:172) About 150 Nichiren priests from all over the country come here for the ceremony, participation to which being a precondition to be allowed to perform religious services.

Air Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport Montreal has two international airports, one for passenger flights only, and the other for cargo. Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (also known as Dorval Airport) in the City of Dorval serves all commercial passenger traffic and is the headquarters for Air Canada and Air Transat. To the north of the city is Montréal-Mirabel International Airport in Mirabel, which was envisioned as Montreal's primary airport but which now serves cargo flights along with MEDEVACs and general aviation as well as some passenger services.Hélibellule fait revivre le transport des passagers à Mirabel In 2016, Montreal-Trudeau was the third busiest airport in Canada by both passenger traffic and by aircraft movements, behind Toronto Pearson and Vancouver. In 2016, the airport handled 15.6 million passengers,https://calgaryherald.com/Business/loses+title+third+busiest+airport+expects+further+traffic+decline/1499974/story.html and 225,203 aircraft movements. With 61% of its passengers being on non- domestic flights it has the largest percentage of international flights of any Canadian airport. Trudeau airport is served by 40 carriers to over 100 destinations worldwide. Airlines servicing Trudeau offer flights to Africa, Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, the United States, Mexico and other destinations within Canada. Trudeau Airport is home to the largest duty- free shop in North America. Other airports in the Montreal area serve military and civilian use. Plattsburgh International Airport in the United States—closer to Montreal's southern suburbs than Trudeau—also serves the area. Public transportation to Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport is provided by the Société de transport de Montréal's bus line 747. A new electric light rail system, the Réseau électrique métropolitain, is currently in planning and will connect the airport with Montreal's downtown core upon completion, intended for 2020.  Surface Transportation = Rail = Exo runs commuter trains serving Greater Montreal such as this one on the Deux-Montagnes line. Place-Saint-Henri Metro Station.  Intercity passenger service  VIA Rail, which is headquartered in Montreal, provides rail service to other cities in Canada, particularly to Quebec City, Ottawa, and Toronto with several trains daily on its Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. Amtrak, the US national passenger rail system, also provides service to Montreal, operating its Adirondack daily between Montreal and New York City. All intercity trains operate out of Central Station. VIA and Amtrak trains also stop at several suburban stations, the largest of which is at Dorval, adjacent to the airport.  Regional passenger service  Regional passenger train service, geared largely to daily commuters to Montreal's central business district, is operated by Exo. Six train lines operate out of the Lucien-L'Allier and Central stations with Parc, Vendome, De La Concorde, and Sauvé as secondary stations. These facilities are all stops on the Metro system as well. Lines are operated under contract by Canadian National and Canadian Pacific. In some cases, Exo owns the track and infrastructure.  Freight service  Canadian Pacific Railway (known as CP or the CPR), now headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, was founded here in 1881. Its corporate headquarters occupied Windsor Station at 910 Peel Street until 1995. With the Port of Montreal kept open year-round by icebreakers, lines to Eastern Canada became surplus, and now Montreal is the railway's eastern and intermodal freight terminus. CPR connects at Montreal with the Port of Montreal, the Delaware & Hudson Railway to New York, the Quebec-Gatineau Railway to Quebec City and Buckingham, the Central Maine and Quebec Railway to Halifax, and CN Rail. The CPR's flagship passenger train, The Canadian, once ran daily from Windsor Station to Vancouver. CP's passenger services were transferred to VIA Rail Canada in 1978. Montreal-based Canadian National Railways (known as CN, or less-commonly, the CNR) was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government following a series of country-wide rail bankruptcies. CN was formed from the lines of the Grand Trunk, Midland and Canadian Northern Railways, and has risen to become CPR's chief rival in freight carriage in Canada. Like the CPR, CN transferred passenger services to VIA Rail Canada, now a crown corporation, but once part of CN itself. = Public Transit = Square-Victoria-OACI station by Hector Guimard. Greater Montreal is served by a number of public transit providers.  Société de transport de Montréal  The STM serves the Island of Montreal as well as islands of Bizard, des Soeurs, Notre Dame, and Sainte-Helene. The bus network consists of 165 daytime and 20 night-time service routes. STM also provides paratransit and limited wheelchair- accessible buses. = Metro = The Montreal Metro, a subway system, was inaugurated in 1966 and today has 68 stations spread out along its four lines.Plan du métro de Montréal All but five stations are on the Island of Montreal and in STM's territory. Each station was designed by different architects with individual themes and features original artwork, and the trains themselves run on rubber tires, making the system quieter than most. The project was initiated by Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau, who would later bring the Summer Olympic Games to Montreal in 1976. The Metro system has long had a station on the South Shore in the city of Longueuil, and has only recently been extended to the city of Laval, north of Montreal with 3 new stations. Since Sunday, February 7, 2016, the new Azur metro cars are accessible to the users, one of the many features of these new cars is that they can accommodate up to 8% more passengers than the current models who have been running since inauguration of the metro. The city of Montreal has announced plans to convert its entire fleet of buses over to all-electric by 2025.  Société de transport de Laval  The city of Laval, on neighboring Île Jésus, is served by the Société de transport de Laval (STL). The STL runs 40 routes, many of which connect to one of the three Laval Metro stations or to the RTM train station at Sainte-Dorothée. Other bus routes connect to Metro stations on the Island of Montreal, including Côte-Vertu and Henri-Bourassa.  Réseau de transport de Longueuil  Service to the densest part of Montreal's South Shore is provided by the Réseau de transport de Longueuil (RTL). RTL's numerous routes serve the Terminus Centre-Ville, the Longueuil Metro station, and several Exo train stations.  Exo  Exo provides commuter bus (as well as commuter rail) services to suburbs not served by the RTL or STL, via direct/express or feeder routes. In 2017, the Exo network carried more than 190,000 commuters daily.  Ferry services, summertime only  From late spring to early autumn, pedestrian/cyclist ferry service links the Old Port of Montreal, Saint Helen's Island, and the South Shore communities at Longueuil, a distance of . Mid-July 2016, a proposal was suggested by a competing riverboat operator at establishing summertime weekday rush-hour pedestrian ferry service between the downstream, northeastern, outermost borough of Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles and the Old Port, an approximate distance of . The city permanently adopted summertime sailings as of May 2019, and expanded service to seven days and six evenings per week. Having customarily trialed at 30 knots (approximately 34½ miles or 55½ kilometres per hour), implementation of the service has consequently seen its speediness reduced by at least one quarter; nonetheless, with its service even doubled during weekday peak hours it provides the valley with its swiftest sailings, and it even outpaces road traffic between its two docks. Other scheduled Island of Montreal services: * Lachine - Île Saint- Bernard (Châteauguay) * Mercier (Montreal) - Île Charron (Longueuil) * Pointe- aux-Trembles > Varennes (south shore) > Repentigny (north shore) > Pointe-aux- Trembles—a one-way circuitous trio of journeys that total 1½ hours' sailing time (roughly ½ hour each one). Further nearby scheduled St Lawrence River services include: * Boucherville - Île Grosbois * Île à Pinard - Île Sainte- Marguerite—entirely within Quebec's Boucherville Islands Park * Lavaltrie - Contrecœur * Les Coteaux - Salaberry-de-Valleyfield * Longueuil - Île Charron * Notre-Dame-de-L'Île-Perrot - Beauharnois * Notre-Dame-de-L'Île-Perrot - Pointe-des-Cascades  Réseau express métropolitain  On 22 April 2016 the forthcoming automated rapid transit system, the Réseau express métropolitain, was unveiled. Groundbreaking occurred 12 April 2018, and construction of the network – consisting of three branches, 26 stations, and the conversion of the region's busiest commuter railway – commenced the following month. To be opened in three phases as of 2021, the REM will be completed by mid-2023, becoming the fourth largest automated rapid transit network after the Dubai Metro, the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit, and the Vancouver SkyTrain. Most of it will be financed by pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. Montreal Public Transportation Statistics The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montreal, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 87 min. 29.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.7 km, while 17% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. = Road Network = Jacques Cartier Bridge. Like many major cities, Montreal has a problem with vehicular traffic congestion, especially from off-island suburbs such as Laval on Île Jésus, and Longueuil on the south shore. The width of the Saint Lawrence River has made the construction of fixed links to the south shore expensive and difficult. There are only four road bridges along with one road tunnel, two railway bridges, and a Metro line. The far narrower Rivière des Prairies, separating Montreal from Laval, is spanned by eight road bridges (six to Laval and two directly to the north shore). On the Island of Montréal motorists are forbidden from turning right while facing a red traffic signal, a move permitted elsewhere in the Province of Quebec.  Limited-access highways (Autoroutes)  The island of Montreal is a hub for the Québec Autoroute system, and is served by Québec Autoroutes A-10 (known as the Bonaventure Expressway on the island of Montreal), A-15 (aka the Decarie Expressway south of the A-40 and the Laurentian Autoroute to the north of it), A-13 (aka Autoroute Chomedey), A-20, A-25, A-40 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and known as \\"The Metropolitan\\" or simply \\"The Met\\" in its elevated mid-town section), A-520, and A-720 (aka the Ville-Marie Autoroute). Many of these Autoroutes are frequently congested at rush hour. However, in recent years, the government has acknowledged this problem and is working on long- term solutions to alleviate the congestion. One such example is the extension of Quebec Autoroute 30 on Montreal's south shore, which will serve as a bypass. Today's existing highways have been planned in the 1960s as part of a grid like transport system.  Street grid system  Since Montreal is on an island, the directions used in the city plan do not precisely correspond with compass directions, as they are oriented to the geography of the island. North and south are defined on an axis roughly perpendicular to the St. Lawrence River and the Rivière des Prairies: North is towards the Rivière des Prairies, and south is towards the St. Lawrence. East (downstream) and west (upstream) directions are defined as roughly parallel to the St. Lawrence River and the Rivière des Prairies, despite the fact that both rivers flow from the southwest to the northeast. Saint Lawrence Boulevard, also known as \\"The Main,\\" divides Montreal into east and west sectors. Streets that cut across Saint Laurent Boulevard undergo a name change, in that Est or Ouest are appended to their names. Streets that do not cross the Main do not generally contain a cardinal direction at the end of their names. Address numbering begins at one at Saint Lawrence Boulevard. The numbers increase as you move away from the boulevard. On north-south streets, house numbers begin at the Saint Lawrence River and the Lachine Canal and increase to the north. Odd numbers are on the east or north sides of the street, with even numbers on the west or south sides. Numbered streets generally run north and south, and the street numbers increase to the east. Moreover, the addresses are on a grid- axis system, as in many North American cities. Streets generally retain their grid position throughout their course, even if they are slightly diagonal. For example: *Sherbrooke Street, which runs \\"east-west\\" is 3400 (north of the Saint Lawrence), so a house on the north-east corner of Sherbrooke St. would theoretically be numbered 3401, and on the north-west 3400. *Saint Hubert Street, which runs \\"north-south\\" is 800 East, so a house on the north-east corner of St-Hubert St, would be 801 (or 801 East if the street crosses Saint Lawrence Boulevard), and a house on the south-east corner would be 800 East. *Peel Street, which runs \\"north-south\\" is 1100 West, so a house on the north- west corner of Peel St, would be 1101 (or 1101 West if the street crosses Saint Lawrence Boulevard), and a house on the south-west corner would be 1100 West. Ville-Marie Expressway, near Old Montreal An anomaly is that zero is the Saint Lawrence River and the Lachine Canal, so address numbers south of the canal begin at zero at the river, then increase toward the canal, and the canal resets the address grid back to zero. There are only two streets (Atwater and Charlevoix) that cross the canal without changing names, so that addresses south of the canal add a 0 (zero) before the number to act as a \\"negative\\" (though they still increase northward and respect the grid of the streets parallel to them). Therefore, 0400 Charlevoix St. is south of the canal, and 400 north of it. Other grid axes: * North-south streets, east side: St-Denis 400, Amherst/Christophe-Colomb 1100, Papineau 1800, De Lorimier 2100, Pie-IX Blvd 4100, Honoré-Beaugrand 8000, St-Jean-Baptiste Blvd 12000, Rousselière 14000. * North-south streets, west side: Park Avenue 300, Peel 1100, Atwater 3000, Décarie 5300, Cavendish 6500. * East-west streets: Notre- Dame 500, René-Lévesque Blvd 1150, Sainte-Catherine 1400, Ontario 2000, Sherbrooke 3400, Mont-Royal Avenue 4500, St-Joseph Blvd 5000, Beaubien 6500, Jean-Talon 7200, Jarry 8100, Henri-Bourassa 10700, De Salaberry 12000. Gouin Blvd, which follows the shore of Rivière des Prairies, is too crooked to have a constant grid reference. The grid-axis system was introduced by the City of Montreal in the mid-1920s, but was not generally adopted by neighboring towns. Most on-island suburbs or boroughs merged recently on the west side of the island still have separate numbering systems, though most streets that start in the 9 original boroughs continue the Montreal numbering beyond its old borders. The highest address in Montreal is 23000 Gouin Boulevard West in the borough of Pierrefonds. = Street naming = Most streets in Montreal do not change name throughout their course, respecting their grid axis. Streets such as Saint Laurent Boulevard, Papineau Ave., De Lorimier Ave. and Pie-IX Blvd. have a foot in both rivers, and some streets re-commence despite gaps or interruptions. There are a few notable exceptions which continue for historical reasons. A few north-south streets which begin in Old Montreal change name at Saint Antoine Street (formerly Craig Street), site of the former city wall (Saint-Pierre → Bleury → Park Avenue, Bonsecours → Saint- Denis). Only one street changes name many times: McGill Street → Square- Victoria Street → Beaver Hall Hill → Frère-André Place → Phillips Place → Phillips Square → Aylmer St. According to the rules of the Commission de toponymie du Québec, the French-language form of street names is the only official one, and is to be used in all languages: e.g. chemin de la Côte-des- Neiges; rue Sainte-Catherine; côte du Beaver Hall. Most English speakers, however, use English generic equivalents such as \\"street\\" or \\"road\\", as do English-language media such as the Montreal Gazette. Officially bilingual boroughs have the right to use such names in official contexts, such as on street signs. In the past, a number of streets had both English and French names, such as \\"avenue du Parc\\" or \\"Park Avenue\\", \\"rue de la Montagne\\" or \\"Mountain Street\\", \\"rue Saint-Jacques\\" or \\"Saint James Street\\". Some of these names are still in common colloquial use in English, and perpetuated by the tourism industry. Many streets incorporate an English specific name into French, such as \\"chemin Queen Mary\\", \\"rue University\\", \\"avenue McGill College\\". There are also a few cases where two names are official, such as \\"chemin du Bord-du-Lac/Lakeshore Road\\". In English, the pre-Francization names are still commonly used, thus, although only the French is 'official', in English one often hears names such as Park Avenue, Mountain Street, Saint Lawrence Boulevard, Pine Avenue, Saint John's Boulevard etc. Canada Post accepts the French specific with English generic, as in \\"de la Montagne Street\\" or \\"du Parc Avenue\\", although many such forms are never used in speaking. Another anomaly that typifies this kind of mixed heritage and history is René Lévesque Boulevard. Once called \\"Dorchester Boulevard\\" in its entirety, this long east-west street was renamed for Quebec former nationalist Prime Minister René Lévesque, except for sections that run through the very Anglophone city of Westmount. However, the entire street is still sometimes referred to as \\"Dorchester.\\" It is useful to note that, in Montreal as in other cities, the generic is usually omitted in either language, so one would simply talk of Park (or Du Parc), Mountain (or De la Montagne), Saint Lawrence (or Saint Laurent), University, McGill College, Doctor Penfield, or Fairmount. This is mainly because a specific is almost never given to two streets. If duplication exists, they are always in different boroughs or towns and are retained for historical reasons. For example, Montreal's present 19 boroughs have 6 streets named \\"Victoria\\" (2 streets, 2 avenues, one court, and one square), and 9 more in on- or off-island suburbs. In recent years Montreal and most of its suburbs have dispensed entirely with such generic and linguistically fraught terms on their street signage. = Cycling and Cycling Infrastructure = The Copenhagenize Index ranked Montreal in the world's top 20 cycling-friendly cities from 2011 to 20192019 Copenhagenize Index.

Numerous factors influence walkability such as street infrastructure, safety measures and mixed land use. Benefits include positive contributions to health and happiness, the environment, and socioeconomic factors.  Background  Active transportation, including walking, accounted for 15% of trips in Montreal in 2013, an increase of 9.1% from 2008. The largest increase was observed in neighbourhoods near the city centre. Based on ease of access to errands by foot, Montreal is ranked by Walk Score as the second-most walkable city in Canada, with inner-city neighbourhoods such as Plateau Mont-Royal, Outremont and Ville-Marie obtaining the highest marks. Montreal is also home to around 50 car-free streets and one of the world’s largest indoor pedestrian networks, improving access by foot to the downtown area. Challenges A key challenge to walkability is safety, with 19 pedestrian fatalities reported in 2019. Policymakers have responded by investing in improved pedestrian signals (Jadah, 2019: online) and by modifying traffic speeds and rights-of-way. In the Plateau Mont-Royal, Mayor Luc Ferrandez has gone further and cooperated with other boroughs to unveil a comprehensive action plan to prevent accidents. Montreal’s pedestrian population also includes 122,600 people with limited mobility who face unique challenges. For these individuals, pedestrian-oriented infrastructure such as sidewalk cafés can limit mobility by blocking sidewalk access. Another challenge to walkability is higher precipitation or wind speeds in the winter months, which has a strong negative effect on pedestrian count. Montreal almost implemented heated sidewalks on St. Catherine street to combat the winter weather, but eventually decided against it, due to costs. However, Montreal’s underground city allows pedestrians to be protected from the weather while they walk from metro stops to some downtown buildings.  Increasing walkability  Walkability can be improved by ensuring: ● Pedestrians are the main priority ● Safe, attractive, and highly connected pedestrian circulation ● Denser neighbourhoods with mixed uses that support public activity ● Transit networks that are alongside highly walkable areas ● Complete streets that support multiple modes of transport ● Limited, higher-priced curbside parking and hidden parking lots _Montreal’s Plans that Promote Walkability_ Following are some of the plans implemented in Montreal that focus on increasing walkability: ● Plan de Transport (2008) - Reduced the dependence on automobiles and focus on active modes of transportation. ● Plan D’Action en Accessibilité Universelle de la Ville de Montréal (2015-2018) - Pushed for universal accessibility especially for people with functional limitations. ● Politique de Stationnement (2016) - Introduced a new parking pricing approach, create an environment that supports more sustainable mobility, and create a government body to manage parking. ● Plan D’Action Montréal Physiquement Active (2014-2025) - Push for compact urban areas, more pedestrian networks, and safer cycling routes to promote a more active lifestyle. ● Vision Zéro (2019-2021) - Reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the road to zero.  Benefits = Health = Health benefits arise from nutritious food accessibility, high urban density, and physical activity. Moreover, walkability benefits seniors experiencing a decrease in mobility post retirement. * Food access: Montreal ranks as the second Canadian city for widespread food insecurities and has a high number of food deserts, with a relatively high proportion of the population unable to access fresh food within a 500m radius. Having affordable healthy food within a walkable distance improves its inhabitants’ health potential. Indeed, the spatial unattainability of nutritious food is one of the leading causes of obesity in North America and \\"in 2007, the obesity rate of Montreal adults was 14.8%, compared with 11.8% in Toronto and 8.6% in Vancouver\\". * Cardiovascular health & Obesity: Urban environments such as parks and green spaces can passively or intentionally stimulate the cardiovascular system leading to reduced obesity and an overall healthier and longer life. Contrary to gyms, these spaces are accessible to the whole socioeconomic spectrum, making shorter distances to such settings essential for the population’s health. Mount-Royal park’s immense size and central geographic position permit accessibility to a significant number of inhabitants. However, smaller parks are not found equally throughout Montreal. The future burden of chronic disease from obesity lies in Canadians with average BMI, and thereby a walkable environment benefits the greater number. Densely built neighbourhoods reduce physical inactivity since motorized commuting is unnecessary. Montreal is an island- city, thereby has a low index of urban sprawl. Besides its center, it possesses many dense mixed land-use neighbourhoods such as the Plateau and the Mile-End, which favour daily cardiovascular activity. * Seniors: Walking is the main physical activity in the senior population of Montreal (individuals over the age of 65), decreasing the likelihood of physical and mental health issues. Walkability for seniors is influenced by physical mobility, individual abilities and spatial accessibility. Locations that exhibit greater walkability have more crosswalks, four-way intersections and limited dead- ends. Research shows that regions in Greater Montreal that have stronger walkability to grocery stores, have improved independent ageing for seniors, meaning their autonomy to carry out essential tasks safely is prioritized. Further research is needed to make regions more age-friendly, especially for seniors since walking is a key factor in improving the quality of life due to the health benefits of remaining physically active. = Environment = Montreal has 17 large parks, representing a combined area of 4900 acres. Green spaces like Jean Drapeau Park and Bois-de-l'Île-Bizard Nature Park promote walkability through the addition of pedestrian safe zones. In July 2016, there was an estimated 1.7 °C difference between “Car-Dependent” and “Walkers’ Paradise” neighbourhoods in Montreal, revealing that regions with increased walkability had lower urban air pollution and air temperatures due to less vehicle emissions. To further mitigate increasing temperatures, Saint Michel, Montreal has a plan by 2032 to plant new vegetation (i.e. trees) to promote walkability by cooling pedestrian walkways, benefiting the environment through carbon sequestration ). = Socioeconomic: = In Montreal, walking behaviour between regions varies due to socioeconomic factors like education level, employment and income. Research shows that low-income individuals in Montreal live in regions with less walkability due to a lack of infrastructure including pedestrian lanes and proper street lighting. However, overall walkability increases access to local businesses, thus promoting social interactions. Increasing urban development in tourist destinations like Old Montreal will subsequently increase walkability and attract more tourists and locals, promoting economic growth. = Taxi =Cars For people who need a car for a short term, Montreal has many services to offer among auto sharing or car rental. If you are looking for a car-sharing company, Communauto is the most popular one. Amigo Express is online platform which allows you to find a lift to any destination in Quebec. If you need a car for a road trip or another specific need, several rental companies have branches in Montreal. Pay attention if you need to park in Montreal, it is not that easy to find the right place and the right moment, you will also probably have to pay your parking, please refer to the traffic rules.  Marine  The region of Montreal is centred upon the Island of Montreal, part of an archipelago in the Saint Lawrence River. As a result, marine transportation has been integral to the region's history. The Port of Montreal is one of the largest inland ports in the world. Montreal also sits at the head of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, a waterway that allows ocean-going vessels to travel as far as Lake Erie and beyond. The Seaway replaced the earlier Lachine Canal which was the first facility that allowed boats to bypass the Lachine Rapids.

After fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars, he was promoted to command an infantry regiment at the beginning of the First French Empire. He led the unit during the War of the Third Coalition in 1805. The following year he fought in the War of the Fourth Coalition. The year 1808 found him at Zaragoza in Spain where he was wounded. In 1809 he led a brigade during the War of the Fifth Coalition at Gefrees. Taupin transferred again to Spain where he fought in the Peninsular War including the battles of Bussaco and Salamanca. He was appointed to command an infantry division in October 1812 and in January 1813 was promoted general of division. In 1813 he led his division in the battles of the Pyrenees, San Marcial, the Bidassoa, Nivelle and the Nive. In 1814 he conducted a particularly stubborn defense at Orthez and was fatally wounded leading an attack at Toulouse. Ironically, his death came a few days after Napoleon abdicated his throne. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 37. Revolution Taupin was born in Barbery, Oise on 17 August 1767. According to a list of transactions that were recorded by the Count of Clermont, Taupin was a warden of the Forest of Pomeraie. He enlisted in the Infantry Regiment de Roi (King's Regiment) on 14 May 1787. He participated in the Estates-General of 1789 as a deputy from Barbery. On 16 February 1791 the Regiment de Roi was disbanded. On 18 September 1791, he joined the 1st battalion of National Volunteers of the Oise as a sous lieutenant and was named captain on 31 January 1792. From 1792 to 1795, he soldiered with the Army of the North and earned promotion to chef de bataillon (major) on 24 May 1794. The 1st Battalion of Oise Volunteers became first the 183rd Demi-Brigade which in 1796 became the 28th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade. From 1796 to 1798, Taupin served in the Army of the Interior and the Army of England. Beginning in 1799, he was assigned to the Army of the Danube. Taupin fought at the Battle of Montebello on 9 June 1800. He stopped the advance of the Austrian right wing, capturing a body of enemy soldiers and several cannons. He was wounded at the Battle of Marengo. During this battle, the 28th Line formed the advance guard of Jean Lannes' corps. Taupin continued fighting in the 1801 campaign in the Army of Italy. For his bravery at Montebello, he received a saber of honor on 24 January 1802. He was wounded in the thigh on 17 December 1802 at Larozotte. He became a member of the Légion d'honneur on 24 September 1803. He transferred to the 11th Line Infantry on 22 December 1803 as a major. Empire=Germany= Taupin became an officer of the Légion d'honneur on 14 June 1804. He was named colonel of the 103rd Line Infantry Regiment on 1 February 1805. In this capacity, he led his regiment in all the major campaigns from 1805 to 1807 and fought at the Battle of Dürenstein in 1805. The 103rd Line was in Honoré Theodore Maxime Gazan's division of the V Corps at Dürenstein. When the division was attacked by an overwhelmingly superior force of Russians and Austrians on 11 November, it was able to cut its way out of the trap, though it suffered losses of 2,300 men. He was wounded during the battle. Taupin became a commander of the Légion d'honneur on 25 December 1805. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of Taupin's 103rd Regiment served in Gazan's 2nd Division of Lannes' V Corps at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806. In December, the 103rd Line fought in the Battle of Pułtusk. The V Corps missed the bloody Battle of Eylau because it and Nicolas Léonard Beker's dragoon division were covering Warsaw. The corps was under the command of Anne Jean Marie René Savary when it fought in the Battle of Ostrołęka on 15 February. The 103rd Line participated in this engagement in which Ivan Essen's Russian corps was defeated. Taupin was promoted to general of brigade on 21 February 1807 and raised to the peerage as a Baron of the Empire on 2 July 1808. He was sent to Spain with the 2nd Division of the V Corps in September 1808. He was wounded in the right thigh on 27 December at the Second Siege of Zaragoza and sent home to France to recover. The War of the Fifth Coalition found him in command of a brigade in Marshal François Christophe de Kellermann's Reserve Corps, a rear-echelon formation based at Frankfurt. His command included the 4th Battalions of the 36th, 50th, and 75th Line Infantry Regiments, a total of 2,397 soldiers. The brigade formed part of Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffiniere's division, along with the brigades of Alexandre Theodore Victor Lameth and Jean André Villeteaux. On 8 July 1809 the brigades of Taupin and Lameth with some attached units were defeated by Michael von Kienmayer's Austrians in the Battle of Gefrees. The 5,600-man French force was led by Jean-Andoche Junot. =Spain and Portugal: 1810–1812= Taupin came to Spain as part of the 2nd Division under Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. On 15 September 1810, he commanded a brigade in Bertrand Clausel's division of Junot's VIII Corps during the Battle of Bussaco. The 1,949-man brigade consisted of the 4th Battalions of the 15th Light, 46th Line, and 75th Line Infantry Regiments. The VIII Corps was part of Marshal André Masséna's Army of Portugal. While the French were engaged in the 1810 Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo Taupin vowed to shoot any French soldier that came into his brigade's area to forage for grain. During the invasion, Taupin's brigade was in the advance guard and began to pillage Coimbra as soon as that city was occupied. When other French officers complained, Junot refused to do anything. Taupin served throughout the 1810–11 invasion of Portugal. Battle of Salamanca Taupin led a brigade in Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet's division at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro on 3–5 May 1811. The brigade comprised the 1st, 2nd and 4th Battalions of the 50th and 59th Line Infantry Regiments and was part of Louis Henri Loison's VI Corps. Mermet's division was part of Masséna's flank attack on 5 May. This turned the Allied right flank, but Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington placed his right flank in a new position which Massena did not attack. In the summer of 1812, Taupin called his officers together at a village church and lectured from the pulpit about the overuse of horses and mules in the infantry. The veteran recalled that in 1793 he had a haversack to carry his belongings and a stone for a pillow. He railed against officers keeping riding horses and using too many mules to carry their baggage. Ironically, Taupin himself had six mules to carry his personal baggage. At the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Taupin led a brigade in Antoine Francois Brenier de Montmorand's 6th Division. The 2,706-strong brigade included two battalions of the 17th Light and three battalions of the 65th Line Infantry Regiments. Brenier's division arrived on the field as Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's division was being ridden down by a British heavy cavalry brigade under John Le Marchant. Attacked by Le Marchant's horsemen, Brenier's other brigade, consisting of the 22nd Line, shot down one- fourth of the troopers of the leading squadron. However, the British dragoons rode into it and routed it. Le Marchant was killed in the struggle, shot through the spine. In the battle, Taupin's two regiments sustained lighter losses than 21 officers lost by the 22nd Line. The 17th Light lost nine officers while the 65th lost only three. In the Burgos Campaign during October 1812, Taupin commanded the 3rd Division of the Army of Portugal which was formerly led by Claude François Ferey. The division was made up of two battalions each of the 31st Light, 26th Line and 70th Line plus three battalions of the 47th Line Infantry Regiment. =Spain and France: 1813= Battle of Sorauren: Taupin's division attacked the position marked \\"4th Dn & Campbels Portuguese\\". On 28 January 1813 Taupin was promoted to general of division. After the Burgos Campaign, the French armies spread out to re-occupy Spain. That winter, Napoleon ordered the Army of Portugal to be placed at the disposition of Bertrand Clausel's Army of the North to suppress the Spanish guerillas. On 30 March Taupin's division moved to Vitoria to assist the Army of the North. In mid-May, while Clausel attacked the guerillas under Francisco Espoz y Mina with three divisions, Taupin's troops guarded Navarre. The Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813 marked the end of the French Kingdom of Spain. Clausel's four divisions belatedly neared the battlefield on 22 June before turning away after hearing rumors of the defeat. Though pursued for a time by Wellington's troops, Clausel retreated via Jaca over the Somport Pass on 12 July. After Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult reorganized the army in July, Taupin assumed command of the 8th Division. His 5,981-man division included the same four regiments from October 1812 plus the newly-added 9th Light and the 88th Line. The brigade commanders were Jean-Pierre Béchaud and Jean Lecamus. In the Battle of the Pyrenees in late July 1813, Taupin's division fought in Clausel's corps and suffered 131 killed, 1,045 wounded and 26 captured. His division was not engaged in the Battle of Roncesvalles on 25 July. In the Battle of Sorauren on 28 July, Taupin's whole division launched an assault on the hill of Oricain with Lecamus' brigade on the right and Béchaud's brigade on the left. Normally light companies were used to skirmish. Since Taupin employed his grenadier companies also, the French skirmish line was twice as strong as usual. Lecamus' brigade was repulsed before it reached the crest, but Béchaud's troops briefly established themselves on the crest before being driven off. In the Battle of San Marcial on 31 August, Clausel's divisions crossed the Bidassoa River at dawn, covered by fog. After the mist cleared, the divisions of Taupin and Jean Barthélemy Darmagnac began pressing back William Inglis' British brigade and a Portuguese brigade. At 3:00 pm Clausel received Soult's order to withdraw just as a very heavy rainstorm began. By the time the retreating divisions reached the Bidassoa, the river was rising dangerously. The first brigades of both Taupin and Darmagnac got across but the second brigades became stranded on the far bank with Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen's division. Vandermaesen marched upstream to the bridge at Bera (Vera) and at 2:00 am on 1 September began making desperate attacks against the 100 British riflemen defending the span. The French finally dislodged the defenders and escaped, though Vandermaesen and many others were killed. Bertrand Clausel In the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October 1813, Taupin's 4,700-man division held the ridge north of Bera. It was attacked by 6,500 soldiers from the British Light Division and Francisco de Longa's Spanish division advancing north from Bera. On the right flank, Béchaud's brigade held the Bayonette Spur which included the Saint Benôit fort and the Bayonette Redoubt. Lecamus' brigade (under Colonel Cambriel) defended the Hog's Back and the Vera Pass on the left flank. Allied forces led by James Kempt drove back Cambriel's brigade rather easily and seized the crest while sustaining only 78 casualties. John Colborne's brigade had more difficult time and its first attack on the Saint Benôit fort was repulsed. The French chased their enemies downhill and were out of order when the British supporting battalion appeared. The Allies returned to the attack and ousted the French from the fort. Then they fought their way to the top of the spur where they overran the redoubt also. Colborne's brigade lost 302 men killed or wounded. British officers remarked that the French soldiers fought less stubbornly than in the past. Half of the total French casualties of 1,673 men were in Taupin's division. During the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813, Taupin's division held the second line. By 10:00 am Clausel's two front line divisions were driven back into the second line. When attacked again the two broken divisions began to unravel and Clausel asked Taupin to send help. When Taupin's line was assaulted, most of his soldiers fought poorly and their fortifications were quickly overrun. Taupin blamed the defeat on the fact that his reserves had been sent away to help the other divisions. The battalion of the 88th Line in the Signals Redoubt repulsed several attacks by the British 52nd Foot but it was soon isolated by the retreat of other units. At length the 88th Line was forced to surrender and disappeared from the French order of battle. By 2:00 pm Clausel's corps was forced back behind the Nivelle River. Taupin's division lost 68 killed, 375 wounded and 498 captured. After the Nivelle the 8th Division was suppressed, but Soult appointed Taupin as commander of the 4th Division to replace Nicolas François Conroux who had been killed. The division, which counted 6,098 soldiers, included two battalions each of the 12th Light, 32nd Line and 43rd Line and one battalion each of the 45th, 55th and 58th Line. Though the Battle of the Nive lasted from 9 to 13 December 1813, Taupin's division was only lightly engaged, sustaining only 197 casualties. The 4th Division was involved in the advance on Arcangues on 10 December, but the Allied position was so strong that Clausel declined to press the attack. =France: 1814= Battle of Toulouse map shows the attacks of Rey's and Gasquet's brigades at lower right. At the Battle of Orthez on 26 February 1814, Taupin's division held the French right flank at the Plassotte Knoll overlooking the village and church of Saint-Boès. Wellington planned to turn the French right flank using Lowry Cole's British 4th Division. Soon after 8:30 am, Cole's leading brigade under Robert Ross seized the church and village, but it was unable to advance beyond the village. When Cole brought up an artillery battery to suppress the French guns, the battery commander was killed and two of its guns were knocked out. Cole renewed the assault, throwing in José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on the right of Ross. However, the second attack was also beaten back, Ross going down with a wound and the Allied soldiers falling back to the village. Presently Taupin counterattacked and his men recaptured part of the village. Despite being reinforced by the Portuguese 1st Caçadores from the Light Division, Cole's entire line soon collapsed and his soldiers abandoned Saint-Boès. His initial plan thwarted, Wellington ordered a general assault on the French position at 11:30 am. The attack on Taupin's division was renewed by the British 7th Division under George Townshend Walker. Supported by a Portuguese brigade on the right and two battalions on the left, Walker launched the 6th Foot, followed by three more battalions at Taupin's defenses. In addition Wellington sent the 52nd Foot to turn Taupin's left flank. By this time the rest of the French army was retreating. After a four-hour defense, Taupin's tired men withdrew; they were the last French soldiers to relinquish their position. At Orthez, Taupin's division lost 77 killed, 463 wounded and 51 captured. Cole's division suffered 304 British and 295 Portuguese casualties, while Walker's division reported 368 British casualties. In the Light Division, the 52nd Foot sustained 89 casualties and the 1st Caçadores lost 47. At the Battle of Toulouse on 10 April, Taupin's division consisted of two brigades under Jean- Pierre-Antoine Rey (3,039 men) and Joseph Gasquet (2,416) men). Wellington ordered William Carr Beresford to take the British 4th and 6th Divisions on a flank march alongside the Ers River to strike Soult's right flank on Mont Rave. The route being through muddy fields, Beresford's march was considerably delayed, causing the Spanish corps to attack prematurely and suffer a repulse. When Beresford finally reached the extreme French right, his six brigades began to advance up Mont Rave in three lines of two brigades each. Soult ordered Taupin's division to change position and then charge downhill against the Allied forces. Rey's brigade was on the right with the 12th Light leading while Gasquet's was on the left with the 47th Line leading. The outer flanks were supported by cavalry. Rather than forming his battalions into line, Taupin sent the two columns marching downhill in a narrow formation. They advanced in battalion column with the battalions one behind the other and were shot to pieces by their British opponents deployed in line. Taupin was fatally shot alongside Rey's leading battalion while trying to encourage his soldiers. The French soldiers panicked and fled uphill, followed by the British. Seeing Rey's brigade in flight, Gasquet's brigade also ran away and the soldiers manning the Sypière Redoubt fled. Taupin died at 11:00 am and later that day his body was left in the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne. On 12 April the official couriers arrived from Paris with news that Napoleon had abdicated and the war was over. The name Taupin appears on the west side of the Arc de Triomphe.

His father was a pilot and his mother was an economist working for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade; during his childhood, the family moved to Moscow. From 1991 to 1996 Chichvarkin studied at the State Academy of Management, as well as earning money trading on Moscow flea markets. After graduating Chichvarkin started studying for a PhD (Kandidat), which he abandoned in 1998. Yevroset Company In 1997 Chichvarkin and his friend Timur Artemev started a business named Yevroset to sell mobile phones. In 2002 Yevroset became one of the top three Moscow mobile phone retailers, with 92 retail outlets. The company opened 100 more outlets in 2002, 117 more outlets in 2003, 800 more outlets in 2004, 1934 more outlets in 2005, etc. In 2007 they had 5156 outlets in 12 countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Criminal prosecution In August 2005 Chichvarkin was accused of involvement in the illegal import of a $100 million shipment of mobile phones, but the accusations were eventually dropped. In March 2006 a large consignment of Motorola mobile phones shipped for Chichvarkin was seized on the pretext that their emissions of microwave radiation exceeded the levels permitted by Russian health regulations. After those cases Chichvarkin accused Russian law- enforcement agencies of corporate raiding.Экс-владелец «Евросети» Евгений Чичваркин объявлен в розыск Obshchaya Gazeta 23 January 2009 In March 2007 Chichvarkin was mentioned by the media in connection with the case of Dmitry Sidorov, the founder Iled M, which was accused of large scale tax avoidance. Iled M had sold mobile phones to Yevroset as well as to other retailers. In August 2007 the apartments of many Yevroset employees were searched by police. Some experts considered the searches to be connected with the Idel M case, while other saw it as a continuation of Motorola case. Others still viewed it as a marketing ploy by Yevroset themselves (the last chance to buy their phones before they are confiscated), others as a siloviks' revenge on Chichvarkin. In September 2008 the headquarters of Yevroset were searched in connection with its handling of Andrey Vlaskin, a Yevroset employee who in 2003 stole mobile phones worth around 20 million Russian roubles (approximately US$1 million). Vlaskin was caught by Yevroset security in Tambov, moved to Moscow to a Yevroset-owned apartment and after some time agreed to compensate Yevroset for their losses. While between 2004 and 2007 Yevroset and Vlaskin apparently had no claims on each other, in 2008 Yevroset was accused of kidnapping, illegal imprisonment and extortion. On 21 September 2008 Chichvarkin sold 100% of Yevroset stock to Alexander Mamut. The volume of the transaction was US$400 million. In January 2009 Chichvarkin moved to the United Kingdom and on 23 January 2009 on Russian federal search list in connection with the Vlaskin case. On 28 January the Basmanny Court of Moscow approved Chichvarkin's arrest (in absentia). On 12 March 2009 his details were passed to Interpol. On 13 April 2009 the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia noticed that a key investigator of Chichvarkin's case, Vladimir Knyazyev, had previously been sentenced for stealing a large consignment of mobile phones from Chichvarkin's Yevroset. During the 2007 contraband case he had forged the act of destroying the phones confiscated as evidence. The investigation committee demanded the dismissal of Knyazyev because of the conflict of interest but their demands were refused. On 17 November 2010 the jury found all the defendants in the Vlaskin case not guilty. The prosecution's appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected on 20 January 2011 and Chichvarkin's indictment was withdrawn a few days later. His lawyer Yuri Gervis noted that Chichvarkin is still worried that he might be charged again in connection with the 2005 contraband case. International search of Euroset Evgeny Chichvarkin has been discontinued. As reported on 25 January 2011 by an official representative of the National Central Bureau (NCB) of Interpol at the Interior Ministry Olga Shklyarov, it is due to the termination of criminal proceedings against Chichvarkin under Article 24 of the Code (the absence of a crime).http://www.newsru.com/russia/25jan2011/chichfree.html While in London Chichvarkin has participated in protests highlighting the dangers of conducting business in Russia, referring to the cases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Sergei Magnitsky.

The conception of the relationship, or if it is even a valid group, varies between researchers. Conceptions of Tibeto-Kanauri Benedict (1972) originally posited the Tibeto-Kanauri Bodish–Himalayish relationship, but had a more expansive conception of Himalayish than generally found today, including Qiangic, Magaric, and Lepcha. Within Benedict's conception, Tibeto- Kanauri is one of seven linguistic nuclei, or centers of gravity along a spectrum, within Tibeto-Burman languages. The center-most nucleus identified by Benedict is the Jingpho language (including perhaps the Kachin–Luic and Tamangic languages); other peripheral nuclei besides Tibeto-Kanauri include the Kiranti languages (Bahing–Vayu and perhaps the Newar language); the Tani languages; the Bodo–Garo languages and perhaps the Konyak languages); the Kukish languages (Kuki–Naga plus perhaps the Karbi language, the Meitei language and the Mru language); and the Burmish languages (Lolo-Burmese languages, perhaps also the Nung language and Trung). Matisoff (1978, 2003) largely follows Benedict's scheme, stressing the teleological value of identifying related characteristics over mapping detailed family trees in the study of Tibeto-Burman and Sino-Tibetan languages. Matisoff includes Bodish and West Himalayish with the Lepcha language as a third branch. He unites these at a higher level with Mahakiranti as Himalayish. Van Driem (2001) notes that the Bodish, West Himalayish, and Tamangic languages (but not Benedict's other families) appear to have a common origin. Bradley (1997) takes much the same approach but words things differently: he incorporates West Himalayish and Tamangic as branches within his \\"Bodish\\", which thus becomes close to Tibeto-Kanauri. This and his Himalayan family constitute his Bodic family.

Carter in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was designed by the architects Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and Hardie Phillip, built in 1927-29, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and its boundaries increased in 1987. Goodhue came to Honolulu from New York City to design not just this home, but also the Honolulu Museum of Art on the site of the former home of Anna Rice Cooke. The buildings are in the Mission Revival and Mediterranean Revival styles so popular in the Western states during the 1920s. Governor Carter's wife, Eastman Kodak heiress Helen Strong Carter, appears to have had some influence on the design, because the ladies' powder room is much larger than the men's smoking room. The house's 40 rooms include servants' quarters, which can be distinguished by their lower, ceilings, compared with ceilings elsewhere, as well as small rooms for arranging flowers and storing luggage. The basement and upper floors are connected by elevator, grand staircase, and servants' staircase. The 45 servants included 10 who worked inside the house and 35 who tended the grounds. The Carters occupied the house in 1930, but the governor died in 1933, and Mrs. Carter died in 1946. During World War II, she left the house in the care of relatives who opened it to military personnel for R&R.; The house was sold after she died, and most of the lower grounds were subdivided into house lots.

The house, also known as Kualii (also spelled Kualii), was built in 1911-1912 for Charles Montague Cooke Jr., and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The listing's boundaries were increased in 2000 to include the Kūkaōō Heiau (Tax Map Keys 2-9-19:35 and 2-9-19:43, respectively). Building history In 1902, wealthy businessman Charles Montague Cooke (of Castle & Cooke) gave his son Monty (as Charles Montague Cooke Jr. was called) a large tract of land on a high ridge in Mānoa Valley that contained an ancient Hawaiian heiau. That was the year Monty married Lila Lefferts. In 1911, Monty hired two prominent architects, Walter Emory and Marshall Webb, to build a large stone mansion in Tudor style on the hillside above the heiau. The house cost $40,000 and was named for an ancient Hawaiian chief. The basement and ground floor, built of basalt lava rock quarried on site, support two upper floors of half-timber and stucco. At each end of the house is a heavy stone chimney, one rising from the kitchen, the other from the living room. The central entry bay is covered by a porte-cochere with stone columns and a half gabled second floor above it, and flanked by gabled entry bays at each end of the house. Heiau The name of the heiau (temple of ancient Hawaii), Kūkaōō, is composed of kū 'stand' + ka 'the' + ōō 'digging stick', and has several possible translations. According to one source, it means 'Kū of the digging stick'. According to another, it means 'standing digging stick', in apparent reference to an old legend about a chief named Kawelo who was said to have thrown a digging stick from the highest mountain at the back of the valley down onto the hill where the heiau stands, known as Puu Pueo 'owl hill'. The square-shaped heiau measures about 12 meters across and stands about 6 meters above the flat, rocky clearing on which it stands. The late Bernice P. Bishop Museum anthropologist Kenneth Emory estimated the heiau to be 1,000 years old. Its gardens used to help sustain the population of the ahupuaa of Waikiki. In 1992, the current owners, Samuel Alexander Cooke (born 1937, grandson of Charles Montague Cooke Jr.) and Mary Cooke, purchased the land and commissioned preservationist Nathan Napoka to reconstruct the walls of the old heiau, which had been badly overgrown. Stonemason Billy Fields relied on survey drawings from the 1930s to rebuild the walls, using only rocks found on-site. In 1996 the Mānoa Heritage Center was established to manage the site and offer educational tours.

Adjoining the small community of Painted Cave, the site is located about north of California State Route 154 and northwest of Santa Barbara. The park was established in 1976. Wide view of the cave Closer view of the art The smooth and irregularly shaped shallow sandstone cave contains numerous drawings apparently depicting the Chumash cosmology and other subjects created in mineral pigments and other media over a long period ranging from about 200 up to possibly 1000 years or more. There is also evidence of graffiti beginning with early white settlers, which eventually led to creation of a protective physical barrier and State Historic Park status. In 1972 it was added as Site #72000256 on the National Register of Historical Places. Access is from State Route 154 about north of U.S. Route 101 in the San Marcos Pass in the Santa Ynez Mountains, on Painted Cave Road. The cave is adjacent to the left side of this narrow one-lane mountain road, with a slightly widened shoulder that provides parking for one or two vehicles. The drive is not appropriate for trailers and RVs, due to some very tight turns and steep sections. This park is one of the few providing open access for viewing original rock art of the Chumash people in person. Flash photographs are prohibited since they can harm the artwork; some people use flashlights to help view the art, and some take photographs with long exposures with the camera braced on the metal gate or using a tripod.

Son of a construction foreman, he attended the school of architecture at the University of Turin, while also attending Physics and Chemistry lectures with the dream of crystallizing carbon to obtain diamonds.\\"Il sogno luminoso di Cruto\\", by Andrea Albini, in \\"Le Scienze (Scientific American)\\", num.484, dic.2008, pag.127 In 1872 he opened a small workshop in his home village where he conducted tests on the production of pure carbon from ethylene. His efforts were rewarded in 1874 when his experiments succeeded in producing thin sheets of graphite, albeit his initial purpose was that of producing diamonds. After attending some conferences held by Galileo Ferraris about the contemporary advances in electric technology – whose topics included Thomas Edison's experiments to find a suitable filament for incandescent lights – he discovered that a carbon filament treated with ethylene under high pressure and temperature acquired a positive resistance coefficient (its resistance depends on temperature; when temperature increases, it increases its resistance). Cruto's filament is produced by deposition of graphite on thin platinum filaments in the presence of gaseous hydrocarbons. Sublimating this platinum at high temperatures leaves behind thin filaments of super-pure graphite. He thought that his discovery could be used in incandescent lights instead of carbonized bamboo filament. Helped by Naccari, he experimented with his invention in 1880 in the physics laboratory of the University of Turin. In 1882, he attended the Electricity Expo at Munich, where he gained fame with his technologically new light globe whose efficiency was better than that of Edison's light bulb, also because it produced a white light instead of the yellowish light of Edison's globe. His success was repeated at the International Turin Expo of 1884 to the extent that he sold his project in France, Switzerland, Cuba and United States. After these successes and because his manufacturing facilities in Piossasco were inadequate, he decided to move his activities to a more suitable location. Such a location was identified in Alpignano where in 1885-1886 he founded a light globe factory that he managed until 1889 and that eventually grew to a productivity level of 1000 light bulbs a day. Eventually, due to strong disagreements with the factory new management, he resigned in order to pursue his favorite activity as an inventor. His old factory was sold a number of times, went bankrupt and was eventually acquired by Philips in 1927. Cruto married late in life and spent the rest of his life between his family and his old laboratory. He continued his experiments on the accumulation of atmospheric energy and the invention of a toy called mosca elettrica (\\"electrical fly\\"). Cruto died, almost forgotten by all, in 1908.

It was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and its boundaries were increased in 1995, after of land which included the site became a state park in 1992. Geography Kūkaniloko lies in the Wahiawā Plateau between Oahu's two mountain ranges: the Waianaes to leeward, and the Koolaus to windward. It also lies at the intersection of two major paths of overland travel: the Waialua Trail between the North Shore and ʻEwa Beach, and the Kolekole Trail through the Waianae Range. The site is not only the piko of the island, but its placement across from the Waiʻanae Range could have been used as a calendar. The sun could be observed at Kūkaniloko by using certain markers. The present day location is near the intersection of Kamehameha Highway and Whitmore Avenue just north of Wahiawā, Hawaii. History Kūkaniloko, meaning \\"to anchor the cry from within,\\" is the geographic piko (navel) of Oahu. Kūkaniloko was symbolically the most powerful birth site for the island's high chiefs, among whom Kakuhihewa and Maʻilikākahi were perhaps most famous. Although, not every chief or royal was allowed to enter the site; only those who participated in human sacrifices [6]. The Hoolonopahu Heiau associated with the site was later destroyed, as were many others in the area, to make room for sugarcane and pineapple fields in the rich soils where sweet potato and yam once grew in abundance. Chiefly families lived along the slopes of the Waianaes overlooking the plateau and along the shores of Waialua to the north, and many key battles between rivals for control of Oahu were also fought on the central plains surrounding Kūkaniloko. The wide view of the skies from Kūkaniloko might also have made it a sort of Hawaiian Stonehenge. In April 2000, a team from the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy recorded designs and shapes on the stones that could have been used to track the movements of celestial objects for calendrical purposes.

Risk and vulnerability The risk of monga is identified by the Overseas Development Institute as resulting from/being:Rebecca Holmes, John Farrington, Taifur Rahman and Rachel Slater (2008) Extreme poverty in Bangladesh: Protecting and promoting rural livelihoods London: Overseas Development Institute * external shocks (e.g. an earthquake or financial crisis) * stresses – predictable events that form part of the family life-cycle (e.g. old age or weddings) * idiosyncratic * covariate (large areas affected by one phenomenon such as drought) * acute (e.g. an epidemic) * chronic (e.g. degeneration of resource productivity under increasing population pressure) Vulnerability is also a complex combination of the following: * Physical: areas prone to natural disasters such as floods or cyclones * Economic: caused by factors such as indebtedness and low, seasonal or unreliable income. * Social: e.g. gender inequality and lack of social capital and/or networks. There are many negative coping strategies employed and this can have both a short-term impact (e.g. reducing food consumption), but it also threatens households' long term ability to help themselves out of the crisis as they are forced to sell productive assets. Preventing monga in Bangladesh Preventing monga requires addressing the following issues: # reduce risk by protecting assets and household consumption/income; # prevent negative coping strategies (e.g. selling productive assets); # promote investment in livelihoods and productive assets; # increase voice and access to information. In earlier years, efforts to counteract the effects of monga were made through Government test relief and other programmes, and by rural infrastructure \`cash-for-work' interventions by long established NGOs such as RDRS Bangladesh which also carried out skills training and crop diversification from the mid-1970s. The spread of irrigation has reduced the impact of the early season monga (March, April) but is still a major factor in the September–October period before the amon rice harvest = Government action = The Bangladeshi government has been trying to assist the victims of monga by providing a US$295 million program which provides employment for two million heads of families for 75 days during the monga season. This also can be a big fail sometimes. = The BRAC programme = This involves the transfer of productive assets worth 8,000 to 13,000 Taka to the poorest households in northern Bangladesh. Furthermore, it provides intensive training and support on how to manage these assets, as well as a daily stipend until the assets start producing an income (approximately 300 Taka per month). In this way, the assets transferred are not sold as a coping strategy before those assets have started producing an income and securing the household from such an extreme measure (see Cash transfers). The programme also subsidises health and legal services, water and sanitation provision and the development of supportive community networks. = The Chars Livelihoods Programme (CLP) = The poorest households in the Jamuna Chars region, an low-lying area prone to floods and erosion in northern Bangladesh, are provided with income generating assets worth approximately 13,000 Taka. This livelihoods intervention support includes a monthly stipend for 18 months of 300 Taka per month, infrastructure development, social development training, seasonal work and promotes entrepreneurship in the agricultural and non-farm sectors. = The Vulnerable Group Development programme (VGD) = A national programme integrating food security and nutrition issues with development and income generating activities for poor households in food insecure areas. For two years this programme transfers monthly food rations, as well as services such as income generating skills training. The programme also works with micro-credit service providers. = The Programmed Initiatives for Monga Eradication (PRIME) = This is the initiative of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), a micro-finance institution, in northern Bangladesh. The PKSF provide employment opportunities for the monga season, emergency credit for households with a slightly higher income, consumption loans, remittance services and a carefully designed flexible credit support system. The aim is to build beneficiaries’ coping capacity, and their skills and resources to secure their own futures.

An independent legal entity with 501(c)(3) charity status, and a Board of Directors, United Israel Appeal is responsible for the allocation and oversight of funds raised by United States Jewish federation campaigns on behalf of Israel for use by its operating agent, the Jewish Agency for Israel. It also secures and monitors U.S. grant funds for the immigration and absorption of Jewish refugees and humanitarian migrants to Israel from countries of distress. Partnered with the Jewish Agency for Israel, United Israel Appeal assists American Jews to fulfill their ongoing collective commitment to contribute to and participate in the upbuilding of the State of Israel. United Israel Appeal has offices in New York City and Jerusalem.  Activities  United Israel Appeal's principal objectives are to assist immigration to Israel through the relief, rehabilitation, and resettlement of the immigrants therein, and to aid charitable, educational, and scientific institutions and Jewish-identity programs in Israel. In consultation with the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) and individual Jewish federations, United Israel Appeal nominates members and observers of the Jewish Agency Board of Governors (BOG), members of its committees and designates delegates to the Jewish Agency Annual Assembly.  Allocation and evaluation  United Israel Appeal provides grants, fiduciary oversight, allocates funds provided to it from donors, foundations, American Jewish Federations and Jewish Federations of North America. United Israel Appeal monitors and evaluates the programs operated on its behalf by the Jewish Agency for Israel. United Israel Appeal monitors the management of the educational assets and activities of the Israel Education Fund (IEF) as well as appointing members of the boards of the managing companies.  History  United Israel Appeal was first established in 1925 as the United Palestine Appeal (UPA) to unify fundraising in America for a Jewish national homeland. Its constituents included Keren Hayesod, the fundraising organization for the Jewish Agency; Hadassah; Hebrew University; the Jewish National Fund and Mizrachi. United Palestine Appeal was dissolved in 1930 and reconstituted in 1936 by Keren Hayesod and the Jewish National Fund. In 1938, United Palestine Appeal entered into a partnership with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) to found the United Jewish Appeal (UJA). United Israel Appeal has undergone many changes since its early days. In addition to the partnership begun in 1938, the most significant changes prior to 2000 came in 1971 as a result of the reconstitution of the Jewish Agency for Israel. After the Reconstitution Agreement, for the first time, American Jewish leaders from federations, as well as all the American Zionist organizations, served as members of the United Israel Appeal's board of directors. The American Zionist organizations had seats on the Jewish Agency Board through their membership in the World Zionist Organization. The Reconstitution Agreement led United Israel Appeal to name the Jewish Agency for Israel as its exclusive operating agent in Israel. In 1999, United Jewish Communities was created as a merger of United Israel Appeal, United Jewish Appeal, and the Council of Jewish Federations, into a single, national organization. After this merger, United Israel Appeal became a subsidiary of United Jewish Communities, which itself was later renamed the Jewish Federations of North America.  Funding  According to the organization's Internal Revenue Service Form 990 form, United Israel Appeal distributed $231,487,000 of grants and other assistance to entities outside the United States between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014.  Leadership  United Israel Appeal's chairman is Andy Groveman of Memphis, whose term began in November 2015. David M. Mallach is the executive vice-chairman. The most recent past chairman is Richard N. Bernstein of Miami. Other past chairpersons have included Bruce A. Arbit of Milwaukee; Richard L.

His total of 448 appearances remained a club record until passed by Tommy Traynor in the mid-1960s.  Military career Shelley was born in Romsey, Hampshire and after starting in local football, had a distinguished career in military football whilst serving in India and Egypt during the First World War. In India, he served with the 2nd/5th Hampshire Territorials and was a member of the Battalion side which reached the semi-finals of the Calcutta Cup tournament in 1915. By 1918, he was in Egypt with the 1st/4th Wiltshires with whom he won the Divisional Cup.  Football career  Following his demobilisation, he signed for Eastleigh Athletic in November 1919, but within weeks had signed for Southampton who were trying to rebuild their side in readiness for their entry into the newly formed Football League Third Division South at the end of the season. After spending a few months in the reserves, Shelley was given his big chance in the first team when Arthur Andrews broke his leg in an FA Cup tie at West Ham in January 1920. In the absence of a recognised right-half, the directors were pondering buying a replacement but they were persuaded by the club trainer, former England right-half Bert Lee, to \\"give the young Shelley a chance\\". Shelley made his debut in the Southern League in a 2–2 home draw with Cardiff City on 17 January 1920. He made the most of his opportunity and kept his place for the last 18 games of the season, playing on the losing side only five times as the team consolidated itself and went on to finish in eighth position in their last season in the Southern League. He rapidly gained considerable repute as a consistent, reliable half-back in the \\"stopper mould\\", having the knack of smothering opposing forwards by his ability to anticipate and intercept through-balls. In 1920, the Saints were elected to the Football League Third Division for its inaugural season, in which Shelley missed only three matches, forming a good relationship with Bill Turner at left-half, with Alec Campbell or George Moorhead at centre-half. Although they finished second in the league, Southampton missed out on the only promotion spot to Crystal Palace. Under manager Jimmy McIntyre, Saints went one better in 1921–22, finishing equal on points with Plymouth Argyle but with a superior goal average, with Shelly and Turner both ever-present. The half back line of Shelley, Campbell and Turner cemented Saints place in the Second Division over the next few years, until Campbell lost his place to George Harkus in March 1924. By the start of the 1924–25 season, Turner had left the club, and Campbell had regained his place in the centre with Harkus moving to the left. In November 1924, Shelley missed a match for the first time since the end of the 1920–21 season, thus ending a run of 141 consecutive appearances, covering three whole seasons. In December 1924, Saints' poor league form led to the resignation of manager Jimmy McIntyre. Caretaker manager George Goss led them on a run in the FA Cup, defeating Liverpool in round 4, to reach the semi-final at Stamford Bridge, where they were defeated 2–0 by Sheffield United on 28 March 1925, with Shelley playing in all five cup matches. For the 1925–26 season, Saints appointed Arthur Chadwick as manager, but his arrival made only a moderate impact on the team's fortunes, finishing 14th in the table. Having hardly missed a game since his debut in January 1920, Shelley lost his place in December 1925, with Harkus taking over at right-half alongside Arthur Bradford and Stan Woodhouse, before Shelley was recalled for the last two matches of the season. In the 1926–27 season, Chadwick settled on his favoured line-up with eleven players featuring in at least 35 of the 42 league games; this included a half back line-up of Shelley, Harkus (in the centre) and Woodhouse on the left, in front of full-backs Michael Keeping and Ted Hough. Despite the settled look of the side, the Saints struggled in the league, but had a great run to the semi-final of the 1927 FA Cup, defeating Newcastle United on the way. In the semi-final, played at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927, Saints were eliminated 2-1 by Arsenal with Saints' goal coming from Bill Rawlings. In this match, Saints came up against their former star full-back Tom Parker who had had a nightmare in Saints' previous semi-final appearance two years earlier. This time Parker was on the winning side as Arsenal moved on to Wembley, losing to Cardiff City in the final. With occasional spells on the sidelines, Shelley retained his place at right-half for the next two seasons, but for 1929–30 his appearances were more irregular with, first, Bradford and then Arthur Wilson taking over. In the following season, Shelley had a long run at centre-half, with Harkus having left the club, before handing over to Johnny McIlwaine. Shelley's final season was 1931–32 when he was used as cover for McIlwaine in the centre or Frank Campbell on the right, with his final appearance being away to Plymouth Argyle on 16 April 1932. Shelley was not selected for full international honours, but was a member of an F.A. XI which toured South Africa in 1929. In his long playing career for Southampton, he made 410 league and 38 FA Cup appearances, scoring nine goals. Coaching career Following his retirement from playing, he remained at The Dell as coach to the club's first \\"nursery\\" team which competed in the Hampshire League. His success with the youngsters led to him being asked by manager George Kay to take over as first-team trainer following the retirement of his mentor, Bert Lee in 1935. Saints started the 1935–36 season (their fiftieth season since the club's foundation in 1885) with four wins and two draws from their first six matches, but were unable to sustain this form and in the period to the New Year they won only three more matches. After another poor season, in which the Saints finished in seventeenth place, nine members of the board resigned and George Kay left to take over at Liverpool, taking Shelley with him. At Anfield, Shelley was a part of George Kay's coaching staff, helping the Reds take the Football League championship in 1946–47. After Kay's retirement in 1951, Shelley remained a member of the coaching staff under Don Welsh until 1956. Shelley remained in Liverpool for the rest of his life, dying there in December 1971, aged 72.

Name The name Pečine is a plural form derived from the word peč 'large cliff, rocky wall' (which developed from the earlier meaning 'hollow in a cliff', ultimately from 'place for cooking'). Like similar names (e.g., Peč, Pečice, Pečke, etc.), it refers to a local landscape element. History In the hamlet of Stari Rut, 1 km northwest of Pečine, are the remains of an ancient hill fort. This site is still referred to as Castle Peak () locally. A silver Roman fibula found in the area, now kept at the museum in Tolmin, attests to early settlement here. During the Second World War, the village was bombarded by German forces in February 1944, destroying several houses. A battle took place between German forces and Yugoslav Partisan units in the hamlet of Travnik on 19 March 1945, and another engagement at the hill to the west known as Lorčevo brdo in April 1945.

He is known as attorney general of the Province of Quebec, judge, mathematician, historian, member of the Royal Society, and cursitor baron of the exchequer..  Biography  Francis Maseres was born in London on 15 December 1731. His parents were Magdalene du Pratt du Clareau and Peter Abraham Maseres, physician. The Maseres family (Masères) were French Protestants who left France after the revocation of Edict of Nantes in 1685. He was fluent in French. He had a brother, named Peter. He studied in Rev. Richard Wooddeson's School in Kingston-upon-Thames, then entered Clare College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (1752) and a Master of Arts (1755). He entered the Inner Temple to study law in 1750, and was admitted to the bar in 1758. On 4 March 1766, he was appointed attorney general of the new British Province of Quebec, the former French Canada conquered in 1760 and definitively ceded by France through the Treaty of Paris in 1763. He was sworn in office on 26 September 1766 and exercised his functions until the autumn of 1769. In March 1768, the Carleton government requested of him a report on the reform of the province's law system. He submitted his report in February 1769. Upon his return to London, he continued to take interest in American colonial affairs. In an essay published in 1770, he recommended that the colonies be represented as quickly as possible in the House of Commons. He was elected member of the Royal Society of London in 1771 and made cursitor baron of the exchequer in August 1773. He was elected senior judge of sheriff’s court in London in 1780. He involved himself in the movement for a constitutional reform of Quebec which resumed at full speed with the end of the American War of Independence in 1783, and which was concluded with the adoption of the Constitutional Act of 1791 by the British Parliament. He espoused the cause of Pierre du Calvet who intended to bring governor Frederick Haldimand before the courts for violating the British constitution. He was interested in mathematics, but he maintained a very conservative stance on the subject. He had written his Dissertation on the use of the negative sign in algebra in 1758. This took a strictly nominalistic view of algebraic operations, saying that negatives were invalid \\"in any other light than as the mark of subtraction of a lesser quantity from a greater.\\" Maseres subsidized many mathematical publications and, in particular, John Hellins's multi-volume edition of John Colson's translation of Maria Gaetana Agnesi's Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana. This translation was valuable for British mathematics, but Maseres also influenced British mathematics negatively by attacking calculus and other advanced mathematical methods.

It causes infection that is mildly pathogenic. However, it often carries a protozoan parasite Histomonas meleagridis which causes of histomoniasis (blackhead disease).Merck Veterinary Manual (see table) Transmission of H. meleagridis is through the H. gallinarum egg.Schmidt GD & Roberts LS (2005). Foundations of Parasitology, 7th ed. The McGraw Hill Companies Inc., New York, New York, p. 441. H. gallinarum is about 1–2 cm in length with a sharply pointed tail and a preanal sucker. The parasite is a diecious species with marked sexual dimorphism. Males are smaller and shorter, measuring around 9 mm in length, with a unique bent tail. Females are stouter and longer, measuring roughly 13 mm in length, with a straight tail end.Permin A & Hansen JW (1998). The Epidemiology, Diagnosis and Control of Poultry Parasites. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy, pp. 29-30. Lifecycle H. gallinarum has a direct lifecycle involving birds such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, grouse, guineafowl, partridges, pheasants, and quails as definitive hosts. Eggs of H. gallinarum are passed in feces by the host. At optimal temperature (22 °C), they become infective in 12–14 days and remain infective for years in soil. Upon ingestion by a host, the embryonated eggs hatch into second-stage juveniles in the gizzard or duodenum, and are passed to the cecum. Their development is completed in the lumen, but some may enter the mucosa and remain for years without further development. The prepatent time is 24–30 days. Earthworms and houseflies are considered paratenic hosts, as they can ingest the egg in feces and a juvenile may hatch in tissues, which stays dormant until eaten by birds. Epidemiology H. gallinarum is geographically distributed worldwide, commonly found in chickens, domesticated turkeys, and many other species of fowl, primarily of poultry. Their eggs are found to live for years in soil making it difficult to eliminate H. gallinarum from a domestic flock. Earthworms may ingest the eggs of H. gallinarum and contributes to the cause of infections in poultry. Although the eggs are themselves infective, they can develop further into a second infective larval stage. This development occurs around 27 °C and takes 2–4 weeks.Kaufmann, J (1996). Parasitic Infections of Domestic Animals: A Diagnostic Manual. Birkhäuser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland, p. 358. Pathogenesis H. gallinarum infection is itself is mildly pathogenic. However, H. gallinarum plays the role of carrier in the lifecycle of Histomonas meleagridis, the causal pathogen of enterohepatitis \\"blackhead\\" of turkeys. H. meleagridis stays viable while inside the egg of H. gallinarum.Pattison M, McMullin P, Bradbury JM, Alexander D (2007). Poultry Diseases, 6th ed. Saunders Ltd, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, p. 623. Heavy infection in pheasants indicated gross lesions characterized by congestion, thickening, petechial haemorrhages of the mucosa, intussusception, and nodules in the cecal wall. In addition under microscopy, chronic diffuse typhlitis, haemosiderosis, granulomas with necrotic center in the submucosa and leiomyomas in the submucosa, muscular and serosa associated with immature H. gallinarum worms were observed. Diagnosis and treatment Primary infections are usually not apparent. Secondary infections are characterized by the formation of nodules in the cecum and the submucosa of the cecum. During heavy infections, intestinal walls may thicken and exhibit marked inflammation. In egg-laying hens, heavy infection significantly reduces egg production. Diagnosis commonly is through the presence of eggs in host feces. Effective treatment is by using mebendazole, which is normally distributed to a flock of birds in their food and water. In addition, rearing the birds on hardware cloth assists in the elimination this parasite. Free-range chickens can also be infected.

It was a conventional strut-braced, high-wing monoplane, based loosely on the Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20 that Adolf Rohrbach designed in 1920. It had a fully enclosed flight deck and passenger cabin, and featured fixed, tailskid undercarriage. Power was supplied by three engines, one in the nose, and two mounted in nacelles on the wings. Construction was of metal throughout. Design and development In 1926 Deutsche Luft Hansa purchased the prototype Roland, followed by five production examples over that year and the next.Munson 1982, p.138 The production machines were built with open flight decks, although they were later enclosed, as on the prototype. These were put to work servicing a route between Berlin and London via Hanover and Amsterdam. In July 1927 the Roland held the world endurance record for a payload of 1,000 kg with a flight of 14 hours 23 minutes, and the world distance record for a payload of 2,000 kg of . At different times, the Roland held twenty-two world records. In 1928, Luft Hansa replaced three of its Rolands with new machines of slightly different design. Designated Ro VIIIa, these had a fuselage that was stretched by 30 cm (1 ft) and were powered by the more powerful BMW V engines in place of the BMW IVs fitted to the prototype and first production batch. A new Spanish airline, Iberia, purchased the three Rolands that Luft Hansa retired, and put them into service on its inaugural service between Madrid and Barcelona. In 1929, Rohrbach produced nine examples of a substantially updated Roland for Luft Hansa. These featured a major redesign of the flight deck, and a new wing design. Dubbed the Roland II, these aircraft continued in service with the airline until 1936 on its Hamburg–Malmö and Berlin–Munich routes. Luft Hansa sold at least three of these aircraft to Deruluft upon retirement. The Luftwaffe acquired another one, armed it, and operated it at the clandestine school at Lipetsk to train bomber crews. During his 1932 election campaign, Adolf Hitler hired a Rohrbach Ro VIII Roland aeroplane from Deutsche Luft Hansa for his two first series of campaign flights in March and July. The aeroplane was named Immelmann I after World War I pilot Max Immelmann. Hitler switched to a Ju 52 in November 1932. Popular culture The Spanish amusement park Tibidabo (Barcelona) got a real-size replica of that plane, painted red. It is the most famous ride in the park, opened on September 23, 1928, sometimes referred to as \\"the first flight simulator in the world\\", and called \\"L'avió\\" (Catalan for \\"the plane\\").

Philadelphia: Saunders/Elsevier; 2009.Pötzl O.: Die Aphasielehre vom Standpunkt der klinischen Psychiatrie, I: Die optisch-agnostischen Storungen (die verschiedenen Formen der Seelenblindheit) [The Aphasia Doctrine from the Standpoint of Clinical Psychiatry, I: Optic-Agnosic Disorders (the Different Forms of Mind-Blindness)], Leipzig, Deuticke, 1928. MacDonald Critchley, former president of the World Federation of Neurology, more recently summarized CWS as “a patient loses the power to conjure up visual images or memories, and furthermore, ceases to dream during his sleeping hours”.Critchley M.:The Parietal Lobes, London, Edward Arnold,1953. This condition is quite rare and affects only a handful of brain damage patients. Further study could help illuminate the neurological pathway for dream formation. History=Jean-Martin Charcot= Portrait of Jean-Martin Charcot. In 1883 Jean-Martin Charcot encountered a patient who was most likely suffering from posterior cerebral artery thrombosis (not confirmed with autopsy) and lost the ability to consciously reproduce images from his dreams while awake.Charcot J-M.: Un cas de suppression brusque et isolée de la vision mentale des signes et des objets, (formes et couleurs) [On a case of sudden isolated suppression of the mental vision of signs and objects (forms and colours)]. Progrès Médical 1883; 11:568. While this patient still reported dreams of words, the inability to recall any imagery, termed visual irreminiscence, became the center of Charcot's case study.Bischof, M., & Bassetti, C. L. (2004). Total dream loss: A distinct neuropsychological dysfunction after bilateral PCA stroke. Annals of Neurology, 56(4) His resulting contribution to the formulation of the syndrome lies on the lack of ability to re-visualize dream imagery and does not imply their complete absence, but a general state of visual amnesia. =Hermann Wilbrand= In 1887 Hermann Wilbrand was studying an elderly female subject with bilateral posterior cerebral artery thrombosis.Wilbrand H.: Ein Fall von Seelenblindheit und Hemianopsie mit Sectionsbefund [A case of mind-blindness and hemianopia with autopsy results]. Dtsch Z Nervenheilkd 1892; 2:361. This subject displayed a complete inability to dream coupled with an inability to recognize familiar places, a condition known more recently as topographic agnosia. Additionally a condition known as prosopagnosia, or the inability to recognize familiar faces was also noted in the patient. Wilbrand's contribution revolves around the complete inability to produce dreams with the presence of agnosias as possible side conditions. Symptoms=Traditional Classification= Combing early studies, the traditional symptoms of CWS centered on visual irreminiscence, prosopagnosia, and topographic agnosia. However, due to significant differences in the observations of Charcot and Wilbrand's case work, this syndrome bridged the entire loss of dreaming, whether it be due to the isolated inability of the brain to produce images while asleep as Charcot had dictated, or the complete loss of dreaming all together as with Wilbrand. This has led to the terming of Charcot and Wilbrand variants, which corresponded to either the loss of dream imagery and visual irreminisence or the complete ceasing of dream experience often coupled with agnosia. =Modern Classification= There is new focus on the type of injury and analysis of REM sleep pertaining to CWS. A more current medical definition lists CWS as “the association of loss of the ability to conjure up visual images or memories and the loss of dreaming”.Murri L., Arena R., Siciliano G., et al.: Dream recall in patients with focal cerebral lesions. Arch Neurol 1984; 41:183. A 2004 case-evaluation of a 74-year-old woman who had experienced an acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction which rendered her dreamless for a 3-month period was to perform polysomnography testing in combination with patient dream reporting to determine both her sleep architecture or pattern of sleep stages, and subsequent dream recollection. Such techniques allow for associations between the physiological timetable of dreaming during REM sleep and the patient's ability to recall dreams to be compared closely. Physiological causes In patients with loss of visual imagery during sleep, instances of acute-onset brain damage such as thrombosis, hemorrhage, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning in particular have been indicated as possible motivators for CWS. Additionally, some slower progressing conditions, namely tumor growth (neoplasm) in brain tissue and abnormal embryonic development (dysgenesis) of the corpus callosum, have been associated with this syndrome. Patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease as well as Turner syndrome have also described having CWS. In terms of localization, the lesion or damaged tissue is most often localized to the lateral (sides) or mesial (middle) occipitotemporal regions, and typically appears bilaterally (affecting both sides equally). The exact localization however has not been illuminated and can most accurately be summarized as \\"a lesion in an acute phase affecting the posterior regions”. Similarly, in patients with complete loss or suppression of dreaming there is typically an association with focal, acute-onset cerebral lesions like hemorrhage, thrombosis, or trauma. Early attempts to locate the lesion site responsible for the cessation of dreaming on a universal scale have led to the parietal lobeSolms M.: The Neuropsychology of Dreams: A Clinico-anatomical Study, Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum, 1997. with no bias to either side, and single lesions of either hemisphere commonplace. Recent case studies of dream loss have found evidence suggesting that damage to the parietal is not necessary for CWS. Additionally, in some of the cases of parietal lobe lesions, the lesion continued into the occipitotemporal regions, further blurring the localization of global dream loss. In almost all cases, dreaming returned within 12 months, implying a possibility that the site of interest was only connected to the damaged regions, most likely through neural pathways, further complicating localization. Relation to REM Sleep REM sleep or Rapid eye movement sleep is the sleep stage when traditionally the majority of dream activity has been documented. According to the Activation- synthesis hypothesis the sensory systems (specifically the visual system activated by Ponto-Geniculo-Occipital waves or PGO waves named for the regions they travel through) as well as the vestibular system are activated during the REM stage.Brown, R. E., Basheer, R., McKenna, J. T., Strecker, R. E., & McCarley, R. W. (2012). CONTROL OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS. Physiological Reviews, 92(3), 1087-1187. doi: 10.1152/physrev.00032.2011 Feedback from the nerves controlling movement influence dream experience despite the inhibition of muscle control from the medulla which ceases motor activation through glutamatergic neurons in a process referred to as REM Atonia.Vetrivelan, Ramalingam, Fuller, Patrick M., Tong, Qingchun, & Lu, Jun. (2009). Medullary Circuitry Regulating Rapid Eye Movement Sleep and Motor Atonia. The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(29), 9361-9369. doi: 10.1523/jneurosci.0737-09.2009 Mismatch of this data might create specific dream experiences such as floating or flying. Emotional behavior and memory formation centers, most importantly the amygdala and hippocampus. are reactivated during sleep and are believed to generate the emotional content of dreams. In patients with CWS, REM sleep is not necessarily impaired but the sensory systems activation is most likely impaired from the lesion damage resulting in decreased contribution to the synthesis of dreams. In particular damage to the occipitotemporal region may alter the activation normally produced by PGO waves leading to an absence of visual system activation. Additionally damage to the memory formation pathways might be responsible for the inability of patients to recall images. Detection Methods While scientific dream analysis has been avoided in the past given the difficulty in quantifying and qualifying the experience of patients, emerging technology has made it easier to chart brain activity and target physiological areas responsible for dream function. =Polysomnography = REM sleep with EEG boxed in red and eye movements indicated by red line. A Polysomnography test (PSG) records the biological changes during sleep through monitoring the brain (Electroencephalography, EEG), eye movement (Electrooculography, EOG), heart rhythm (Electrocardiogram, ECG), and muscle activity (Electromyography, EMG). Typically a complete PSG requires a minimum of 12 channels and 22 wire attachments and produces a “score” or report. Sleep stages are identifiable through comparison of the EEG, EOG and EMG channels with stages 1 and 2 being defined as light sleep, 3 being slow wave sleep and 4 being REM sleep. Additionally a PSG can reveal “arousals” or sudden shifts in brain wave activity.Iber C, Ancoli-Israel S, Chesson A, and Quan SF for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications, 1st ed.: Westchester, Illinois: American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2007. Analyzing the resulting amount of REM sleep in combination with patient reported dream experience has been the method of choice for recent dream studies. In particular researchers can wake the patient mid-REM sleep and ask for dream experience, which in normal patients would enhance their recollection and dream count. Absence of dream experience suggests the presence of CWS and this test method can also help to illustrate whether the patient is suffering from an inability to recall visual images or complete dream loss. =fMRI= Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) is the specific MRI procedure associated with measuring brain activity. It does so by detecting changes in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to the energy utilization by the brain using a specific blood-oxygen-level- dependent contrast.Huettel, S. A.; Song, A. W.; McCarthy, G. (2009), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2 ed.), Massachusetts: Sinauer, Recently fMRI has come to the forefront of dream research because it does not require the use of dyes or isotopes and allows for brain blood flow and related activity to be monitored during sleep. Specifically analysis of dreaming patients have revealed increased blood flow/oxygen utilization by network consisting of the pontine tegmentum, thalamus, amygdala, basal ganglia, anterior cingulate and occipital cortex. Specifically in CWS activation of the occipital cortex is of great interest and it can monitored through fMRI and combined with patient dream reporting to isolate dream formation. Additionally during sleep fMRI studies have revealed a significant decrease in the activity of the prefrontal cortex which likely accounts for the decrease in time perception, insight, and remembrance of dreams. This can be analyzed in patients to help better differentiate between global dream loss and a lack of visual remembrance. The specific mechanism for deactivation of the prefrontal cortex is unclear due to the complexity of the acetylcholine activation pathway and its expanse into variety of other cortical areas. =Dream Journals= Dream journals are an effective tool for patients to quantify their dreaming experience. By recording the frequency of dreams and the level of detail, dream journals can be combined with other physiological data to arrive at the best picture of dream synthesis. Additionally dream journal data can help to organize the bizarre features within the dream experience such as discontinuities (incomprehensible shifts of time or location), incongruities (mismatching plot elements), and uncertainties (confusion over discrete concepts) which are useful to the dreamer.Hobson, J. A., Hoffman, S. A., Helfand, R., & Kostner, D. (1987). Dream bizarreness and the activation-synthesis hypothesis. Human Neurobiology, 6(3), 157-164. Medical Significance Until recently CWS was considered extremely rare and it is now recognized slightly more often as an acute phase of focal brain damage. While CWS patients do not suffer from any serious effects, dreaming is believed to provide some relatively important functions to the health of the human mind. It is hypothesized that a Reverse learning mechanism occurs while dreaming that facilitate the unlearning of unfavorable pathways to the organism. Complete failure of such as system has been postulated to lead to a state of almost perpetual obsession coupled with hallucinatory associations.Crick, F., & Mitchison, G. (1983). THE FUNCTION OF DREAM SLEEP. Nature, 304(5922), 111-114. doi: 10.1038/304111a0 In addition it has been postulated that dreams account for emotional preservation, with the emotions one feels during nightmares and joyful dreams solidifying and checking the successful ability to express them.Hobson, J. Allan. (2003). Dreaming: An Introduction to the Science of Sleep (January 16, 2003 ed.): OXFORD. Lastly Freudian Dream Content Analysis, although lacking in credibility in the modern scientific community, once held that dreams hold the key to understanding and emancipating the subconscious.Freud, S. (1900) The Interpretation of Dreams. New York: Avon, 1980. Potential for Research=Refining the Dream Pathway= Since CWS patients have limited to nonexistent symptoms other than dream loss, studying these cases can give great insight into the physiological basis of dreams.Bentes, C., Costa, J., Peralta, R., Pires, J., Sousa, P., & Paiva, T. (2011). Dream recall frequency and content in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsia, 52(11), 2022-2027. doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03290.x The regions of damage and condition affecting them can be compared to the severity of the dream-loss to help create a map of importance when it comes to synthesizing and remembering dream images. =posttraumatic stress disorder= The diagnosis criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves hyper-arousal, disturbed sleeping, and traumatic nightmares with numerous REM-related sub-symptoms. CWS on the other hand marks little to no dreaming, decreased REM sleep to dream linkage, and lack of visual remembrance. The specific physiological changes that take place in CWS patients might help to isolate the dream formation pathways that are hyperactive in PTSD patients and offer clues on how to reduce them. =Depression= Major depression which is believed to be modified by acetylcholine systems, is a functional disorder pertaining to the same neuronal structures that regulate dreaming. CWS may unlock the means to understand the stimulation of these structures better leading to enhanced treatment for sufferers of chronic depression.

He was secretary general of the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentines (CGTA) between 1968 and 1974. Early career and rise to prominence Ongaro was born to a middle-class family of Italian Argentines from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, in the Argentine seashore city of Mar del Plata in 1924. Fluent in Latin and schooled in music composition, Ongaro became an apprenticed graphist and was eventually hired at COGTAL, one of Argentina's largest publishing cooperatives. Becoming active in the Buenos Aires Printworkers' Federation (FGB), the 1966 coup d'état against President Arturo Illia and its resulting advent of anti-labor policies led Ongaro to remove FGB leader Osvaldo Vigna in a coup of his own, that November. This move, however, met with the disapproval of José Alonso, the head of the CGT (among whose 62 unions the FGB belonged) and forced Ongaro to pursue alliances within the fractious CGT union (then South America's largest). Ongaro's only ally among the 62 unions was initially the sanitary workers' Amado Olmos, and the duo were no match for Alonso's conciliatory strategy with the repressive new regime of General Juan Carlos Onganía. This stance, shared with powerful CGT leaders such as the steelworkers' Augusto Vandor and the construction workers' Rogelio Coria, was shaken by Security Committee head General Osiris Villegas' violent March 1967 assault on CGT headquarters done to impede a planned general strike. Belonging to a CGT disoriented by the regime's surprise attack, Ongaro traveled to Cuba in early 1968, where, during a political conference, he met Argentine journalist and writer Rodolfo Walsh, with whom Ongaro flew to Madrid to introduce to the CGT's benefactor, exiled populist leader Juan Perón. Perón was impressed with both men and subscribed to Ongaro's view that the CGT leadership's efforts at dialogue with the dictatorship would be in vain. President Onganía had already ordered eight of the 62 CGT unions into government receivership (including the second-largest, the railway workers') and CGT elections in March 1968 pitted the steelworker's Vandor against Perón's own choice, Raimundo Ongaro. Vandor's steelworkers' union was the largest in the CGT and he still had allies such as Alonso and Coría; but Ongaro's allies now included the rail workers' Lorenzo Pepe and the telecom workers' Julio Guillán, both of whose unions were in receivership. Where Ongaro had Perón's own support, Vandor could only boast the endorsement of Onganía's new Labor Minister, Rubens San Sebastián, the architect of the President's \\"divide and conquer\\" strategy towards the CGT. The CGTA Ongaro was elected Secretary General of the CGT on March 30, 1968, without a concession from the defeated Vandor and the Labor Minister annulled the election, impeding Ongaro's taking office. Writer Rodolfo Walsh and numerous adherents of the activist Third World Priests' Movement joined Ongaro, Pepe and their CGT supporters in creating the Argentine CGT (CGTA), a coalition announced during a rally on May 1, the international labor day. Drawing from his publishing background, Ongaro had the CGTA draft a weekly newsletter which, under Ricardo de Luca's direction and with regular contributions from Walsh, Rogelio García Lupo and Horacio Verbitsky, became renowned for its treatment of local as well as international issues (the first issue featured coverage of the aftermath of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.). The CGTA was also the subject of banned documentaries by filmmaker Fernando \\"Pino\\" Solanas and others in the vanguard Grupo Cine Liberación. Numerous leaders from within Alonso's official CGT also extended their support, notably Córdoba Province light and power workers' leader Agustín Tosco, who earned the enmity of his union's national leader Juan José Taccone, by joining the CGTA. The CGTA was the target of intense harassment by the dictatorship, who over the next year had around 5,000 of its members detained nationwide. Tosco's support of a local autoworkers' strike at the important Córdoba FIAT plant in May 1969 was decisive in the demonstrations' brutal May 29 repression, whose subsequent riots became known as the Cordobazo. The Cordobazo encouraged a hard line in the regime's labor relations policy. Having detained Tosco and numerous others, the mysterious June 30 assassination of Augusto Vandor provided a pretext for Ongaro's arrest and the banning of the CGTA. These struggles brought him to the attention of the International Labour Organization, which elected him a member of their administrative council later that year. Tosco's and Ongaro's repeated stays in prison and continued pressure led to the CGTA's inactivity and, on Ongaro's release in January 1972, he disbanded the defunct trade union and founded the independent Argentine Printworkers' Sindicate (SGA). Increasingly focused on influencing Juan Perón, whose return from exile was imminent, he established \\"Basic Peronism,\\" a leftist political advocacy group. Terror and exile Political pressure led the dictatorship to call for free and fair national elections in March 1973, which Perón's Justicialist Party won in a landslide; one Basic Peronism supporter, journalist Rodolfo Ortega Peña, was among those elected to Congress on Perón's FREJULI party list. Ongaro's independent union and leftist stance, however, made him a target to the CGT and to a far-right adviser close to Perón himself, José López Rega. Congressman Ortega Peña was assassinated by López Rega's death squad, the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (Triple A), on July 31, 1974, and the Ongaro family's home in the Buenos Aires suburb of Los Polvorines was frequently raided with impunity, leading to Mrs. Ongaro's miscarriage on one occasion. Undeterred, Ongaro organized a September 16 meeting in Bella Vista, Tucumán, to support a sugarmill workers' strike led by Atilio Santillán. Reunited with other former CGTA allies including Agustín Tosco and steelworkers Francisco \\"Barba\\" Gutiérrez and Alberto Piccinini, Ongaro organized a conflict resolution committee geared for the defense of targeted unions. Piccinini's November election as shop steward at steelmaker ACINDAR's Villa Constitución plant eventually led to the March 1975 mass arrests of those at the plant as well as those of Ongaro and others at the committee. Allowed a radio, he learned of the May 7 murder of his teenage son, Alfredo Máximo Ongaro, at the hands of the Triple A, and, upon his August 29 release, he was deported to Lima, Peru; Mrs. Ongaro and her remaining children had left days earlier, and only the warden's precautions prevented Ongaro's abduction and murder by the Triple A. The overthrow of Peru's populist dictator, Juan Velasco Alvarado, the following day led to an increasingly hostile climate for left-wing Argentine exiles in general, and Ongaro departed for Spain in June 1976. Supported by Spanish sympathizers, European radio and TV interviews and remittances from the FGB itself, the Ongaros returned in March 1984, three months after Argentina's return to democracy. Ongaro's return to the FGB Ongaro was reelected Secretary General of the FGB, which, despite its recent ordeal, still counted with around 25,000 members and remained Argentina's largest print workers' union. Welcomed into the CGT by Secretary General Saúl Ubaldini (a colleague of Ongaro's at the ILO), the FGB became less prominent as one of the smallest of the CGT's 62 unions. Ongaro, who earned renown for his uncompromising stance against anti-labor policies two decades earlier, concurred with the CGT's grudging support of the anti-labor President Carlos Menem (a Justicialist candidate elected with the CGT's support in 1989). Adverse to conflict, Ongaro refused to condemn Menem's October 1989 pardon of those who led Argentina's last dictatorship during its infamous 1976-79 campaign of human rights abuses. Ongaro also kept a low profile during the advent of free market policies that ushered in an unprecedented era of corporate takeovers and mergers in Argentina during the 1990s. One such takeover, that of Editorial Atlántida (Argentina's leading magazine publisher) by Editorial Perfil in 1998, led to differences between affected employees and Ongaro, himself, who did not oppose the merger. The event led to strain between Ongaro and the FGB rank-and-file, though he has since been reelected as their Secretary General. The FGB's relatively conciliatory stance in collective bargaining negotiations fostered the emergence in 2011 of a rival faction, the Eduardo Ayala Classist Graphics Group. Having led Argentina's largest print workers' unions, the FGB, since 1966, Ongaro became the dean of Argentine labor leaders.

Electrified track was laid to the station site and quarterly proving cars ran for nearly twentyfive years, but no revenue-earning car ever travelled to or from the halt. Overview The electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between Grimsby and Immingham Dock which the Great Central Railway had built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the Great Central and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network, though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. In modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally as \\"tramcars\\", with related things being called names such as \\"tramcar halt\\" and \\"tramcar bridge\\" with \\"car\\" a more common short form than \\"tram.\\" Location and facilities Immingham Town - known locally as \\"Tramcar Halt\\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from Immingham engine shed and residents of the village of Immingham, by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper. When the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to engine shed, or \\"Loco\\" as it was called locally. A 1966 aerial photograph shows a single decker bus in the near foreground very close to where the tramcar halt would have been. When the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the company grudgingly built it to what would have been Queens Road Halt. The extension was single track with a passing loop at the halt. Proving tramcars ran along the extension every quarter to maintain the right of way, but no revenue earning vehicle ever traversed it. The overhead wires and points were removed in the Second World War and all trace of the unused branch had gone by 1955. Services Unusually among British tramways, services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at Immingham engine shed, whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock. It was normal for several tramcars to queue to reverse at Immingham Town at the peaks. Herein lay some of the reasons the Great Central never followed through with their stated intention of running cars to Queen Road, still less to Immingham Village beyond, as was implied in some earlier publicity and repeatedly requested by Immingham Parish Council. By a large margin the line's key market was dock workers, with railway staff a distant second and Immingham villagers a distant third. While these last would have paid fares, railway staff never did throughout the line's existence, so running tracks and services would be hopelessly uneconomic. Furthermore, travelling through to Queens Road or the village would have added significant time and potential disruption to the core users' journeys, with no benefit to them whatsoever. Closure The line took some years to die, being cut back at the Grimsby end in 1956 then reduced to peak services only in 1959, when it disappeared from Bradshaw and through ticketing beyond the line was withdrawn. Formal closure of the line and Immingham Town tramcar halt came on Monday 3 July 1961, with the last tramcars running on Saturday 1 July 1961, when a convoy of six cars set off from Immingham Dock, nominally at 14:03. The last tramcar of this convoy and therefore the last from Immingham Town was Number 4. Aftermath The first track on the line to be removed was at Dock tramcar station, to give increased parking space. The process of demolition was piecemeal and even in 2013 many hints of the line remained, such as spun concrete masts near Immingham Town.

He was born in 1947 in Huddersfield, United Kingdom and migrated to Australia in 1970. He has been an academic, performance artist and writer, publishing 15 full-length works of fiction, three academic books, short stories and poems. He is the author of the Eddon and Vail science fiction thriller series, the Heaven and Earth young adult fantasy trilogy and the illustrated Wolf Kingdom series for children. He has been awarded the Australian Aurealis Award on five occasions for his fiction. Life and academic career Richard Harland completed undergraduate studies at Cambridge University, graduating with a BA and majoring in English. After graduation, he planned an ambitious doctoral thesis, focusing on a global theory of the language of poetry and approached numerous universities around the globe seeking funding for his research. Support was unforthcoming until an offer from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, consequently he migrated to Australia in 1970 to take advantage of this opportunity. He originally only intended to remain in the country until his PhD was completed, but after some months decided to settle permanently.Humphries, Glen (29 August 1997). \\"Beyond the Dark Edge\\". Illawarra Mercury. Weekender Section. Page 4. Work on his thesis was slow, and he eventually reduced its scope to an MA, before moving away from his studies for several years, while he worked as a singer, songwriter and poet in and around Sydney. He published poetry and short stories during this period in a number of literary magazines. He returned to academic life in the 1980s through a tutoring position at the University of New South Wales and continued work on his doctoral thesis, which was published as Superstructuralism: The Philosophy of Structuralism and Post-Structuralism in 1987. The volume sold well, was well received, and secured him a lecturing position in English at the University of Wollongong, where he remained for ten years. During his academic career he published full-length works and a number of articles on literary theory. Fiction writing He scored an early success in childhood with a short story which won a prominent United Kingdom competition, and also wrote and distributed stories while at school, exchanging ongoing instalments for sweets and other tokens when other pupils were reluctant to part with legal tender. He is best known for several series of novels, but commenced his novel writing career relatively late in life. He had been eager to write full length tales from late childhood but suffered from writer's block, which prevented him making significant headway with novel projects (and also many short stories) for much of the next 25 years. He was able to produce academic books during this period, however, and he attributes the writer's block partly to his belief that he had to write serious literary novels rather than what he found most enjoyable to work on. It was not until writing the comic horror novel The Vicar of Morbing Vyle (1993) that he managed to conquer this obstacle. However he had published short stories prior to this, some of which were collected in Testimony (1981), which also included his poetry. He was still lecturing at the University of Wollongong when he wrote The Dark Edge, the first novel of his \\"Eddon and Vail\\" science fiction thriller series. His senior lecturing role was a secure tenured position, much sought after by professional scholars, however, with a sequel to The Dark Edge having been commissioned by his publisher, Pan Macmillan Australia, set to appear the following year, he felt unable to juggle the demands of full-time academic life with fiction writing. Despite an uncertain future in a small Australian publication market, where relatively low volume sales are considered a best- seller and there are few full-time writers, he resigned his position in 1997 to concentrate on his fiction. He has been a full-time writer ever since. He remains an Honorary Senior Fellow in English at the University of Wollongong.Van, Ikin (1 March 2003). \\"Nothing too fancy\\". Sydney Morning Herald. Spectrum Section. Page 2. He has also taught summer courses at the university, most recently on children's and young adult fantasy literature. =Novels= Many of Harland's novels contain maps. He has confessed to a fascination with maps, sometimes spending hours studying them. He has also admitted to often viewing his fictional worlds as though seen from an elevated distance, something he feels is a common feature among fantasy writers. Following the 1999 publication of Hidden from View, the final volume in his Eddon and Vail series, all of his novels have been written either for young adults or children, with the exception of The Black Crusade (2004). Some of his novels have also been published as audio books. The \\"Vicar\\" series The first volume of this series, The Vicar of Morbing Vyle, was Harland's first published novel. He set up his own publishing company to bring it to press, and approached individual booksellers in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney to promote it. While it is no longer in print, it has since attained a cult status, something he claims was his original intention when marketing the book.Kuhn, Andrea (17 June 2000). \\" You're better off working at a checkout \\". Illawarra Mercury. Weekender Section. Page 3. It was followed in 2004 by The Black Crusade, a prequel to The Vicar of Morbing Vyle. It describes the journey of the hapless Basil Smorta, a multi lingual bank clerk, who is forced into the company of a group of \\"fundamental Darwinists\\" by their imprisonment of the object of his undying love, Australian singer, Volusia, in a mobile iron box. The group travel across Eastern Europe during 1894, and encounter ghosts, blood donating vampires and other comic horror curiosities. The novel, which shows the origin of the 'vyle' Marquis of Morbol Villica from the first volume in the series, plays with the notion of the tale's reliability as a factual narrative, including fictional footnotes, apparently inserted by the publisher, to show their disdain and disagreement with Basil's actions and their unheroic qualities.(2005-03-01). \\"Doctor's fantasy a winner\\". Illawarra Mercury. IQ Section. Page 37. The novel was published by Chimaera Publications, which also produces Aurealis, a magazine which publishes and promotes Australian speculative fiction, and originated the Aurealis Awards (although these awards have been administered entirely independently from Chimaera by another organisation since 2004). The novel won an Aurealis Award in 2004 in both the \\"Best Horror Novel\\" and the overarching \\"Golden Aurealis Best Novel\\" categories. The Eddon and Vail series In this series of three science fiction novels with both mystery and supernatural elements, Inspector Eddon Brac, a male detective with traditional sleuth leanings, is partnered with assistant Vail ev Vessintor, a female goth noble with expertise in the psychic sciences. Each novel presents the pair with a murder mystery with an unorthodox and surprising origin and also explores the tension between them. The series is set against the background of the colonial hegemony of the planet Terra, whose influence has spread across the cosmos, but is increasingly threatened by the Anti-Human, an unknown menace, which follows a steady path from the boundaries of the universe towards the core, consuming Terran colonies as it advances. The first volume, The Dark Edge was a finalist for the 1997 Aurealis Award in both the Horror Novel and Science Fiction Novel categories and the third, Hidden from View, was nominated for the 1999 Ditmar Award in the Best Novel category. The Heaven and Earth trilogy This trilogy for young adults is set in Australia 1000 years into the future and concerns a war between heaven and earth. Each book includes an 'angelology'. In preparation for writing the trilogy, Harland extensively researched angels and cosmology, including both the mainstream and unorthodox sources of Christian, Islamic and Judaic lore on the subjects. He was particularly concerned to present angels as beings which departed from the comforting 'Disney' representations of some previous works, and were awe inspiring, beautiful and disturbing, while remaining characters readers could still empathise with. The first book he read on angels was A Dictionary of Angels by American poet Gustav Davidson, and he has returned to this book numerous times since to help with inspiration on subsequent fiction projects. He has also stated that the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck greatly assisted in creating his vision of heaven.(2002-03-31). Atkinson, Frances (compiled by). \\"Influences – Richard Harland\\". The Sunday Age. Agenda Section. Page 10. The Wolf Kingdom series The Wolf Kingdom Series comprises four illustrated fantasy books, aimed at older pre-adolescents, commencing with Escape! and completed by The Heavy Crown, all published in 2008. Harland wrote the story, and Laura Peterson provided illustrations which head each chapter and are mostly full page. Each tale functions as a self-contained narrative, but the series also interlinks as a larger story arc. The books were launched in association with the Children's Book Council of Australia. A race of talking, bipedal wolves have overrun and enslaved humankind, leaving only a determined resistance, known as the \\"Free Folk\\", who shelter in a subterranean refuge and plot to liberate themselves from their animal overlords and must discover how these creatures have risen from their former bestial state, to become oppressive rulers of humankind. The books focus on two children, a brother and sister, whose parents are taken by the wolves, and who subsequently join the \\"Free Folk\\" and become key to the success of the rebellion. Harland has long been fascinated with wolves; during his childhood in the United Kingdom he passed an ominous wood named 'Wolves Wood' on daily basis in a school bus and this left a marked impression upon him. The series won the 2008 Aurealis Award for the \\"best children's illustrated work/picture book\\" category. In awarding the series an Aurealis the judges, acknowledging the dual work of Harland and his illustrator partner, Laura Peterson, commented: \\"The illustrations help to bring alive aspects of the story – muscular pictures for a muscular tale. Laura Peterson has shown attention to detail in all the artwork pertaining to the wolves and helps to support the atmosphere of peril that Richard Harland has created.\\" Worldshaker Harland's most recent series of novels commenced with Worldshaker, a young adult steampunk novel partly inspired by the work of Charles Dickens, released in May 2009 in Australia. The main inspiration for this book was the dream he had which is now one of the scenes in the book. The principal character is Col, who lives in the privileged upper sections of a mountain-sized city-ship. He has been selected to become the next commander of the craft, but is forced to question his world when a girl who has escaped from the lower decks, seeks his help and reveals to him the poverty and exploitation below the elite world of his upbringing. The novel sold to US publisher Simon & Schuster for a substantial advance. The story itself is very similar to the plot of the film Metropolis. Both feature a young man who is the heir to a futuristic society where the wealthy live \\"above\\" and the poorly treated workers \\"below\\", with a young woman of the worker class teaming together with the young man to overthrow the cruel establishment. Harland began developing the ideas for Worldshaker in the mid 1990s and took five years to write the novel, passing through 3 complete rewrites. It was first entitled Leviathan, later Juggernaught before finally being published as Worldshaker. The sequel to Worldshaker has been published as Liberator. Other young adult fiction novels *Walter Wants to Be a Werewolf (2003) It is part of the Aussie Chomps series for teenagers. Walter is a young member of a family of werewolves, but struggles to manifest true werewolf characteristics when the full moon rises, and subsequently visits a doctor hoping to find a cure for his condition. *Sassycat: The Night of the Dead (2005) It was a finalist for the 2005 Aurealis Award for best children's (8–12 years) long fiction. =Shorter works of fiction= Richard Harland has published nearly 20 short stories and novellas. His work has been included in anthologies such as Encounters, Outcast, and the 2008 published Dreaming Again, the second anthology of Australian speculative fiction compiled by prolific editor and anthologist, Jack Dann. He has also published shorter works in magazines in Australia and the United States. Several of his stories have received honourable mentions in the prominent Year's Best Fantasy and Horror anthologies, edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling. His shorter fiction has been both nominated for and won Australian speculative fiction awards. Author's website His website is notable for presenting the substance and background of each of his fiction projects, and dozens of pages of writing tips. It also includes an extended biography, describing the development of his writing career, including his protracted battle with writer's block. Harland has a second website created solely to provide advice to writers. The result of a four-month break from his writing it has over 140 pages of advice and tips and is located at http://www.writingtips.com.au.

Biography Salim Dada learned to play classical guitar and the oud, contrabass, mondole, kwitra and percussions. He also studied harmony, Western and Eastern musical theory, and presented several works for guitar solo and small ensembles. Between 2002 and 2005 he prepared a cycle of musical writing (harmony, counterpoint and analysis) in school of distance learning polyphonies with the composer Jean-Luc Kuczynski in France, and the Institute National Supérieur de la Musique in Algiers in the class of the academician Golnara Bouyagoub. His nomination in 2007 as a Composer-in-Residence with the Algerian National Symphony Orchestra allowed him to create seven compositions and conduct 30 concerts in two years. The music catalogue of Salim Dada spans twenty symphonic works, a dozen scores for strings and chamber music and numerous pages for solo musicians (guitar, piano, harpsichord, saxophone, violin, etc.). He also has composed for voice and instruments of traditional Arab music and for film and theatre. Composer-member of SACEM, his compositions won awards in competitions and were presented at events such as the 57th Bayreuth Festival Junger Künstler in 2007, festival of the “Euro- Mediterranean Youth Orchestra” in Damascus in 2008, the 7th Arab composers festival \\"Arab Perspectives\\" in Cairo, Settembre Musica \\"MITO 2009\\" at Milano, \\"PAN 6\\" in Amsterdam.

When fluid is injected under a polyp in preparation for endoscopic mucosal resection, some polyps do not \\"lift\\", indicating that the polyp is not separating from the submucosa. This makes polypectomy more technically difficult, and increases the risk of intestinal perforation if polypectomy is then attempted. It is also thought to be indicative of an early colorectal cancer that has invaded the submucosa significantly (sm3 – invasion down to the lower one-third of the submucosa), which would make surgical removal of the tumour preferable to allow complete removal of the cancer. Consequently, the non-lifting sign is generally considered to be a contraindication to performing endoscopic mucosal resection. History The non-lifting sign was first described in 1994 by Yoshiharu Uno and Akihiro Munakata of the Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Japan. In 1999 the same team showed that the presence of a non- lifting sign correlated with the depth of invasion of the submucosa by early colorectal cancers that were being considered for endoscopic resection. The tumours which did lift when fluid was injected were found to be less invasive than those that did not (sm1 or sm2 - invasion confined to the upper two- thirds of the submucosa, with at least 1mm of uninvolved submucosa underneath). It is thought that the non-lifting sign is due to fibrosis around the tumour causing tethering of the tumour to the muscularis mucosae. Subsequent research suggested that the non-lifting sign is less accurate in determining depth of tumour invasion than the assessment of tumours by the endoscopist, but still suggests that the presence of the sign makes endoscopic resection technically difficult. However, more recently it has been found that fibrosis may be caused when a tumour is biopsied before endoscopic mucosal resection is attempted, which leads to a false positive non-lifting sign and therefore reduces the apparent accuracy of the sign. The authors, therefore, recommended avoidance of biopsy of the lesions if EMR is to be attempted, and if biopsies have been taken the time before EMR is attempted should be minimised.

Instead, Wang Yongmin assigned several character components to each key relying on the inherent redundancy of Chinese characters. For example, the U key can generate 13 different shapes (such as 立, 六, 辛 or 冫), but a sequence of at most four keys always disambiguates individual shapes, for example, pressing UEMC produces 毅, mapping U to 立 for this character.See the Wubi method for more information.

After calling at Algiers (where he took on board Muslim passengers bound for Mecca) and Tunis, he reached Alexandria. Here he and his assistant Waldred took his Levant Company stock and went overland and then up the Nile to Cairo. Finding it impossible to sell his goods in Cairo, he went with another Englishman, John Burrell, to visit Jerusalem. This was a very hazardous journey to make, given the perils of any travel by land in an area rife with highway robbery. After his return, he wrote a letter about his adventures to friends in London that was published in 1603 as A True and Strange Discourse on the travailes of two English Pilgrims. It was a popular account and went through numerous editions. The popularity of the account was due to the vivid narration and the surprising friendship it presented between an English Protestant (Timberlake) and an unnamed Muslim from Fes, Morocco. This man had been one of the passengers Timberlake had taken on board in Algiers. Encountering Timberlake at Mamre, near Hebron, as part of a large Syrian caravan, the Moor promised to help the captain in a strange land. Timberlake - unwisely declaring himself a Protestant and an Englishman at Jaffa Gate - was arrested and accused of being a spy, the guards not knowing the country of England or Queen Elizabeth. He was released from prison only through the intercession of the Moor, who pleaded with the Ottoman Pasha for Timberlake's freedom. This Moor saved Timberlake's life on a second occasion when the two men hired racing camels at Gaza to return to Cairo, and were set upon by Bedouin, who wanted to take Timberlake to sell as a slave. Timberlake's account is also a vivid glimpse into the history of Palestine and the situation of Christians there in the Ottoman period. The Protestant Timberlake is forced by the Pasha to stay in the Franciscan hospice, against his will, but in fact Timberlake appears to develop a grudging respect for the friars, who greet him there by washing his feet despite his fear of being made to participate in Catholic mass. Given this, Timberlake's account shocked certain sectors of the English public in the Jacobean period by appearing to be pro-Catholic and pro-Muslim, and he was ridiculed in a caricature printed in an unauthorised version of his account. [picture] Timberlake published nothing else, but continued his travels as a merchant adventurer, journeying to Virginia, where he owned land in Smith's Hundred, and also to Bermuda, where he also owned land. He died in September 1625, in Titchfield, near Fareham, Hampshire, where he had been closely associated with Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and was buried in the chancel of St. Peter's Church there. His grandson, also called Henry Timberlake, emigrated to Newport, Rhode Island.

Barnard) in the Lolo subgroup of Lolo-Mos'o, remarking, \\"The language appears to form a bridge between Lolo and Kachin\\".Grierson, George Abraham. 1928. Linguistic survey of India, vol. 1, pt. 2, Comparative vocabulary. Calcutta: Government of India Central Publication Branch. Luo (2000:325 [1954]) placed Gongshan Qiu (Dulongjiang Dulong) and Gongshan Nu (Nujiang Dulong) in the Tibetan language branch (along with Tibetan, Jiarong, Qiang, and Xibo), but also stated that the person-marking in Qiu and Nu resembles that of languages in Nepal, and suggested that Qiu and Nu might form their own separate branch. Sun (1982:2) postulated a close relationship between Dulong, Jingpho, and Deng; elsewhere (2007:567) he limits this to Dulong and Jingpho. In a more extensive passage (1983:234-247), he still maintains that Dulong and Deng should be included in the Jingpho branch (1983:243), but also concludes that based on the unique characteristics of Dulong, it arguably deserve its own branch of Sino-Tibetan, but it has more similarities with Jingpho than with any other branch (1983:247). Nishida (1987) places Dulong and Nung (a supergroup including Rawang and Anong) together into a group called Lolo-Burmese-Dulong, alongside the Loloish and Burmese branches, but places Nu (Nusu?) directly under the Burmese branch. In her PhD dissertation, Cui Xia (2009) compares Dulong with Tibetan, Qiangic (Pumi), Burmese-Yi (Zaiwa and Hani), and Jingpho, concluding that Dulong is on a separate branch. The results pertaining to Jingpho are summarized in Dai & Cui 2009. Matisoff (various places, e.g. 2003:692) likewise postulated a relationship between Nungish and Jingpho, and a grouping called Jingpho-Nung- Luish, but neither van Driem (2001) nor LaPolla (2003) have been able to find substantiating evidence. Thurgood (2003) and LaPolla (2003) propose that Nungish may be part of a larger \\"Rung\\" group. Matisoff (2013) now agrees that the relationship between Nungish and Jingpho-Luish is due to contact, not a close genetic relationship. He also reiterates a relatively close relationship between Nungish and Lolo-Burmese, particularly the Burmish branch (Matisoff 2013:5). DeLancey (2009) includes Nungish in the Rung group along with rGyalrong, Qiang, Primi, and Tangut, and places Rung tentatively under Burmic, on the same level as Lolo-Burmese-Naxi. Recently, LaPolla has proposed a group of features that are characteristic of Rawang (LaPolla 2012:126), and also offered a reconstruction of person-marking in Proto-Dulong-Rawang (LaPolla 2013:470).

Kemp was an infantry battalion Commanding Officer. Among his assignments were the command of Operation Fingal in Afghanistan from July to November 2003, and work for the Joint Intelligence Committee and COBR.[citation needed] After retiring Kemp co-wrote Attack State Red with Chris Hughes. The book is an account of the 2007 Afghanistan campaign undertaken by the Royal Anglian Regiment, documenting their initial deployment. Kemp has spoken on a range of social and political issues, including the British armed forces, the Middle East, and the European Union. He is a frequent contributor to The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, The Daily Express, Bruges Group, ConservativeHome, and Breitbart News.[self- published source?]  Early life and military career  Kemp was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School before serving as a soldier and officer in the Royal Anglian Regiment from 1977 to 2006. Having trained as an infantry soldier in 1977 at Bassingbourn Barracks, Cambridgeshire, he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant on the General List on 5 August 1978. Posted back to the Royal Anglian Regiment in 1979, Kemp was appointed as a platoon commander with the 3rd Battalion, based in Palace Barracks, Belfast. During his military career Kemp completed seven deployments on Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1980 and Captain in 1985. He later became a training instructor at Bassingbourn before a posting to the 2nd Battalion as the second in command of a Company, Milan Platoon Commander, and then Battle Group Operations Officer, serving in several locations across the world including a tour as part of UNFICYP in Cyprus.Crossmaglen Security Forces Base, South Armagh, Northern Ireland As a captain in the Royal Anglian Regiment, Kemp took part in the first Gulf War in 1990–91, commanding the Tactical Headquarters of 7th Armoured Brigade, and was promoted to the rank of Major in 1991. Following tours with the 7th Armoured Brigade and in Headquarters Northern Ireland, he returned to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment as Point Company Commander, leading the company in Bosnia, Germany and Canada. In Bosnia, he served on operations with the United Nations (UNPROFOR). He then took over the Armoured Infantry Training and Advisory Team based at Hohne and Sennelager, and held a staff appointment in the Ministry of Defence. Kemp was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1997 and commanded the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment in Oakington and Londonderry from 1998 to 2000. After this command, he was appointed Commander of the Operational Training and Advisory Group and then spent six months as Counter Terrorism and Security Advisor to the Government of Macedonia.Royal Anglian machine-gunners, Helmand, 2007 Kemp was attached to the Cabinet Office from 2001 to 2006, during which time he was briefly Commander of Operation Fingal in Afghanistan (between July and November 2003) with approximately 300 soldiers under his command. At the Cabinet Office he worked for the Joint Intelligence Committee and the national crisis management group, COBRA, during the period of the 2005 London bombings and a series of kidnappings of British nationals in Iraq and Afghanistan. His responsibilities included Iraq, and he made several visits to Baghdad, Fallujah and Mosul. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel on 30 June 2004 and retired from the army on 30 March 2006. After leaving the army, Kemp co- authored the book Attack State Red with Chris Hughes, a journalist with the Daily Mirror. It describes the deployment of the Royal Anglian Regiment in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2007 as a part of Operation Herrick. The title of the book comes from the British military standing operating procedures (SOPs) for the alert state of a base referring to the likelihood of attack. The book was published in September 2009 by Penguin Books.  Politics = Allegations of war crimes and criminal prosecutions of British soldiers = Kemp has repeatedly spoken out against the \\"malicious, disruptive\\" investigation and prosecution of British soldiers for suspected criminal acts in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the opening of new investigations relating to the actions of British soldiers in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, including those relating to Bloody Sunday. Kemp has argued that the prosecution of British armed forces personnel for alleged criminal acts \\"are part of a concerted campaign of political warfare intended to undermine western democracies and their ability to defend themselves.\\" Kemp told the Belfast News Letter that he was concerned about the investigations into historic crimes, stating \\"It is obvious some soldiers do some wrong things of course but there is a very clear difference between them and terrorists. Soldiers set out to uphold the law whereas terrorists set out to maim and murder. They should be treated differently.\\" Kemp told a Law of War Conference at the Israel Law Centre in 2015 that \\"it has always been difficult to get soldiers to adhere strictly to the laws of war because the battlefield is an inherently dangerous and frightening place, and soldiers are only human beings who sometimes succumb to the strain and stress of conflict, sometimes make mistakes, and who sometimes get overtaken by anger at seeing their mates blown apart next to them.\\" Kemp was himself questioned by police in 2000 concerning his suspected role in the murder of a prominent Republican figure during the 1980s, but formal charges were not brought against him. = Brexit = Kemp is a member of the advisory board of Veterans for Britain, which campaigned strongly during the 2016 referendum for the UK to leave the European Union. = Afghan interpreters = In 2015, Kemp spoke out in support of granting asylum in the UK to Afghan interpreters who had worked with British armed forces.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/11832796/Britain- owes-Afghan-interpreters-a-debt-of-honour.html = Israel and Palestine = Kemp is involved with several pro-Israel organisations including as a Board member at the Friends of Israel Initiative and the International Advisory Board of the pro-Israel organisation NGO Monitor and a frequent speaker at the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of UN Watch. Kemp has suggested that the UK government's condemnation of actions by the Israeli government and military in Palestine are the result of anti-Semitism within British government institutions and the mainstream media, as well as a desire by the same \\"to appease militant Islam\\". Interviewed in The Jewish Post in May 2015, Kemp stated that 'I'm not suggesting all Muslims are extremists, or support violence and terrorism. But, what I would say is that the overwhelming majority of Muslims is opposed to Israel and is anti-Semitic. As they gain dominance in different Western countries and threaten us with violence that they sometimes carry out – we’ve seen it in Paris, in Denmark, in London, where a British soldier was decapitated by Islamic extremists – there is an inclination among many people, who maybe ought to know better, to appease that violence and appease that dominance, and therefore side with them against Israel.'  United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (2008)  Kemp asked to be interviewed by the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (also known as the Goldstone Report), which was established by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as an independent international fact-finding mission \\"to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression\\". His request was rejected \\"because the report did not deal with the issues he raised regarding the problems of conducting military operations in civilian areas\\". Kemp publicly rejected the conclusions of the investigation, denying allegations that Israel engaged in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Kemp said: \\"Of course innocent civilians were killed. War is chaos and full of mistakes. There have been mistakes by the British, American and other forces in Afghanistan and in Iraq, many of which can be put down to human error. But mistakes are not war crimes...Based on my knowledge and experience, I can say this: during Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli Defense Forces did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in the combat zones than any other army in the history of warfare.\\" In the report of a June 2009 conference at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Kemp also accused Hamas of deploying women and children as suicide attackers, and wrote that \\"Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence and ferry arms and ammunition between battles.\\"  UN Commission of Inquiry Report on Gaza (2014)  Kemp criticised the findings of the 2014 UN Commission of Inquiry Report on Gaza, calling it \\"flawed and dangerous\\". His analysis was strongly critiqued by Richard Falk, former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Palestine, who accused Kemp of ignoring and misinterpreting international law. = \\"Honour the Brave\\" = Kemp was involved in the \\"Honour the Brave\\" campaign led by the Daily Mirror in 2007 and 2008 to recognise the sacrifice of British troops killed or wounded in action by the award of a medal similar to the US Purple Heart. The campaign was initiated by Rita Restorick, mother of British soldier Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, who was killed by an IRA sniper on 12 February 1997. An Early Day Motion in the 2008–2009 parliamentary session supporting the initiative gained the support of the majority of Members of Parliament, as well as widespread support among serving and retired military ranging including Field Marshal Sir Edwin Bramall, former Chief of Defence Staff. The campaign eventually led to the MOD announcement in 2008 of a new award to be made to the next of kin of British soldiers killed in action, which was launched in July 2009. The award, called the Elizabeth Cross, is the first decoration to be named after a reigning monarch since the institution of the George Cross in 1941 and was back-dated to the end of the Second World War.  Death threat  In October 2013 British media reported that Kemp may be on an Al-Qaeda death list. Kemp featured alongside others who have spoken out against Islamist terrorism on a video released by the Al Qaeda group al- Shabaab, which was responsible for an attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in 2013. The video included a clip from the BBC TV programme HARDtalk of Kemp condemning the murder of Fusilier Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich. The al- Shabaab urged UK Islamists to copy the murder. The Daily Mirror reported that anti-terrorist police had discussed with Kemp this death threat and concerns over his security. Controversies= Criticism of \\"political correctness\\" in the armed forces = Kemp has consistently criticised efforts by the British army to increase gender and ethnic diversity. In 2014 he expressed his strong opposition to the proposal to end the policy prohibition on women serving in ground close combat roles, stating that women lack \\"ferocity, aggression and killer instinct\\". Writing in the Daily Telegraph in 2016 he alleged that the decision to allow women access to all armed forces roles was driven by \\"feminist zealots and ideologues hell-bent on equality of opportunity without exception\\" and that \\"through no fault of their own, women will often become the weak link in an infantry team. The men will have to take up the slack\\". Kemp was critical of the army's 2018 recruitment advertising campaign, \\"This is Belonging\\", stating that \\"The army, like the rest of government, is being forced down a route of political correctness ... What is most important is that the army is full of soldiers. It is of secondary importance that they reflect the composition of society.\\" On 1 August 2017 The Times published an article by Kemp claiming that Islamic State forces were attempting to infiltrate the British armed forces, stating that \\"The understandable drive by the armed forces and police to recruit more Muslims, and a less understandable concern for ticking the politically correct box over operational effectiveness, combine into an unprecedented danger.\\" The article was condemned for stigmatising all young Muslims as \\"potential terrorists\\" and undermining attempts to increase diversity in the British armed forces. On 3 August 2017 The Times published a letter from the Muslim Council of Britain that said \\"Richard Kemp chooses to cast a dark shadow of suspicion on Muslims serving in our nation’s armed forces (Islamists may have already infiltrated our armed forces, 1 August).\\" Attacking an article that Kemp had written in that newspaper, they said it was \\"unreasonable and downright unfair to single out Muslims who have taken the patriotic step to enlist.\\" Kemp has defended the continued enlistment of 16 and 17 year olds by the British armed forces, despite criticism of the policy from child rights organisations, arguing that the recruitment policy \\"unquestionably boosts the quality and fighting effectiveness of the armed forces\\". = 2015 University of Sydney lecture = On 11 March 2015 Kemp visited the University of Sydney to deliver a lecture on \\"Ethical Dilemmas of Military Tactics\\" and the complexities in dealing with violent non-state actors such as ISIL. This lecture was interrupted by a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators led by Associate-Professor Jake Lynch, the Director of the University's Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies. Following a heated exchange between the protesters and audience members, the pro- Palestinian protesters were evicted by security guards. In response to the incident, Kemp wrote a letter to the University of Sydney criticising Lynch's behaviour and accusing the latter of antisemitism. The University of Sydney later commenced an investigation into the incident. =Libelling Baroness Warsi= In April 2017, a column written by Kemp and published in the Jewish News suggested that Baroness Warsi had sought to excuse the conduct of the Islamic State group. The column also suggested that she had objected to action being taken against British Muslims who murder and rape for that organisation. The Jewish News was subsequently ordered to pay £20,000 in damages plus costs to Warsi. In its public apology, the Jewish News stated > In a column written by Colonel Richard Kemp published in the Jewish News and > jewishnews.co.uk on 6 April 2017, it was suggested that Baroness Sayeeda > Warsi has sought to excuse the appalling conduct of the barbaric Islamic > State terror group. The column also suggested that Baroness Warsi has > objected to action being taken against British Muslims who murder and rape > for Islamic State. We wish to make absolutely clear that these allegations > were wholly untrue and should never have been published.\\" Warsi donated the damages to a charity for Muslim and Jewish women. Kemp himself did not issue an apology, and was accused by Warsi of appearing \\"to wantonly publish inflammatory and offensive comments without a thought for the consequences (let alone the truth).\\" =Call for death penalty, deportation or internment of suspected terrorists= In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing, Kemp called for all foreign nationals on the British government's terrorism watch list to be deported from the UK. He has also called for British nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism to be interned or stripped of their citizenship, stating \\"those who are fighting with Islamic State, who have gone out from this country to fight with Islamic State, to murder, torture, and rape, we don’t let them come back. They don't come back into this country.\\" Kemp's calls were rejected by Brigadier Paul Gibson, the former director of counterterrorism for the UK Ministry of Defence, who stated the suggestions were \\"a very, very blunt instrument that I think would fundamentally undermine the way we in Britain operate as a liberal society where we absolutely put the rule of law at the front of everything we do.\\" In December 2017 Kemp appeared on a Jon Gaunt podcast with far-right activist Tommy Robinson, calling for British citizens fighting for ISIS \\"if possible to be killed in Iraq or Syria or wherever they are.\\" On 23 July 2018, The Daily Telegraph published an article by Kemp which argued that after its departure from the European Union, Britain should re-instate the death penalty for terrorism suspects. =Allegations concerning Jeremy Corbyn = During the general election campaign in May 2017, Kemp accused Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn of supporting terrorism: \\"We must face the fact that Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would simply aid our enemies. He would rather support the likes of Hamas – every bit as fundamentalist as Islamic State – than oppose these extremists.\\" In May 2019, he stated that \\"Corbyn supports terrorism and terrorist violence. He is not a pacifist nor a man of peace despite his false claims. He is a racist, a liar, a fraud and a threat to this country and all people.\\" Kemp has repeatedly accused Corbyn of supporting the Irish Republican Army, condoning the murder of civilians and being a \\"Jew hater\\". =Use of the term \\"taig\\"= In July 2017 he received criticism for his usage of the term \\"taig\\", a slur for Catholics (particularly those of Irish descent), during an exchange on Twitter, including from former Labour MP and British Army officer Eric Joyce who questioned if he knew it was a \\"racist term of abuse\\". In his defence Kemp mentioned that as a practising Catholic, one of the few in his former unit, and having often been subject to the term as a result, he did not consider it a term of abuse.  Honours and awards  Kemp was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Military Division, on 25 April 1994 in recognition of his intelligence work in Northern Ireland in 1993, and was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for service as a commander in the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia in 1994. He was promoted Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), Military Division, in the New Year Honours 2006. He received an honorary doctorate from Bar-Ilan University in 2015.

Names Until ca. 1950, the endonym Lolo was written with derogatory characters in Chinese, and for this reason has sometimes been avoided. Shafer (1966–1974) used the term \\"Burmic\\" for the Lolo-Burmese languages. The Chinese term is Mian–Yi, after the Chinese name for Burmese and one of several words for Tai, reassigned to replace Lolo by the Chinese government after 1950. Possible languages The position of Naxi (Moso) within the family is unclear, and it is often left as a third branch besides Loloish and Burmish. Lama (2012) considers it to be a branch of Loloish, while Guillaume Jacques has suggested that it is a Qiangic language. The Pyu language that preceded Burmese in Burma is sometimes linked to the Lolo-Burmese family, but there is no good evidence for any particular classification, and it is best left unclassified within Sino-Tibetan. Löffler (1966) and Bradley (1997) consider the Mru language to be closely related to or part of Lolo-Burmese, while Matisoff includes Mruic in the Northeast Indian areal group. Pai-lang, attested from the 3rd century, is Lolo-Burmese, perhaps Loloish. External relationships Guillaume Jacques & Alexis Michaud (2011) argue for a Burmo-Qiangic branch with two primary subbranches, Na-Qiangic (i.e. Naxi-Qiangic) and Lolo-Burmese. Similarly, David Bradley (2008)Bradley, David. 2008. The Position of Namuyi in Tibeto-Burman. also proposes an Eastern Tibeto-Burman branch that includes the two subbranches of Burmic ( Lolo- Burmese) and Qiangic. Internal classification Bradley (1997, quoted in Peiros 1997) gives the following classification for the Lolo-Burmese languages. In later publications, in place of Loloish, David Bradley instead uses the term Ngwi based on a conservative autonym in the Sanie language. *Lolo-Burmese Mru Core Lolo-Burmese *Ugong–Burmish Ugong Burmish *Loloish (Ngwi) Lama (2012), in a study of 36 languages, finds the Mondzish cluster (Mondzi–Maang, Mantsi–Mo'ang) to be divergent.

Solan 1991) in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic theory, describing a new look at normal object relation that takes place from the beginning of life. Till nowadays symbiosis (propounded by Margaret Mahler 1968, 1975) is the common term for a normal object relation, while Ronnie Solan emphasizes that symbiosis represents impairment in object relation. Jointness is defined as a dynamic process representing an emotional system for attachment and for communication between separate individuals who jointly approach each other in a third, joint, virtual space. Jointness represents an encounter between mother and infant, psychotherapist and patient, or any partners experiencing simultaneously mutual intimacy, while concomitantly safeguarding separateness. The newborn, very early in life, perceives the other, even his mother, as a \\"not-I\\" (it indicates a psychic process to safeguard one's own self), and is attached to the \\"not-I mother\\" by an intimate acquaintance with her through his/her senses. When both, mother and baby, devote themselves to intimacy, that temporarily blurs the boundaries between them, separateness can be safeguarded. As a result, baby might gradually develop his/her own boundaries and acknowledge those of his or her object and might invest their own innate abilities to participate in human interactions and enjoy relationships (\\"motivational systems,\\" Emde, 1988). The development of this basic process of jointness between baby and mother depends on mother's capacity to tolerate separateness. It is the mother who imprints the quality and the intensity of the rapprochement-separation balancing process in their relationship, while both of them are fully invested in each other. The unique jointness and the unique communication, in a unique psychic virtual space are created by the sharing of interests (emotional or cognitive), and by the mutual investment of partners in a joint phenomenon, object, or idea, meaningful to both. All vital human communication represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space. Thus, \\"jointness\\" elicits the triadic (triangulation) object relations (mother's space – \\"virtual transitional space\\" – baby's space). In this type of transitional space baby and mother, lovers, or partners of a common task, are jointly determine the extent of rapprochement between themselves, the extent of safeguarding separateness and also the moment to separate. Each of them is sensorily attentive to the strangeness and the separateness of the “non-I” that the other represents for him. Such a dynamic process of jointness, represents healthy development from birth, paves the way to a sense of individuation and culminates to establish the valuable communication with others relating to their otherness, while preserving separateness and self integrity. It is important to distinguish between jointness and symbiosis. Both may commence with the beginning of life; they may seem similar, and yet they are widely different experiences. In symbiosis, baby and mother behave and function as though they were \\"an omnipotent system - a dual unity within one common boundary\\" (Margaret Mahler, 1968, p. 201). Partners of symbiosis can be fully satisfied as long as there is no hint of separateness. Jointness, on the other hand, represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space. The development of this basic process (between baby and mother) in symbiosis depends on mother's inability to endure separateness while both of them are fully invested in each other. It is the mother who imprints on their encounter her need to contain herself with her baby in one unit and to prevent the encouragement of separateness in favor of the boundaries of their unity. Both partners will be motivated, through life, by a powerful need for merging and they will remain almost addicted to finding another object to merge with and attach their symbiotic needs, even at the expense of sacrificing their individuation, their true-self and their self-esteem. Such an encounter fosters only a dyadic relation where the \\"transitional virtual space\\" between them is missing. Hence, symbiosis is a dyadic pathological process, even from the beginning of life that results in self fragility, narcissistic disturbances and in an immature personality; while jointness represents a triadic healthy development that depends on healthy narcissism and generates separation-individuation, communication and relationship.

The band's name is inspired by the story The Whisperer in Darkness by H. P. Lovecraft. The lyrics deal mainly with occult and mystic concepts.  History  Whispers in the Shadow was formed as a solo project by Ashley Dayour (vocals, guitars, also known as guitarist for L'Âme Immortelle & Veneno para las Hadas) in 1996. They soon developed into a full lineup and released their first album, Laudanum in 1997 followed by their second album November in 1999. These two albums are heavily influenced by the sound of The Cure's early recordings such as Pornography. In 2000, they released the third album A Taste of Decay which was a departure into a more rock oriented sound. This was followed a year later by Permanent Illusions which was very much far from the gothic rock origins of the band. Psychedelic and progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd had a major influence on the sound of this record. After touring all over Europe in 2001, they released their first live album called Everything You Knew Was Wrong in 2003, but several lineup and record label changes forced them to take a break. Whispers in the Shadow returned in 2007 with the live album A-Cold-Night followed by the re-releases of their first two albums Laudanum and November, remastered with new cover artwork and unreleased bonus tracks. In 2008, they released their fifth studio album called Into the Arms of Chaos. This album can be seen as a new beginning and was produced by John A. Rivers at Woodbine Street Recording Studios. He also worked with bands such as The Chameleons, Clan of Xymox, Love and Rockets, Dead Can Dance and Sopor Aeternus and created a more harsh and powerful but still dark and psychedelic sound, which was described by the press as \\"Goth- Floyd\\", a mixture of the traditional gothic rock sound like Fields of the Nephilim with the soundscapes of Pink Floyd. In 2010, they released The Eternal Arcane, the second part of a 4-piece cycle about the occult concept of alchemy. In 2011, a live DVD called Searching for Light was released. The band then toured with Vendemmian and Merciful Nuns throughout Europe. In April 2011, they released a 6-track EP, The Lightbringer which includes a cover version of the Leonard Cohen classic \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" as well as other unreleased tracks. The main theme of the EP is the fall of the archangel Lucifer. The lyrics are inspired by chaos magic and occult writers such as Austin Osman Spare, Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, Kenneth Grant, as well as writers from the Weird Fiction genre like Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen and the Cthulhu Mythos by H. P. Lovecraft. 2012 marked the release of their self-produced seventh studio album, which is the third part of the ongoing conceptual cycle, The Rites of Passage, and 2014 marked the release of their eighth studio album, the fourth and final part of the cycle, Beyond the Cycles of Time. In 2018, the band released their ninth studio album The Urgency of Now and will release their tenth album Yesterday Is Forever in 2020.

The Trust has been running now for over 40 years, during which time many thousands of young people from all over Britain and indeed around the world, have benefited from the unique experience that is provided. A mark of the impact she made is the institution of an annual memorial lecture in her honour, which continues today.  Schoolship scheme  Sailing Barge Thalatta in the River Blackwater The Trust owned and operated two sailing barges (known in the Trust as schoolships) the 150 burthen ton Thalatta and the 200 ton Sir Alan Herbert, both coasting spritsail barges, rigged with ketch mizzens. The latter vessel was procured through an appeal made in memory of the famous humourist, novelist, playwright and one-time MP, A.P. Herbert. The Trust continues to operate today, based at Maldon, Essex and the sailing barge Thalatta is undergoing a major overhaul and rebuild at the barge yard at St Osyth, largely supported by lottery funding. The name Thalatta originates from the Greek word meaning the sea (see Thalatta! Thalatta!). The Sir Alan Herbert is no longer in the hands of the Trust, and has reverted to her original name, Lady Jean.  Achievements  Jane Benham was a major figure in development of the Trust's work, personally carried out much of the administration and served as First Mate of the Thalatta. In this endeavour, she worked closely with John Kemp, founder of the Trust, master mariner and author; and his wife, Monica Kemp. The programme was dubbed 'A Week in Another World'. During their stay on board the schoolships, children and their accompanying teachers or youth leaders explored the east coast within the area North Foreland in the south to Orfordness in the north, living on board and working the vessels under sail. Jane Benham was awarded the MBE for her work with the East Coast Sail Trust.  Artist and benefactor  She was also a prolific and accomplished artist, painting mainly small works in oils, acrylic and watercolour, principally of Essex coastal scenes. She was a strong and generous supporter of several charities, as well as a number of individuals whose hardship came to her notice.  Background  Jane Benham was the daughter of Hervey Benham and granddaughter of William Gurney Benham, who between them edited the Essex County Standard from 1884 to 1964. Her father was also a prolific author of books, in particular about sailing and shipping on the east coast. She was brought up in Fingringhoe and West Mersea, Essex; and educated at St Mary's School, Colchester and St Felix School, Southwold. When not at sea she lived during most of her life at Maldon, Essex. Jane Benham died from cancer, aged 49, in 1992.

Some publications avoid the term under the misapprehension that Lolo is pejorative. Lolo is the Chinese rendition of the autonym of the Yi people and it is only pejorative when written with a particular Chinese character (one that uses a beast rather than human radical), a practice that was prohibited by the Chinese government in the 1950s.Benedict, Paul K. (1987). \\"Autonyms: ought or ought not.\\" Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area 10: 188. Italics in original. David Bradley uses the name Ngwi, which is also used by Ethnologue, and Lama (2012) uses Nisoic. Paul K. Benedict coined the term Yipho, from Yi and a common autonym element (-po or -pho), but it never gained wide usage. Internal classification=Bradley (2007)= Loloish was traditionally divided into a northern branch, with Lisu and the numerous Yi languages and a southern branch, with everything else. However, per Bradley (1997) and Thurgood (2003:8) there is also a central branch, with languages from both northern and southern. Bradley (2002, 2007) adds a fourth, southeastern branch. *Northern Loloish: Nuosu (2 million), Nasu (1.0 million), etc. *Central Loloish: Lisu (940,000)–Lipho (250,000) (incl. Lolopo (570,000), Lalo (320,000)), Micha (50,000), Lahu (600,000), Jinuo (21,000), etc. *Southern Loloish: Akha–Hani, Phunoi–Bisu, Pholo and ’Ugong (aberrant; removed in Bradley 1997) *Southeastern Loloish: Nisu, Phula, Sani, Azha, Khlula, Muji, Phowa, etc. Ugong is divergent; Bradley (1997) places it with the Burmish languages. The Tujia language is difficult to classify due to divergent vocabulary. Other unclassified Loloish languages are Gokhy (Gɔkhý), Lopi and Ache. =Lama (2012)= Lama (2012) classified 36 Lolo–Burmese languages based on a computational analysis of shared phonological and lexical innovations. He finds the Mondzish languages to be a separate branch of Lolo-Burmese, which Lama considers to have split off before Burmish did. The rest of the Loloish languages are as follows: The Nisoish, Lisoish, and Kazhuoish clusters are closely related, forming a clade (\\"Ni-Li-Ka\\") at about the same level as the other five branches of Loloish. Lama's Naxish clade has been classified as Qiangic rather than Loloish by Guillaume Jacques & Alexis Michaud (2011)Jacques, Guillaume, and Alexis Michaud. 2011. \\"Approaching the historical phonology of three highly eroded Sino-Tibetan languages.\\" Diachronica 28:468-498. (see Qiangic languages). A Lawoish (Lawu) branch has also been recently proposed.Hsiu, Andrew. 2017. The Lawu languages: footprints along the Red River valley corridor. Satterthwaite-Phillips' (2011) computational phylogenetic analysis of the Lolo-Burmese languages does support the inclusion of Naxish (Naic) within Lolo-Burmese, but recognizes Lahoish and Nusoish as coherent language groups that form independent branches of Loloish.Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian. 2011.

His reign lasted for 18 years, from 1714 to 1732. Personal life Dodda Krishnaraja was born on 18 March 1702. He was the first-born son of Kanthirava Narasaraja II, by his second wife Maharani Chelvaja Ammani Devi. A month before his tenth birthday—upon his father's death—he acceded to the throne of Mysore. Although he was married nine times, direct descents in the Wodeyar lineage stopped with him; a son was born to his first wife, but died aged six months. Dodda Krishnaraja died on 5 March 1732 at the age of 29, and was succeeded by his relative's son, Chamaraja Wodeyar VII. Demands of neighbours Just before Dodda Krishnaraja I's accession, a change had come in the governance of the Mughal province of Sira (Carnatic Bijapur) to the north and northeast of Mysore. In 1713, Carnatic-Bijapur was split into a payanghat jurisdiction with capital at Arcot and governed by a newly styled Nawab of Arcot, and a balaghat jurisdiction, governed by a newly styled Nawab of Sira. That same year, the governor of Carnatic-Bijapur, Sadat-ulla Khan, was made the new Nawab of Arcot, and Amin Khan was appointed Nawab of Sira; Mysore, however, remained a formal tributary state of Sira. This division, and the resulting loss of revenue from the rich maidān region of Mysore, made Sadat-ulla Khan unhappy and, in collusion with the rulers of Kadapa, Kurnool, Savanur, and the Maratha Raja of Gutti, he decided to march against Krishnaraja Wodeyar I. However, the Nawab of Sira, anxious to preempt the coalition's action, hit upon a plan himself of reaching the then-Mysore capital, Seringapatam. In the end, both Nawabs—of Arcot and Sira—settled upon a joint invasion led by the former. Krishnaraja Wodeyar I, for his part, was able to \\"buy off this formidable confederacy\\" by offering a tribute of Rs. 10 million. This outcome, however, made Mysore vulnerable to similar future claims, which, for example, were made successfully two years later by Maratha raiders who appeared in the Mysore capital. The resulting depletion of the Mysore treasury led Mysore to itself attack and absorb the poligar chiefdom of Magadi to its north. Abdication of power gave a decidedly negative appraisal of the maharaja's character: > \\"Whatever portion of vigour or of wisdom appeared in the conduct of this > reign belonged exclusively to the ministers, who secured their own authority > by appearing with affected humility to study in all things the inclinations > and wishes of the Maharaja. Weak and capricious in his temper, he committed > the most cruel excesses on the persons and property of those who approached > him, and as quickly restored them to his favour. While no opposition was > made to an establishment of almost incredible absurdity, amounting to a lakh > of rupees annually, for the maintenance of an almshouse to feed beasts of > prey, reptiles, and insects; he believed himself to be an unlimited despot; > and, while amply supplied with the means of sensual pleasure, to which he > devoted the largest portion of his time, he thought himself the greatest and > the happiest of monarchs, without understanding, or caring to understand, > during a reign of nineteen years, the troublesome details through which he > was supplied with all that is necessary for animal gratification.\\" According to , the Maharaja's lack of interest in the affairs of state, soon led two dalvoys, or ministers, Devaraja, the army chief, and his cousin, Nanjaraja, who was both the revenue minister and the privy councillor, to wield all authority in the kingdom. After Krishnaraja Wodeyar I's death in 1736, the dalvoys would appoint \\"puppet maharajas,\\" and effectively rule Mysore until the rise of Haidar Ali in 1760.

Humbert was primarily known as a portrait painter. Humbert was the son of Pierre Humbert, a merchant from Geneva who had settled in Amsterdam in 1706 as a bookseller and publisher, and his second wife Emilie de Superville, daughter of Daniel de Superville, a Calvinist theologian from Saumur who had fled to the Dutch republic in 1685. Humbert studied painting in Paris, where he served as apprentice to Jean Fournier and subsequently probably also to Joseph-Marie Vien. In 1761 or 1762 he moved from Amsterdam to The Hague. In 1767 he became an apprentice of the academy of drawing of the local painter's guild Confrerie Pictura. In 1787 he was chosen as one of the guild officers and in 1792 he was even elected as head of the guild. He painted portraits as well as historic and mythological subjects. His portrait subjects included Dutch East India Company official Abraham du Bois (1760), politician Hendrik Fagel (1766) and writer Isabelle de Charrière (1769). The portrait of du Bois originally hung in the Dutch East India Company offices in Rotterdam, but is now part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Humbert designed the ornate decorations of the facade of The Hague's town hall during the wedding of Stadtholder William V to Wilhelmina of Prussia in 1767. He also painted a room in the courthouse of The Hague. A work by Humbert hung in the stadtholder quarters at the Binnenhof but it was removed around 1808 along with a number of other paintings during a remodeling ordered by king Louis Bonaparte, who had used the stadtholder quarters as a royal palace since 1806. In 1768, Humbert married Elisabeth Antoinette Deel. The marriage produced seven children, including: * Jean Emile Humbert, a military engineer credited with rediscovering ancient Carthage * David Pierre Giottino Humbert de Superville, a scholar and artist who wrote the influential Essai sur les signes inconditionnels dans l'art.

Club career Her clubs include IL Sandviken, Bjørnar (now Arna-Bjørnar) (2000), FK Athene Moss (2001), Asker (2002–2005, 2008) and, in 2006/07, Umeå IK where she was vice- captain for the 2007 season. At the end of her time in Umeå she went on holiday to West Africa where she contracted serious food poisoning with a body temperature of 42 degrees C. In her own words, \\"I met the man with the scythe\\" (i.e. the Grim Reaper). In 2008, she returned to Norway and played again for Asker, and was also the club's physical trainer as well as qualifying as a lawyer and beginning full-time work for a law firm in Oslo. At the end of 2008 when Asker became bankrupt most first-team players including Klaveness transferred to Stabæk IF, the nearby top sports club, to set up Stabæk Fotball Kvinner (SFK). Stabæk therefore became the first Norwegian club to have men's and women's teams playing in the two elite divisions, the Tippeligaen and the Toppserien. Despite retiring from international football in 2011 Klaveness was contracted to continue playing for SFK in 2012. But she announced her retirement from all football in March 2012 after her enthusiasm waned. International career Klaveness played in Norway's team in the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament in the USA, and in the UEFA Women's Euro 2005, also known as the European Cup competition, played in England. She played on the Norwegian team that finished fourth at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, but retired from the Norwegian national team at the end of the 2007 season having played 51 matches and scored six goals. The manner of Klaveness' departure was controversial, as coach Bjarne Berntsen told her she was no longer required in the airport lounge immediately after the long flight home from the World Cup in China. This shocked and upset Klaveness and some of her teammates. She was recalled in 2009 after Eli Landsem replaced Bertsen as the team's trainer. In October 2009 she was recalled to the women's national team for two matches in the qualification stage of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Eventually she completed a further 22 matches for Norway. Post playing career As a specialist in employment law Klaveness is sometimes involved with disputes between football clubs and their employees. She also serves on the management committee of NISO, the organisation for sports people in Norway.NISO Management 2011-2013 Klaveness announced her retirement from football in March 2012. Further to her career as an attorney, she is also serving as a deputy judge in the Oslo court. Since her playing retirement, Klaveness has also worked as a television football pundit. She was a studio commentator for NRK's coverage of the 2014 [men's] World Cup, after which she was subject to sexist criticism by internet trolls.

In August 1943, the squadron strafed Japanese defenses on Cape Gloucester in New Britain, to prepare for the amphibious attack on the island. For this action, it was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC). It received a second DUC in June 1944 for missions in which it attacked Japanese airfields, harbors and shipping in New Guinea.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 93–95 The squadron moved from New Guinea to the Moluccas in October 1944.

In January 1945, the squadron moved to Lingayen Airfield on Luzon, from which it continued to support ground forces in the Philippines, but also mounted attacks on industrial targets in Taiwan and struck shipping along the coast of China. It temporarily moved to Palawan to attack enemy installations in preparation for the planned invasion of Borneo. The following month, the 823rd moved to Okinawa, from which it flew several attacks on missions against southern Japan before V-J Day. In November, it moved to Itazuke Airfield, Japan, where it served as part of the occupation forces until inactivating in September 1946, when the 38th Group was reduced to two squadrons in post war reductions in military forces. =European missile unit= In September 1962, the 38th Tactical Missile Wing reorganized, eliminating its groups.

The village is east by road of the regions capital of Faro, west of the town of Aljezur and north-east of the coastal town of Portimão. The village is in an area of mountains called Serra de Monchique. The parish is in the western half of the municipality of Monchique, and is in the heart of the Serra de Monchique and has an area of 146 km2. The parish is bounded on the north by the municipality of Breja, south by the municipalities of Lagos and Portimão, west by the municipality of Lagos and east by the parish of Monchique.  Etymology  The name Marmelete derives from Sea and Milk. This name came about through a local folklore legend regarding the origins of the village. The legend tells the story of a ship sailing along the nearby coastline being caught in a fierce storm which caused the ship to capsize. The captain and his crew managed to escape to the coast near to Lagos, saving eight goats and timber from the ships structure. With what they had salvaged the captain and crew decided that they need to find somewhere to shelter and decided to head for the nearby Serra de Monchique. Eventually they came upon the area which is now the location of the village. The men settled there building shelters using the materials they had salvaged from the ship. Every morning members of the community would travel back down the mountain to the sea to catch fish, whilst the other took care of the goats and other livestock they had acquired. Many of the men began relationships with the local girls and some married and started families. After several years the shacks and shelters built by the captain and crew became a village with proper dwellings and they had gathered a considerable amount of livestock. There captain did not settle into the monotonous life on land and longed to go back to the sea. One day the captain went to the port of Lagos and by chance met an old seafaring acquaintance. The man owned a ship and hearing about the captain's predicament, he offered him a position of captain on his ship, but he could not employ any of his old crew. Since the captain could not take any of his old crew with him, he said goodbye to them with the following words: My friends, I leave you and do not know if I will ever return, but in my soul I'll keep this place and I name the village \\"Mar e Leite\\" (Sea and milk). Both elements that helped and sustained all of us over the many years. The sea, where we caught fish, and the milk of our goats. The remaining crewman took the captains words and inscribed them on a stone. Over time, the village name was modified until it developed to its present form of Marmelete Economy *Agriculture *Apiculture *Pig farming *Cork harvesting Marmelete is a main supplier of Cork, as well as a producer of Black pork.

The locals also produce a strong spirit called medronho, a traditional fruit Eau de vie from the fruit of the Medronho tree, Arbutus unedo, also called strawberry tree.

Her work remained tied to surrealism but was also innovative, including abstract elements and the use of techniques such as sgraffito and the use of sand for texture. She became isolated in her later life due to health issues, and except for retrospectives at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1986 and at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 2009 and 2014, she has been largely forgotten, despite her influence on Mexican modern art. Life Rahon was born Alice Marie Yvonne PhilppotFrancisco Morosoni: Alice Rahon - Una Mirada A Alice Rahon (Spanish). in Chenecey-Buillon, Quingey in the east of France.Andrade, p 12. Her most vivid memories of childhood were of Brittany, the house of her paternal grandparents in Roscoff, where she passed long periods of time in the summer and during the Christmas holidays. She also remembered visiting the beaches of Morlaix.Andrade, p 12-13. When she was about three years old, she suffered a serious accident which put her in casts and affected the rest of her life. One of the injuries was a fracture in the right hip, which forced her to recuperate lying down for long periods of time. This left her isolated from other children, including her younger sister Geo, spending time in the family garden reading, writing and drawing to occupy her mind.Andrade, p 13. This isolation was reinforced when she fell again at age twelve, breaking a leg. These events gave her an identity of fragility and by the time she was a teenager, she preferred solitude, creating worlds of her own imagination.Andrade, p 15. For the rest of her life she always walked with a slight limp and pain. She became pregnant when she was very young, but the child had a congenital defect and died soon after birth. When she and her sister were young women, they lived in Paris and discovered its bohemian scene. In 1931, she met artist Wolfgang Paalen and they married in 1934. With him she became involved with the Surrealism movement, published poetry under the name Alice Paalen, and met others such as Eva Sulzer, a Swiss photographer, with whom she was lifelong friends.Andrade, p 15-16. Her life with Paalen also introduced her to travel, which she did much of during her life. In 1933, the couple visited the cave paintings at Altamira and in 1936, she traveled to India accompanied by poet Valentine Penrose. Both of these travels had impact on her life and art, even naming two cats Vishnu and Subhashini in her late life.Andrade, p 16-18. She traveled extensively during much of her life with later voyages to Alaska, Canada, the United States, Lebanon and in Mexico. Rahon, Paalen and Sulzer were invited to visit Mexico by Andre and Jacqueline Breton and Frida Kahlo .Andrade, p 18. They first traveled in Alaska, British Columbia and the U.S. west coast, where Paalen became fascinated by indigenous art. They finally arrived to Mexico City in 1939, at first staying in a hotel in the San Ángel neighborhood. She became friends with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. With Frida she shared frustrations of a fragile body and the inability to have children as well as using art and writing to pass the time. The bond with Frida led to the later creation of a painting called La balada para Frida Kahlo. Both the couple's fascination with the country and the outbreak of World War II in 1939, prompted them to remain permanently in the country, with Rahon becoming a Mexican citizen in 1946.Andrade, p 18-22. In 1947, Alice and Paalen divorced and she named herself Rahon, married the Canadian Edward Fitzgerald. However, this relationship ended several years later after the two worked on a film together.Andrade, p 24-25. From then, Rahon's social life revolved around friends in various artistic, intellectual and foreign exile circles, which she had begun in Europe. By the 1950s, these friendships included Rufino Tamayo, Carlos Mérida, Octavio Paz, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Henry Moore, Gordon Onslow Ford and his wife, along with Kahlo and Diego Rivera. She also maintained contacts with groups of artists in New York and California. After her death, a record she kept of these people's lives and deaths was found.Andrade, p 8. She also continued to travel frequently, in part because of her art exhibits in the United States and Mexico but she also visited many cities in Mexico and spent long periods in Acapulco. One reason for this was that she was a strong swimmer despite her physical problems, moving more comfortably in the water than on land. In 1967, she had another accident, this time falling down stairs at the opening of a show at the Galería Pecanins in Mexico City. This time, she injured her spine, but she refused medical treatment, stating that doctors had tortured her enough as a child. The injury caused her to become a recluse. She was the subject of an exhibit at the Galería de Arte Mexicano in 1975, and a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1986,Andrade, p 26-27. but for the last years of her life, she lived practically in seclusion in her house in Tlaquepaque, visited by only a few friends such as Eva Sulzer and American professor Wayne Siewart, whom she had known since the 1950s.Andrade, p 27. She lived surrounded by mementoes of her life, including books signed by the likes of Breton, Paul Éluard, poems by Picasso, letters from Henry Moore and Anaïs Nin, paintings dedicated by Yves Tanguy and Paalen, and old photographs and souvenirs.Andrade, p 9. By 1987, she could no longer take care of herself in her home and was placed in a nursing home. Refusing food, she died four months later in September 1987.Andrade, p 28. Career Rahon's first career was as a poet. In 1935, she became part of the Surrealist movement in Europe, meeting artists such as Paul Eluard and Max Ernst through her husband.Andrade, p 16. In France, she published 'A meme la terre' with a print by Yves Tanguy, and in 1938 Sablier Couche, illustrated by Joan Miró. Both projects were supported by André Breton. She also wrote 'Muttra' and other poems while in India with Hindi influence, as well as poems related to the work of painters she admired, such as Picasso.Andrade, p 16-17. In Mexico, Rahon gradually left poetry, but she did publish one last collection of works called 'Noir Animal', in which appears a portrait of Alice painted by Paalen.Andrade, p 19. She also contributed some poems and illustrations to Wolfgang Paalen's DYN (magazine), which published writing in English and French about Mexico for foreign audiences. However, her work with DYN was mostly as editor, working with writers such as Alfonso Caso, Miguel Covarrubias and Jorge Enciso .Andrade, p 19-20. However, even as a painter, she remained connected to poetry, illustrating the writings of others such as Chateau de Grissou by Cesar Moro .Andrade, p 21. Her career as a painter and visual artist spanned almost forty years, starting shortly after she arrived to Mexico in 1939. She was supported in this endeavor by husband Wolfgang Paalen, who helped her get her first exhibits in 1944 and 1945 at the Galería de Arte Mexicano with Inés Amor, then in California and New York. She exhibited frequently, especially from the late 1940s into the 1960s in Mexico, the United States and even in Beirut, working frequently with artists and writers living outside their native Europe.Andrade, p 22. Other artistic endeavors included theater and film. In the late 1940s, she became interested in the genre, especially puppet theater.Andrade, p 24. She created the script and costume design for a production called Orion, el gran hombre del cielo; however, it was never produced during her lifetime. However, it was revived in 2009 for a retrospective of Rahon's work at the Museo de Arte Moderno by a group called Laboratorio de la Máscara. They used her original notes and sketches to create sets and choreography inspired by dances from India. She worked on a film with her second husband Edward Fitzgerald, about a magician that lived at the bottom of the sea called Les Magiciens. The main character was sometimes represented by an actor and other times by a marionette. It was a costly and long project, with Rahon making chutney and other foods in her kitchen to sell and help finance the project. Years later, the project was finished, but she had separated from Fitzgerald and the only copy of the experimental film was lost. Only a few stills from the film exist. By the late 1960s, she painted rarely.Andrade, p 26. She withdrew from the art world, with only one major exhibit of her work, a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1986, sponsored by Teresa del Conde who was head of INBA at the time. Her isolation in her later years meant that no one was promoting her work and she was almost forgotten by younger generations of artists and art historians, despite her important role in the development of Mexican art . However, in 2009, the Museo de Arte Moderno held a major retrospective of her work, which, along with inclusion in a collective exhibition at the Museo Mural Diego Rivera the same year, was the first public showing of her work since 1986. Artistry Rahon's early artistic work was in poetry, often writing about scenes and landscapes from her childhood, as well as about her immobility and nostalgia. However, after arriving in Mexico, she began to paint, firstly in watercolours, inspired by the colours of her surroundings in Mexico. Most of her later work was in oils, but she also created drawings, collages and objects. The main influences in her work are surrealism, poetry, her travels and Mexico. Her work has been described as primitive and intensely poetic, “breathing with and inner life.” Her paintings have some link to surrealism but are also tied to her experiences in Mexico and her use of colour, light and the appearance of landscapes show influence from poetry. Influence from cave paintings and tribal art from her travels can also be seen. Her works were considered mature from the beginning, with abstract elements (not accepted in Mexico at the time) but still representing something concrete, almost always natural phenomena.Andrade, p 20. Her surrealist influence was mostly from Paalen, with important early influences being Moraines, Rendez-vod de vivieres and Cristales del espacio. However, she is also classed with other surrealist artists from Europe in Mexico, such as Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington . Unlike these two, she did not confine herself to oils but experimented with techniques, especially those related to texture, showing influence from Rufino Tamayo. Her themes include landscapes, elements from myths, legends, Mexican festivals, and elements of nature, along with mythical cities (which represent introspective worlds) and homage to various artists that she admired. Water appeared often, both in form and as the color blue. She made series of paintings related to rivers, similar to those created by Paul Klee titled El Nilo, Rio Papaloapan, Rio Papagayos and Encuentro de Rivieras (painted many years later).Andrade, p 25. She created paintings to honor Giorgio de Chirico, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Joan Miró and Pablo Neruda . Two dedicated to Frida Kahlo include La balada de Frida Kahlo (made shortly after Frida's death), as well as Frida aux yeux d’hirondelle in 1956, which was reworked a decade later. While surrealist, her work also demonstrates the beginning of abstract art in Mexico in the 1940s, along with Carlos Mérida, Gunther Gerzso and Wolfgang Paalen. She was also a pioneer in the use of sand, sgraffito and other textures on her canvases.

Haute couture is high-end fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers—often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Couture translates literally from French as \\"dressmaking\\", sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit. Haute translates literally to \\"high\\". An haute couture garment is always made for an individual client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance and only in Paris. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag: budget is not relevant. In modern France, haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards. Terminology The term haute couture originally referred to Englishman Charles Frederick Worth's work, produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. The Dapifer notes that Worth would allow his clients to select colors, fabrics, and other details before ever beginning his design process, which was unheard of at the time. In France, the term haute couture is protected by law and is defined by the Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris based in Paris. The chambre syndicale de la haute couture is defined as \\"the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses\\". Their rules state that only \\"those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves\\" of the label haute couture. The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organization was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the \\"couture\\" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the Federation Francaise, de couture, du Prêt- à-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode.Calasibetta, C., Tortora, P., & Abling, B. (2002). The fairchild dictionary of fashion. (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Fairchild Books. More rigorous criteria for haute couture were established in 1945. To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term haute couture in its advertising and any other way, members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture must follow specific rules: * design made-to- order for private clients, with one or more fittings; * have a workshop (atelier) in Paris that employs at least fifteen staff members full-time; * have at least twenty full-time technical people, in at least one workshop (atelier); and * present a collection of at least fifty original designs to the public every fashion season (twice, in January and July of each year), of both day and evening garments. The term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in Paris or in other fashion capitals, such as London, Milan, New York City, or Tokyo. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or fashion designers that create exclusive and often trend-setting fashions or to the fashions created. The term haute couture has also taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art, music, etc.  History in Europe  Chanel Haute Couture Fall-Winter 2011–2012 Fashion Show by Karl Lagerfeld Chanel Haute Couture jacket, Fall/Winter 1961. Haute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th Century. Rose Bertin, the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture. Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models. As railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and dressmakers were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations. A () is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture. Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed. The couturier Charles Frederick Worth (1825–1895), is widely considered the father of haute couture as it is known today.s with the designs of an Englishman named Charles Frederick Worth, haute couture repres an archaic tradition of creating garments by hand with painstaking care and precision\\". Taunton Press, 2001Jacqueline C. Kent (2003). Business Builders in Fashion – Charles Frederick Worth – The Father of Haute Couture The Oliver Press, Inc., 2003 Although born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry. Revolutionizing how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of- a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colors and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready- to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period. Following in Worth's footsteps were Callot Soeurs, Patou, Poiret, Vionnet, Fortuny, Lanvin, Chanel, Mainbocher, Schiaparelli, Balenciaga, and Dior. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers. In the 1960s, a group of young designers who had trained under men like Dior and Balenciaga left these established couture houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Ted Lapidus, and Emanuel Ungaro. Japanese native and Paris-based Hanae Mori was also successful in establishing her own line. Lacroix is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.End of a fairytale: Christian Lacroix fashion house to strip down.

Instead of being constructed for the purpose of selling and making money, they are made to further the publicity, as well as perception and understanding of brand image. For all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in ready-to-wear clothing and related luxury products such as shoes and perfumes, and licensing ventures that earn greater returns for the company. Excessive commercialization and profit-making can be damaging, however. Cardin, for example, licensed with abandon in the 1980s and his name lost most of its fashionable cachet when anyone could buy Cardin luggage at a discount store. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes. Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to the television show Gossip Girl.

Silk originates from China where the \\"Silk worm\\" was found to live. Asian elite began the use of silk in high fashion since the classical ages. As time went on, silk began to be traded leading to the creation of the \\"Silk Road\\" to be formed, which was a boost to China's economy. The value of silk is distinguished by the form of its use, such as it being used as currency. Silk type of fabric is composed of fibers that are produced by the \\"Silk Worm\\" mainly found only in China. There are various kinds of silks, used by designers, found in the textile world. Such as Dupiono, China, Brocade, Jacquard, Satin silk, etc... These various kinds of silks are often used to produce certain styles of clothing. For example, Chiffon silk is used to create draping due to the fact that this silk is a thinner silk than others. Allowing for easier movement and flow of the fabric, thus creating an easier process for draping. = Wool = Wool is the textile fiber obtained from animals such sheep, camels, camelids, goats, or other hairy mammals. Wool was first discovered and used mainly for protection against cold weather. Not all types are acceptable or considered \\"fine\\" wool. For instance, fine wool is found only within four breeds of sheep, the other fifteen are not considered to be \\"fine\\". Dying wool is a delicate procedure due to the fact that wool easily absorbs color, so it is important to be cautious in order not to ruin the wool. Some of the more higher-end wools are alpaca, angora, mohair, cashmere, camel hair, and vicuña; each of these wools has a different texture, softness, and richness.

Smörgåsbord became internationally known at the 1939 New York World's Fair when it was offered at the Swedish Pavilion \\"Three Crowns Restaurant\\". It is typically a celebratory meal and guests can help themselves from a range of dishes laid out for their choice. In a restaurant the term refers to a buffet- style table laid out with many small dishes from which, for a fixed amount of money, one is allowed to choose as many as one wishes.  Etymology  A Nordic smorgasbord In Northern Europe, the term varies between \\"cold table\\" and \\"buffet\\": In Norway it is called or kaldtbord and in Denmark (literally \\"the cold table\\"); in Germany and in the Netherlands (literally \\"cold buffet\\"); in Iceland it is called (\\"loaded/covered table\\"), in Estonia it is called (\\"cold table\\") or rootsi laud (\\"Swedish table\\"), in Latvia (\\"the cold table\\"), in Finland (\\"butter-bread/sandwich table\\") or ruotsalainen seisova pöytä (\\"Swedish standing table/buffet\\"). In Eastern Europe, each language has a term that literally means \\"Swedish table\\". In Japan it is referred to as / (baikingu / vaikingu, i.e. \\"Viking\\"). The Swedish word consists of the words smörgås (\\"sandwich\\", usually open-faced) and bord (\\"table\\"). Smörgås in turn consists of the words smör (\\"butter\\", cognate with English smear) and gås (literally \\"goose\\", but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated to the surface of cream while it was churned). The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so smörgås came to mean \\"buttered bread\\". In Sweden, the term att breda smörgåsar (\\"to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches\\") has been used since at least the 16th century. In English and also in Scandinavian languages, the word smörgåsbord refers loosely to any buffet with a variety of dishes — not necessarily with any connection to Swedish Christmas traditions. In an extended sense, the word is used to refer to any situation which invites patrons to select whatever they wish from an abundant selection, such as the smorgasbord of university courses, books in a bookstore, etc.  Smörgåsbord and julbord  Smörgåsbord foods A traditional Swedish smörgåsbord consists of both hot and cold dishes. Bread, butter, and cheese are always part of the smörgåsbord. It is customary to begin with the cold fish dishes which are generally various forms of herring, salmon, and eel. After eating the first portion, people usually continue with the second course (other cold dishes), and round off with hot dishes. Dessert may or may not be included in a smörgåsbord. = Julbord = A special Swedish type of is the (literally \\"Yule/Christmas table\\"). The classic Swedish julbord is central to traditional Swedish cuisine, often including bread dipped in ham broth and continuing with a variety of fish (salmon, herring, whitefish and eel), baked ham, meatballs, pork ribs, head cheese, sausages, potatoes, Janssons frestelse, boiled potatoes, cheeses, beetroot salad, various forms of boiled cabbage, kale and rice pudding. It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like snaps, brännvin or akvavit with or without spices. Other traditional foods are smoked eel, rollmops, herring salad, baked herring and smoked salmon. Julbord aboard the cruise boat Gustavsberg VII in 1990 Other dishes are pork sausages (), smoked pork and potato sausages (), cabbage rolls (), baked beans, omelette with shrimps or mushrooms covered with béchamel sauce. Side dishes include beetroot salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown cabbage. Lutfisk, lyed fish made of stockfish (dried ling or cod served with boiled potato and thick white sauce) and green peas that can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include rice pudding (), sprinkled with cinnamon powder. Traditionally, an almond is hidden in the bowl of rice porridge, and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognized for having good luck. Julbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until Epiphany in some homes. It is traditional for most Swedish and Norwegian workplaces to hold an annual Julbord between November and January. In Denmark a typical tradition resembling the Swedish julbord is julefrokost (\\"Christmas-lunch\\"), which involves a well-stocked Danish smörgåsbord with cold as well as hot dishes, and plenty of beer and snaps. It is distinct from the Danish Christmas dinner, which is served on 24 December, and is served as a lunchtime meal, usually for family and friends on 25 or 26 December. It is also a tradition for most Danish workplaces to hold an annual julefrokost some time during the months of November to January. History  The members of the Swedish merchant and upper class in sixteenth- century Sweden and Finland served schnapps table (brännvinsbord), a small buffet presented on a side table offering a variety of hors d'oeuvres served prior to a meal before sitting at the dinner table. The most simple brännvinsbord was bread, butter, cheese, herring and several types of liqueurs; but smoked salmon, sausages and cold cuts were also served. The brännvinsbord was served as an appetizer for a gathering of people and eaten while standing before a dinner or supper, often two to five hours before dinner, sometimes with the men and women in separate rooms.Nordiska Museet, in Swedish The smörgåsbord became popular in the mid-seventeenth century, when the food moved from the side table to the main table and service began containing both warm and cold dishes. Smörgåsbord was also served as an appetizer in hotels and later at railway stations, before the dining cars time for the guests. During the 1912 Olympic Games, restaurants in Stockholm stopped serving smörgåsbord as an appetizer and started serving them instead as a main course. Since March 2020, many smörgåsbords were suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as there are restaurants offering take-away or delivery.

The terms \\"gastronome\\" and \\"gourmet\\" define the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure.  Earliest uses of the word  The \\"foodie\\"—not as elitist as a gourmet, more discriminating than a glutton—was first named in print in the early 1980s. The term came into use almost simultaneously in the United States and Britain. Priority goes to Gael Greene, who, in June 1980, wrote in New York Magazine of a character who \\"slips into the small Art Deco dining room of Restaurant d'Olympe ... to graze cheeks with her devotees, serious foodies.\\"G. Greene in New York Magazine (2 June 1980); Oxford English Dictionary at \\"foodie\\" Immediately afterwards the foodie was defined in the British press. Ann Barr, features editor of the London magazine Harper's & Queen, had asked readers to comment on a then-new obsession with food. Several readers' responses named Paul Levy, food writer on the same magazine, as the perfect example. Levy played along,Paul Levy, \\"What is a foodie?\\" in The Guardian (14 June 2007) contributing an anonymous article in August 1982, defining the term (\\"Foodies are foodist. They dislike and despise all non-foodies\\")V. Woods [editor] in Harpers & Queen (August 1982); Oxford English Dictionary at \\"foodie\\" and characterizing himself as the \\"ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes, original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking 'king foodie'\\". The word gained currency rapidly, partly because Barr and Levy followed up with a book, The Official Foodie Handbook, published in 1984.Ann Barr and Paul Levy, The Official Foodie Handbook. London: Ebury Press, 1984.  Pursuits  Foodies are a distinct hobbyist group. Typical foodie interests and activities include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling, food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, food distribution, food fads, health and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary tourism, and restaurant management. A foodie might develop a particular interest in a specific item, such as the best egg cream or burrito. Many publications have food columns that cater to foodies and many of the websites carrying the name foodie have become popular amongst the foodies. Interest by foodies in the 1980s and 1990s gave rise to the Food Network and other specialized food programming, popular films and television shows about food such as Top Chef and Iron Chef, a renaissance in specialized cookbooks, specialized periodicals such as Gourmet Magazine and Cook's Illustrated, growing popularity of farmers' markets, food-oriented websites like Zagat's and Yelp, publishing and reading food blogs like Foodbeast and foodieworld, specialized kitchenware stores like Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table, and the institution of the celebrity chef. Foodies have a significant social media presence; food lovers have created their own YouTube channels where they show what they cook and where they eat around the world. It has also become a common practice to take photos of food and beverages consumed at home or outside and share them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other media in a form of food porn.  Criticism  Chris Onstad, author of the webcomic Achewood and the author of The Achewood Cookbook, stated a dislike for the term. Onstad said \\"There are so many words that already describe the concept of people who like food, or enjoy cooking, or enjoy knowing about cooking. \\"Foodie\\": It's like the infantile diminutive—you put a \\"y\\" on the end of everything to make it childlike. We don't need it. It's embarrassing. 'Girl, I'm a foodie.' Like oh my God.\\"Norton, James. Chow down, dude. Salon. Tuesday 10 April 2007. Retrieved on 23 July 2011. Many journalists, like Roberto A. Ferdman, author of Stop Calling Yourself a 'Foodie' in the Washington Post, also criticize the word saying, \\"There is a great irony in describing yourself as a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would.\\" Ferdman claims that people who associate themselves with being a \\"foodie\\" are in fact distancing themselves from the group they wish to be associated with. The author then states that there is nothing wrong with having an interest in food, in fact this popular trend is helping the food movement thrive. Ferdman's main argument is that since the word is so widely used, its meaning has become ubiquitous and some meaning is lost upon the need to constantly announce how much someone likes to eat.

Natural Arch, Tirumala hills, a notified National Geo-heritage Monument,Geo-Heritage Sites, Minister of Mines Press release, 09-March-2016national geo-heritage of India, INTACH is a distinctive geological feature north of the Tirumala hills temple, near the Chakra Teertham in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The arch is also called Silathoranam (శిలాతోరణం) in the local language (Telugu language: sila means ‘rock’ and thoranam means a garland strung over a threshold, connecting two vertical columns or an ‘arch’ as in this case). The arch measures in width and in height, and is naturally formed in the quartzites of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic (1600 to 570 Ma) due to natural erosive forces. Legend Mythology related to the arch, linked to the famous Tirumala hills temple of Lord Venkateswara, has three versions. According to one version, the arch resembles the hood of a serpent, a conch (Sanskrit: Shank) and a discus (Sanskrit: chakra) – all symbols of worship in Hindu religion – and considered to be the source of the Idol of Lord Venkateswara or Lord Balaji at the Tirumala hill temple. The second version is that the main deity in the Tirumala temple is of the same height as the height of the arch. The third version is that Lord Vishnu, known as Balaji or Venkateswara (the central deity of Srivaishnava tradition) at the Tirumala temple town, is supposed to have put his first foot down at a place called Padalu or Sreevaripadalu (శ్రీ వారి పాదాలు)(Telugu language: Divine foot prints) which is the highest point of Tirumala hills, the second step at the location of the arch. Thereafter, the next step is stated to have been placed where his idol is now worshipped in the temple at Tirumala. History Another view of the Natural arch In the 1980s, during excavations for a geological fault in the Tirumala hills, geologists found this rare geological formation of the rock arch which has two dissimilar sets of rocks with a connecting thin link. The assessed geological age of the rock arch is 2.5 million years. Formation of the arch is attributed to intensified weathering and erosion of stream action that has withstood the torque of nature. This is a rare geological fault which is technically called in the geological idiom as ‘Eparchaean Unconformity’. Geology The natural geological arch has two distinct physiographical regions – southwest upland and northeast lowland. The Tirupati hills, at the foot of a picturesque range of hills, are known by several names such as 'Seshachala', 'Venkatachala' and 'Balaji'. The geological formations are categorized under four heads namely, the (1) Archeans (the gneisses), (2) the Eparchean unconformity (Quartzose sandstones Overlying the granite with a distinct unconformity), (3) Puranas (formation of Cuddapah group well developed in the valley) and (4) Quaternary deposits. The Tirumala hills essentially of precambrian period are composed of sedimentary rocks – quartzites and intercalated shales, which are given the geological, stratigraphical nomenclature of Nagari quartzites. The hill ranges of the Tirumala rise to a height of (at Tirumala) from the average height of in the plains at Tirupati. The steep scarp of the hill ranges depicts unconformity in its topographic, structural and denudational features, which is the Eparchian Unconformity. The sedimentary thickness of the Cudappa basin is of the order of with volcanic sequences in the form of sills and dykes. A prominent Eparchaean Unconformity of the formation resting on the Archaean peninsular gneissic complex is noted. Rocks of Cuddapah Supergroup including Kurnool Group are the prominent feature of the basin. Specifically, the arch's origin is attributed to two schools of thought namely, a) it could be the effect of a wave action from oceanic transgression or intensified climatic settings and corrosion and b) it may have been naturally carved out of quartzite.  Visitor information  Map of Thirumala – the arch is close to Varahaswamy temple in B1 block in the map and is one kilometre from north of the main shrine of Lord Venkateshwara The best time to visit the arch is between 6 A.M. and 8 A.M., fog permitting. There is a well maintained garden in front of the arch should visitors wish to rest or wait until fog clears. Sunset is also a good time to visit, as the arch looks even more striking and mystifying in the light of the setting sun. Seen in the light of a full moon the arch is said to be \\"ethereally beautiful.\\" Access The location of the arch is well connected by road, rail and air routes. The nearest railhead to Tirumala hills is Tirupati. From Tirupati railway station the approach to the Tirumal temple is only by road, a distance of . The nearest airport is located at Renigunta, about away from Tirupati, which connects to Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore airports. Regular bus services (both private and Govt. transport services operate) are operated by all the states bordering Andhra Pradesh. The approach road from the temple is wide and is an avenue of trees. Private vehicles are allowed to the location. A 20-minute walk from the Varahaswamy temple in Tirumala (see map pictured) would be a pleasant experience.

The Whitechapel Pool, realised specifically for the show, transformed the ground-floor of the gallery into an abandoned public swimming pool fictionally dated to 1901 and related to the gentrification of the East End of London.

The capital of Jersika was located on a hill fort southeast of Riga.  History  Jersika was established in the 10th century as an outpost of the principality of Polotsk on the old \\"trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks\\". It was ruled by Orthodox Christian princes from the Latgalian-Polotsk branch of the Rurik Dynasty.von Keussler, Fr. (1897) Zur Geschichte Bischof Meinhards und des Fürstenthums Gercike. Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Altertumskunde der Ostseeprovinzen Russlands a.d. Jahre 1896. Riga. In 1209 Visvaldis, the prince of Jersika, was defeated by bishop Albert of Riga and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and his Lithuanian wife taken prisoner. He was forced to submit his kingdom to Albert as a grant to the Bishopric of Riga, and received back only a portion of it as a fief. He lost lands of Autīne and Cesvaine, but retained Jersika, Mākoņkalns and Naujiene. Visvaldis' feudal charter is the oldest such document surviving in Latvia, and in this charter Visvaldis is called \\"the king of Jersika\\" (\\"Vissewalde, rex de Gercike\\", in another document also \\"Wiscewolodus rex de Berzika\\").The \\"Chronicle of Henry of Livonia\\" translated and edited by James A. Brundage, Columbia University, 1961; revised 2003; 288 pages In 1211 the part of Jersika controlled by Albert which was known as \\"Lettia\\" (\\"terra, quae Lettia dicitur\\") was divided between the bishopric of Riga and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword.Švābe, A. (1936) \\"Jersikas karaļvalsts \\". Senatne un Māksla, 1936:1, pp. 5–31. (In Latvian, original documents in Latin included) In 1212 Polotsk gave up its tributary rights over Jersika in favor of Bishop Albert. In 1214 Germans attacked the Castle of Jersika and sacked it. Baltic German Uexküll family claimed that Conrad Uexküll had married the daughter of Visvaldis. After the death of Visvaldis in 1239 his fief passed to the Livonian Order, but this was repeatedly contested by the rulers of Lithuania and Novgorod, who periodically sought to conquer the territory.

The Act was described as \\"purely procedural\\" by the House of Lords in R v Joyce,DPP v. Joyce at para 355 but in fact extended the definition of high treason. It became treason to seize one of the King's forts and then not surrender it within six days of being ordered to. This form of treason had originally been enacted in the Treasons Act 1534 and then abolished by the Treason Act 1547. It was soon abolished again by the Treason Act 1553, but would be restored again by the Rebellion Act 1572 (this time without the 6 day deadline). It was also made treason to say that the king was a heretic or usurper, in writing or (for the third offence only) in speech. The Act re- enacted some existing procedural rules in prosecutions for treason and misprision of treason. However the Act amended procedure by stating that a person accused of committing treason only by \\"open preaching or words\\" must be prosecuted within three months of the offence, instead of the 30-day limit previously established by the Treason Act 1547. The Act also prohibited the widow of a man convicted of treason from claiming her dower, a rule not abolished until 1925. Repeals The new kinds of treason created by this Act were abolished by the Treason Act 1553. The Act has since been repealed. Sections 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 of the Act were repealed on 28 July 1863 by section 1 of, and the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1863. Section 11 of the Act was repealed on 1 January 1926 by section 56 of, and Part I of the second schedule to, the Administration of Estates Act 1925. Section 20(3) of, and the fourth schedule to, the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938 (c.63) made the following repeals on 1 January 1939: section 5; in section 4, the words from \\"and that all processes of outlawry\\" to the end; in section 6, the words \\"or process of outlawry\\". Section 4 of the Act was repealed on 15 June 1945 by section 2(1) of, and the Schedule to, the Treason Act 1945. The preamble and sections 6 and 10 of this Act were repealed on 30 July 1948 by section 1 of, and the first schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948.

He lives and works in Paris, France. In 2009 he was nominated for the Flemish Culture Prize.  Life and career  Christina Mirabilis (Sint-Truiden) The Bat (Bolsward) Le Grand Vivisecteur (Leiden) The Column (Antwerp) Johan Creten started to practice drawing and sculpture at an early age. Fascinated by art, literature and music, he met a couple of passionate antiquarians in his hometown that supported him during the first years of his life. In 1985, he graduated at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent where he discovered a clay studio, left behind by the students. Training as a painter, Johan Creten found a real potential in this technique : he started to include ceramics elements in his paintings and familiarized with mud – that he has chosen to be his new medium. He graduated at the School of Fine Arts in Paris. In the 80’s, art was surrounded by conceptual and minimalist artists. By choosing clay, Johan Creten made a bold move, trying to open the possibility of this rare technique in the contemporary art field. He has been firstly represented by Galerie Meyer in Paris, specialized in tribal art from Oceania that organized two of his exhibitions : \\"Johan Creten: Peintures et Sculptures\\" in 1987 et \\"Kunstkamer. Installation et performance\\" in 1988. He has also been represented by the galerist Robert Miller in New York who dedicated him an exhibition in 1988 (\\"Odore di Femmina\\") and in 2001 (\\"Johan Creten : 3 Torsos\\"). Johan Creten is currently represented by Galerie Perrotin in New York, Paris and Hong Kong, Almine Rech Gallery in Brussels and Galerie Transit in Mechlin. In the past twenty years, Johan Creten has been offered prestigious residencies such as the Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres and the Villa Medici. By travelling widely around the world and experiencing different studios, each residency was an opportunity to enrich his œuvre.  Artistic practice  Johan Creten is considered one of the precursors – with Thomas Schütte and Lucio Fontana - in introducing ceramics in contemporary art. Fascinated by its beauty, its symbolic impact and the richness of its history, the artist explores the medium through multiple techniques and scales. His painting training brings another dimension to his sculpture work, giving the glaze and its colors a main role in the artworks. Deeply influenced by the environment and its effects on the impressions of his works, Johan Creten’s work ranges widely, from delicate clay sculptures to large-scale bronzes, a medium he introduced in his work more recently. Inventing phantasmagoric and organic creatures and forms and creating his own fantasy world through them, Johan Creten’s œuvre reveals the artist own engagements and raises existential questions such as the ambiguity of sexuality in the human race and the unpredictable strength of nature among others.

History Embassy of Ukraine in Tel Aviv As Ukraine is rich with Jewish history, it plays a major part in Israeli education for young generation of Jews. In addition, Ukraine is also rich in religious history and contains the grave of Rabbi Nahman of Breslev, which is a pilgrimage site to many religious Jews. As Israel and the West Bank contain rich Christian history, Ukrainians come to Israel as religious pilgrims. This is especially true regarding Jerusalem, with its Orthodox Christian holy sites. When Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR, it was one of the 33 states that voted for a Jewish state in the Mandatory Palestine during the UN Partition Plan in 1947. Later, the Soviet Union broke off relations with Israel in 1967 after the Six-Day War and restored diplomatic relations in 1991. For Jews worldwide, Ukraine also holds many memories regarding the Holocaust, as the site of Babi Yar is in its territory. As Ukraine is a newly independent state, this serves to create a common sense of identity of Ukraine and Israel as nations who gained their independence in the 20th century.

It grew out of the British folk rock and progressive folk movements of the later 1960s.M. McLatchey, A Guide to Progressive Rock Genres , retrieved 29 January 2009. Despite the name, the term was used indiscriminately to categorise performers who incorporated elements of medieval, renaissance and baroque music into their work and sometimes to describe groups who used few, or no, electric instruments. This subgenre reached its height towards the middle of the 1970s when it achieved some mainstream success in Britain, but within a few years most groups had either disbanded, or were absorbed into the wider movements of progressive folk and progressive rock. Nevertheless, the genre had a considerable impact within progressive rock where early music, and medievalism in general, was a major influence and through that in the development of heavy metal. More recently medieval folk rock has revived in popularity along with other forms of medieval inspired music such as Dark Wave orientated neo-Medieval music and medieval metal. Characteristics Medieval folk rock is characterised by three major elements used in various combinations. First, the playing of extant early music involving rock instrumentation. Second, the creation of original music that incorporates compositional features of early music, such as musical modes. Third, the incorporation of the sounds of early music into rock songs, through vocal techniques, the use of additional instruments that characterise early music, or the simulation of early music sounds on rock instruments (for example, the use of a drone sound on an electric guitar).E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 30, 73, and 135. A final element that does not affect the nature of the music, but often accompanies it, is the adoption of perceived elements of ‘medievalism’ in lyrics, actions, dress or artwork.J. E. Perone, Music of the Counterculture Era (Greenwood, 2004), p. 27. History=Origins (1960s)= John Renbourn in 2005 Musicologists have noted an attempt to fuse popular music with elements of early classical music from the mid-1960s in Britain and America, which they refer to as baroque rock or baroque pop.B. Gendron, Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-garde (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 172. An interest in fusing the sounds of medieval and renaissance music with more popular forms was first evident in the British progressive folk movement of the late 1960s. This was particularly clear in the important work of The Incredible String Band from their 1967 album The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion (1967), which introduced both medieval and world music elements into their music. These continued in the highly influential The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter (1968).E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), p 73. Also part of the progressive folk movement was guitarist John Renbourn, whose 1968 album Sir John Alot of Merry Englandes Musyk Thynge and ye Grene Knyghte began to display his interest in the medieval, containing a number of versions of early music songs, which would be dominant on The Lady and the Unicorn (1970). From 1967 Renbourn was a member of the folk group Pentangle, and he took his interest in early music into the mix of influences (including blues, jazz, bluegrass, world music and traditional folk song) in the band.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 200. Coming from the more traditional end of the folk spectrum were Shirley and Dolly Collins. They were the first artists to produce a complete album, Anthems in Eden (1969), that combined traditional folk songs with early music instruments, utilizing David Munrow’s Early Music Consort, and early music remained a major preoccupation of their careers.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 199. Also from 1969 Third Ear Band made use of medieval instruments alongside classical and eastern influences. What laid the foundation for the transformation of these trends into a form of rock music was the release in 1969 of the London-based folk rock band Fairport Convention’s album Liege and Lief, which saw the clear inception of British folk rock as fusion between electric rock music and traditional folk songs and styles.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 4. Fairport Convention occasionally incorporated elements of early music into their repertoire. However, their fusion of English folk music with rock instrumentation was mostly focused on early modern and nineteenth-century ballads and dance music. In contrast, the band formed by former Fairport member Ashley Hutchings as Steeleye Span in 1969, tended to explore a wider range of period music ranging back into the Middle Ages. They also utilized more diverse instruments, including mandolins, recorders and oboes, besides electric guitars, bass and later, drums. This was exemplified by their 1972 album Below the Salt, which contained several early music songs and from which they released the a cappella single of the sixteenth-century carol \\"Gaudete\\", which reached number fourteen in the UK singles chart, arguably the greatest mainstream success for medieval folk rock, as the band were occasionally described.\\"Steeleye Span info page\\", retrieved 29 January 2009. =Heyday: 1970-75= Gentle Giant in 1974 The process of ‘electrification’ set off by Fairport in the folk world, by which existing groups adopted a model of rock instrumentation, meant that several progressive folk performers of early music now joined a growing number of medieval folk rock bands. These included Pentangle, who electrified in 1970 for the album Cruel Sister, Third Ear Band, who from 1972 introduced electric guitars, basses and drums and, from 1976, with the release of Amaranth, Dolly Collins produced an early music album for her sister Shirley that used both electric and traditional instruments. In contrast to Pentangle, Amazing Blondel, formed in 1969 and who composed their own music in a renaissance style, did not electrify. Nevertheless, because of their approach and use of original compositions, they are often described as medieval rock. Very similar in tone were bands like Forest, who from 1969 recorded their own compositions with modern acoustic and medieval instruments.Prog rock archives, retrieved 29 January 2009. At the same time in Germany there were similar developments. Because of the association of folk music with Nazism, Ougenweide, originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, although inspired by Fairport Convention and Pentangle, opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German folk rock.S. Winick, Dirty Linen, 128 (February/March 2007). Several bands followed suit, including Parzival from 1971.\\"Parzival at prog rock archives\\", retrieved 29 January 2009. The growth of interest in early music in the academic and classical worlds were significant for the expansion of medieval folk rock. Gryphon, arguably the archetypal British band in the genre, was formed in 1971 by Richard Harvey and Brian Gulland, both graduates of the Royal Academy of Music. Gryphon were originally an acoustic ensemble performing folk and medieval tunes. However, with the addition of guitarist Graeme Taylor and drummer Dave Oberlé, by the time of their first eponymously titled album in 1973 they had become a folk rock band that incorporated bassoons and krumhorns into their sound and were being marketed as ‘medieval rock’.C. Snider, The Strawberry Bricks Guide to Progressive Rock (Lulu.com, 2008), p. 183-4. (Transatlantic Records booklet, 1974); New Spotlight - Ireland's National Music Entertainment Weekly, 7 (10) (30 August 1973), retrieved 29/01/09. The same year saw other experiments that combined early music with rock instruments, including the one-off project Giles Farnaby's Dream Band.P. Stump, Gentle Giant: Acquiring the Taste (SAF Publishing Ltd, 2005), p. 78. Often classified with Gryphon were Gentle Giant whose multi-instrumental members added clavichord, harpsichord, violin and recorder to the mix from their second album Acquiring the Taste (1971), but this was all combined with classical and jazz elements and can be already considered as progressive rock.W. Martin, Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978 (Open Court Publishing, 1998), p. 220. In 1971, the year that Gryphon and Gentle Giant were founded, medieval music was one of the prevailing fashions in rock music, as evidenced by probably the most successful band of the moment Led Zeppelin in their amalgamation of blues- based rock with recorders and mandolins together with medieval themes on Led Zeppelin IV, most notably on ‘Stairway to Heaven’.R. Yorke, Led Zeppelin, From Early Days to Page and Plant (Virgin, London, 1974, 2nd edn., 2000), p. 149. =Decline and diffusion 1976-80= Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull at London's Hammersmith Odeon, March 1978 The first half of the 1970s was a short-lived peak in popularity for medieval folk rock. Gryphon enjoyed some mainstream success when they played the National theatre and Old Vic and supported Yes on tour. However, with line-up changes from about 1975 they began to drop their distinctive medieval sound and became increasingly a mainstream progressive rock band, before they dissolved in 1977. Similarly despite retaining elements of medieval music, bands like Gentle Giant rapidly moved off into further experimentation and were soon being classified under the more general category of progressive rock. The only places where medieval folk rock was growing in the late 1970s were France and the Netherlands. In France, particularly from Brittany, there were bands like Ripaille, formed for a highly regarded eponymous album in 1977, and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock in 1979. In the same period the most enduring French folk rock band Tri Yann also moved into medieval territory. There were also a handful of bands in other European counties, including Thomas Flinter from the Netherlands from 1978-80.D. E. Asbjørnsen, Scented Gardens Of The Mind retrieved 29 January 2009. However, although starting later most of these groups had disbanded or moved on at the start of the 1980s. If surviving medieval folk rock bands shifted towards more mainstream progressive rock, progressive rock bands often included early music among their influences. Despite emerging from the British blues boom, the vocal style of Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull was often compared with a medieval troubadour, while the signature sound of his flute, later combined with the keyboard and stringed instrumental skills of the band, lent itself to a medieval element of the music. This emerged most clearly with the album Minstrel in the Gallery (1975) and later in the folk inspired Songs from the Wood (1977). Medieval images and sounds are so prominent in the band's career that they have occasionally been classified as 'medieval progressive rock'.P. Dodd, Book of Rock: From 1950s to Today (Pavilion, 2005), p. 230. Yes took occasional flights into medievalism, perhaps because of their highly talented keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who in 1975 produced the rock opera album The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.W. Martin, Music of Yes: Structure and Vision in Progressive Rock (Open Court, 1996), p. 78; E. Sherr Sklar, D. L. Hoffman, and A. Lupack, King Arthur in Popular Culture (McFarland, 2002), p. 151. It is argued that progressive rock obtained its distinctive sound of modal harmony from medieval music.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 52. It was probably through progressive rock that early music influences found their way into early heavy metal, for example in the modal keys employed by Black Sabbath from 1970 and in the Renaissance inspired songs of bands like the Ritchie Blackmore founded Rainbow from 1974.J. E. Perone, Music of the Counterculture Era (Greenwood, 2004), p. 27; R. Walser, Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music (Wesleyan University Press, 1993), pp. 46-8. However, early music was only one of a range of influences on these bands, including classical, jazz and world music, from which progressive groups selected and adapted. As the popularity of progressive rock declined in the face of punk rock, new wave and electronic rock in the second half of the 1970s, early music tended to disappear as a major musical influence in rock, and while medieval and fantasy themes remained a feature of developing genre of heavy metal, there was little conscious attempt to replicate early music. =Renaissance: 1980s to the present= Blackmore's Night performing in Heidelberg 2002 Medieval folk rock virtually disappeared in the early 1980s. Some rock performers did continue to produce medieval style music, particularly groups emerging from the German electronic Kosmische movement, including Estampie, who from 1985 sang lyrics in medieval German and Latin, and members of which went on to found Qntal in 1991. Neither of these bands used guitars and both avoided the 'medieval rock' label.Steve Winick, 'Estampie and Qntal, medieval rock (not)', Dirty Linen, 134 (February/March 2008), retrieved 28/01/09. They are often associated with the neo-Medieval music of Dark Wave goth subculture that flourished in the 1980s, producing acts including the Australian duo Dead Can Dance and from America Faith and the Muse. This genre is extremely difficult to classify, but is usually characterised by reliance on electronic music and (particularly female) voices mixed with medieval acoustic instruments.J. Kaplan and H. Lööw, The Cultic Milieu: Oppositional Subcultures in an Age of Globalization (Rowman Altamira, 2002), pp. 140-7. Important in the revival of hybrid genres of early music was the rise of interest in medievalism in general and medieval re- enactment, medieval markets and renaissance fairs in particular, from the late 1980s in Germany and America.M. C. C. Adams, Echoes of War: A Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture (University Press of Kentucky, 2002), p. 2. This period saw the creation of a number of acoustic medieval folk bands, particularly in Germany, many of which played markets and fairs. These included Corvus Corax, from 1989, In Extremo from 1995, Schandmaul from 1998, Saltatio Mortis from 2000, and Faun from 2002. There are still a vibrant medieval folk rock scene on German medieval festivals, and bands like Schandmaul and Faun have gained popularity beyond the medieval scene. Corvus Corax began the metal side project Tanzwut from 1996 and from 1998 In Extremo moved from acoustic to a heavy metal sound. Together with hard rock and heavy metal outfit Subway to Sally (founded in 1992), who shifted from folk towards German medieval music in 1995, these bands are usually seen as the founders of the German Medieval metal subgenre.'Modern Minstrels: Medieval Rock on the Rise', Goethe Institut, retrieved 30 January 2009. While these bands moved off into heavy metal music, in roughly the same period a number of performers emerged who mixed early music and acoustic instruments with soft or hard rock, relying heavily on the network of medieval markets and renaissance fairs. Ritchie Blackmore, having dropped musical clues to his interest in early music throughout his career, took the surprising step of forming the renaissance focused rock band Blackmore's Night with vocalist Candice Night in 1997. Blackmore is usually careful to describe his music as ‘renaissance rock’, which is more accurate as a description of the source of his inspiration, but also distinguishes it from other forms of medieval based music.Blackmore's Night, official website, , retrieved 29 January 2009. Other performers who produce medieval electric music include the California-based Avalon Rising and Circulus from England, both of which describe their music, among other things, as medieval folk rock.D. Simpson, ‘Boogie knights’, Guardian, 29 June 2006, retrieved 22 January 2009. There was a revival of medieval folk rock of sorts in England in the late 1980s. Shave the Monkey from 1988 managed to use British and European folk festivals to support a career that continued until 2003.Shave the Monkey, Official website, retrieved 29 January 2009.

And so the wheel goes round', Folk Words, (March 21, 2008), retrieved 30 January 2009. More recently there have been indications of a return to an interest in medieval folk rock among established folk rock musicians. Since 1986 Maddy Prior, formerly of Steeleye Span, has toured and recorded with the acoustic early music group The Carnival Band.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 202. Guitarist Richard Thompson joined recorder player Philip Pickett for an album of early music mixed with rock, The Bones of All Men (1998), and has toured with his show 1000 Years of Popular Music (2003) which included thirteenth-century rounds and baroque versions of modern pop songs.Richard Thompson', Living Scotsman, retrieved 30 January 2009. In 2018 performance poet and multi-instrumentalist Attila the Stockbroker launched his band Barnstormer 1649, combining early music and punk using many period instruments alongside a punk rock backline. They released an album 'Restoration Tragedy' in September 2018 and are currently active and touring.

The game is set in the era of classical Greece in an archipelago, with players being made ruler of a small town, which they must expand and lead. Ikariam has received generally positive reviews.  Gameplay  Ikariam has been compared to the Civilization series created by Sid Meier and to the Travian series. The aim of the game is to expand the town which is controlled by the player, to gather resources and conquer or placate other players. The game can be played for short periods of time; building and researching takes place in real time so the player can return later and assign the town's inhabitants new tasks. The town's inhabitants pay taxes to the player or can be sent to gather resources instead. The game world is split into islands, each of which can support up to 16 (or up to 17 if the player purchases ambrosia) players and their towns. Each island has its own saw mill for producing wood and one of the other buildings which produces a luxury resource. There are five main types of resources: Wood, Wine, Marble, Crystal Glass and Sulphur. They are available from the Sawmill, Vineyard, Quarry, Crystal Mine and Sulphur Pit respectively. All these resources are required to progress in the game, making resource acquisition through conquest or trading mandatory. Each island's inhabitants may cooperate and donate building materials to improve the efficiency of their island's resource gathering facilities, which enables all local players to obtain resources more quickly. Failure to do so may result in hostilities between island inhabitants. Players can communicate with island mates by using the agora, a message board found on every island that can only be viewed by people with towns on that island. With resources the player may construct buildings such as barracks, shipyards and academies. Citizens of the town can then be trained as soldiers, sent to research new technologies, or perform other tasks, which they are paid tax money for undertaking. Citizens must be kept happy to prevent them from leaving the town. The satisfaction of the people is determined by a number of factors. The player can build a tavern that increases happiness in the town by 12 per tavern level. The player can also serve wine in the tavern. This increases happiness by 60 however consumes wine on an hourly basis. In addition, the player can build a museum after researching cultural exchange. Happiness in the town is increased by 20 for each level of the museum. Also, for each level of the museum the player may sign one additional cultural assets treaty with another player. This increases the happiness in town by 50. The player may have no more than one cultural assets treaty with a player. Cultural goods can be moved from one town to another at any time. Happiness can also be improved with certain research and governments. The game also provides four advisors to guide the player throughout the game; they are shown in the top right of the screen. From left to right the names are: Towns, Military, Research and Diplomacy. The towns adviser provides the players with updates on the player's empire. In addition, the town adviser lets the player manage trade routes, a paid feature that allows the player to ship resources from one of the player's towns to another town regularly. The military adviser allows the player to see all the fleets that the player has on the seas and cancel actions these fleets are conducting. The player can also view combat reports that provide overviews of past and ongoing land and naval battles here. The research adviser lets the player conduct research if the player has enough research points. Research is needed to progress in the game. This adviser also show the player how many research points are currently available, how many scientists are currently working in academies, how many research points are produced hourly, and how long it will be until the player can research certain technologies. The diplomatic adviser lets the player read and reply to messages the player has received from other players, send messages to players in the player's alliance, view treaties the player has signed, see which agoras on the player's islands have unread posts, and access agoras.  Business model  Ikariam is nominally free-to-play but players may opt to purchase in-game advantages via a Microtransaction system. This will give them access to a sixth resource, which can be used for Ikariam Plus, the premium version of Ikariam. The game was pre-released in June 2006, as a minimal 2D graphic game. Players used slash (/) commands to play the game.  Alliances  On building an Embassy, one can join or found an alliance. Alliances are groups of players who work together. They will usually protect each other. If an alliance member is attacked by another player, the whole alliance, or stronger members in the alliance will intervene and will ward off the attacker. If you are the leader of the alliance, how many members you can have in your alliance depends on your embassy level. Also, you get a small amount of \\"bonus\\" resources each day, depending on the number of people in your alliance. An alliance has three jobs that can be assigned by the leader: the Diplomat, the General and the Home Secretary. The diplomat is responsible for making treaties, answering messages sent to the alliance, and editing the external alliance page which is viewable by all players. The General is responsible for overlooking all alliance members military movements, and has the ability to call off any attacks being made by alliance members. The Home Secretary is responsible for editing ranks within the alliance and editing the internal alliance page which is viewed only by the alliance members. Alliances frequently draw together people from all over the world who have similar interests and have been described as a game play element not found in other web browser games.  Worlds  Several different game servers are available.http://en.ikariam.com/ Each of these servers represents a different game \\"world\\" with its own population of players and its own map of thousands of islands. Currently the English-language version of this game has nineteen servers, each given a Greek letter designation from Alpha to Omega and more recently Apollon, a reference to the Greek god Apollo. Older worlds such as Alpha and Beta tend to have higher-ranked players and more economic and military stability. Newer worlds represent more of a frontier experience with free-flowing alliances and warfare. One of the attractions of the game is for an experienced player on an older world to create a new account on a brand-new world in an effort to rise to the very top (frequently impossible in older worlds who have players that have been active for many years). Due to the nature of the game it is quite feasible to manage accounts on several worlds/servers.

He was born in Athens and spent his childhood in Darmstadt. From 1908 to 1913 he studied in Munich with Friedrich Klose, Felix Mottl and Rudolf Louis. In addition to music he wrote lyric and dramatic poetry and was on the fringes of the circle around Stefan George. Petersen was an apprentice conductor in Lübeck under Wilhelm Furtwängler in 1913-14; at the end of the First World War he was active as a writer in the Expressionist movement in Munich but from 1919 devoted himself entirely to music. His early music is described as radically Expressionistic, but in the 1920s he progressively clarified his style, arriving at a monumental tonal style typified by his Grosse Messe, op. 27 of 1928-9, premiered in 1930 in Dartmstadt under Karl Böhm. From 1927 he was a lecturer in the Music Academy at Darmstadt, and in 1934 became professor of music in Mannheim. He died in Darmstadt. Petersen's works include five symphonies, concertos, works for string orchestra, choral and chamber music, and the opera Der goldene Topf, premiered in Mannheim in 1941.

These coaches were first built in the 1930s and continued to be produced until the 1950s. Today all coaches of this type have been retired. A number still run on museum railways.  General  Eilzüge first ran in Germany in 1907. These were express trains (Schnellzüge), that did not switch to hauling the new through coaches, but stayed with the conventional, eight- wheeled compartment coaches common at that time. Not until the end of the 1920s did the Deutsche Reichsbahn consider developing special wagons as eight- wheeled open coaches for the semi-fast train class.  Coaches = Type E 30 = Following the construction of trials coaches in 1928 and 1929, the full production of 150 Eilzugwagen began in 1930; 2nd and 2nd/3rd class variants being turned out. The full designation of these coaches was B4i-30 (later Ayse 604) and BC4i-30 (later Abyse 617). Other, 3rd class only, coaches entered service as C4i-30 (later Bye 655). They were classified as Type (Verwendungsgruppe) E 30. These coaches were of rivetted construction in accordance with the standards of the time. They had an open 3rd class section with a centre aisle and 2+3 seating arrangement, and four 2nd class compartments each with six seats. As on express coaches, the entrances were inset, but the roof was of basket arch design at the coach ends, as on the Class 28 Rheingold Express coaches. The entrances at the ends of each coach had double doors for 3rd class and a single swing door for 2nd class. By each of the entrance ways was a toilet with a wash basin. The windows were 800 mm wide in 3rd class and one metre wide in 2nd class. The coaches had Görlitz Type II (light) bogies. The gangways were open and only secured with folding lattice gates (Scherengitter), so there was no protection from the elements. = Type E 36 = In 1935 development started on a successor to the E 30. The main difference was the welded coach body. In addition an extra half- compartment was added because the coach, at 20 m long, had more space than its predecessor. To enable a better view the bottom edge of the windows was lowered and the panes enlarged. Other features, like the open gangways and Görlitz bogies, were identical to those of the E 30. Only C4i-36 and BC4i-37 coach variants were placed in service because, unlike its predecessor, the E 30, no more pure 2nd class coaches were ordered. Later these coaches were reclassified as Bye 667 and Abyse 630 by the DB. = Type E 42 = From the Schürzenwagen series of coaches, a semi-fast, Eilzug, variant was developed. In important details it was the same as the previous class, the E 36. However the coach body was now streamlined (by tapering the ends) and had panels or 'skirts' covering the sole bars. These even covered the new Reichsbahn- standard bogies which were very similar to the Minden-Deutz bogies later used by the DB. For the first time in the Deutsche Reichsbahn, Eilzugwagen were given gangways protected by folding bellows (Faltenbalge). As a result, they could be used, if need be, in express trains because from now on passengers could pass from one coach to another. Nevertheless, the open layout was retained, as on the E 30 and E 36 coaches - as were the inset double doors at the ends of the coaches of what was now the 2nd class section. The 1st class section just had a simple swing door at the end of the coach. However the half-compartment in the centre of the wagon was omitted. Two prototypes with 2nd and 3rd class seating were delivered by LHW to the Reichsbahn at Breslau in 1939: the BC4üp-39 (later the AByse 631) built to a very light structural design. This meant that they were particularly suitable for use on hilly routes. The interior of the 3rd class area was--as was de rigueur at that time --fitted with wooden seats; 2nd class sections were given soft, fabric-covered seats. In all, according to plans at that time, 8,550 coaches of this type were to be bought in order to finally get rid of the old, eight-wheeled, compartment coaches. 650 were to be built as ABüp, the rest as C4üp. To achieve this, head office drew up a four-year plan. However, due to the shortage of raw materials during the Second World War, only 125 composite (AB) coaches were ordered, of which by 1944 only 45 could be delivered: the BC4üp-42a (later Abyse 633). 17 units ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB). Of the 3rd class coaches, the C4üp-42a, 100 units were delivered. The 40 that were left to the DB were later classed as Bye 669. Another 250 Eilzügwagen of type C4üp-43a were delivered, but they were used as ambulance coaches until the end of the war. These were later classified as Bye 670 where they ended up in the DB fleet. Before their interior could be fitted out, several of these coaches were used as so-called Stehwagen (static coaches) until the founding of the Bundesbahn. = Modernisation = When the passenger classes were restructured in 1956, BC coaches became ABs and C coaches became Bs. In 2nd class the same soft seats were fitted as in the E-30 and E-36 types. Coaches left behind in Austria after the war were, like all pre-war Reichsbahn coaches, upgraded and modernised during the 1960s with UIC sliding windows and new cushioned seats. From 1955 to 1960 all pre-war Eilzugwagen in the DB were refurbished and modernised. Instead of wooden seats, they were fitted with cushioned seats with imitation leather covers and the seats were arranged in a 2+2 configuration. The light bulbs were largely replaced by fluorescent strip lights. The coaches so converted were eventually classed as Ayse, AByse and Bye with code numbers in the 600 series. Almost all these semi-fast coaches were used until the 1970s in their designated role; only then did many end up on local passenger services. Whilst the DB coaches remained in service until 1984, those left in the DR were rebuilt in the 1960s, like the other DR Schürzenwagen, into the so-called 'modernised coaches' (Modernisierungswagen).  Städtewagen / yl coaches = Classes = From 1951 the DB acquired new coaches for semi-fast services called Städtewagen or city coaches. These were the first coaches in the DB to be built to the new UIC template for X class coaches and had a standard length of 26.4 m. These coaches had, in addition to the end doors, a double door in the middle. The doors were of the swing door type. Like the UIC express coaches they were of welded, all-steel construction and were equipped with the rubber corridor connectors commonly used today. Minden-Deutz bogies were fitted. On these coaches the 2nd class (1st class after the 1956 reform) areas were open plan. By the entrance ways at each end of the coach was a toilet. The coaches were fitted for both steam and electric heating and were rated at up to 120 km/h. The following variants were procured: C4ymg-51 (later Bylb 421), BC4yg (later ABylb 411), CPwymg-51, a large number of which were fitted with driver's cabs for push-pull operations and designated as CPwygmf (later BDylbf 456). The driver's cab end of the coach had an inset entrance located one compartment-length from the end to make room for the cab. These coaches were joined by four luggage/buffet cars of class CRrymg-54 (later BRyl 446) and prototypes of 1st class open coaches, the Aymg-52, later reclassified as Ayl 401. The code letter b was only given to coaches with control wiring, their classification until 1975 being …ym(b). = Employment = Following their delivery the new coaches were initially used in light express trains. Only after the 1956 class reform, when 3rd class was upgraded to 2nd class and 2nd to 1st were the Städtewagen placed in their intended role. In their early years, the driving cars had been used with six-wheeled Umbauwagen (rebuild coaches) on suburban services in conurbations like Hamburg. Later on, with the delivery of new Silberling local train coaches from 1959, the driving car was used with those as well. In the 1980s the control equipment on all these coaches was removed. In the 1970s and 80s the Städtewagen were also used in conventional local passenger trains, especially from 1982 on the conversion of many district Eilzüge to supplement-free express trains and on the retirement of pre-war coaches. The last yl coaches were retired from the DB in 1990, because they wanted to avoid having to fit them for central locking which would have been expensive. Several coaches have ended up, however, via a third party in the DR and were employed in Berlin suburban services including Berlin-Lichtenberg to Nauen and Falkensee. After their retirement, several yl coaches were used as centre cars in testing the new InterCityExpress driving cars.  Preserved  Many pre-war and post-war semi-fast coaches have been preserved. For example, the Ulm Railway Society at Ettlingen runs several pre- war Eilzugwagen. Others belong to the Traditions-Eilzug Zwickau. Several post- war Eilzug coaches, including a driving car, also still exist. The BSW Lübeck looks after two coaches belonging to the Nuremberg Transport Museum. Several yl coaches are also operational with the Bavarian Railway Museum at Nördlingen.  Technical data for yl coaches  * Length over buffers: 26.40 m. * Width of coach body: 2,82 m. * Overall height: 4.05 m. * Bogie pivot pitch: 19.00 m. * Bogie wheelbase: 2.50 m. * Total weight: 35 to 39 t. * Bogie type: Minden-Deutz. * Top speed: 120 km/h. * Heating: electrical and steam.

It is located at the east side of the island, south of the city of Famagusta. The population of the village is 5,758 (October 2011 census) and it consists of a municipality since 1994. The current mayor is Andros Karayiannis. Since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, around 75% of the village terrain is in Northern Cyprus. The village is 12 kilometers from the famous resort of Ayia Napa. The \\"Ghost Town\\" of Varosha can be clearly viewed from the roof of the Cultural Centre, as can the craters from shells fired during the invasion in the field opposite. The village has agricultural land around it, and is one of the \\"Kokkinochoria\\" (red villages) so called from the red soil. Potatoes are widely grown but Deryneia is famous for its strawberries and holds a biennial strawberry festival at the football ground of Anagennisi Deryneia on the Dherynia to Sotira road.  Historical Background  According to data and information available, Dherynia is in this position for about 700 years. But it turns out the archaeological sites and monuments in the occupied area and the buffer zone that the history of Dheryneia is much greater. Virgin Mary Nativity Church built in 15th or 16th centuries We do not know exactly why the area was named \\"Dherynia\\". Simos Menardos and Mr J. Goodwin in his book,«An historical toponymy of Cyprus»Third Edition 1978 page 264 argue that settlers settled here, perhaps after the Trojan War, the ancient city that was Gerineia near Pylos, Peloponnese and was the capital of the Kingdom of the famous and prudent King Nestor, which Homer calls GERINION it came from Gerinia. The above, embraces and Nearchus Clerides in his book,\\"Villages States and Cyprus.\\" Another version is that the name came from the name of an English or Frankish general who once camped in the \\"mountains\\" of Dheryneia. The above and other aspects included in the study Deryneioti composer - Mr. Adamou researcher Katsantoni issued in 1991. What today we can consider as evidence to support his claim to the name of Deryneia is that between the southeast and Deryneia and beach is located on ancient village called Therimeio or Therineio. Later became \\"Drynio\\", \\"Dryneia\\" and finally \\"Dherynia.  Current form  Embracing the bay of Famagusta on the east coast of Cyprus, next to the historic and cosmopolitan city of Evagoras, near the famous Famagusta, is the beautiful and near the sea, Dherynia. It is only 5 kilometers from Famagusta and 2 km from the sea with the golden sand. The mesh of Attila in 1974 has a result that the 70% of the municipality is occupied and all residents have lost their property. The population of the municipality is approximately 7,500 people. This figure includes the 1,000 refugees living in a refugee settlement in Deryneia and excludes 3,000 refugees inhabitants of occupied \\"Kato\\", or \\"Down Deryneia\\" where refugees scattered throughout Cyprus and abroad. Although the consequences of the Turkish invasion hindered the progress and development of the area both economically as commercially and in tourism area, however due to the progressiveness and industriousness of its inhabitants and the efforts of individual Local Authorities and organized the municipality became possible to develop Dherynia in a great level . Residents of the City are farmers or are employed in the tourism industry of Agia Napa and Protaras, trade, processing and crafts. The farmers involved in the cultivation of early vegetables and especially the cultivation of strawberries. Deryneia traditionally holds the first position in strawberry production and covers 60% of a national production. In fact it is given great importance and every 2 years, in mid- May, and organised with great success, the Pancyprian Festival Strawberry which attracts thousands of visitors, both locals and foreigners. In the field of culture Dherynia has created and maintains a long tradition. Ranks among the first communities founded dance, theater and music groups. Also in the field of sport, Dherynia boasts great successes. The Athletic Association \\"Anagennisi (Renaissance)\\" founded in 1920 ranks among the historic clubs in Cyprus, maintains football and volleyball teams for men and women. The National Association \\"Christodoulou Dimitrakis' has a futsal team in first division. The Dherynia athletes has made a national and worldwide with great success in athletics and shooting. The offer of Deryneia is also strong in the National Games.

Deryneia has several monuments, landmarks and points of reference, such as Byzantine churches, Folklore Museum, Monuments Heroes, Outdoor Amphitheatre, Sports Centre, City Park, City Hall, the Cultural Centre of Occupied Famagusta. Despite the difficulties with the occupation and semi-occupation of Deryneia, progress and growth led to the upgrading of local government. From Improvement Board which functioned until January 6, 1994 upgraded to municipality after a referendum held on June 6, 1993 and percentage 74.70% of residents voted to upgrade the Community Council. Strawberry Festival Deryneia is directly connected with the cultivation of strawberries after the first strawberry plantations on commercial basis in Cyprus cultured in Derynia of the pioneer farmer m.Mitsio Giannoukou 55 years ago. Today despite the occupation and the loss of 70% of the region following the tragic events of 1974, Deryneia is still by far the first in the cultivation and production of strawberries in Cyprus, both in quantity and in quality. The Pancyprian Strawberry Festival was organized by the Municipality in 1999 and is presented every 2 years. This Festival is about showcasing the innovative culture of the strawberry and the distribution of the product and by-products in conjunction with the presentation of quality cultural and artistic programmes.

Contrary to a number of erroneous comments in the media, Freefall was not the final novel in the Tunnels series, and the fourth book, Closer, was published by Chicken House in the UK on 3 May 2010. Freefall picks up the story where the second book left off, and describes the events after Will Burrows, Chester Rawls, Elliott, and Bartleby have plummeted down a huge opening in the Deeps, finding themselves at an even greater depth in the Earth. As the story unfolds, Will and his father, Dr. Burrows, discover a way back to Topsoil and return to Highfield, a new character, Martha, is introduced, and there are two major confrontations with the Rebecca twins, the main antagonists of the series. Plot summary Closer, Further (Part 1) The opening chapter describes how Chester Rawls is the first to regain consciousness on a fungal shelf deep down in the Pore where he, Will Burrows, Elliott and Bartleby have crash landed. After Will has located his brother’s dead body and given him a burial of sorts, he and Chester carry the injured Elliott with them as they set about exploring this alien and frightening world. The task of moving through the passages with the burden of Elliott and their equipment is made easier thanks to the reduced gravity at this depth in the Earth. With the help of Bartleby’s tracking ability, they discover that there is someone else down there with them, but are attacked by giant carnivorous creatures called spider-monkeys. They are saved by the intervention of a new character called Martha. She takes them to where she lives, a shack evidently built by the survivors of a galleon which was sucked down another of the giant holes like the Pore, so she can tend to Elliott and protect the two boys. Meanwhile, the Rebecca twins, who were pushed into the Pore by Sarah Jerome in her last dying act, are aware that Will is alive, and begin to plot against him with two Styx Special Forces soldiers, called Limiters. One of the Rebeccas and a Limiter approach Will's father, Dr. Burrows, and attempt to bully him into finding them a way out of the Pore. Dr. Burrows seems to have very little comprehension that the Styx are dangerous and capable of great cruelty and murder. Martha's Shack (Part 2) At Martha’s shack, Elliott’s condition deteriorates as she catches a voracious fever, and Martha warns Will and Chester that her son died after the same thing happened when he injured himself on an expedition two years previously. Much to Will’s surprise, the other Rebecca twin turns up alone at the shack, and her life is only spared after Will stops Chester and Martha from killing her. The twin claims that she is innocent and has had to go along with her sister’s evil plans. Will appears to give her the benefit of the doubt, but Chester and Martha are highly skeptical. Will is further won over by the Rebecca twin as she gives him two phials, which purportedly contain the Dominion virus and its antidote. Elliott’s condition worsens, and Will and Chester discover that Martha has been less than honest with them, and that there may be a source of modern medicines to help the girl. Although Martha is reluctant for them to risk the long journey, she eventually leads them to a \\"metal ship\\" which her son had stumbled across. The Metal Ship (Part 3) When they get there, it turns out that the metal ship is actually a modern Russian nuclear submarine, and they are forced to shelter inside it while Elliott responds to the antibiotics. There is also the added risk that they may be attacked by \\"Brights\\", giant moth like flying creatures. As they finally set off from the submarine, the second Rebecca twin makes her appearance with Dr. Burrows and the two Limiters. Will realizes the twin who surrendered to him has been lying all the time, as she orders Bartleby to attack him – the Hunter has been conditioned to follow her orders after being Darklit in the Colony. One of the Limiters is killed by a \\"Bright\\", but the Rebeccas still have an edge. Just when it appears as if all is lost, Elliott reveals that she is half Styx, and saves the day by priming one of the explosives from her rucksack. In the subsequent explosion, Will and his father are separated from Chester, Elliott, Martha and Bartleby, while the Rebecca twins and the surviving Limiter seek refuge in the Russian submarine, which is knocked down the giant hole it was in by the explosion. The Underground Harbour (Part 4) Separated from his friends and not knowing whether they are alive or not, Will is persuaded by his father to travel upwards, and they stumble upon an underground harbour, a deep-level fallout shelter from the Cold War. After Will has helped himself to various weapons from the armoury in the shelter, they manage to get an outboard engine to work, and attach it to a launch. Then they travel up a subterranean river linking the fallout shelter to the surface, and emerge in Norfolk, from where they make their way back to Highfield, and are reunited with Drake. Highfield, Again (Part 5) Mrs. Burrows, Will’s stepmother, has gone through a transformation after she manages to beat her TV addiction, and has returned to Highfield where she is kept under close surveillance by the Styx and their agents. At Dr. Burrows’ insistence, Drake takes him to meet his wife, so revealing to the Styx that Dr. Burrows and Will are back Topsoil. Then there follows a parting of the ways as Mrs. Burrows remains on the surface with Drake, who has asked Will to return into the Earth and make sure that the risk of the Dominion virus has been neutralised. Departure (Part 6) Drake, with help from a squad of former SAS soldiers, devises a plan to trap one of the leading Styx, the \\"old Styx\\", using Mrs. Burrows as bait. But the mission fails and Mrs. Burrows is captured and taken to the Colony where she is Darklit (being casted by Styx by the Dark Light). Meanwhile, Will is accompanied by his father as they retrace their route to where the submarine was blasted from the ledge in the giant hole Will has named \\"Smoking Jean\\", and he is reunited with Chester, Martha, and a fully recovered Elliott. Dr. Burrows, in a literal leap of faith, throws himself into the pore, followed by his son, and eventually by Elliott and Bartleby. Dr. Burrows’ assumption that the gravity further down the pore is progressively lower is proved to be correct, and after locating the submarine, they search for any surviving Styx. Dr. Burrows, driven by his conviction that there is a world at the centre of the Earth, risks all their lives as he makes sure that they have no option but to continue towards it. They finally make it through to the \\"Garden of the Second Sun\\" - a hidden world at the center of the Earth, complete with its own sun, mountains, oceans, and animals long since extinct on the surface. Assisted by Will, Dr. Burrows begins to investigate one of three Mayan-type pyramids they find there, and it seems as though they are finally safe from the Styx until Elliott spots some footprints. She, Will and Bartleby follow the trail and discover that the Rebecca twins and a Limiter have also made it through to the hidden world. After Elliott sets an ambush to deal with the Styx for once and for all, Will disobeys her and sneaks in to retrieve the Dominion phials. He is discovered by one of the Rebecca twins, and in the firefight and explosion which follow, both the Rebecca twins and Limiter perish, while Will makes off with the phials. Far from being angry at his disobedience, Will’s reward is a kiss on the cheek from Elliott. It seems as though Will’s prayers have been answered as he embarks upon his new life in this idyllic world, with Elliott as his companion and working with his father to discover incredible secrets from the past, until one day Dr. Burrows spots a WW2 German bomber, a Stuka, in the sky.

Development  The P-30 was developed by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering (VNIIRT) as an early warning ground control and interception radar for the Soviet Air Defence Forces, airforce and navy of the Soviet Union. Crystal was a development of an earlier radar design, the P-20 radar with which it shares many similarities. The radar was developed under the direction of chief designer V. Samarin and by 1955 the radar had completed state trials and was accepted into service. In 1958 the P-30 was upgraded to provide a 10-15% improvement in the detection range as well as improvements to the systems reliability, the modernised variant entered service in 1959 after completion of state trials. The P-30 has now been superseded by its successors, the P-35 and P-37 radar.  Description  The P-30 is a semi-mobile radar consisting of a trailer mounting the control cabin and transmitter equipment, two Zil trucks carrying the power supply equipment and antenna trailers. The antenna system of the P-30 is composed of two open frame truncated parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception. Both antenna are fed by a stacked beam composed of six feed horns. The radar uses two antenna to determine target altitude by the V-beam system with azimuth scanned mechanically. The upper antenna is tilted to an angle of 25 degrees from horizontal which results in each target appearing twice on the indicator, the distance between the two allows the targets altitude to be approximately estimated by the operator. The left hand side of the lower antenna carried the antenna array of the NRS-20 IFF secondary radar, which was used to identify detected aircraft as friend or foe.  Operators  The P-30 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1955 and though they have since become obsolete, they were passed down to successor states after the fall of the Soviet Union. The radar has been exported and continues to serve in some areas around the world.

Both countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1992. Ethiopia has an embassy in Tel Aviv; the ambassador is also accredited to the Holy See, Greece and Cyprus. Israel has an embassy in Addis Ababa; the ambassador is also accredited to Rwanda and Burundi. Israel has been one of Ethiopia's most reliable suppliers of military assistance, supporting different Ethiopian governments during the Eritrean War of Independence. In 2012, an Ethiopian- born Israeli, Belaynesh Zevadia, was appointed Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia.Foreign Ministry names first Israeli of Ethiopian origin as ambassador History=Royal Era= Ethiopian consulate in Jerusalem During the imperial era, Israeli advisers trained paratroops and counterinsurgency units belonging to the Fifth Division (also called the Nebelbal, 'Flame', Division).Ethiopia-Israel In December 1960, a section of the Ethiopian army attempted a coup whilst the Emperor Haile Sellassie I was on a state visit in Brazil. Israel intervened, so that the Emperor could communicate directly with General Abbiye. General Abbiye and his troops remained loyal to the Emperor, and the rebellion was crushed.Pateman, Roy. Eritrea: even the stones are burning. Lawrenceville, NJ [u.a.]: Red Sea Press, 1998. pp. 96–97 Empress Menen Asfaw visiting Israel, 1959 In the early 1960s, Israel started helping the Ethiopian government in its campaigns against the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The Ethiopian government portrayed the Eritrean rebellion as an Arab threat to the African region, an argument that convinced the Israelis to side with the Ethiopian government in the conflict.Iyob, Ruth. The Eritrean Struggle for Independence: Domination, Resistance, Nationalism, 1941–1993. African studies series, 82. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. p. 108 Israel trained counter-insurgency forces and the Governor General of Eritrea, Asrate Medhin Kassa, had an Israeli Military Attaché as his advisor. An Israeli colonel was put in charge of a military training school at Decamare and the training of the Ethiopian Marine Commando Forces. By 1966, there were around 100 Israeli military advisors in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian–Israeli cooperation had impacts on the discourse of the Eritrean rebel movements, which increasingly began to use anti-Zionist rhetoric. It also enabled the Eritreans to mobilize material support from the Arab and Islamic world. The Israeli perception of the war in Eritrea as part of the Arab–Israeli conflict was reinforced when reports of links between the ELF and Palestine Liberation Organization emerged after the Six-Day War.Lefebvre, Jeffrey Alan. Arms for the Horn: U.S. Security Policy in Ethiopia and Somalia, 1953–1991. Pitt series in policy and institutional studies. Pittsburgh, Pa: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1991. p.

The Ethiopian State at the Crossroads: Decolonisation and Democratisation or Disintegration? Lawrenceville, N.J. [u.a.]: Red Sea, 1999. pp. 95–96 Ethiopian Church in Jerusalem In 1969 the Israeli government had proposed the formation of an anti-Pan-Arab alliance consisting of the United States, Israel, Ethiopia, Iran and Turkey. Ethiopia rejected the proposal. In 1971, the Israeli Chief of Staff Bar Lev made a visit to Ethiopia, during which he presented proposals for deepening of Israeli-Ethiopian cooperation. The Ethiopians turned down the Israeli proposals but nevertheless, Ethiopia became internationally accused of having given concessions to Israel for setting up Israeli military bases on Ethiopian islands in the Red Sea. Ethiopia consistently denied all such accusations. Israel offered Ethiopia military assistance in the event of a Yemeni take-over of the islands, but Ethiopia turned down the offer fearing a political backlash. Still, Ethiopia was attacked at the 1973 OAU summit in Addis Abeba by the Libyan delegation, accusing Ethiopia of allowing the build-up of Israeli bases on its territory. At the summit the Algerian president Houari Boumediène called on Ethiopia to break its relations with Israel. In return, Boumediène offered to use his political leverage to freeze Arab support for the ELF.Spencer, John H. Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years.

The Benghazi meeting condemned Ethiopian-Israeli cooperation, and pledged support for the ELF.Situation in the Horn; HIM's Visit Ethiopian Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold began seeking political support for breaking relations with Israel after the OAU summit. After long discussions, the cabinet voted to sever diplomatic links with Israel. The decision was however censored by a veto from the Emperor. At the time of the October 1973 war, many African states severed their relations with Israel. This, and Arab threats of a crippling oil embargo,Getachew Metaferia, Ethiopia and the United States: History, Diplomacy, and Analysis p. 72. put pressure on the Emperor to withdraw his veto, and on October 23, 1973 Ethiopia severed its diplomatic relations with Israel. The break of relations with Israel caused the United States to tone down its support to Imperial rule in Ethiopia. =Mengistu rule= Even after Ethiopia broke diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973, Israeli military aid continued after the Derg military junta came to power and included spare parts and ammunition for U.S.-made weapons and service for U.S.-made F-5 jet fighters. Israel also maintained a small group of military advisers in Addis Ababa. In 1978, however, when the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Dayan admitted that Israel had been providing security assistance to Ethiopia, Mengistu Haile Mariam expelled all Israelis so that he might preserve his relationship with radical Arab states such as Libya and South Yemen. Although respectively Addis Ababa claimed it had terminated its military relationship with Israel, military cooperation continued. In 1983, for example, Israel provided communications training, and in 1984 Israeli advisers trained the Presidential Guard and Israeli technical personnel served with the police. Some Western observers believed that Israel provided military assistance to Ethiopia in exchange for Mengistu's tacit cooperation during Operation Moses in 1984, in which 10,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were evacuated to Israel.Ethiopian-Israeli accord eases Jewish emigration In 1985 Israel reportedly sold Addis Ababa at least US$20 million in Soviet-made munitions and spare parts captured in Lebanon. According to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), the Mengistu regime received US$83 million worth of Israeli military aid in 1987, and Israel deployed some 300 military advisers to Ethiopia. Additionally, the EPLF claimed that thirty-eight Ethiopian pilots had gone to Israel for training. As Mengistu's allies in the Socialist Bloc went into a state of crisis and division, Ethiopia began to put more emphasis on relations with Israel.Africa - Ethiopia - General Information In 1989 formal diplomatic relations were reinstated.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution, 1974-1987: A Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian Autocracy. LSE monographs in international studies. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. p. 360 In late 1989, Israel reportedly finalized a secret agreement to provide increased military assistance in exchange for Mengistu's promise to allow Ethiopia's remaining Beta Israel to immigrate to Israel. In addition, the two nations agreed to restore diplomatic relations and increase intelligence cooperation. Mengistu apparently believed that Israel, unlike the Soviet Union, whose military advisers emphasized conventional tactics, could provide the training and matériel needed to transform the Ethiopian army into a counterinsurgency force. During 1990 Israeli-Ethiopian relations grew stronger. According to the New York Times, Israel supplied 150,000 rifles, cluster bombs, ten to twenty military advisers to train Mengistu's Presidential Guard, and an unknown number of instructors to work with Ethiopian commando units. Unconfirmed reports also suggested that Israel had provided the Ethiopian Air Force with surveillance cameras and had agreed to train Ethiopian pilots. Commercial relations Trade relations between Ethiopia and Israel have grown over the years. In the early 1980s, Dafron, an Israeli notebook manufacturer, won a government contract to market 2 million notebooks to Ethiopia.Saying goodbye to Israel's beloved notebook, Haaretz Israel imports Ethiopian sesame, coffee, grains, skins and hides, spices, oilseed and natural gum. Ethiopian Jews In return for this aid, Ethiopia permitted the emigration of the Beta Israel. Departures in the spring reached about 500 people a month before Ethiopian officials adopted new emigration procedures that reduced the figure by more than two-thirds. The following year, Jerusalem and Addis Ababa negotiated another agreement whereby Israel provided agricultural, economic, and health assistance. Also, in May 1991, as the Mengistu regime neared its end, Israel paid US$35 million in cash to allow nearly 15,000 Beta Israel to emigrate from Ethiopia to Israel.

During the devastating earthquakes that have hit Peru (1970, 2005, 2007), Israel was the first country to send help. Israel sent the distinguished Israel Defense Forces Unit 669 Search and Rescue unit, along with members of the IDF medical corp which set up a field hospital.http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Mashav+–+International+Development/What+is+Mashav/Israeli+Humanitarian+Relief-+MASHAV+-+the+Israel+F.htm In 2001 Eliane Karp, a former Israeli, became First Lady of Peru. In 2011, former chief of staff of the Peruvian Armed Forces, General Francisco Contreras said, “We definitely need to be concerned with the growing presence of Iran in South America. It appears that Iranian organizations provide support to other terrorist organizations, and that there is cooperation between them. There is something strange in the relationship Chavez has forged with Iran, as is the presence of the Iranian defense minister in Bolivia on a recent visit.” According to Contreras, countries like Israel and Peru need to increase cooperation to combat the growing terrorist threat.Peruvian army vet warns of growing Iranian presence Jerusalem Post Trade and military cooperation Bilateral trade was $37 million in 1997. $31 million coming from Israeli exports to Peru. Israeli exports to Peru rose 71.5% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same period in the previous year. Israeli exports consisted of machinery and plastics. Israel imports food, beverages and tobacco from Peru. Israel's defense ties with Peru go back several decades, and in recent years include the sale of Rafael's Spike anti-tank missile to the Peruvian army, as well as Israeli drones to its air force. In 2009, the government of Peru signed a $9 million deal with Global CST, a defense-consulting firm based in Petah Tikva, run by former IDF general Yisrael Ziv. Peruvian General Contreras said he decided to hire Ziv's company to help train the military how to combat terrorists from the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) Maoist organization. According to Contreras, Ziv's company focused on training elite forces for special counterterror operations, strengthening Peruvian intelligence networks, and assisting security forces in working together to kill or capture Sendero Luminoso members. Contreras said that despite pressure from the US not to hire a private company, the combination of assistance from the US Military and Ziv's company turned the tide in Peru's war on terror, and that \\"The combination brought a major change, and our military became more offensive and took the battle to the terrorists, instead of always being on the defensive.\\" In May 2013, Peru's Minister of Agriculture, Milton von Hesse, held talks with his Israeli counterpart Yair Shamir to strengthen cooperation in agriculture and implement projects. Von Hesse said that Israel has developed a modern agricultural technology to address the problems caused by deserts, and Peru is eager to learn from their experience, and therefore achieve efficient water management in arid areas.

It is located in the former city of Nepean, which was amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001. It was built on the site of the former Borden Dairy Farm. The land was bought by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) in 1959. The Borden farm community was built in 1967-1976 as a joint development of the CMHC and the Ontario Housing Corporation and features single-family homes with parks and bikeways placed behind the houses, instead of on the streets. There was more development in the 1980s and early 1990s. The rough boundaries of the neighbourhood are Merivale Road to the west, Bowhill Avenue to the north, Nepean Creek to the south and Chesteron Drive to the east. According to the 2016 Canada Census, the population for this area was 2,668.Population calculated by combining Dissemination Areas 35060517, 35060518, 35060516, 35060514 and Dissemination Blocks 35060515009, 35060515010, 35060515008, 35060515001, 35060515002, 35060519004 and 35060519003 One of the housing developments found alongside the Borden Farm neighbourhood is Fisher Glen, built in the early 1980s.

The countries have had official relations since June 1954. The Israeli embassy in Bangkok was established in 1958.Israel embassy in Bangkok Since 1996, Thailand has had an embassy in Tel Aviv.Thai embassy in Tel Aviv Thailand and Israel share a close and friendly relationship, and cooperate on many fields. People-to-people relations between the two countries are also good, as thousands of Thais are employed in Israel, and millions of Israelis have visited and continue to visit Thailand. History On 28 December 1972, a four-member commando of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September invaded the Israeli embassy in Bangkok and held the ambassador and several of his guests as hostages. Two Thai government members, Dawee Chullasapya and Chatichai Choonhavan, who was then deputy foreign minister and became prime minister in 1988, along with the Egyptian ambassador to Thailand, Mustapha el Assawy, negotiated the release of the hostages and instead offered themselves and a number of other Thai officials as surety for the terrorists' safe conduct to Cairo. Then-Israeli prime minister Golda Meir praised the Thai government for their diplomacy which made for a bloodless end of the crisis. In January 2004, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn inaugurated a joint Israeli-Thai agro-technology experimental farm for irrigation of high value crops at Khon Kaen University. There is a Thai- Israel Chamber of Commerce, Thai-Israel Friendship Foundation, as well as a small community of Israelis living in Thailand. After the Thai floods of 2011, Israel sent water management experts to Thailand. Princess Chulabhorn Mahidol is involved in advancing scientific cooperation between the two countries. In 2012 the two countries signed a trade agreement. Thailand recognized Palestine in 2012. During 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict the Thai government supported a peaceful solution to the conflict and called on both sides to show restraint. It further stated that it will continue to support both Israel and Palestine, but will not condone terrorist activity by either side. Thailand is one of the top tourist destinations for Israelis, and Israel became popular for Thai migrant workers. More than 20 thousand Thais are employed in Israel in agriculture and in Asian restaurants as cooks. They work legally under the aegis of the Thai–Israeli bilateral agreement, the Thai-Israel Cooperation on the Placement of Workers (TIC). On September 2014, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement. On July 2015, Israel and Thailand signed a medical cooperation agreement. A delegation from the Thailand industrial association visited Israel in 2015. The Thai public is generally apathetic to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, but the Muslim minority in the country, nearly four million, is generally sympathetic to Palestine. In June and July 2018, Israeli commandos and technology supported Thai Navy SEALs during the highly publicisized Tham Luang cave rescue mission. The operation was a complete success, rescuing the entire soccer team.

In Hebrew : יחסי ישראל-וייטנאם Yechasei Yisrael-Vietnam) are the diplomatic, cultural and economic ties between the State of Israel and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Vietnam and Israel established diplomatic relations on July 12, 1993, followed by Israel opening its resident embassy in Hanoi in December 1993. The current Vietnamese Ambassador to Israel is Đỗ Minh Hùng, who has been assigned since January 2019. He operates out of the Vietnamese embassy in Tel Aviv. Ties between the two nations are generally friendly and stable. Vietnam has expressed its interest in boosting defense ties with Israel. There are also many Vietnamese working in Israel, and Israel has also delivered humanitarian aid to Vietnam in several occasions. According to reports, some 2,000 Vietnamese students study in Israel. Israel and Vietnam also cooperate in such fields as agriculture, information technology and biotech, and cultural exchanges between the two countries are quite extensive. History In 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and North Vietnam's Politburo chairman Ho Chi Minh stayed at the same hotel in Paris, and became very friendly. Ho Chi Minh offered Ben Gurion a Jewish home-in- exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion turned the offer down, telling Ho Chi Minh: \\"I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine.\\" From 1977 to 1979 the State of Israel permitted approximately 360 Vietnamese refugees to enter the country. The most well-known rescue operation took place on June 10, 1977 in which an Israeli freighter ship called the Yuvali, en route to Taiwan, sighted the passengers. Vietnam and Israel established diplomatic relations on July 12, 1993. Israel opened its resident Embassy in Hanoi in December 1993, with David Matnai appointed as the first Ambassador to Vietnam. The first resident Vietnamese ambassador to Israel was Đinh Xuân Lưu, who presented his credentials to Israeli President Shimon Peres on July 8, 2009. The ambassador operates out of an embassy at 4 Weizman Street in Tel Aviv, Israel, a first since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1993. The previous ambassador was a non-resident ambassador, operating from Cairo. At their meeting, President Shimon Peres told the new ambassador: \\"I congratulate the Vietnamese government on their decision to establish an embassy in Israel. The establishment of an embassy opens a new era in the relationship of the two countries.\\" Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have frequently conducted reciprocal visits at various levels, and have strengthened ties in such fields as business, education, culture, technological cooperation and agriculture. The visits arranged by the Israeli government included those of delegations comprising entrepreneurs and businessmen, academic groups, journalists, artists and musicians, legal workers, and so on. In January 2010, Luu said that it was key for Israel to increase its cooperation with Vietnam via its strong wherewithal in high-potential high-tech areas such as information technology, aerospace, and biological technologies applied to agriculture to boost farming productivity, which were important areas in Vietnam's modernization. In September 2011, he and Vietnamese Ministry of Defence Deputy Minister Lieutenant General Truong Quang Khanh led a working delegation from the defense ministry in a visit to Israel. In July 2012, he spoke of strong ties between Vietnam and Israel, and the possibilities for initiating future partnerships. In November 2011, at the invitation of Vietnam's President Trương Tấn Sang, Israeli President Shimon Peres had an official visit to Vietnam from the 21st to the 27th, accompanied by Ministers and business delegation. This first high-ranking visit aimed at strengthening and expanding political and economic strategic ties between Israel and Vietnam. In September 2012, Luu said that friendship and cooperation between Israel and Vietnam had its roots in a meeting in 1946 between Democratic Republic of Vietnam Prime Minister and President Ho Chi Minh and David Ben-Gurion. He also said that trade between the two countries had risen to $660 million in the first eight months of 2012. He spoke of cooperation between the two countries in agriculture, water technologies, IT, telecommunication, education, and homeland security. Future president of Vietnam, Trần Đại Quang, visited Israel in 2014 and met with president Reuven Rivlin. Israeli minister Tzipi Hotovely visited Vietnam in August 2015. Vietnamese deputy PM visited Israel on December of that year and met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. In 2016, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Vương Đình Huệ said Vietnam should learn from Israel how to develop a start-up ecosystem. In October 2016, Vietnamese president Trần Đại Quang met with Israeli ambassador to Vietnam, Meirav Eilon Shahar, and praised the warm ties between the two countries. He further stated Israel and Vietnam need to boost their economic and business ties and to even open a direct route between them in order to facilitate their cooperation and tourism. Public security minister of Vietnam, General To Lam visited Israel in November 2016 and met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Economic relations Israeli businessmen have shown considerable interest in Vietnam and organized many business trips to the country to explore investment opportunities in agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, oil and gas exploitation and production, telecommunications, and pharmacy. In August 2004, Israel and Vietnam signed an Agreement of Economic and Trade Cooperation, an important legal basis for the further development of trade. The two-way trade turnover has reached 70 million US dollars in 2005. Two Israeli corporations, Agronet and Astraco, have opened offices in Hanoi. Technology and know-how developed at Kibbutz Afikim will be used in a half-a- billion-dollar milk production project in Vietnam. The project involves establishing a dairy of 30,000 cows to supply 500,000 liters of milk a day, about 40% of Vietnam's present milk consumption. Afikim will be responsible for all stages of the enterprise, including breeding and preparing land for crops that will be used as feed. The governments of Vietnam and Israel signed an agreement on double tax avoidance in Hanoi on August 4, 2009, creating a transparent and healthy legal environment for their businesses to increase transactions. Signatories to the document were Deputy Minister of Finance Tran Xuan Ha and Israeli Ambassador to Vietnam Effie Ben Matityau. They both stressed the importance of the agreement in promoting economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.Vietnam, Israel sign double tax avoidance deal Israel and Vietnam are also working on completing a free-trade agreement, that would further enhance the business relationship between the two countries.vietnam ties with israel The Israeli government has helped train and educate Vietnamese in the science of agriculture, aquaculture, livestock, and dairy milk production. Vietnam, which is now considered one of the leading economies in the developing world, relies part of its success on Israeli technology and agricultural development. Military cooperation Many Israeli military experts have been impressed by the development of the Vietnamese military and its equipment, which led to the Israeli Government and the Israel Defence Forces to develop deeper ties with the Vietnam People's Army. The first Israeli military mission to Vietnam was initiated in 2012-13. The Vietnamese Government continues to express interest for further cooperation, and even military exercises between the two countries. Assistance to Vietnam Israel has also dispatched many specialists to Vietnam to give in- service training to their Vietnamese colleagues, especially in agriculture. Government officials and professionals from various ministries in Vietnam have visited Israel to study tours as well as for trainings. Various on-the-spot courses have been conducted in various fields, such as agriculture, aquaculture, livestock, dairy milk production and education, under the auspices of MASHAV, the Israeli Center for International Cooperation. Vietnamese refugees arriving at Ben Gurion International Airport, Israel, 1977 =Technology= A forum to further scientific and technological cooperation between Vietnam and Israel took place in Hanoi on January 18, 2010, drawing the participation of close to 160 businesses from both countries. Speaking at this first forum of its kind in Vietnam, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) Pham Gia Tuc, stated that the Vietnamese government sees Israel as an important partner in its policy to boost multi- faceted cooperation with countries in the Middle East. In 2016, a group of Vietnamese students and teachers traveled to Israel to learn about robotics and start-ups. Cultural ties In 2014, Vietnam hosted an Israeli film festival, in celebration of 20 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Numerous Israeli books have been translated to Vietnamese.

Permanent displays dedicated to the Begg technique can be found in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, the Library of the American Dental Association in Chicago, and the PR Begg Museum at the University of Adelaide. Education Begg was born in Coolgardie, Australia. His father was an accountant and his mother a business manager. He grew up working at a cattle and sheep farm in South Australia. He and his family moved to Adelaide in 1900, where he was enrolled into Pulteney Grammar School. He attended St. Peter's College where he was a classmate of Howard Florey. He received his science degree from University of Melbourne in 1923. Before he left for the US, Begg at one point drew a sketch of the aboriginal people of Australia and noticed that their incisors were completely worn down. A striking fact he observed was that these aboriginal people had no caries or periodontal disease in their teeth. Begg decided to enroll in Angle School of Orthodontia in Pasadena, California in 1924. During his stay in California, Edward Angle was developing his Edgewise Appliance after working on the Ribbon arch appliance. Begg and Fred Ishii of Japan were the first to treat patients with the edgewise appliance in Angle School of Orthodontia. In 1925, Begg sailed back to Australia to work with orthodontics on his own patients in Adelaide, South Australia. He also took up a position as professor at the University of Adelaide. He eventually retired from this position in 1964. Begg initially experimented with Edward Angle's non-extraction therapy but without much success. He observed a lot of relapse and treatment results with which he and his patients were not happy. In 1928, he decided to start removing teeth and starting seeing better dental aesthetics in his patients. When he came back from the US, Begg was using a rectangular wire like Angle. However, he made a switch to the round archwire in 1928 and started using that with his brackets. In 1933, he usedribbon arch brackets and round arch wires with lighter forces in an orthodontic treatment. He is known to have developed the \\"Australian orthodontic wires\\" in 1940s when he worked with a metallurgist named Arthur J. Wilcock. Begg married in 1928 and eventually had three children.  Begg technique  The Begg technique consists of three stages. The first involves multiple steps such as opening anterior bite, closing anterior spaces, eliminate anterior crowding, correction of rotations, and over-correction of mesio-distal relationship of buccal segments. This technique employs bite opening bends such as the gable bend or anchor bend along with the use of class II elastics. The bite opening bends will produce the intrusion of the frontal incisors either through the translation movement or rotation (tipping) movement. The rotational movement leads to flaring of the teeth as a side effect, which can be controlled by class II elastics preventing the flaring of upper anterior teeth. The second stage involves closing the extraction spaces. Begg mentioned that it was important to maintain the corrections achieved in Stage I while working on Stage II. The third stage of the Begg technique involves the root correction in the labio-lingual direction or mesio-distal direction. Harold Kesling and George Dishham, American orthodontists, introduced the Begg technique to many orthodontists in the United States in the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1959, Dr. Kesling and Dr. Rocke invited over 150 orthodontists to assess the result of over 100 cases which were treated by Kesling and others with the Begg technique. Kesling is known for popularizing the technique in the United States. Death Dr. Begg retired in 1980. On January 18, 1983 he died at Glen Osmond and was cremated. He is survived by his youngest daughter, Diana Coates.

Netanyahu's visit to Kazakhstan was the first by an Israeli head of government. Some Israeli commentators have signaled that Israel's relations with the Central Asian states, including Kazakhstan, are part of the country's involvement in \\"The Great Game\\" for control over the strategic natural resources in Central Asia. In a similar vein, the Islamic Republic of Iran both publicly fumed about and privately tried to cancel Kazakhstan's ties to Israel, to no avail; Iran had earlier tried and failed to have the newly independent former-USSR Muslim majority states ally with them instead of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, and their anti-Israel moves have been fairly similar in both style and results.

Jewish community in Kazakhstan  Kazakhstan's Jewish population surged dramatically when Stalin exiled thousands of Jews from the Pale of Settlement. An additional 8,500 Jews escaped during the Second World War and fled to Kazakhstan. Since 1989, approx. 10,000 Kazakh Jews have relocated to Israel. The Beit Rachel synagogue in Astana is the largest in Central Asia and opened in 2004. In 1999, all of Kazakhstan's Jewish communities were brought together under the All-Kazakhstan Jewish Congress. The country's first synagogue was opened in 2001 by Chabad Lubavitch, and a community center featuring a Jewish day school and summer camps, was also set up. Today, Kazakhstan's Jewish community of 3,300 has more than 20 Jewish organizations and 14 day schools. Over 700 Jewish students attend 14 Jewish day schools across the country and The Jewish Agency for Israel also sponsors several youth centers across the country where Jewish teens are taught Jewish culture and Hebrew. The Jewish community of Kazakhstan continues their cultural heritage. As such, in 2007 a youth dance and vocal group Prahim was created in Almaty. The highlight of Prahim’s repertoire is the popular Yiddish song, ‘Bei Mir Bistu Shein,’ which the band performs in four languages: Kazakh, Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew. In October 2014 the group performed several concerts in Boston and New York City. A reciprocal visit by American Jewish youth performers to Kazakhstan is planned for spring 2015. In September 2016, the central synagogue in Almaty held the twelfth Torah scroll introduction ceremony. It was a tribute to Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, the Lubavitch Rebbe’s father, after which the Jewish centre of Kazakhstan, Chabad Lubavitch, was named.

Abraham Ángel Card Valdés (March 7, 1905 – October 27, 1924) was a Mexican artist known under his first names Abraham Ángel; he dropped his surnames after his brother Adolfo expelled him from his family home when Abraham Ángel was barely 16.  Life  Abraham Ángel was born in El Oro, State of México, being the youngest of five. His father was Lewis Edward Card Burke (originally Carthburke Beedgar), a Welsh miner and adventurer, who travelled continuously throughout the country in search of fortune in gold and silver mines. His mother, Francisca Valdez, was from Sinaloa, México. At just 14, she left home to follow Lewis to El Oro, and form a family with him. Lewis, a gambler and womanizer, left a few years later, rarely seeing the family again. The older brother, Adolfo, became head of the family, which left in search of a better life to Puebla, Mexico, where Abraham Ángel spent his childhood. At age 11 he moved to Mexico City with his mother, his sister Amelia and his older brother Adolfo, who remained in charge. Abraham Ángel was raised in a strict Protestant environment, the religion professed by his father, which had been energetically adopted by his brother Adolfo. At age 16, Abraham Ángel decided to attend art and painting studies at Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (also known as Academia de San Carlos), a decision met with absolute opposition from his brother Adolfo. Abraham Ángel refused to comply, so he ended up being expelled from his home, to the astonishment and sadness of his mother and sister. It was 1921, and Abraham Ángel had already met Manuel Rodríguez Lozano, his tutor, with whom he had an intense homosexual affair, and who gave lessons in drawing based on the methods of Adolfo Best Maugard.Abraham Angel Card, Art Encyclopedia. In that difficult moment Abraham Ángel decided to drop his surnames and moved to his lover's home. A couple of years later, Lozano chose another young artist, Julio Castellanos, as his protégé, and abandoned Abraham Ángel. Humiliated and depressed, he was found dead on October 27, 1924, from a cocaine overdose, either an accident or suicide. His scarce works, numbering around 30 known paintings, are highly appreciated and valued by museums and art collectors.

Israel has an embassy in Madrid. Spain has an embassy in Tel Aviv, an honorary consulate in Haifa and a General Consulate in Jerusalem, which is regarded as diplomatic missions to the city of Jerusalem (including both West and East Jerusalem), Gaza and the territories of the West Bank.Consulado de España en Jerusalén , Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y de Cooperación de España In additions to both countries being member states of the United Nations, both countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean. The two countries are also involved with various programmes and agreements through the European Union, of which Spain is a member, and its relations with Israel.  History  Spanish Embassy, Tel Aviv Spanish policy towards the Middle East was determined by the nature of the Francoist regime, and by post-World War II politics. Franco made some overtures towards Israel but short of recognizing the country, not least because the latter's government had no interest in being recognised by such a regime. This outright rejection from the newly created State of Israel towards the Francoist dictatorship was born out of domestic politics and ideological reasons. In 1949, the State of Israel voted against lifting sanctions against Spain in the United Nations General Assembly due to the Francoist regime's sympathy and material support for the Axis Powers. The hostility between both countries paved the way for Spain's fostering of relations with the unaligned Arab nations (nurturing the narrative of the so-called \\"traditional Hispano- Arab friendship\\"), which helped Spain to overcome international isolation. A cornerstone of Arab-Spanish friendship was the non-recognition of Israel. In these years, several editions of the antisemitic libel of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were published in Spain, finding positive reception as factual truth among the most extreme factions of the regime. Despite the lack of diplomatic ties, the Franco government aided in Jewish emigration from Morocco in the 1960s and, during the Six-Day War in 1967, issued laissez-passer documents to Egyptian Jews, enabling them to emigrate. The pro-Arab views of the previous Francoist regime had created a stance that was very difficult to overcome even after the transition to democracy. The first Spanish government after Franco's death, headed by Adolfo Suárez, declared that it would not recognize Israel unless it withdrew from the occupied territories and allowed the creation of a Palestinian homeland. Following Suárez's resignation in 1982, the new President of the Government of Spain,NB: President of the Government of Spain is the official English denomination Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, seemed inclined to inaugurate relations between Spain and Israel but this had to wait for the next government due to the pro-Arab stance of the Foreign Minister José Pedro Pérez-Llorca,Pérez-Llorca had been a member of the Popular Liberation Front in his youth who argued against recognition as a response to Israel's links to the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and fears of an oil embargo as reprisal by Arab countries. Pérez-Llorca later became an advisor for Kuwait Petroleum. Nevertheless, small steps were taken towards rapproachment, including informal contacts by Samuel Hadas, the Israeli representative to the United Nations World Tourism Organization based in Madrid. Hadas, a member of the Israeli Labor Party, was responsible for the creation of a Spanish Friends of Israel association and a dialogue group that included several Spanish Socialist Workers Party members of parliament, such as Enrique Múgica Herzog, as well as members of the ruling party, UCD. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, 7 November 2017 With a view to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, President of the Government Felipe González, who had been elected on a Socialist platform three years earlier, sent a personal letter to secretary general of the Arab League, Chedli Klibi, on 25 April 1985, advising him of Spain's plans. Following Operation Wooden Leg, the Spanish Government issued a strong condemnation of the attack, putting a temporary hold to the recognition process. Further conversations with ambassadors from Arab states in Madrid followed in January of the next year, advising them of Spain's forthcoming plans. Spain and Israel established diplomatic relations on 17 January 1986. Samuel Hadas was named Israel Ambassador in Madrid.\\"Israel Designates Ambassador to Spain\\" Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1986 Spain had joined the European Economic Community on 1 January. Soon after, a representative office for the PLO opened in Madrid \\"as evidence of Spain traditional policy of friendship with the Palestinian people and as an instrument to achieve a lasting, just and global solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict\\". In 2000, Spain lifted its veto on Israel's admission to the Western European Group of the United Nations, on a basis of permanent renewal of temporary full membership, ending Israel's administrative limbo, as its membership in the Asian Group had been withheld due to the large majority of Muslim countries in the Asian block opposing. In October 2011, Spanish Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, arrived in Israel for a two-day state visit to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and meet with local scientists.Economic, commercial ties with Spain continue to shine Religious and cultural ties Many Israelis are Sephardi Jews, culturally associated with the Iberian Peninsula from where Jews were expelled in the late-fifteenth century. Many Israelis are also of Spanish and Portuguese Jewish extraction from before the expulsion of Jews from the Iberian peninsula. Some Israelis live in Spain today, and there is also a small contemporary Spanish Jewish community. Many Spanish people are also of converso or marrano origin, with a recent study estimating the figure to be as high as 20%. An Israeli newspaper, Maariv, noted that José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has said that his family is of Jewish descent, probably from a family of marranos. In honor of the 25th anniversary of diplomatic and cultural relations between Spain and Israel, the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid loaned a painting by El Greco to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. A special evening was held in the presence of Yitzhak Navon, the fifth President of the State of Israel and Alvaro Iranzo Gutierrez, ambassador of Spain in Israel.Visiting Masterpiece from the Prado Museum, Madrid Bilateral trade Spanish apparel retailer Zara opened their first store in 1997 in Tel Aviv.

He served under three national championship coaches (Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and Lou Holtz) during his career. A native of Orrville, Ohio, Yonto played fullback as sophomore (1945) and guard as junior (1946) under coach Frank Leahy at Notre Dame. As a senior prior to his 1948 graduation, he served as an assistant freshman team coach after a leg injury ended his playing career. He went on to coach high school football for 16 years at numerous schools, including seven years at Notre Dame High School for Boys in Niles, Illinois. In 1964 he returned to the University of Notre Dame as defensive line coach under incoming head coach Parseghian, and held that role throughout Parseghian's 11 seasons, as well as six more (1975–80) under Devine, the last four as defensive coordinator. During that period, he was a part of three Notre Dame national championship staffs (1966, 1973 and 1977) and he coached a dozen All-America defensive linemen. That list included Alan Page, Kevin Hardy, Mike McCoy, Walt Patulski, Mike Kadish, Mike Fanning, Steve Niehaus and Ross Browner—all of whom went on to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. Browner won the Lombardi, Outland and Maxwell Awards, and Patulski also won the Lombardi. On 12 occasions, Yonto′s defensive line ranked among the top 10 teams in the country in terms of rushing defense. Eight of those Irish teams gave up less than 100 rushing yards per game, and the 1974 Notre Dame Fighting Irish ranked first nationally in both rushing defense and total defense (195.2 yards per game). During the Gerry Faust years (1981–85), Yonto served as a special assistant to athletic director Gene Corrigan while handling administrative duties in a wide variety of football areas.

It was released as the B-side of the single \\"Somewhere in London\\" in 1985. It then featured on their 1986 album Back in Line and was later included on the 1999 A Rare Collection 1972-1996. \\"Lanercost\\" was written by Maddy Prior (who sings the lead vocals on the piece) and Rick Kemp.  Lyrics and content  Lanercost is a village near to a priory of the same name in the north of Cumbria, close to the Scottish border. The lyrics describe part of the life of English King Edward I, who fought to subdue the Scottish. Towards the end of his life, the King spent time at Lanercost Priory, directing a campaign against Robert the Bruce. The King, although ill, caught and hanged three of the Bruce's (four) brothers. Ultimately, however, he died when leading his army north. Each of the four verses begins by describing the actions of the canons (priests) at the priory - fishing; praying; working in the scriptorium and finally carrying the King's coffin. The rest of each verse then discusses Edward and his actions - lying in bed \\"cursing fate\\" (as he is too ill to fight); delighting at his capture and execution of the Bruce's brothers; leaving to ride north and then dying before his work can be finished. The chorus is centered on a repetition of the Kyrie eleison (in fact spelled 'elaison' in the sleeve notes), presumably suggesting that this would have been sung by the canons themselves. The Kyrie lyrics are not included on the Shanachie LP liner notes.  Variants  According to Reinhard Zierke,Zierke, Reinhard.

Born in Greece, she moved with her family to São Paulo in 1954. From 1976 she lives and works in London, São Paulo and New York. Alongside her art she was the founder of the project-led space, Sartorial Contemporary Art (2005–2010) and since 2010 has been running a family trust the Alegre Sarfaty Collection. Gretta exhibited her work at institutions such as Museu de Arte Contemporânea da Universidade de São Paulo (MAC/USP), Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo (MAM/SP), Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP), Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (MNBA), Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo, Instituto Moreira Salles (SP/RJ), (MAP), Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Museo MACRO Asilo, Palazzo dei Diamanti di Ferrara, Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian, Fundação Vera Chaves Barcellos (FVCB), Centre Georges Pompidou, Internationaal Cultureel Centrum, New York University (NYU), among others. Early life Marchant was born in Athens in 1947\\"Gretta Alegre Sarfaty Evocative Recollections\\", Internationaal Cultureel Centrum Bulletin, 1 February 1980. Reproduced in an untitled web page, website of Sartorial Art. and was named Alegre Sarfaty, from parents of Italian, Greek and Turkish origin. In 1954, her family moved to São Paulo, Brazil.\\"Gretta Alegre Sarfaty\\", Escritório de Arte. At the age of 17 she married José Grzywacz; she has three children from this marriage: Victoria Sarfaty Grzywacz, Pedro Grzywacz and Rafaela Grzywacz Goodman. In the following years, Gretta dedicates to his artistic works and in the early 70's begins to exhibit professionally. His art studies include those at FAAP and the Escola Panamericana de Artes, with Ivald Granato and Walter Lewy. She studied photography with the photographer Julio Abe Wakahara during the year of 1975. Due to its artistic production and exhibitions, it moves to Paris, Milan and New York. Nowadays the artist it's established in Brazil, spending some brief periods of the year between New York, London and Italy. Artistic career Throughout her career Gretta exhibited mainly in São Paulo, New York and London. In the 70s she participated in numerous solo shows in Brazil displaying her early paintings. Her world travels and mixed background has had an important influence on her more contemporary visual work – particularly her photography and collages which deal in themes of identity and culture, although her art is not restricted just to the canvas. Marchant's work embraces a wide range of media including installation, photography, video, paintings and performance. =Brazil and Europe= At the beginning of the 70s she started creating the series of paintings, Metamorphosis and her work was noted by the Brazilian gallerist, Franco Terranova. In 1975 he participated in the Bienal Internacional de Arte de São Paulo. In 1976 he showed her works in the Galeria de Arte Global, in São Paulo. In 1979 she had several shows in Germany (Karlsruhe) and in Italy (Galleria Diagramma, Milan; Palazzo dei Diamanti, Ferrara) and also in Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou, where she performed the Evocative Recollections. In 1980 she held the exhibition Evocative Recollections & Transformations at the Museu de Arte Contemporânea (MAC/São Paulo). In 1983 she created a series of paintings with a book, dedicated to the Brazilian culture, Self-Portrait of Brazil, a publication containing a series of paintings by the artist and texts about important personalities from the country that was exhibited at the Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP) and in 2011 participated in the exhibition Arte como Registro, Registro como Arte, na Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo.  Auto-Photos  This series of photos from 1976 is one of the first Marchant's artworks dedicated to female identity and its various demonstrations: her face appears in sequences of beauty and ugliness, grace and madness. A frivolous play with recurrent images of herself is in fact an ironic dialogue with the constructed cultural image of a woman. Marchant expresses in this series the notion of gender performativity, a term created by Judith Butler in 1988. Roberto Pontual wrote about this work: > The work of Gretta has been originally more related to the language of > photography, especially during her recent stay in Europe. Her main focus has > always been the female body, including her own body as a symbol of women's > condition in our society. Quoted in \\"Auto Photos 1976-1986\\". Marchant's > website.  Transformations  alt=Here the topic of deconstructing the female image gains even more strength. Marchant's face is being manipulated and distorted: > Rather than the manifestation of personal destructive tendencies, these > images should be viewed as the externalisation of a revolt directed against > the male cultural stereotype, mortifying as it does the feminine form into > the authoritarian and distorting dimension of an abstract and aesthetic > beauty, to which the artist opposes the angry vision of a reverse side, > through a body that is deformed, disfigured and fragmented. Quoted in > \\"Transformations 1976-1986\\", Sarfaty Marchant's website.  A Women's Diary  Another work from 1976 where Marchant uses photography to create a diary of her own body, captured in almost abstract poses. The way that the body appears on the photos calls into question its materiality.  Evocative Recollections  alt= In 1979 she performed Evocative Recollections (performance with catalogue) in Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, as well as in Palazzo dei Diamanti di Ferrara, Italy.Elvio Becheroni, \\"Dal «continente-donna». Una intelligente denuncia della condizione feminile nel mondo\\", L'Arena di Verona, 24 March 1979, p.37. Reproduced in an untitled web page, website of Sartorial Art. This performance was then shown in different locations in Belgium (Internationaal Cultureel Centrum, Antewerp), Brazil and Italy. Under the same title, Evocative Recollections, Marchant continued the topic of female body and women's liberation in the series of photos (1980–1981). In an essay published for Marchant's solo exhibition at the Centro Culturale La Filanda (Verano Italy) Gillo Dorfles wrote about this series: > Sure: such pictures will not be the same with another artist, with another > option, however, even considered under a point of view of photographic > document, Gretta's corporeal options reach an unusual efficacy. We are in > front of a little common combination, between the creative activity of an > artist who knows how to enjoy the expressive dynamic and plastic > possibilities of her body and the realisation of a photographic > documentation which remains autonomous as well as in its technical as in its > aesthetic values. Quoted in \\"Evocative Recollections\\", Sarfaty Marchant's > website. =New York= In 1983 Marchant moved to New York and after a traumatic event, the fire in the Hotel Chelsea,Randy Diamond, \\"Fire in Hotel Chelsea\\" (unidentified newspaper article), reproduced in an untitled web page, website of Sartorial Art (\\"2009 Sartorial Contemporary Art\\"). she began a collaboration with American video and multimedia artists (InterComm group). She also started to discover Kabbalah esoteric thought: she became friends with Simon Jacobson and Kenny Vance and she decided to picture the Kabbalah community in her paintings (Kabbalah, 1984–1985). She also created a performance, Goya Time (1985) and a video, My Single Life in New York (1987). By the time she was represented by the New York-based gallery, Foster Goldstrom Fine Arts, she was involved in the artistic and cultural life of the city and she got to know Arthur Penn, with whom she collaborated in 1993 on his film The Portrait. Some important exhibitions held in New York were Body Works at the Foster Goldstrom Gallery in 1983. The same year he participated in the Body Works & Evocative Recollections at the Keith Green Gallery. In 1984 he had his work exhibited at the inauguration of the Trump Tower.  Body Works  In the late 80s and early 90s Marchant created a photographic series of Body Works, where naked bodies constitute a denunciation of the hedonistic and alienating practices to which the female form is submitted, a denunciation of the repression and mystification to which women's education exposes them from every direction. And they are an affirmation of the real sensuality of women, which respectability nonetheless still attempts to hide or to repress (the curtain or the mosquito net). And so, like gallery owner Romana Loda, we can quote Hugo Von Hofmannsthal when he said: \\"The profound should be hidden. Where? On the surface\\". Quoted in \\"Body Works 1976\\", Sarfaty Marchant's website. alt=  Gretta & Becheroni: Change and Appropriation of an Autonomous Identity  VideoThe video is made in 1980 in collaboration with Elvio Becheroni. Marchant perform in a cube made of paper ribbons, making herself a passage through the space. It is a metaphoric way to the new identity. This work evidences the prison of the woman in the society through its voyeuristic aspect, evoking a ritual of liberation. This work was exhibited in the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo and in other countries like Argentina, Italy and the USA. Vídeo Gretta & Becheroni: Change and Appropriation of an Autonomous Identity, 1980.  Goya Time  Inter- disciplinary multimedia event with 100 artists, curated by Marchant, Sandro Dernini and Butch Morris. Marchant wrote a script and directed this art opera inspired by Francisco de Goya's artworks. The performance took place in 1985, in \\"Quando\\", church and a car park at the Lower East Side, New York.The video is Vídeo La Maja, Goya Time, 1985. alt=  Virtual Body Works 1988/2013  During the Spring of 1987 Marchant was invited to participate in an interactive telecommunications event, Who Killed Heinrich Hertz?,The video is created by InterComm (Timothy Binkley, George M. Chaikin, Ira Schneider and Willoughby Sharp). She became involved in collaborative work with each of the above video artist. In 1988 Ira Schneider created a video dedicated to Marchant.The video is  Myth  VideoThe video is produced by Denny Daniel, in 2003. It is a compilation of snapshots of Marchant, manipulated with a kaleidoscopic effect and juxtaposed with scenes from Marchant's everyday life. The structure of the movie remains the style of music videos from the late 80s. =London= In 1995 she moved to London and married Richard Marchant, \\"the leading Oriental ceramics dealer\\". She continued creating photography related to questions of femininity and identity and was represented for the gallery Wolseley Fine Arts. From 2005, he founded his own artist-run gallery, Sartorial Contemporary Arts, a gallery designed to promote exhibitions of young artists as well as his own.  Reflections of a Woman  Woman as a central artistic subject appears not only in her auto- portraits but also in the series of paintings dedicated to an issue of female identity and body, Reflections of a Woman (1997). It was exhibited in the Wolseley Fine Arts, London, in 1997.\\"London First for Brazilian Artist\\", Antiques Bulletin, 29 November – 5 December 1997, issue 718, p.3. Reproduced in an untitled web page, website of Sartorial Art. > In this series of paintings Gretta is talking not only about herself, but > also about other women. She has found a way to represent women's nature. It > is not her body any more, but every woman's body. They can still be self- > portraits, but they also are portraits of the women of today, full of > confidence about their own identity and conscious of their power. Quoted in > \\"Reflections of a Woman, Sarfaty Marchant's website.  Myth of Womanhood, 2001-2005  alt= alt= The title itself is a provocative statement by the artist in relation to the Female versus Feminism issue, and how the use and abuse of that subject has now become a cliché. The series consists of one photographic image which is duplicated several times to form a stimulating kaleidoscopic final picture. The Myth of Womanhood marks Gretta's return to performance art, however in this instance the performance is only for the camera. alt=  Youth Versus Gravity, 2001-2005  alt= In this series, Gretta manipulated mirrors and their reflections to have a complete view of the subject from different angles. Separate images were used to create fun compositions through symmetry, which are intended to transport the viewer back to the illusion of childhood. In Youth Versus Gravity, the artist has been guided by issues related to longevity. alt=  Permutations, 2009  The installation is a cosmological ricochet which is conceptualized through repeated images of bananas, self portraits and geometric exegesis in ordered sequences in front of a symbol of the Shield of David. Here Gretta is interested in synchronicity and meaningful coincidences. =Recent activity= In 2005 she opened her own gallery, Sartorial Contemporary Art. In October 2008 this moved to a larger space in Kings Cross. Marchant has curated several of its shows including Notting Heaven (2008), Mothers (2008), Remember My Name (2008), Burning Candy (2008), Obsession (2006) and Water (2006). Along with Jasper Joffe and Harry Pye she has been a co-editor of The Rebel magazine. In 2010 she has exhibited in the show Bad Girls, together with Marina Abramović, Annette Messager, Orlan and Gina Pane. The concept of the exhibition was to compare four generation of female artists since the 70s. In 2011 her works were shown in an exhibition at the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo Arte como registro, registro como arte, documenting the history of art performance in Brazil. The show highlights Marchant as one of the few Brazilian artists to ever exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou. One year later she participated in Foto/Gráfica – a New History of the Latin-American Photobook (where she exhibited her Autho-Photos), at Le Bal, Paris and Libriste – Dalla collezione di libri d'artista di Marco Carminati: Gretta Sarfaty & Elvio Becheroni . Modificazione e appropriamento di una identita autonoma at the Instituzione Biblioteca Classense in Ravenna, Italy. In 2013 she had works exhibited in the show Ainda: O livro como Performance curated by Amir Brito Cadôr at the Museu de Arte da Pampulha in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In 2015 participated in the exhibition Reenactment: Videoarte no Palazzo Dei Diamanti, Ferrara, Italy. In 2018 the Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo (MAM) celebrated its 70th anniversary in partnership with the Museu de Arte Contemporânea (MAC) in which Gretta's work Auto-Photos were exhibited. This same year she opened his solo exhibition \\"Reconciliation\\" at Galeria Pilar in São Paulo. The exhibition at Galeria Pilar in São Paulo represents the first individual of the artist in Brazil after the period when she lived out of the country, dividing her work between New York and London. \\"Reconciliation\\" brings a new series of works where the body, an outstanding element of Safarty's artistic career, returns to the painting, video art, engraving and photograph presents at the exhibition. This same body who stared the more known works from the artist, presents itself in the intimate and familiar context of the reunion. In 2019, Gretta starts to be represented by Central Galeria, opening the exhibition \\"Dos nossos espaços vazios internos˜, which brings together vintage works, produced between the years 1970 and 1980, from the series Body Works, Metamorphic Recollections and Diário de uma mulher. In December 2019, Gretta opened the exhibition Reconciliações at the Instituto dos Arquitetos do Brasil, a project contemplated by the Cultural Incentive Law - Lei Rouanet. Gretta also participated in the group exhibition \\"Estratégias do Feminino\\" at Farol Santander in Porto Alegre, the show brings together about 95 works by 53 female artists, produced between the beginning of the 20th century and up to the present day. Also in 2019, Gretta started to be represented by an international gallery, Galeria Nuno Centeno, located in Porto, Portugal. In 2020, Gretta will participate in a solo exhibition at the gallery, scheduled to take place in May. = Alegre Sarfaty Collection = The Alegre Sarfaty Collection of contemporary art is a privately own family trust.

He was president of the National Liberal Youth from 1937 to 1946. Pursued by the authorities due to his anti-communist actions, he managed to flee the country in 1946, and was later sentenced to death. He was member of the Romanian National Committee () and the League of Free Romanians (Liga Românilor Liberi) where he was elected as president in 1953. He was the first manager of the Romanian-language section of Radio Free Europe. His most important work is Frunzele nu mai sunt aceleaşi (\\"The Leaves Are No Longer the Same\\"), published in 1946 under the pen name Mihail Villara. The work was given the Editura Cultura Națională Grand Prize. Ancestry Fărcășanu was a direct descendant of Popa Stoica from Fărcaș, Dolj County. Popa Stoica was a priest who abandoned the church and fought against the Ottoman Empire in the army of Michael the Brave, who later named him ağa, or supreme commander of the army. In 1595, Ağa Fărcaș led an army across the Danube, conquering the Bulgarian citadel Nikopol and marching to Vidin, where he was defeated by the Ottomans, and where he eventually died. After Ağa Fărcaș, the family had a succession of such dignitaries as Radu Fărcășanu (captain in 1639, treasurer in 1654, stolnic in 1657 and mare vornic), Barbu Fărcășanu (logothete and treasurer in 1674), Matei Fărcășanu (great stolnic in 1731), Constantin Fărcășanu (serdar) and Enache Fărcășanu (Grand Panetier named ispravnic of Romanați). Youth and studies Mihail Fărcășanu was born on November 10, 1907, in Bucharest, as the son of Gheorghe Fărcășanu and Mariei Fărcășanu (née Vasilescu). His father had a bachelor's degree in law but he never practiced. Besides Mihail, the parents had another three boys, Gheorghe, Paul (adopted by an uncle, Paul Zotta) and Nicu, and two girls, Margareta (married Bottea) and Mia (married Lahovari). His parents lived in Râmnicu Vâlcea, where Fărcășanu attended primary school and then high school at Alexandru Lahovari High School (now Alexandru Lahovary National College), graduating in 1927 magna cum laude. In 1935 he attended the London School of Economics, where he studied under Harold Laski; Laski would go on to become president in 1945–1946 of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. He completed his legal studies in Germany at the Friedrich Wilhelm University (since 1948 Humboldt University) in Berlin. His doctoral dissertation Über die geistesgeschichtliche Entwicklung des Begriffes der Monarchie (On the History of the Development of the Concept of Monarchy) was completed under the guidance of professor Carl Schmitt. His thesis was later published by the Konrad Tiltsch printing house in Würzburg. In Romania it was published in 1940 under the title Monarhia socială (\\"Social Monarchy\\") by Editura Fundației pentru Literatură și Artă Regele Carol II. Upon returning to Romania after his studies, he became a member of the National Liberal Party (Brătianu). In 1938 he married Pia Pillat, the daughter of poet Ion Pillat and painter Maria Pillat Brateș, making him brother-in-law of literary critic Dinu Pillat and writer Cornelia Pillat. His wife was the granddaughter of Dinu Brătianu, president of the National Liberal Party.  Beginning of his publishing activity  In 1939 he was named editor-in-chief of Rumanian Quarterly magazine owned by the Anglo–Romanian Society. The president of the society was Nicolae Caranfil, with whom Fărcășanu collaborated closely in the Romanian National Committee and the League of Free Romanians. Vice presidents of the society were Zoe Ghețu, George Cretzianu and Fr. Flow, and honorary secretaries were Nicolae Chrissoveloni, Paul Zotta, and Ion Mateescu. The magazine's role was to contribute to the knowledge of cultural values between the two countries and to evidence the spiritual interrelations between the two cultures. The magazine carried articles signed by Romanian personalities such as Nicolae Iorga, Gheorghe Brătianu, Tudor Arghezi, Matila Ghyka, K. H. Zambaccian, Al. O. Teodoreanu, Cella Delavrancea, Militza Pătrașcu and foreign personalities such as Derek Patmore, Henry Baerlein, and journalist Sir Arthur Beverley Baxter. Fărcășanu signed an important essay entitled The Sense of the New Political Regime of Romania. The magazine stopped publishing due to the start of World War II. In September 1940, he was named president of the National Liberal Youth by Dinu Brătianu. Although the political parties were suspended by General Ion Antonescu, the National Liberal Party continued its activities, especially its publishing activities. Between 1940 and 1944, Fărcășanu was editor-in-chief of the Românul magazine, worked on the publishing committee of Pământul românesc magazine, and wrote articles in the newspaper Viața Nouă. In 1942 he published the essay Libertate și existență (\\"Freedom And Existence\\"). In 1943–1944 he was a war correspondent on the Eastern Front. Allegedly he was almost captured by the Soviet Red Army at the bend of the Don, but managed to flee at the last moment. After August 23, 1944 Right after the royal coup of August 23, 1944, the Viitorul newspaper was reborn and Mihail Fărcășanu is appointed editor-in-chief. The organ of the Liberal Party had been banned in 1938 by Carol II of Romania and then by Ion Antonescu. In September 1944, at the proposal of Gheorghe Brătianu, he was reelected as president of the National Liberal Youth. According to his own account, Fărcășanu was the first to criticise Ana Pauker in public, which repportedly stirred a massive communist fightback, calling Fărcășanu an agent of Nazi politician Joseph Goebbels, an enemy of the people and the working class, an adversary of the agriculture reform and a saboteur of the national industry. He further claimed that when he published in the newspaper the translation of Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls, the communist press called him a fascist. In line with the Denazification process taking place in European countries formerly ruled by pro-Nazi regimes, the post-war government took steps to cleanse the police and safety services. Under pressure of the Soviets in the Ceasefire Commission, Nicolae Penescu (minister of the interior in the Sănătescu government) and Nicolae Rădescu had to kick out from the two services many agents who had been loyal to the Antonescu dictatorship. These actions were approved by the National Peasants' Party and the National Liberal Party, thinking that this would ensure a more favourable view of Romania from Moscow. Mihail Fărcășanu was a strong adversary of these actions. In January 1945 Fărcășanu organised Conferința Pregătitoare a Congresului Tineretului Național Liberal (Preparatory Conference of the National Liberal Youth Congress). The conference took place in Sinaia and commemorated 11 years since the assassination of Ion G. Duca and the destruction of the commemorative plaque by the Iron Guard legionnaires. Later that year, Pravda published an article about Mihail Fărcășanu entitled 'Fărcășanu's gang in which PNL and PNT stood accused of organizing a demonstration in support General Rădescu, which by the time had a falling-out with the Soviets. On February 13, 1945, revolting against Rădescu, the communists yelled: Cerem arestarea lui Țețu! (\\"We want the arrest of Țețu!\\"), Cerem arestarea lui Fărcășanu! (\\"We want the arrest of Fărcășanu!\\"). In the later period of Rădescu's government, the communists embarked in a campaign to attract dissident factions of the pre-war political parties, succeeding in bringing several members into the Blocul Partidelor Democrate (BPD, Democratic Bloc of Parties). As a result, the liberal faction led by Gheorghe Tătărescu, and the PNT faction led by Anton Alexandrescu joined the communist-led alliance. The discussions about the attitude of the political parties continued even after the establishment of the Petru Groza government, Romania's first communist-dominated government. Iuliu Maniu proposed that the party maintain the opposition strategy it had adopted in the past, from the period when he was a deputy in Budapest after World War I and even in the time when the parties were legally banned. This point of view was supported by Dinu Brătianu. Fărcășanu wanted to convince them that this would be an error with grave consequences. Fărcășanu said that if they thought the actions of the Communist Party would be suppressed by the Western countries, they were wrong. In autumn 1945, Fărcășanu participated, as a representative of the National Liberal Youth, in organising a great rally in the Piața Palatului (now Revolution Square, Bucharest), on November 8, the king's birthday. On the last day of 1945 a delegation of the allied powers arrived in Bucharest, led by Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel, W. Averell Harriman and Andrey Januaryevich Vyshinskiy. After the discussion Emil Hațieganu from the Peasants' Party and Mihail Romniceanu from the Liberal Party were assigned to the government as ministers without portfolio. In February 1946 the two parties were authorised to publish their own works. Because the name Viitorul (\\"The Future\\") for the party newspaper was owned by Gheorghe Tătărescu, the liberals decided to call their newspaper Liberalul (\\"The Liberal\\"), a name that had used in the past for many newspapers, notably one published in Iaşi under Nicolae Gane and George G. Mârzescu. Being watched by the authorities, Fărcășanu did not assume the role of editor-in-chief, which was later occupied by Azra Berkowitz. In this period Fărcășanu organised three conferences that had to be held in the grand hall of the Fundației Carol I theater on May 12, 19 and 26, 1945. Inspired by a quote of Dinu Brătianu Libertăţile se cuceresc uneori fără jertfe. Dar ele nu se pot menţine decât cu jertfe (\\"Freedom is sometimes gained without sacrifice. But maintaining it calls for sacrifice\\"), the conferences, where ten associate professors announced their arrival, had the following program: * I. Cucerirea libertății (\\"Conquering freedom\\") – associate professors Mihail Fărcășanu, Dan Amedeu Lăzărescu, Radu Câmpeanu * II. Pierderea libertăţii (\\"Losing freedom\\") – associate professors George Fotino, Victor Papacostea, C.C. Zamfirescu * III. Recâştigarea libertăţii (\\"Regaining freedom\\") – associate professors Alice Voinescu, Paul Dimitriu, Paul Zotta, Mihai Popescu At the first conference, after the first words spoken by Fărcășanu, a group of communist activists started a general riot screaming Vi s-au luat moșiile! (\\"Your estates have been taken away!\\"). Fărcășanu tried in vain to talk to the agitators. The conference could not take place in a civilised manner, which was seen as a victory for the communists. The Liberal Party's general secretary Dinu Brătianu, who had worked with Teohari Georgescu during the Rădescu government, convinced Fărcășanu to reschedule the conferences to avoid disruption by the communists. On May 19 Fărcășanu managed to organise his first conference, but by the order of the Ministry of the Interior the other two conferences were banned. This was the last time Fărcășanu appeared in a public action in Romania. In May 1946, the General Police made a report about the National Liberal Party (Dinu Brătianu). The report claimed that Mihail Romniceanu had given a secret order, which was delivered by his secretary Nicolae Magherescu to all the party organisations. This order allegedly said that the Liberal Party should initiate its own secret police to participate in all elections to ensure their proper organisation. The Liberal police would have been run by Fărcășanu. A similar organisation would have been initiated by the Peasants' Party under Corneliu Coposu. These police organisations were never initiated, but because of the General Police report, Fărcăşanu had to leave the country to avoid capture.  Flight from Romania  Aware of the fact that his life was at risk if he stayed in Romania, Mihai Fărcășanu made arrangements to flee Romania. He was helped in this endeavor by long-time friend Matei Ghica- Cantacuzino, a fighter pilot who had participated in the military operations in the war against the Soviet Union reaching Stalingrad where he took part in the bombing of the railway station on October 5, 1942. Matei Ghica-Cantacuzino had left Romania, but had returned with the intention of helping close friends escape. It was agreed that the Fărcășanu family's escape would take place in October 1946, from a small military airport near Caransebeș. The plan was to use an old bomber which had just been repaired and was scheduled to be flown to its base near Brașov. A government commission had just arrived in Caransebeș a day before the flight to inspect the aircraft and to make sure that there were no clandestine passengers on board, and that the aircraft had just enough fuel to fly 300 km, the distance between Caransebeș and Brașov. In agreement with Matei Ghica-Cantacuzino, the mechanic had tampered with the fuel gauge, making it indicate that the tank was only partly full while it was actually completely full. Mihail Fărcășanu, his wife Pia, and their friend Vintilă Brătianu were hiding in some bushes at the far end of the airfield. The plane started rolling towards the end of the runway having only Matei Ghica-Cantacuzino and the mechanic on board. When the plane reached the end of the runway and turned around for take-off, outside the visibility of the control tower, the three stowaways boarded the plane that was racing its engines, and then took off immediately. In Yugoslav airspace, the plane was detected by the Yugoslav airforce, and in took all the skills of the pilot to evade the fighters, by flying into the clouds. The plane was, however, hit several times by the bullets from the fighters, which took out all the navigation instruments except the altimeter. One of the fuel tanks was also hit. With a damaged plane, having practically no navigation instruments and very limited fuel, the pilot started crossing the Adriatic Sea. They were able to land at military airport in Bari, Italy, with practically empty fuel tanks. Ivor Porter, who at that time was British SOE and was working at the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Romania, had been informed about the escape attempt. He had sent a cable to the British authorities in Italy requesting them to ensure their protection. He later described the adventure in a book \\"Operation Autonomous\\", published in 1989. In his book, he states that if he had not sent such a cable, the escapees might have been sent back to Romania.Ivor Porter – Operation Autonomous – Ed. Chato and Windus, 1989 (traducere română \\"Operațiunea Autonomous\\", editura Humanitas, București, 1991) The escape has also been described in a novel written by Pia Pillat, Mihail Fărcășanu's wife, who was also on the plane. The novel, called \\"The Flight of Andrei Cosmin\\", was first published in London in 1972 under the pen name Tina Cosmin, and has been translated into Romanian, being published in Romania in 2002. While it realistically presents the events, she has changed the names of the characters. Thus Mihail Fărcășanu is called Andrei Cosmin, Matei Ghica- Cantacuzino is Ștefan Criveanu and Ivor Porter is Chris Nelson.http://www.romlit.ro/destinul_soţilor_cosmin  Activity in exile  Mihail Fărcășanu and his wife Pia settled in New York City where they soon became some of the most active members of the Romanian emigrants to the United States. Mihail Fărcășanu immediately started the political organization of Romanian refugees. In 1948 he founded the \\"Council of Romanian Democratic Parties\\". The Council had the objective of coordinating the activity of the representatives of Romanian political parties outside the Soviet zone of influence and of establishing a \\"National Romanian Committee\\". Mihail Fărcășanu was one of the representatives of the Romanian National Liberal Party in this Council.Ion Calafeteanu – Politică și Exil. Din istoria exilului românesc – Editura Enciclopedică, București 2000 = Participation in the international European movement = After the end of World War II, the great visionaries of a united Europe, among which Winston Churchill, Jean Monnet, François Mitterrand, Robert Schuman, Altiero Spinelli, Konrad Adenauer, Grigore Gafencu, Alcide de Gasperi and Paul Henry Spaak felt the need of an international organism aiming at a unification of the various nations, the respect of human rights and keeping the peace. On May 7–11, 1948 the 1948 Hague Congress was organized in The Hague, chaired by Winston Churchill. The date was chosen so as to coincide with the third anniversary of the ceasefire which ended World War II in Europe. Following the resolution of this congress, on October 25, 1948 the European Movement International was founded, a nongovernmental organization formed by political personalities from different European countries who were supporting the principle of a united Europe. Romania was represented by Grigore Gafencu, Nicolae Caranfil, Mihail Fărcășanu and Iancu Zissu, who signed the documents in capacity of founding members. The Romanian Section of the European Movement was initially headed by Grigore Gafencu, who had remarkable contributions both at the Hague Congress and in the following period. Consequently, for a long time, the section was headed by George Ciorănescu.Mișcarea Europeană – Secțiunea Română Last years House in Georgetown, Washington DC where Mihail Fărcășanu lived After the death of Louisa Hunnewell Gunther Fărcășanu, Fărcășanu donated the entire holdings of his Franklin Mott Gunther Foundation to the Adormirea Maicii Domnului (Dormition of the Theotokos) Church in Cleveland, Ohio, and to the church's museum. The church was founded on August 15, 1904, as the first Romanian Orthodox church in the United States. He spent the last years of life in his house in the Georgetown district of Washington, D.C., being cared for by his sisters Margareta Bottea and Mia Lahovari and by his niece Domnica Bottea. He had a quiet life playing the violin daily and spending the majority of his time reading. He met frequently with Constantin Vișoianu, with whom he had collaborated to organise a Romanian resistance in exile. He never tried to write his memoirs or other literary works. Mihail Fărcășanu died on July 14, 1987, at the age of 79, not long before the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989.

It was reissued in 1972 by Pocket Books, in 2003 by Vintage and in 2006 by New York Review Books Classics with an introduction by John McGahern.John Williams, Stoner, New York: New York Review Books, 2003. Stoner has been categorized under the genre of the academic novel, or the campus novel.Wiegenstein, Steve (1990–94), \\"The Academic Novel and the Academic Ideal: John Williams' Stoner\\", The McNeese Review 33. Stoner follows William Stoner's undistinguished career and workplace politics, his marriage to Edith, his affair with his colleague Katherine, and his love and pursuit of literature. Despite receiving little attention upon its publication in 1965, Stoner has seen a sudden surge of popularity and critical praise since its republication in the 2000s. Plot William Stoner is born on a small farm in 1891. After high school, the county agent advises he go to agriculture school. Stoner enrolls in the University of Missouri, where all agriculture students must take a survey course in English literature during their sophomore year. The literature he encounters in this introductory course, such as Shakespeare's Sonnet 73, opens a gateway to a new world for him, and he quickly falls in love with literary studies. Without telling his parents, Stoner quits the agriculture program and studies only the humanities. Archer Sloane, a professor, suggests to Stoner that his love of knowledge means that he should become a teacher. When his parents come for his graduation, Stoner tells them he will not be returning to the farm. He completes his MA in English and begins teaching. In graduate school, he befriends fellow students Gordon Finch and Dave Masters. Masters suggests that all three are using graduate school to avoid the real world, and that the academic life is the only life available to all three and they would be failures outside of it. World War I begins, and Gordon and Dave enlist. Stoner decides to remain in school during the war. Masters is killed in France, while Finch sees action and becomes an officer. When Stoner completes his PhD work, he is hired by the University, against its usual policy, because the war has reduced the number of faculty. When the armistice is signed, a party is held for the returning veterans, where Stoner meets an attractive young woman named Edith. Edith acts withdrawn to Stoner's advances, though agrees to his repeated visits. Very soon he proposes marriage. When her parents consent to the marriage, Edith tells Stoner she will try to be a good wife to him, and they marry a few weeks later. Finch returns from the war to the University, which gives him an administrative position and a small sinecure because of his war service. Stoner’s marriage to Edith is bad from the start. It gradually becomes clear that Edith has profound emotional problems and treats Stoner inconsiderately throughout their marriage. Edith tries sporadically to be a homemaker and hostess, alternating between periods of intense, almost feverish activity and longer periods of indolence, indifference, and bouts of illness. After three years of marriage, Edith suddenly informs Stoner that she wants a baby. When she gets pregnant, she once again becomes uninterested in him. When their daughter Grace is born, Edith remains inexplicably bedridden for nearly a year, and Stoner largely cares for their child alone. At the university, Stoner has reworked his dissertation into a published book and is promoted to associate professor with tenure. Without consulting Stoner, Edith accepts a $6,000 loan from her father to buy a house, a loan that Stoner fears they cannot afford. Despite the additional teaching he takes on to pay off the loan, he gradually enters a happy period: He grows close with his young daughter, who spends most of her time with him in his study. Because of the larger house, Stoner's study is his retreat, which he decorates, builds furniture for, and cleans. Returning from a few months with her mother in St. Louis after Black Friday and the suicide of her father, Edith reveals that she has decided to reinvent her manner, dress, and attitude. For short periods, Edith throws herself into outside activities like community theatre, though these interests never last long. She becomes alternately inattentive and oppressive in her relationship with Grace, and Stoner gradually realizes that Edith is waging a campaign to separate him from his daughter emotionally. Edith periodically disrupts Stoner’s study, eventually throwing him out of it so she can take up sculpture, which she never does. Stoner is increasingly forced to spend his free time working at the university instead of at home. For the most part, Stoner accepts Edith's mistreatment. He begins to teach with more enthusiasm, but still, year in and year out, his marriage with Edith remains perpetually unsatisfactory and fraught. Grace becomes an unhappy, secretive child who smiles and laughs often but is emotionally hollow. At the University, Finch becomes the acting dean of the faculty. He continues to become a better teacher and wins admiration from students, though his grasp of school politics is meagre and his colleagues mostly ignore him. Stoner feels compelled by his conscience to fail a student named Charles Walker, a close protégé of a colleague, Professor Hollis Lomax. Stoner fails Walker first in a graduate seminar and then soon afterwards on Walker’s preliminary orals. Unlike Lomax, Stoner does not believe that Walker’s verbal agility sufficiently compensates for his sparse knowledge of the literary canon. In addition, Stoner finds Walker to be lazy and dishonest, thus unsuited to graduate work. Thereafter, Lomax takes every opportunity to exact revenge upon Stoner for his intransigence on the Walker matter. Lomax begins assigning Stoner to teach the least desirable introductory classes, despite Stoner being by then one of the senior faculty members in the department. Around this time, a collaboration between Stoner and a younger instructor in the department, Katherine Driscoll, develops into a romantic love affair. Ironically, after the affair begins, Stoner’s relationships with Edith and Grace also improve. At some point, Edith finds out about the affair, but does not seem to mind it. When Lomax learns about it, however, he begins to pressure on Katherine, who also teaches in the English department. Stoner and Driscoll agree it best to end the affair so as not to derail the academic work they both feel called to follow. Katherine quietly slips out of town, never to be seen again by him. The summer after Katherine leaves town, Stoner becomes ill and seems to age rapidly. As world events like the Great Depression and the Spanish Civil War proceed apace, Stoner rededicates himself to his work. Once more, he sees students leaving the university to fight in war. Stoner begins presenting advanced material to incoming first-year students. Lomax is limited in his ability to counter this, as general University policy involves each teacher having absolute authority over her coursework. After Finch, who by now has become a full dean and is one of the most powerful people on campus, laughs at Lomax's attempts to sabotage Stoner, Lomax finally relents and begins to assign Stoner advanced classes again. Stoner, older now and hard of hearing, though still a better teacher than most of his colleagues, is beginning to become a legendary figure in the English department. He begins to spend more time at home, ignoring Edith's signs of displeasure at his presence. Grace, meanwhile, 17 and a high school senior, begins to socialize more. Stoner has been saving money for Grace to attend an Eastern college, but Edith will not hear of Grace going away, and forces Grace enroll at University of Missouri. The following year, Grace announces she is pregnant. Her mother takes Grace’s pregnancy very badly, but Stoner is supportive. Grace marries the father of her child five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Grace’s husband enlists in the army, and dies before the baby is born. Grace goes to St. Louis with the baby to live with her husband's parents. She visits Stoner and Edith occasionally, and Stoner realizes that Grace has developed a drinking problem. As Stoner’s mandatory retirement age is approaching, he wishes to continue teaching as long as possible, though Lomax offers him a promotion to retire early. Stoner learns that he has cancer and must retire immediately. As Stoner’s life is coming to an end, his daughter Grace comes to visit him. Deeply unhappy and addicted to alcohol, Grace half-heartedly tries to reconcile with Stoner, and he sees that his daughter, like her mother, will never be happy. When Grace leaves, Stoner feels as though the young child that he loved died long ago. Gordon Finch visits Stoner almost daily, but when Stoner brings up Dave Masters, Finch withdraws internally from the dying Stoner. Stoner thinks back over his life. The pain medication that he is taking sometimes makes it difficult to think clearly. He thinks about where he failed, and wonders if he could have been more loving to Edith, if he could have been stronger or if he could have helped her more. Later, he believes that he is wrong to think of himself as failing. During an afternoon when he is all alone, he sees various young students passing by on their way to class outside his window, and dies while touching a copy of the one book that he published years earlier as a young professor. Characters The novel focuses on William Stoner and the central figures in his life. Those who become his enemies are used as tools against him who separate Stoner from his loves. New Yorker contributor Tim Kreider describes their depictions as \\"evil marked with deformity.\\" * William Stoner: The novel's main character, called \\"Stoner\\" throughout the book, is a farm boy turned English professor. He uses his love of literature to deal with his unfulfilling home life. * Edith Bostwick Stoner: Stoner's wife, a neurotic woman, is from a strict and sheltered upbringing. Stoner falls in love with the idea of her, but soon realizes that she is bitter and has been long before they were married. * Grace Stoner: Stoner and Edith's only child, Grace is easily influenced by her mother. Edith keeps Grace away from and against her father as a sort of \\"punishment\\" for Stoner, because of the couple's failing relationship. * Gordon Finch: Stoner's colleague and only real ally and friend, he has known Stoner since their graduate school days, and becomes the dean of the college of Arts and Sciences. His affable and outgoing demeanor contrasts with that of Stoner. * David Masters: Stoner's friend from graduate school, he is killed in action during the Great War, but his words have a continuing impact on Stoner's worldview. * Archer Sloane: Stoner's teacher and mentor growing up, he inspired Stoner to leave agriculture behind and begin studying English literature. He is old and ailing by the time Stoner is hired at the university. * Hollis Lomax: Sloane's \\"replacement\\" at the university, Stoner and he began as friends, but Stoner eventually sees him as an \\"enemy\\". Stoner and Lomax do not see eye-to-eye in their work life. He is described as a hunchback. * Charles Walker: Lomax's crippled mentee, he is an arrogant and duplicitous young man who uses rhetorical flourish to mask his scholarly ineptitude. He also becomes an enemy to Stoner. * Katherine Driscoll: A younger teacher, she has an affair with Stoner. University politics and circumstantial differences keep them from continuing a relationship. Themes In the novel's introduction, John McGahern says Stoner is a \\"novel about work.\\" This includes not only traditional work, such as Stoner's life on the farm and his career as a professor, but also the work one puts into life and relationships. One of the central themes in the novel is the manifestation of passion. Stoner's passions manifest themselves into failures, as proven by the bleak end of his life. Stoner has two primary passions: knowledge and love. According to Morris Dickstein, \\"he fails at both.\\" Love is also a widely recognized theme in Stoner. The novel's representation of love moves beyond romance; it highlights bliss and suffering that can be qualities of love. Both Stoner and Lomax discovered a love of literature early in their lives, and it is this love that ultimately endures throughout Stoner's life. Another of the novel's central themes is the social reawakening, which is closely linked to the sexual reawakening of the protagonist. After the loss of his wife and daughter, Stoner seeks fulfillment elsewhere, beginning the affair with Katherine Driscoll. Edwin Frank, the editor at NYRB Classics responsible for the 2005 reissue of the novel, suggests that Stoner contains many existential elements. \\"I don’t think it’s a mistake to hear Camus behind it,\\" Frank suggests, \\"this story of a lone man against the world choosing his life, such as it is. I sometimes say the books a bit like an Edward Hopper painting, wooden houses casting stark shadows on blank green lawns.\\" Style John McGahern's Introduction to Stoner and Adam Foulds of The Independent praise Williams' prose for its cold, factual plainness.McGahern, John, Introduction. Stoner. By John Williams. New York: New York Review Books, 2003. Print. Foulds claims that Stoner has a \\"flawless narrative rhythm [that] flows like a river.\\" Williams' prose has also been applauded for its clarity, by both McGahern and Charlotte Heathcote of The Daily Express. In an interview with the BBC, author Ian McEwan calls Williams' prose \\"authoritative\\". Sarah Hampson of The Globe and Mail writes that Williams' \\"description of petty academic politics reads like the work of someone taking surreptitious notes at dreary faculty meetings.\\" Williams' prose has also been lauded for its precision, making the novel's emotions universally relatable. Background John Williams had a similar life to that of his character in Stoner. He was an English professor at the University of Denver until he retired in 1985. Like Stoner, he experienced coworker frustrations in the academic world and was devoted to this work, making his novel a reflection of parts of his own life, though in the preface to the novel Williams states that it is entirely \\"a work of fiction\\" and bears no resemblance to any people or events he experienced in his time at the University of Missouri. The life of academic poet J. V. Cunningham also seems to have partially inspired the novel. Reception Stoner was initially published in 1965 and sold fewer than 2,000 copies. It was out of print a year later, then reissued as a mass-market paperback in 1972 by Pocket Books, reissued again in 1998 by the University of Arkansas Press and then in 2003 in paperback by Vintage and 2006 by New York Review Books Classics. French novelist Anna Gavalda translated Stoner in 2011, and it became Waterstones' Book of the Year in Britain in 2012. In 2013, sales to distributors tripled. Although Stoner was not a popular novel when it was first published, there were a handful of glowing reviews such as that from The New Yorker on June 12, 1965, in which Williams was praised for creating a character who is dedicated to his work but cheated by the world. Those who gave positive feedback pointed to the truthful voice with which Williams wrote about life's conditions, and they often compared Stoner to his other work, Augustus, in characters and plot direction. One piece of negative criticism came from Williams' own publisher in 1963, who questioned Stoner's potential to gain popularity and become a best seller. Irving Howe and C.P. Snow also gave praise to the novel when it was first published, although sales of the novel did not reflect this positive commentary. It was not until several years later during Stoner’s republication that the book became more well-known. After being re-published and translated into a number of languages, the novel has \\"sold hundreds of thousands of copies in 21 countries\\". Williams' novel is jointly praised for its narrative and stylistic value. In a 2007 review of the recently reissued work, scholar and book critic Morris Dickstein acclaims the writing technique as remarkable and says the novel \\"takes your breath away\\". Bryan Appleyard's review quotes critic D.G. Myers saying that the novel was a good book for beginners in the world of \\"serious literature\\". Another critic, author Alex Preston, points out that the novel shows the depressing progression through a person’s life that was written by \\"the dead hand of realism\\". In 2010, critic Mel Livatino noted that \\"[in] nearly fifty years of reading fiction, I have never encountered a more powerful novel—and not a syllable of it sentimental.\\"Mel Livatino, \\"A Sadness Unto the Bone - John Williams's Stoner, The Sewanee Review, 118:3, p. 417. Writer Steve Almond wrote a review of Stoner in The New York Times Magazine in 2014. Almond claims Stoner focuses on the \\"capacity to face the truth of who we are in private moments\\" and questions whether or not any of us are truly able to say we are able to do that. Almond states, \\"I devoured it in one sitting. I had never encountered a work so ruthless in its devotion to human truths and so tender in its execution.\\" Sarah Hampson of The Globe and Mail sees Stoner as an \\"antidote\\" to a 21st-century culture of entitlement. She says that the novel came back to public attention at a time when people feel entitled to personal fulfillment, at the cost of their own morality, and Stoner shows that there can be value even in a life that seems failed. In 2013 it was named Waterstones Book of the Year and The New Yorker called it \\"the greatest American novel you've never heard of.\\" Writing in the Washington Post in 2015, literary critic Elaine Showalter was less enthusiastic, noting that she, \\"along with other female readers, [is] put off by Williams’s misogyny.\\" Adaptations In 2015, a film adaptation of the novel was reportedly in production by Blumhouse Productions, Cohen Media Group and Film4. Casey Affleck is set to star as Stoner. ReferencesExternal links *\\"The Greatest American Novel You've Never Heard of\\".

Biography  He arrived in the Colony of British Columbia in 1858, along with many other black people from California encouraged to move to the colony by Governor James Douglas, and took up land near modern-day Quesnel. He and his neighbour at Quensellemouthe, Robert Giscome, explored and established a major route to the Peace River Gold Rush at what became known as Giscome Portage, connecting the northern bend of the Fraser River with the Parsnip River, thereby connecting the Fort George area to the Peace and, by a roundabout route, to the Omineca River goldfields. They explored the Peace, Nation and Smoky Rivers, as reported in a column in the British Colonist, December 15, 1863. They prospected on Germansen Creek in the Omineca area in 1870, but in 1874, like thousands of others, went to the Cassiar Country following reports of rich gold deposits around Dease Lake. McDame and Giscome, with other partners, formed the Discovery Company and staked on what became known as McDame's Creek (McDame Creek today). British Columbia Mines Reports for 1874 for this area, by Gold Commissioner J.H. Sullivan, comment \\"I learn that a new creek has been discovered...now known as McDame's Creek [...] Within 30 days they had extracted gold valued at $6000\\" (approx. $250,000 today). In 1877, McDame Creek was the location of the find of a gold nugget weighing 72 ounces, worth $1,300 at the time (≈$52,000 today) and which is the largest nugget found in British Columbia's history.Notes on Placer Mining in British Columbia, British Columbia Dept of Mines Bulletin No. 21, originally published in 1946. McDame mined with his partners in this area until the early 1880s, when McDame returned to the Omineca, discovering gold on Lorne Creek in 1884. He broke later in the year and wound up in a hospital in Victoria, British Columbia. He returned to the Omineca after his recovery, staking with a new partner, Sam Booth, and died in that region some time before 1901. Legacy In addition to McDame Creek, also named for him was McDame, originally known as McDame Post or McDame's Creek Post, which was sold to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1875 and has also been known as Fort McDame. McDames Creek Indian Reserve No.2 is located in the same area and is named for the creek, which in the Kaska language is known as Kasha (the source word for the term \\"Cassiar\\", referring to fibrous rock—or a crow). McDame also prospected in other areas, such as the Skeena, which was another route to both the Omineca and Cassiar gold districts; there he conferred a few placenames including Chimdemash Creek, the meaning of which is not known.

Biography Montero Duque was born in Matanzas, Cuba. In 1950, he graduated from the Military Academy of the Cuban Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant, eventually assuming the rank of Major. His military career can be traced to battles against the guerrilla forces of Fidel Castro. In 1956, Major Duque was instrumental in leading the Cuban Army during the regime of Fulgencio Batista against Castro and his rebel forces in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra in Oriente Province. After the Cuban Revolution of January 1, 1959, Duque was wanted by the revolutionary courts, accused of having committed human rights abuses against the civilian population during his service in Oriente. He fled Cuba, assisted by Pepe San Román.Rodriguez, Juan Carlos. 1999. Bay of Pigs and the CIA. Ocean Press Melbourne. , pp. 79, 187. During the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, he commanded the Infantry Battalion No.5 of Brigade 2506. He was one of 1,189 members of Brigade 2506 captured by Cuban government forces. Duque was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The Cuban government agreed to release all but nine of them a year later, when the United States ransomed the prisoners for $53 million in food and medicine. Eight men remained, and later, the Cuban government released six more. One died and the second-to-last, Montero Duque (having spent 25 years in a Havana prison), was finally released.

State Representative Weaver (center) in Lancaster, Tennessee. Biography=Early life and career= Weaver was born in Mansfield, Ohio, United States. It was in the mid-1970s that, at the invitation of her aunt, she moved to Dallas, Texas. \\"Disco was the happening thing at the time, the Saturday Night Fever stuff of which I was never a fan,\\" says Weaver. Weaver asked the manager if he would be interested in letting her play guitar and sing during one of the \\"Happy Hour\\" slots. The manager agreed and it was enough for her Dallas debut. She added players until it formed a trio. Then they started a band. The band was called \\"Terri Lynn and Texas Tea\\". They played drums, bass guitar, electric guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, mandolin and she played rhythm guitar. They played a number of clubs and other gigs over the next few years, but it wasn't until a friend at a radio station introduced her to the music of EmmyLou Harris that she adopted a style long used in the industry, \\"a girl and her guitar.\\" It was while she was waitressing at a club called Barny Ol'fields, that she would meet her husband, Mike. She invited him to see her play in Grapevine, Texas that Friday and Saturday night. Mike Weaver has since been an inspiration in her career, even encouraging her to sing to him while on trips in the car. They married on June 23, 1979. =Representative Weaver= Weaver ran a campaign against incumbent Rep. Frank Buck (D) in 2006. Though Rep. Buck retained his seat in the house he later announced he would not run again. Weaver was able to run another campaign the following election. Weaver was elected to the 40th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 2008 to present filling the vacant seat of Rep. Frank Buck (D) She serves in the 106th General Assembly as a member of the House Agriculture Committee, the House Children & Family Affairs Committee, the House Education Committee, the House K-12 Subcommittee, and the House Domestic Relations Subcommittee. Weaver was indirectly responsible for the surprise 2009 Tennessee House of Representatives election of TNGA House Speaker Kent Williams, R-Elizabethton (and concurrently, the defeat of Rep. Jason Mumpower, R-Bristol) as Weaver's first vote within the House of Representatives sided with the Tennessee House Democrats on the recess motion prior to the January 14, 2009 vote for the Speaker of the House. The Tennessee House Republicans tried to block the recess, but lost on a 50–49 vote. Weaver supported a Tennessee law that allows prosecutors to charge women with criminal assault if they use narcotics during pregnancy and the fetus or newborn is found \\"addicted to or harmed by the drug\\". The bill, if it became law would be dangerous to the fetus by removing medical treatment while in the womb and the doctors in the Salon article (cited above) also stated that, in spite of the supporters' state, babies are not born \\"addicted\\". The bill passed and Governor Haslam signed it into law. In 2016, the Legislature refused to renew it.Huff Post, Melissa Jeltsen, 03/23/2016 On September 13, 2016, Weaver was one of just two House Representatives who voted \\"opposed\\" to the expulsion of fellow troubled lawmaker Jeremy Durham over allegations of sexual harassment, campaign finance violations, and tax evasion. Sixteen House members abstained – largely over was they felt was a lack of due process in the matter. Courtroom \\"due process\\" was not necessary, the House legislative's due process was followed. In February 2017, Weaver introduced a bill that would classify children born through artificial insemination as illegitimate, even if both parents are married and consent to the insemination. Weaver defended the bill in a subsequent Facebook post, claiming it was intended only to repeal a statute that the state Attorney General had deemed unconstitutional. However, in reviewing Weaver's argument, Snopes concluded that it rests on a \\"fairly significant misreading\\" of the Attorney General's views and existing Tennessee law. The bill did not pass. (Legislative history, Tn General Assembly) Community involvement Weaver was previously chairman of Farm Bureau and is currently Vice Chairman of the Smith County Republican Party and Chairman of Smith County Republican Women. She is also a member of the Smith County Chamber of Commerce, the local Rotary Club, and the National Rifle Association.

He provided a recital at the town hall in November, and The Advertisers critic opined, \\"The young pianist proved quite equal to the demands of the difficult composition, and his interpretation was decidedly effective.

No chorus is introduced.\\" Kate Bowan of the Journal of Music Research Online observed, \\"[he] produced an enormous amount of music, particularly during the 1920s. Some of the music written during this decade, such as the Formula Series, a set of piano preludes, places him in the world of transnational modernism.\\" His works include an opera The Nightingale and the Rose from The Happy Prince and Other Tales. He worked with the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a pianist, radio lecturer and conductor of the state's studio orchestra in the 1930s. From 1935 to 1940 he was a music critic for The Advertiser and then for the News. He retired in the late 1940s. His son, Arthur Brewster-Jones, was the conductor of the Adelaide Stringster Orchestra. Hooper Brewster-Jones' last performance was the D minor Mozart piano concerto with his son's orchestra – he died of a heart attack fifteen minutes later. Upon his death, Hooper Brewster-Jones left his wife, two of three sons and a daughter. He is the grandfather of John and Rick Brewster, who are the founder members of hard rockers, the Angels.

Dimitar Dimitrov Agura (; 26 October 1849–11 October 1911) was a Bulgarian historian, one of the first professors of history at Sofia University and a rector of the university. Agura was born to a Bessarabian Bulgarian family in Chushmelia, Bessarabia, then part of the Romania (today Krynychne, Odessa Oblast, Ukraine). He started his education in Bolgrad and finished the seminary in Iaşi, Romania, in 1868. Agura graduated in history from the University of Iaşi in 1872. He proceeded to work as a teacher in Bârlad (1872–1874) and a school inspector in Iaşi and Vaslui. For several years, he taught Romanian language and Bulgarian history at the Bolhrad High School (1875–1878). With the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Dimitar Agura arrived in the newly established Principality of Bulgaria and worked as a clerk at the Ministry of Interior (1879–1883). He was an interim Minister of Popular Enlightenment in Leonid Sobolev's cabinet (1883). After that, he was director of the Sofia (1884–1885) and Plovdiv (1885–1889) men's high schools. The Sofia University was founded in 1888 and Agura became a lecturer of history at the university in 1889. He was rector of Sofia University three times (1889–1890, 1892–1895, 1907–1908). He was the university's second rector, after fellow Bessarabian Bulgarian Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan. In 1900, Agura became an acting member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 1901, he was among the founders of the Bulgarian Historical Society; he remained its chairman until his death. Dimitar Agura died in 1911 in Iaşi, where he was attending the University of Iaşi's 50th anniversary celebrations.

History Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, 2013 His majesty King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands commemorated the long-lasting bonding between the Netherlands and the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in Israel (President Shimon Peres' dinner 2013): “It was a Dutch banker from The Hague, Jacobus Kann, who made possible the purchase of the land on which the first modern districts of Tel Aviv were built, more than 100 years ago.” Jacobus Henricus Kann (1872-1944) was a Jewish Dutch banker and owner of the private bank NV Bankierskantoor van Lissa & Kann (ABN AMRO Bank), among his clientele were members of the Dutch royal family, a founder of Bank Otzar Hityashvut Hayehudim and Bank Anglo Palestine (Bank Leumi), and an affluent investor in companies as the Palestine Potash Limited (Dead Sea Works) and Frutarom. Kann sponsored many of Hertzel activities and the zionist conferences and purchased the land for Achuzat Bait- the seed of Tel-Aviv. Kann arrived to Jerusalem for a third time in 1924 with his family and was nominated as the first Consul of the Netherlands in Jerusalem (1924–27). Kann died on October 7, 1944 in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. In 1947, the Netherlands voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1949. The Netherlands was initially among the most supportive countries of Israel in Europe. It was one of the few countries to establish an embassy in Jerusalem, whereas most countries preferred placing their embassies in the Tel Aviv area until the final status of Jerusalem was resolved. Following the Six-Day War, the Dutch people raised about $4.2 million for Israel in donations. After the Soviet Union cut off diplomatic relations with Israel due to the Six-Day War, the Dutch Embassy in Moscow established an Israel interests' section which represented Israel in the Soviet Union until diplomatic relations were reestablished in January 1991.\\"They did not dwell alone.

In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, the Netherlands was one of only two European countries (the other being Portugal) that allowed American aircraft ferrying military equipment to Israel as part of Operation Nickel Grass to use its airbases. The Netherlands also supplied Israel with military equipment during the war, primarily engines, spare parts, and shells for its British-built Centurion tanks after the British government had imposed an arms embargo on Israel and thus cut off Israel's original source for this material, but also parts and munitions for light AMX tanks, artillery ammunition, and aircraft bombs.The Netherlands and the Oil Crisis: Business as Usual, p. 27-30 A number of Dutch truck drivers worked in Israel during the war to replace Israeli truck drivers who had been called up for military service. In 1980, following the Jerusalem Law and a UN Resolution asking member states to withdraw their Jerusalem embassies in response, the Dutch government moved its embassy from Jerusalem. Dutch forces were deployed as part of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force in Lebanon, and during the 1982 Lebanon War, a unit of Dutch peacekeepers was one of the few UNIFIL units that attempted to obstruct the Israeli advance. The Dutch soldiers put up obstacles that damaged two Israeli tanks, but the Israeli armored column ultimately forced its way through their position.Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel, p. 41 The Embassy of Israel in the Netherlands is located in this building in The Hague. (May 2014) During the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq launched Scud missile attacks against Israel in the hopes of provoking an Israeli counterattack and thus rupturing the Coalition, which included Arab countries. Israel agreed not to attack Iraq in exchange for protection, and Coalition Patriot missile batteries were deployed in Israel to counter the Scud attacks. The Royal Netherlands Air Force deployed a patriot missile squadron to Israel and Turkey. The Dutch Defense Ministry later confirmed that the Patriot missiles had been largely ineffective, but the psychological value was high. The Netherlands has an embassy in Ramat Gan, an information office in Jerusalem and two honorary consulates in Eilat and Haifa. Israel has an embassy in The Hague.

It is playfully known by its residents as \\"4 miles from everywhere\\" because of its situation at from Thurmont, Woodsboro, Rocky Ridge, and Lewistown. The town consists of about 40 buildings, including three churches and a small school building. A number of the buildings in the town can be classified as historical and the ruins of older buildings can also be found. Creagerstown is additionally the home to both Creagerstown Park and Creagerstown Cemetery. Maryland Route 550 passes through Creagerstown on its way towards Loys Station in the form of Creagerstown Road. History=Founding= The town originally grew up as an important crossroads for stagecoaches around a major Indian trail known as the Monocacy Road. The Monocacy Road connected the area to Pennsylvania and Virginia. Creagerstown is located at a crossroads where the Monocacy Road connected to another road that ran between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. The earliest settlement of the area was in the early 1700s by German immigrants. Sometime between 1760 and 1770, John Creager laid out Creagerstown, which would eventually supplant nearby Monocacy. =Growth= Creagerstown before the 1914 fire. The town experienced steady growth for a number of years. In 1775, the first house in Creagerstown was built by Isaac Kolb. In 1785, a tannery opened in town; it would operate until 1810. Around the same time that the tannery closed, a German brewery opened in Creagerstown. In 1866, the church from Monocacy was reconstructed in Creagerstown and became known as Union Bethel Church. By 1858 Creagerstown contained a doctor's office, two stores, a hotel, a church, a parsonage, and a school. Growing further by 1873, Creagerstown also contained a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and another church. By 1910, the population of Creagerstown was 200. At one point, there was a tavern on every corner in the town square. =Fire of June 2, 1914= Postcard from 1914 showing the destruction caused by the fire. On June 2, 1914, around 10 am, a major fire broke out in Monocacy Valley Creamery and destroyed about 30 buildings, causing somewhere between $60,000 and $70,000 worth of damages. The fire was caused accidentally when a spark from a fire set by a man in the creamery ignited the roof. Strong winds fanned the flames, allowing the blaze to cross the road and gaps between buildings. Creagerstown had no fire department to put out the fire. The town hall was burned down and the fire also destroyed all of the hotels owned by the Valentine family, though the Valley Hotel was eventually rebuilt. Between 1920 and 1930 a number of houses in the town were reconstructed. But by 1930 other road improvements and other highways, such as the Frederick and Emmitsburg railroads, had been constructed throughout Frederick and Creagerstown never recovered. Historical buildings Most of the buildings in Creagerstown were built between the early 19th century and early 20th century and are made out of log, brick, or stone. The Maryland State Historic Sites Inventory Form for Creagerstown states that \\"the town demonstrates building forms spanning over 100 years.\\" Many of the houses have smaller agricultural buildings in the back of their lots. Most of the commercial buildings are located towards the center of the town. There are a number of notable historical buildings in Creagerstown including the Georgian- style farmhouse Strawberry Hill which is located on Creagerstown Road and is not in the town proper, but is located in the Creagerstown Election District. Along with Pennterra, Strawberry Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. St. John's Church, built in 1908 and located on Blacks Mill Rd, is also in Creagerstown. St. John's Church was built to replace the original St. John's Lutheran Church which was built in the 1850s. Still standing in the town is a small schoolhouse, built in 1855, and the Union Bethel church, a one-story stone church built in 1866.

The chilled water can either be used immediately or be stored for the short- or long-term. When outdoor temperatures are lower relative to indoor temperatures, this system utilizes the cool outdoor air as a free cooling source. In this manner, the system replaces the chiller in traditional air conditioning systems while achieving the same cooling result. Such systems can be made for single buildings or district cooling networks. Operation For a human-powered version, see yakhchal. When the ambient air temperature drops to a set temperature, a modulating valve allows all or part of the chilled water to by-pass an existing chiller and run through the free cooling system, which uses less power and uses the lower ambient air temperature to cool the water in the system. This can be achieved by installing an air blast cooler with any existing chiller or on its own. During low ambient temperatures, an installation can by-pass an existing chiller giving energy savings of up to 75%, without compromising cooling requirements. In heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in winter months, large commercial buildings interior spaces may need cooling, even while perimeter spaces may need heating.McQuiston, Faye C., Jerald D. Parker and Jeffrey D. Spitler. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005. Free cooling is the production of chilled water without the use of a chiller, and can be used generally in the late fall, winter and early spring, in temperate zones.Kelly, David W. \\"Free Cooling Considerations\\". Heating, Piping, Air Conditioning (1996): 51-57. Free cooling is not entirely free since the chiller is still operational.  Methods  Assuming that the system can utilize free cooling, there are three ways to use free cooling: =Strainer cycle= The cooling tower water can be directly linked into the flow through the chilled water circuit. If the cooling tower is open then a strainer is required to eliminate any debris that could accumulate within the tower. The cost savings are associated with the limited use of the water chiller energy. There is an increased risk of corrosion using this method. =Plate and frame heat exchanger= A heat exchanger will transfer heat directly from the chilled water loop to the cooling tower loop. The exchanger keeps the cooling tower water separate from the coolant flowing through the cooling coils. The chiller water is thus pre-cooled. An energy savings is due to reduced chiller loading and thus a reduction in energy consumption. There is an increase in cost due to the pump needing to compensate for the pressure differences. =Refrigeration migration= A valve arrangement within the water chiller opens a direct path between the condenser and the evaporator. The relatively warm fluid in the chiller loop vaporizes the refrigerant, and the energy is carried directly to the condenser, where it is cooled and condensed by the water from the cooling tower. This method is driven by the idea that the refrigerant tends to move towards the coldest point in a refrigeration circuit. The cost savings associated with this method are due to the compressor’s inactivity, since the blower, fans and pumps are all operational.  Seasons =High ambient temperature= When the process return water temperature is equal to or lower than the ambient air temperature Free Cooling is not suitable. The system’s three way valve will bypass the free cooling heat exchanger and direct the fluid flow through the chillers to be cooled to the required set point temperature. =Mid-season operation= For mid-season operation the water is partially cooled by the compressor and partially by the ambient temperatures. The percentage of Free Cooling achieved mid-season is dependent on seasonal temperatures although partial Free Cooling commences when the ambient air temperature is below the process return water temperature. The water is partially cooled through the Free Cooler then flows through the chillers to achieve the required set point temperature. =Winter operation= In winter, when outdoor temperatures are low enough, the water is chilled solely by the Free Cooling coil. This allows the chillers’ compressors to stop operating, saving significant amounts of energy. The only electrical power used in winter operation is for fan operation. This can be achieved once the ambient air temperature is to below the process supply water temperature.  Limitations  Freezing can occur once the ambient air temperature gets below . Another limitation is the temperature difference across the heat exchanger. A heat exchanger that has a very low temperature difference across can become economically unrealistic. The economics of the heat exchanger allow for a minimum free cooling water temperature of about .  Data centers and server rooms =Energy efficiency= Data centers account for 2% of the Global Electricity Consumption. United Kingdom: In 2013, Chancellor George Osborne agreed to make a concession for data centers to be exempt from Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) and allow them to produce their own Climate Change Agreement (CCA). This is also recognised by a new European Commission to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. Cooling data centers or server rooms requires a lot of energy, therefore free cooling can be an ideal solution to save energy. =Types= There are two free cooling options for a data center or server room with the first one being an integral free cooling coil or a chiller which works alongside a free cooler unit. Integral chillers are ideal for sites which have limited space and can offer high energy efficiency levels. These units feature high quality components including scroll and screw compressors, axial fans, and three-way modulating valves. The other options is an independent free cooler that has a greater capacity for heat exchange, as it is sized to maximise efficiency which enables a larger area for the transfer of thermal energy. Independent free coolers have shown energy savings of up to 70%.

The Act also declared that if Mary died and her heir was not yet 18 if male, or was under 15 and unmarried if female, then Philip would govern the realm until the heir to the throne came of age (or was married, if female). In that event, it would be treason to \\"compass, attempt, and go about to destroy the person of the King, or to remove his Highness from the government\\". =Section 7 - Procedure= Section 7 required trials for \\"any treason\\" (not just treason under this Act) to be conducted in accordance with the common law, \\"and not otherwise\\". =Section 8 - Misprision of treason= Section 8 provided that the concealment or keeping secret of treason constituted misprision of treason but not treason: =Sections 9 to 12 - Further procedure= Section 9 preserved privilege of peerage — the right of peers of the realm to be tried by their peers. Section 10 stipulated that offences against the Act which were committed \\"only by preaching or words\\" must be prosecuted within six months. Section 11 created a new rule of evidence for cases of treason under this Act (but not other treasons). It required all of the witnesses against the defendant (or at least two of them) to attend court to give evidence against him in person, \\"if living and within the realm\\". (The rule did not apply if the defendant pleaded guilty.) Different versions of this two witnesses rule were adopted in the Sedition Act 1661, the Treason Act 1695, and eventually in Article Three of the United States Constitution. The rule was first enacted in the Treason Act 1547.1 Ed. 6 c. 12, s. 22 Section 12 made similar provision to section 7. =Section 13 - Accessories= Section 13 provided the rule for how accessories were to be treated for aiding and abetting a crime for which the penalty depended on whether it was the defendant's first or second offence. An accessory was to receive the same penalty as the principal offender, regardless of whether the accessory had committed the offence before. Repeals The Act, except sections 6 and 8, was repealed on 28 July 1863 by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863.Section 1 and the Schedule.

In the process of combining the separate tracks, their relative levels (i.e. volumes) are adjusted and balanced and various processes such as equalization and compression are commonly applied to individual tracks, groups of tracks, and the overall mix. In stereo and surround sound mixing, the placement of the tracks within the stereo (or surround) field are adjusted and balanced. Audio mixing techniques and approaches vary widely and have a significant influence on the final product. Audio mixing techniques largely depend on music genres and the quality of sound recordings involved. The process is generally carried out by a mixing engineer, though sometimes the record producer or recording artist may assist. After mixing, a mastering engineer prepares the final product for production. Audio mixing may be performed on a mixing console or in a digital audio workstation. History In the late 19th century, Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner developed the first recording machines. The recording and reproduction process itself was completely mechanical with little or no electrical parts. Edison's phonograph cylinder system utilized a small horn terminated in a stretched, flexible diaphragm attached to a stylus which cut a groove of varying depth into the malleable tin foil of the cylinder. Emile Berliner's gramophone system recorded music by inscribing spiraling lateral cuts onto a vinyl disc. Electronic recording became more widely used during the 1920s. It was based on the principles of electromagnetic transduction. The possibility for a microphone to be connected remotely to a recording machine meant that microphones could be positioned in more suitable places. The process was improved when outputs of the microphones could be mixed before being fed to the disc cutter, allowing greater flexibility in the balance. Before the introduction of multitrack recording, all sounds and effects that were to be part of a record were mixed at one time during a live performance. If the recorded mix wasn't satisfactory, or if one musician made a mistake, the selection had to be performed over until the desired balance and performance was obtained. With the introduction of multi- track recording, the production of a modern recording changed into one that generally involves three stages: recording, overdubbing, and mixing. Modern mixing emerged with the introduction of commercial multi-track tape machines, most notably when 8-track recorders were introduced during the 1960s. The ability to record sounds into separate channels meant that combining and treating these sounds could be postponed to the mixing stage. In the 1980s, home recording and mixing became more efficient. The 4-track Portastudio was introduced in 1979. Bruce Springsteen released the album Nebraska in 1982 using one. The Eurythmics topped the charts in 1983 with the song \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\", recorded by band member Dave Stewart on a makeshift 8-track recorder. In the mid-to-late 1990s, computers replaced tape- based recording for most home studios, with the Power Macintosh proving popular. At the same time, digital audio workstations, first used in the mid-1980s, began to replace tape in many professional recording studios. Equipment=Mixing consoles= A simple mixing console A mixer (mixing console, mixing desk, mixing board, or software mixer) is the operational heart of the mixing process. Mixers offer a multitude of inputs, each fed by a track from a multitrack recorder. Mixers typically have 2 main outputs (in the case of two-channel stereo mixing) or 8 (in the case of surround). Mixers offer three main functionalities. # Summing signals together, which is normally done by a dedicated summing amplifier or, in the case of a digital mixer, by a simple algorithm. # Routing of source signals to internal buses or external processing units and effects. # On-board processors with equalizers and compressors. Mixing consoles can be large and intimidating due to the exceptional number of controls. However, because many of these controls are duplicated (e.g. per input channel), much of the console can be learned by studying one small part of it. The controls on a mixing console will typically fall into one of two categories: processing and configuration. Processing controls are used to manipulate the sound. These can vary in complexity, from simple level controls, to sophisticated outboard reverberation units. Configuration controls deal with the signal routing from the input to the output of the console through the various processes. Digital audio workstations (DAW) can perform many mixing features in addition to other processing. An audio control surface gives a DAW the same user interface as a mixing console. The distinction between a large console and a DAW equipped with a control surface is that a digital console will typically consist of dedicated digital signal processors for each channel. DAWs can dynamically assign resources like digital audio signal processing power, but may run out if too many signal processes are in simultaneous use. This overload can often be solved by increasing the capacity of the DAW. =Outboard gear and plugins= Outboard gear (analog) and audio plug-ins (digital) can be inserted into the signal path to extend processing possibilities. Outboard gear and plugins fall into two main categories: *Processors – these devices are normally connected in series to the signal path, so the input signal is replaced with the processed signal. Examples include equalization, dynamic processing (compressors, gates, expanders, and limiters). However, some processors are also used in parallel, as is the case in techniques such as parallel compression/limiting (a.k.a. New York compression) and sidechain equalization. *Effects – these can be considered as any unit that has an effect upon the signal, the term is mostly used to describe units that are connected in parallel to the signal path, and therefore they add to the existing sounds but do not replace them. Examples of common effects include reverb and delay. Some effects are more commonly used in series like chorus, flange, and vibrato. Multiple level controls in signal path A single signal can pass through a large number of level controls, e.g. individual channel fader, subgroup master fader, master fader and monitor volume control. According to audio engineer Tomlinson Holman, problems are created due to the multiplicity of the controls. Each and every console has their own dynamic range and it is important to utilize the controls correctly to avoid excessive noise or distortions. =Processes that affect levels= *Faders – Used to attenuate or boost the level of signals. The most commonly used process is level control, which is used even on the simplest of mixers. *Panning – A panning control, or pan pot, changes the proportional level of a signal that is sent to each speaker in stereo and surround sound systems. This gives the listener the impression that the signal is coming from a particular direction. This process is based on the phenomenon of sound localization, which is the listener's ability to perceive the direction of a sound by the differences in intensity and arrival-time to our left and right ears. *Compressors – A device which attenuates the volume of a track when its volume passes beyond a set threshold. The primary use of a compressor in mixing is to limit the dynamic range of a signal. Compressors are equipped with a number of controls including the threshold, the amount of compression (e.g. Ratio), and how quickly or slowly the compressor acts (e.g. Attack and Release). *Noise gate or expansion – The Expansion device does exactly the opposite of what the compressor does. It increases the volume range of a source and may do so across a wide dynamic range or may be restricted to a narrower region by control functions. Restricting expansion to only low-level sounds helps to minimize noise. This function is often referred to as downward expansion, noise gating, or keying and reduces the level below a threshold set by a specific control. *Limiters – A limiter is a compressor with a Ratio of 10:1 or higher. Some limiters have extremely high (or infinite) ratios, often referred to as a \\"brick-wall\\" limiter, meaning that little to no audio is allowed to surpass the threshold. Limiters are most commonly used in mixing to strictly limit the maximum output volume of a track, bus, or overall mix. Limiters are especially useful in digital mixing to avoid clipping. =Processes that affect frequency response= There are two principle frequency response processes: *Equalizers – The simplest description of EQ is the process of altering the frequency response in a manner similar to what tone controls do on a stereo system. Professional EQs dissect the audio spectrum into three or four parts which may be called the low-bass, mid-bass, mid-treble, and high-frequency controls. *Filters – Filters are used to eliminate certain frequencies from the output. Filters strip off part of the audio spectrum. There are various types of filters. A high-pass filter (low- cut) is used to remove excessive room noise at low frequencies. A low-pass filter (high-cut) is used to help isolate a low-frequency instrument playing in a studio along with others. And a band-pass filter is a combination of high- and low-pass filters, also known as a telephone filter (because a sound lacking in high and low frequencies resembles the quality of sound over a telephone). =Processes that affect time= *Reverbs – Reverbs are used to simulate acoustic reflections in a real room, adding a sense of space and depth to otherwise \\"dry\\" recordings. Another use is to distinguish among auditory objects; all sound having one reverberant character will be categorized together by human hearing in a process called auditory streaming. This is an important technique in creating the illusion of layered sound from in front of the speaker to behind it. Before the advent of electronic reverb and echo processing, physical means were used to generate the effects. An echo chamber, a large reverberant room, could be equipped with a speaker and microphones. Signals were then sent to the speaker and the reverberation generated in the room was picked up by the two microphones. =Processes that affect space= *Panning – While panning is a process that affects levels, it also can be considered a process that affects space since it is used to give the impression of a source coming from a particular direction. Panning allows the engineer to place the sound within the stereo or surround field, giving the illusion of a sound's origin having a physical position. *' creates a stereo-like sound image from monophonic sources. This way the apparent source width or the degree of listener envelopment is increased. A number of pseudostereo recording and mixing techniques are known from the viewpoint of audio engineers and researchers. Downmixing The mixdown process converts a program with a multiple-channel configuration into a program with fewer channels. Common examples include downmixing from 5.1 surround sound to stereo, and stereo to mono. Because these are common scenarios, it is common practice to verify the sound of such downmixes during the production process to ensure stereo and mono compatibility. The alternative channel configuration can be explicitly authored during the production process with multiple channel configurations provided for distribution. For example, on DVD-Audio or Super Audio CD, a separate stereo mix can be included along with the surround mix. Alternatively, the program can be automatically downmixed by the end consumer's audio system. For example, a DVD player or sound card may downmix a surround sound program to stereo for playback through two speakers. Mixing in surround sound Any console with a sufficient number of mix busses can be used to create a 5.1 surround sound mix, but this may be frustrating if the console is not specifically designed to facilitate signal routing, panning and processing in a surround sound environment. Whether working in an analog hardware, digital hardware, or DAW mixing environment, the ability to pan mono or stereo sources and place effects in the 5.1 soundscape and monitor multiple output formats without difficulty can make the difference between a successful or compromised mix. Mixing in surround is very similar to mixing in stereo except that there are more speakers, placed to surround the listener. In addition to the horizontal panoramic options available in stereo, mixing in surround lets the mix engineer pan sources within a much wider and more enveloping environment. In a surround mix, sounds can appear to originate from many more or almost any direction depending on the number of speakers used, their placement and how audio is processed. There are two common ways to approach mixing in surround: *Expanded Stereo – With this approach, the mix will still sound very much like an ordinary stereo mix. Most of the sources, such as the instruments of a band, backing vocals, and so on, are panned between the left and right speakers. Lead sources such as the main vocal are sent to the center speaker. Additionally, reverb and delay effects will often be sent to the rear speakers to create a more realistic sense of being in an acoustic space. For the case of mixing a live recording that was performed in front of an audience, signals recorded by microphones aimed at, or placed among the audience are sent to the rear speakers to make the listener feel as if they are a part of the audience. *Complete Surround/All speakers treated equally – Instead of following the traditional ways of mixing in stereo, this much more liberal approach lets the mix engineer do anything he or she wants. Instruments can appear to originate from anywhere, or even spin around the listener. When done appropriately and with taste, interesting sonic experiences can be achieved, as was the case with James Guthrie's 5.1 mix of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, albeit with input from the band. This is a much different mix from the 1970s quadrophonic mix. Naturally, these two approaches can be combined in any way the mix engineer sees fit. Recently, a third approach to mixing in surround was developed by surround mix engineer Unne Liljeblad. *MSS – Multi Stereo Surround – This approach treats the speakers in a surround sound system as a multitude of stereo pairs. For example, a stereo recording of a piano, created using two microphones in an ORTF configuration, might have its left channel sent to the left-rear speaker and its right channel sent to the center speaker. The piano might also be sent to a reverb having its left and right outputs sent to the left-front speaker and right-rear speaker, respectively. Additional elements of the song, such as an acoustic guitar recorded in stereo, might have its left and right channels sent to a different stereo pair such as the left-front speaker and the right- rear speaker with its reverb returning to yet another stereo pair, the left- rear speaker and the center speaker. Thus, multiple clean stereo recordings surround the listener without the smearing comb-filtering effects that often occur when the same or similar sources are sent to multiple speakers.

History The 1832 meeting house of the Beaver Dam German Baptist Congregation (Church of the Brethren) near Johnsville, Maryland. The 1842 Johnsville Methodist Protestant (United Methodist) Church in Johnsville, Maryland. The town of Johnsville was first settled by English and German immigrants in the 1740s, including the Birely and Iler families. In the 1770s, a congregation of German Baptists or “Dunkers” organized Beaver Dam Church two miles northeast of the present town, the second oldest Church of the Brethren congregation in Frederick County. In the early-19th century, the town of Johnsville developed to serve the needs of travelers on the main road leading from southern Pennsylvania to Frederick, the specific location of the town being almost halfway between Union Bridge and Libertytown. In 1854, the General Assembly of Maryland created a new election district with Johnsville at its center. A map of Frederick County, drawn by Isaac Bond in 1858, records the presence of a hotel, a wheelwright's shop, a blacksmith's shop, two stores, a post office, school, a physician, and two churches (Methodist Episcopal and Methodist Protestant) in Johnsville. Johnsville retains its much of its rural community aesthetic and historical integrity today. Historic structures along the single street through the town document its important role as a place where travelers could obtain necessary services while moving between larger population and commercial centers. A few of the historic structures in Johnsville include the Methodist Protestant Church (today Johnsville United Methodist Church), built in 1842 and displaying intricate brickwork resulting from a later renovation; the Johnsville Schoolhouse, built in 1903; the former Methodist Episcopal Church, a frame Gothic Revival structure built in 1851; the Grove Store, a large compound structure with combined commercial and residential spaces built in 1875 in Italianate style; the Wolf House, a circa 1840 Greek Revival styled house with later Italianate porch; and the Dr. Sidewell House, a compound stone and brick structure reflecting two periods of construction (circa 1810 and 1840). Nearby, the Beaver Dam Church of the Brethren maintains two historic buildings: an 1832 meetinghouse and an 1882 brick meetinghouse.

Family Barbara of Brandenburg was born in the Hohenzollern residence of Ansbach as the tenth of the nineteen children of Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg; she was the fourth child born from his second marriage to Anna of Saxony, daughter of the Wettin elector Frederick II of Saxony. At the time of her birth, her father ruled the Franconian margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach and also inherited the neighbouring Principality of Kulmbach, upon the death of his elder brother Margrave John the Alchemist. In 1471, he succeeded his brother Frederick Irontooth as Elector of Brandenburg.  First marriage  In Berlin on 11 October 1472, eight-year-old Barbara was married to the Silesian Piast Duke Henry XI of Głogów, around thirty years her senior. The marriage contract stipulated that, in case of the duke's death without issue, his Duchy of Głogów was to be passed to his wife, with reversion to her Hohenzollern family. Four years later, on 22 February 1476, Duke Henry XI died suddenly, possibly poisoned by Brandenburg agents. This death left Duchess Barbara of Głogów, with the Duchy of Crossen and Kożuchów, but a long succession war erupted: The Silesian duchy had been a Bohemian fief since 1331, therefore, not only did Henry XI's closest male relative, his cousin Jan II the Mad, former Duke of Żagań, claim the whole inheritance, but also King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and the Anti-King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. To further complicate the matter, half of the duchy was held by Margareta of Celje, widow of Władysław of Głogów. Immediately after the death of Duke Henry XI, Barbara's father, Elector Albrecht Achilles, had the Duchy of Głogów occupied by Brandenburg troops under the command of his son John Cicero of Brandenburg.  Second marriage  In the name of his daughter, Elector Albrecht Achilles appointed Otto von Schenk as provincial administrator.Alexander von Daniels, Handbuch der deutschen Reichs- und Staatenrechtsgeschichte, vol. II, Laupp, 1862, p. 260. Nine months later, Barbara of Brandenburg was married again, this time to King Vladislaus II, who wanted to seize the fief of Głogów to his domains. The wedding, performed by proxy with the Silesian duke Henry I of Münsterberg-Oels acting, took place in the Brandenburg city of Frankfurt (Oder) on 20 August 1476. His furious rival, King Matthias Corvinus, supplied Duke Jan II the Mad with an army to occupy the Głogów lands; however, he was defeated by John Cicero's troops near Crossen in October 1478. At the end of the succession dispute, Barbara, who counted on the support of the Głogów states, after the violent fights with Duke Jan II, finally obtained the Duchy of Crossen, with the towns of Bobrowice, Sulechów, and Lubsko,Gerhard Köbler, Historisches Lexikon der Deutschen Länder: die deutschen Territorien vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart, C.H.Beck, 2007, p. 125. pledged to the Electorate of Brandenburg against Barbara's dowry, a sum of 50,000 florins.Karl Friedrich Pauli, Allgemeine preussische Staatsgeschichte, samt aller dazu gehörigen Königreichs, Churfürstenthums, Herzogthümer, Fürstenthümer, Graf- und Herrschaften, aus bewährten Schriftstellern und Urkunden bis auf gegenwärtige Regierung, vol. VII-VIII, C. P. Francken, 1767, p. 575. Due to war, Barbara couldn't travel to Bohemia for her marriage and coronation in person. Shortly after, King Vladislaus II determined that his unconsummated and only juridical marriage with the Brandenburg princess was useless and began to seek legal separation. This enraged Elector Albert Achilles, who in 1481, obtained a compensation payment; however, with the mediation of the Bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg, he still wanted to continue the marital bond, and even offered his ten-year-old daughter Dorothea of Brandenburg as a replacement to her older sister, if the King did not want Barbara any more. King Vladislaus II refused any other agreement with the House of Hohenzollern, but remained legally married to Barbara although he never saw her. At the death of King Matthias Corvinus on 6 May 1490, the Bohemian King pursued the Hungarian crown too, and in order to obtain more support for this, he secretly married Corvinus' widow, Beatrice of Naples, on 4 October. After the union became public, this caused a scandal because King Vladislaus II was bigamous. This situation lasted for the next ten years, where he became increasingly desperate for an heir, because his Neapolitan wife was unable to bear him children.  Last years  In the meanwhile, Barbara fought against her family for a divorce from King Vladislaus II; also, she became secretly engaged with the Franconian knight, Conrad of Heideck, in 1493. As a punishment for her independent behavior, Barbara was imprisoned at Plassenburg Castle until Conrad broke off the engagement. Five years later, on 7 April 1500, Pope Alexander VI finally dissolved both marriages of King Vladislaus II. Beatrice of Naples retired to Ischia, where she died eight years later. In 1502, the Bohemian-Hungarian King married Anne of Foix- Candale, relative of the kings of France and Navarre, with whom he finally had children. Barbara probably remained in Plassenburg without domains or incomes. Without a doubt, she died in her birthplace, Ansbach, on 4 September 1515, aged fifty-one. She was buried in Heilsbronn.

Some Catho research units are labeled and carried under joint supervision with public universities. These are of two mixed units: CNRS (LEMLEM  UMR 8179, IEMNIEMN  UMR 8520) and two host teams (EA - LGCgE,LGCgE EA - L2EPL2EP). There is also a Clinical Research Center.Clinical Research Center And the medical school maintains a center for Economic Geology, Jardin botanique Nicolas Boulay. For about ten years, Lille Catholic University institutions worked at structuring and strengthening their research activity. At the federation level, this focused on the organization of research, with the appointment of a Vice-president for Research – Cailliez Jean-Charles (2003–2012) and Nicolas Vaillant (2012 - ) – and the creation of a research council of the University. This organization induced structuring of research areas covered by the centers and the faculty of the federation, fostering the emergence of major cross-cutting themes. They share concern for the betterment of life in contemporary society: responsibilities and risks; ethics, care, and loss of autonomy; energy, housing, environment, and sustainable development; innovation, collective intelligence, and new human interactions. Student life Catholic rock group P.U.S.H. performing at Catho =Associations=Student Federation The Federation of Lille Catholic University students (or FEUCL)Student clubs created in 1926 coordinates the 300 campus organizations and represents 17,000 students in the assemblies of Catho at CROUSCROUS or FAGE.FAGE Association of University Support The Association of University Support (AEU)AEU manages 10 residences and Meurein restaurant serving 5000 meals a day, lunch and dinner.

Internal associations in schools and faculties Most schools and faculties have a student office (BDE) or a corporation that deals with both solidarity and culture. BDE and corporations represent their school or faculty to FEUCL. For example, ACEM (Corporate Association of Medical Students), created in 1910, lays claim to being the oldest French student corporation. In addition to the BDE and corporations, schools and faculties of Catho include associations for sports and for humanitarian, cultural, and festive events. =Activities= Students have access to sports activities through the center of Ennetières-en- Weppes of Catho or the gyms of the AEU.

In addition to the restaurant Meurein, there's a sandwich shop, Vauban. Also, the bars and clubs of Lille, in particular in the Massena district and Henninot room, almost daily receive student parties organized by the BDE or other associations. =Housing= The AEU maintains 10 residences for students. Many students live together in the Vauban quarter or the Old Lille, giving that area of the Catho a high concentration of students and low median age. The Foundation of the Catholic University of Lille The Foundation of the Catholic University of Lille was created under the aegis of the Fondation de France to support the general activities of the University: support for teaching and research, support of students, and heritage restoration.

His military career began in 1814 when, as a captain, he raised a company of Maryland volunteers, leading them at both the Battle of Bladensberg and the Battle of North Point, where he was wounded. After the war he rose to become major general and commander-in-chief of the First Light Division, Maryland Militia. During John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, Steuart personally led a detachment of militia, and, as the prospect of civil war drew closer, he was among those who lobbied unsuccessfully for Maryland to secede from the Union. In 1861, at the start of the Civil War, Steuart left his home state of Maryland and joined the Confederacy, though at 71 years of age he was by then considered too old for active service. This did not prevent him from personally riding with Lee's army and even being captured at the First Battle of Manassas. He is sometimes confused with his eldest son, Brigadier General George H. Steuart, who fought for the Confederacy at a number of major battles, eventually surrendering with General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox in 1865. Steuart died in 1867, his health and fortune ruined by his devotion to the Southern \\"lost cause\\".

When compared to the [other] Regiments we were the last that left the ground...had our Regiment not retreated at the time it did we should have been cut off in two minutes.\\" George, p.143 Although North Point was a tactical defeat for the Americans, it would prove a turning point in the War of 1812. The British took significant losses, including their commanding officer Major General Robert Ross, and, lacking the strength to take the city of Baltimore, they eventually withdrew.

On July 19, 1844, the Boston City Greys visited Baltimore, and marched in parade with various companies of the 53rd Regiment. Steuart hosted a party for the visiting militia, which was held at his family estate in West Baltimore, known as Maryland Square. The event was celebrated by extensive coverage in the Baltimore American and, like the previous year's visit from Pennsylvania, was commemorated in a lithograph.Rice, p.119 Steuart also appears to have formed an acquaintance with the social reformer Dorothea Dix, who in July 1850 was his guest at Steuart's country residence Sparrow's Point on the Chesapeake Bay. Also a guest was the Swedish feminist and activist Fredrika Bremer, who wrote in a letter to her sister Agathe: \\"Late in the evening I sat in the most beautiful moonlight with Miss Dix on the veranda of General Stuarts' [sic] house, looking towards the shining river and the wide Chesapeake Bay, listening to the story of her simple yet remarkable life\\".Sjoberg, Leif, American Swedish (1973) Retrieved January 2012 Dix was a campaigner for better treatment of the mentally ill, a subject which was also the life's work of Steuart's brother, the physician Richard Sprigg Steuart. Also among Steuart's social circle was the writer Washington Irving, who was a regular guest at Maryland Square.Richardson, p.226 =Know-Nothing elections= Flag of the Know-Nothing, or American party. Baltimore mayor Thomas Swann persuaded Governor Thomas W. Ligon to stand down Steuart's militia during the 1857 elections. During the mid-1850s public order in Baltimore was threatened by the election of candidates of the Know Nothing party.Andrews, p.475 In October 1856 the Know Nothing Mayor Samuel Hinks was pressed by Baltimorians to order Steuart's militia in readiness to maintain order during the mayoral elections, as violence was anticipated. Hinks duly gave Steuart the order, writing that he should \\"hold yourself with your command, or such portion thereof as you may deem necessary, in readiness to march at a moment's warning, fully armed and equipped for active service\\".Melton, p.103 In response, Steuart ordered his men to \\"assemble in marching order\\" on November 4 and await further orders. However, perhaps fearful of greater violence, the mayor soon rescinded his order.Andrews, p.476 On October 31 he met with Steuart and requested that the general make his soldiers ready, but not assembled, and Steuart duly countermanded his original order. On polling day violence soon broke out, with shots exchanged by competing mobs. In the 2nd and 8th wards several citizens were killed, and many wounded.Andrews, p.477 In the 6th ward artillery was used, and a pitched battle fought on Orleans St between Know Nothings and rival Democrats, raging for several hours. The result of the election, in which voter fraud was widespread, was a victory for the Know Nothings by around 9,000 votes. In 1857, fearing similar violence at the upcoming elections, Governor Thomas W. Ligon ordered Steuart to hold the First Light Division, Maryland Volunteers in readiness.Andrews, p.478 Ligon carried a \\"painful sense of duty unfulfilled\\" owing to the violence of the previous year, and was determined to maintain order.Melton, p.159 However, Mayor Thomas Swann successfully argued for a compromise measure involving special police forces to prevent disorder, and Ligon once again balked at the use of military force. He did not formally rescind the order to Steuart's militia, but rather proclaimed that he did not \\"contemplate the use, upon that day of the military force which I have ordered to be enrolled and organized.\\" This time, although there was somewhat less violence than in 1856, the results of the vote were again compromised by the use of force and intimidation. Mayor Swann was duly re-elected, albeit in a heavily disputed ballot. Slavery and the coming of the Civil War Charles Carroll of Carrollton, planter, signer of the American Declaration of Independence, and president of the Maryland State Colonization Society. Steuart's family were slaveholders and strong supporters of the South's \\"peculiar institution\\", although they supported the gradual abolition of slavery by voluntary means. In 1828 Steuart served on the board of managers of the Maryland State Colonization Society, of which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the co-signers of the Declaration of Independence, was president. Steuart's father, James Steuart, was vice-president, and his brother Richard Sprigg Steuart was also on the board of managers.The African Repository, Volume 3, 1827, p.251, edited by Ralph Randolph Gurley Retrieved Jan 15 2010 The MSCS was a branch of the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to returning black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as Liberia. The society proposed from the outset \\"to be a remedy for slavery\\", and declared in 1833: :\\"Resolved, That this society believe, and act upon the belief, that colonization tends to promote emancipation, by affording the emancipated slave a home where he can be happier than in this country, and so inducing masters to manumit who would not do so unconditionally...[so that] at a time not remote, slavery would cease in the state by the full consent of those interested.\\" Stebbins, Giles B., Facts and Opinions Touching the Real Origin, Character, and Influence of the American Colonization Society: Views of Wilberforce, Clarkson, and Others, published by Jewitt, Proctor, and Worthington (1853).

In 1859 Steuart's militia participated in the suppression of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, an abortive attempt to ignite a slave rebellion. Steuart personally led six companies of Militia: the City Guard, Law Greys and Shields Guard from Baltimore, and the United Guards, Junior Defenders and Independent Riflemen from the city of Frederick. The departing Baltimore militia were cheered on by substantial crowds of citizens and well-wishers.Andrews, p.497 After Harper's Ferry, militias in the South began to grow in importance as Southerners began to fear slave rebellion inspired by Northern Abolitionists.Ken Burns, The American Civil War The following year, in a letter to the National Intelligencer on November 19, 1860, Steuart congratulated the editors on their support for the Fugitive Slave Acts, and set out his own support for the Supreme Court's 1857 decision to uphold slavery in the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford. He also criticized the recent election of then President-elect Abraham Lincoln on a platform opposed to slavery. Steuart argued for \\"the invalidity of Lincoln's election, because of the negro votes cast and counted for him in the states of New York, Ohio, and Massachusetts\\".Letter from George H. Steuart to the National Intelligencer dated November 19, 1860, unpublished.

Generally, when the Massachusetts troops were passing thru the city of Baltimore, it was evident to me that 75 p.c. of the population was in favour of repelling these troops. Instinctively the people seemed to look upon them as intruders, or as invaders of the South, not as defenders of the City of Baltimore. How or by whom the first blow was given can not be now ascertained, but the feeling of resistance was contagious and powerful.

The political situation remained uncertain until May 13, 1861 when Union troops occupied the state, restoring order and preventing any further move to secession, and by late summer Maryland was firmly in the hands of Union soldiers. Arrests of Confederate sympathizers soon followed, and General Steuart fled to Charlottesville, Virginia, after which much of his family's property was confiscated by the Federal Government.Brugger, Robert J., p.280, Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634-1980 Retrieved Feb 28 2010 Maryland Square was seized by the Union Army and re-named Camp Andrew after Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew, a noted abolitionist.Mitchell, p.166 Union troops were quartered in Steuart's mansion and Jarvis Hospital was soon erected on the grounds of the estate, to care for Federal wounded.Nelker, p.120 Steuart was not alone in fleeing to Virginia to join the Confederacy. Many members of the newly formed Maryland Line in the Confederate army would be drawn from Steuart's Maryland militia,Goldsborough, p.9 though at age 71 Steuart was personally judged too old for active service. Despite this, he spent much of the war following the Confederate army and was present at or near a number of battles,Hanson, p.272 including Gettysburg,The English Confederate - The Life Of A Civil War General, 1815-1889, by Collett Leventhorpe, p.110.

There, on 21 May 1864, he died.Nelker, p.67 A friend of general Steuart at the University of Virginia wrote to his bereaved father: :\\"You will not charge me, I trust, with intruding on the sacredness of your grief, if I cannot help giving expression to my deep, heartfelt sympathy with your great sorrow. You have sacrificed so much for the righteous cause already, that I know you will present this last and most precious offering also with the fortitude of your character and the submission of a Christian. Still, I know how valuable this son of yours had been to your interests, how dear to your heart, and I cannot tell you, with what deep and sincere grief I heard of your terrible loss.\\" Mitchell, p.339 Steuart's brother, the physician Richard Sprigg Steuart, chose not to leave Maryland, remaining in his home state throughout the war, though his open support for the Confederacy meant that he too became a fugitive from the federal authorities. Baltimore resident W W Glenn described him as living in constant fear of capture: :\\"I was spending the evening out when a footstep approached my chair from behind and a hand was laid upon me. I turned and saw Dr. R. S. Steuart. He has been concealed for more than six months. His neighbors are so bitter against him that he dare not go home, and he committed himself so decidedly on the 19th April and is known to be so decided a Southerner, that it more than likely he would be thrown into a Fort. He goes about from place to place, sometimes staying in one county, sometimes in another and then passing a few days in the city.

After the war Steuart's dedication to the \\"Lost Cause\\" of the Confederacy would prove a disaster for him and his family. Although Maryland Square was restored to him after the war, neither he nor his children would live there again.Rice, p.290 Jarvis hospital was closed in 1865, at the war's end, and in the summer of 1866 the buildings were auctioned off, permitting successful bidders 10 days from the date of auction in which to remove their purchases from the grounds.Rice, p.256 After the war Steuart travelled to Europe, but returned to Maryland in 1867,Hanson, p.272 where he died on October 21, 1867, age 77.

Accessibility is a fundamental philosophy of Radius. The group eschews the stuffiness and elitism often associated with chamber music and seeks to attract a new, generally younger and more informal, audience to its performances. The ensemble's primary performance venue is MIT's Killian Hall with occasional outreach concerts at various locations in the Greater Boston area. Radius Ensemble also performs one free family- oriented concert every spring. Radius was founded in 1999 by Jennifer Montbach who (as of the 2008-2009 season) continues as the group's artistic director and oboist.  Personnel  There are nine core members of the Radius Ensemble. The core personnel for the 2008-2009 season are Sarah Bob on piano, Miriam Bolkosky on violoncello, Sarah Brady on flute, Eran Egozy on clarinet, Anne Howarth on French horn, Jae Young Cosmos Lee on violin, Jennifer Montbach on oboe, and Gregory Newton on bassoon. The ninth core position (viola) is not filled for the 2008-2009 season. Additional musicians are engaged as the repertoire demands.  Artistic Diversity  Radius Ensemble plays a diverse blend of standard repertoire and more modern music, occasionally venturing into realms that could be classified as experimental. Further variety and flexibility is added to each performance by using a range of ensembles: solo instruments, smaller ensembles, and larger groups are regularly included in the same concert. Radius further enhances its artistic diversity by promoting works of living and younger local composers. A composer in residence program has featured Jonathan Bailey Holland (2008-2009 season) and Curtis K. Hughes (2007-2008 season). Guest artists have contributed to the increasing popularity of Radius Ensemble. For the 2008-2009 season guest artists include Robin Young (of radio station WBUR) as narrator for the Holocaust-inspired There is wind and there are ashes in the wind by Osvaldo Golijov, Robert D. Levin on piano for the Mozart Quintet in E-flat major for piano and winds, K.452, Marcus Thompson on viola for the Brahms String quintet in F, Op. 88, and Fenwick Smith on flute for Shulamit Ran's Mirage for Five Players.

Turkey has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia has an embassy in Ankara. Both countries are the full members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Both countries are also classed as regional powers and middle powers in their respective regions.  History  The relations between the two countries can be traced back during the Malay sultanate era and the Ottoman Empire. From 19th century, relations between the Malay Sultanates and the Ottomans remained intact, bolstered by close personal ties between Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor, who made several visits to Istanbul. On the occasion of Sultan Abu Bakar's visit in 1890, he and his brother, Engku Abdul Majid, married Turkish women. These marriages has further strengthened the bilateral relationship and produced a mixed Malay-Turkish descendants such as Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, Ungku Aziz and Tun Hussein Onn. Today, the modern relations of both countries has started since 1964. Prime Minister Najib Razak visited Turkey on 17 April 2014 to extend bilateral trades between the two countries and signed FTA. Some economic agreements has been establish between the two countries such as Strategic Framework Agreement and Free Trade Agreement. Beside that, the visa requirements for both countries visits also has been abolished.  Economic relations  Both countries also currently forging greater co-operation in trade and investment especially linkages in the Islamic financial industry between the two markets. Turkey also currently looking on Malaysia to become one of its trading partner in the ASEAN region. In 2019, as part of the plan to improve ties with Asian nations, Turkey plans to boost its investment in Malaysia where the latter also have been considered as among 17 countries under focus for exports as had been expressed by Turkish Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan in August.  Security relations  The Turkish defence industry company has signed several accords with Malaysian partner which worth around $600 million deal for armoured vehicles production. The other Turkish firms also has signed deals with Malaysian partners to modernise the Malaysian military systems. On 12 May 2017, Malaysia deported three Turkish suspects over their alleged involvement with the Gülen movement, an organisation which has been designated as a terrorist organisation by the Turkish government. Following this, the Malaysian government was accused by the Stockholm Center for Freedom (SCF) for enabling the persecution of government critics of the administration under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan by unlawfully turning over Turkish nationals who fled from the crackdown launched by their President under the request of their government. Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia Ahmad Zahid Hamidi denied the detention was based on order from the Turkish government, while explaining that the arrests were made after receiving information from the Counter-Messaging Centre (CMC) in relation to their involvement in an organisation that deemed illegal in their country.

First published in 1990, then in 1996. In 2007, the novella was republished as part of a collection of Lukyanenko's early short stories titled Quay for Yellow Ships.  Plot  An astronaut from Earth named Dima (short for Dmitry) crash-lands on the fourth planet of the star LK 43. The indigenous people, whose physical appearance is almost indistinguishable from human, live in the so-called Cities, enclosed and self-sufficient habitats, providing their tenants with all life's necessities. The Cities are ruled by the ruthless and authoritarian Watchers. The official ideology of the Cities promotes absolute equality and replaceability. The official honorific is \\"Equal\\". All individual qualities are considered to be atavistic and must be mercilessly eliminated to the point that most redheads are forced to dye their hair. The most dangerous atavisms are crying, hate, love, and friendship. These are eradicated in early childhood. The inhabitants of the Cities live in dormitories, while children live and study in boarding schools and know nothing about their parents. Each person's place of residency is chosen by the Watchers and are often relocated to another City. The Watchers also choose each person's job. Reproductive couples are chosen by the computer. The same computer also chooses a person's menu (exchanging food is forbidden). At the age of 60, all citizens are killed. Those who are declared as incurable atavists or publicly promote ideologically incorrect views are publicly censured and are subjected to a mind-wipe procedure.. There are people who do not live in the Cities; they are called Outsiders. The Watchers make the Equals believe that all Outsiders are nothing more than bandits and villains. Even the word \\"outsider\\" is considered a profanity by the Equals. While the Outsiders are free from total control, they have their own problems. Long ago, there was a nuclear war on the planet, which turned most of the planetary surface into a scorching desert. Most of the survivors enclosed themselves in the Cities, while the rest chose to stay free. The Outsiders are unable to provide themselves with even the most basic necessities, so they are forced to steal from the City stores. Dima finds out all this after meeting two Outsiders and a kidnapped Equal. He agrees to aid a group of Outsiders in infiltrating a nearby City to free all Equals from the totalitarian Watchers. As Earth technology is much more advanced than local technology, this plan has a chance to succeed. Dima kills three Watchers but is himself captured. He finds out that most Watchers live in the beautiful and idyllic Thirteenth City, which consists of houses in the only forest left on the planet. The existence of Thirteenth City is covered up, so that neither the Equals nor the Outsiders are aware of it. After getting to Thirteenth City, Dima discovers that the way of life in the Cities is the only viable one on the planet. Due to the nuclear war, there are very few habitable areas left. Besides the small forest, which fits only several thousand Watchers and the gully with a few hundred Outsiders, life is only possible in the Cities. Their population is in the millions, so overcrowding is inevitable. To avoid bloody conflicts and overall chaos, the Watchers are forced to combat love (to avoid jealousy), friendship (to avoid unions and political parties), and hate to create uniform goodwill among the Equals. The Equals, like the Outsiders, are suffering from genetic mutations, caused by radiation. That is the reason why all sexual partners must be selected by the computer. The Outsiders, unwilling to subject themselves to rule, simply kill their children in infancy. The set lifespan of 60 is the result of extremely low supplies, even the Watchers are not exempt from this rule. Also, only those with high IQ are chosen to be Watchers, as they can grasp the severity of the situation and make the necessary decisions. On behalf of Earth, Dima promises to help the people of this planet to remove the consequences of nuclear war. This will take years, but once it is done, the people will once again be able to live normal lives.

Estrada José Manuel Estrada (born in Buenos Aires el 13 July 1842; died in Asunción, Paraguay, 17 September 1894) was an Argentine lawyer, writer, politician, eminent speaker and representative of Catholic thought.  Biography  José Manuel Estrada, with other thinkers and political defenders of Catholic thought such as Pedro Goyena and Emilio Lamarca, stood out in Argentinean history for their firm opposition to the Secularism that characterized the government of the country between the second half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century. President Sarmiento designated him Secretary of External Relationships and head of the General Department of Schools. He was elected deputy for Buenos Aires (1873–1876). He founded the newspaper The Argentinean. Between 1876 and 1888 he acted as Rector of the National Association of Buenos Aires. He made an important contribution to the Pedagogic Congress of 1882, where it was agreed that the state school system should be Catholic, maintaining this position in a long debate with Leandro Alem. This was opposed to the Law 1420 of 1884 for public, free and compulsory teaching that established the lay public school system. He was also opposed to the Law of civil marriage sanctioned in 1888, representing the opinion of the Catholic thinkers. In 1885 he was appointed president of the recently founded Catholic Union.La Democracia Christiana Argentina In 1888 he was re-elected as national deputy. His tomb in the cemetery of the Recoleta He taught Constitutional Rights and Administrative Rights in the University of Buenos Aires and he stood out as a journalist in the magazine The Union that he directed along with Pedro Goyena and Tristán Achával Rodríguez, where they defended their positions in opposition to the liberal reforms of the governments of that time, whose main advocate was Julio Argentino Roca. In 1891 he accepted the position of Plenipotentiary Minister in Paraguay, where he died in 1894. His remains lie in the cemetery of La Recoleta. A monument was erected to him in the Plaza Loria in 1947. His death is commemorated annually on September 17 in Argentina.

Wewak, New Guinea, March 1944 The squadron was established in early 1941 as a reconnaissance squadron equipped with the Douglas B-18 Bolo. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, it flew antisubmarine missions over the southeast Atlantic coast. In February 1942, the squadron was deployed to the Southwest Pacific , flying Douglas A-20 Havoc and North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. During the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, it engaged in the first sea-level attack by B-25 Mitchells in World War II and demonstrated that this tactic was extremely effective. The squadron also participated in the raids on Wewak, New Guinea, which were preemptive strikes that virtually ended the threat of enemy offensive air capabilities. In 1945, the squadron converted to the Douglas A-26 Invader. After World War II, the squadron moved to Japan and was reassigned to the 38th Bombardment Group. it performed occupation duty throughout the late 1940s and was inactivated in 1949 due to budget reductions. The squadron was reactivated in 1962 as a MGM-13 Mace NATO tactical missile squadron, stationed in West Germany. It maintained missiles until the MGM-13 was withdrawn from service in 1966. The unit was again reactivated as a BGM-109G Gryphon cruise missile squadron in April 1985. It maintained 80 operational missiles in a combat-ready state.

History Max was first published in 1991 and appeared monthly until the final issue which was a double issue for the months January and February 2008. It described itself as a photo and pop culture and lifestyle magazine. The magazine was owned by MAX Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, part of the publishing group Verlagsgruppe Milchstraße, which has been 100% owned by Hubert Burda Media since 2004. The circulation became continually lower according to the IVW figures. In the third quarter 2005, it had a circulation of 250,393, and in the third quarter 2006 220,333. During the same period, the number of subscriptions fell from 19,958 to 13,534. In March 2006, the magazine started to publish multi-paged features of the best photos found on Flickr in the Flickr-Portfolio, which covered approximately 6 pages. This was controversial, because the Flickr photographers received no money. On 11 January 2008, Hubert Burda Medien announced that they would stop publishing the magazine. The name of the magazine was to be kept for the publication of city guides. In 2011, a special \\"one shot\\" issue was published.

After a moderate success, Hubert Burda Medien decided on publishing another special issue in 2012. This time, the editorial department was outsourced to the Storyboard GmbH in Munich. As for winter 2012, it is not decided yet, whether the special issues are to become an annual event. The webpage continued after 2008 with a separate, small editorial staff. From fall 2011 to spring 2012, students of the Deutsche Journalistenschule wrote most of the articles on Max.de. After that, the site was run by a single editor who focused on pop culture, especially music, film and web phenomena. In winter 2012, a new editor took over to try out a new approach with pieces on adventurous and urban lifestyles. Since March 2013, there were no authors writing for Max.de, the side being updated with automatically imported articles from the German news agency dpa.

Early life She was born Martha Jane Jones, May 27, 1917 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Evan Jones and his wife, the former Noreen Sorrell. When her mother Noreen died in the 1918 flu pandemic, Martha was a year and a half old, and with her young father unable to care for her, she was raised by her paternal grandparents Evan Jones and his wife Elizabeth or Lizzy, who were of Welsh and Scottish extraction. She grew up in the Portland, Louisville neighborhood, surrounded by a large upper-middle-class extended family, that was spread out along Portland Avenue and nearby streets. Her great-grandfather, W.O. Jones, and her grandfather, Evan Jones, were partners in a boiler works factory, C.J.Walton & Son, that employed some of her extended family as boilermakers, including her father, Evan Jones. While she was still in the first grade, her grandfather would give her a quarter for each poem she wrote; growing up she had several poems published in Louisville newspapers and magazines, and at the age of 10, she won a national one-act play contest. Martha Jane attended the Louisville Public Schools, first at the Montgomery Street School through sixth grade, and then at Western Middle School, before graduating in 1934 from Shawnee High School (Kentucky), with Honors. She won a scholarship to the University of Cincinnati's Drama School, the College-Conservatory of Music, which she attended for two years. While attending college, she wrote to Lynn Fontanne of the acting couple The Lunts, and was invited by Miss Fontanne to audition in New York for their newly formed repertory theatre company. Career as a model and actress After moving to New York City, she became a model with the Harry Conover agency. In 1940 the Ashcan School artist, John Sloan painted four portraits of her; \\"Lady From Louisville\\", \\"Blue Eyed Girl\\" and \\"Miss Jones\\" are all in the collection of the Delaware Art Museum, \\"Dramatics\\" also known as \\"Portrait of a Lady in Red\\", was sold at auction in 1984 and is in a private collection. As an actress in the 1940s and 1950s, Martha Jones made her Broadway debut with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in The Pirate in 1942, and was Miss Fontanne's protege. She appeared in Blithe Spirit (play), Arsenic and Old Lace, The Heiress, The Respectful Prostitute, and other plays, both on Broadway and on tour in the United States and Canada. In July 1943, she married actor Robert Emhardt, with whom she debuted in The Pirate, then appeared in Harriet with on Broadway. Career as a writer After her first marriage ended, she remarried in November 1952 to Ralph Rofheart, an art director and advertising executive, by whom she had one child Evan, in 1957. Soon after her son was born, she chose to be a full-time mother, and she stopped pursuing acting. In the late 1960s she began working as a freelance advertising copywriter. In the early 1970s, Rofheart wrote a novel of Henry V of England, Fortune Made His Sword, which was purchased, by William Targ, then the Editor-In-Chief of G. P. Putnam's Sons. It was optioned as a Book of the Month Club selection for March 1972, published in the UK as Cry God For Harry, London : Talmy, [1972]. Critic Granville Hicks, reviewing Fortune Made His Sword in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that Rofheart \\"deftly avoids the dangers\\" of writing about a subject that's \\"Shakespeare territory\\". Gilbert Highet, writing in the Book of the Month Club News for February 1971, had this to say, \\"Martha Rofheart has used her historical knowledge and her creative imagination to give us a splendid full scale portrait of a mighty man\\". Published work After Fortune Made His Sword, Rofheart wrote five novels, Glendower Country, New York, Putnam [1973], in the UK published as Cry God for Glendower, London : Talmy Franklin, [1973], My Name Is Sappho, New York : Putnam, [1974], Burning Sappho in the UK, London : Talmy Franklin, [1975], a fictionalized theatrical family saga entitled The Savage Brood, New York : Putnam, [1974],The Alexandrian, New York : Crowell, [1976] a novel of Cleopatra and Lionheart!: A Novel of Richard I, King of England, New York : Simon and Schuster, [1981]. Several of Rofheart's novels were translated into German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Serbian. In May 2013, The Alexandrian was translated and published in Italy by Castelvecchi. Based upon her, \\"outstanding contribution to Modern fiction\\", with the publication of Glendower Country, Rofheart was elected on November 21, 1974, A DAUGHTER of MARK TWAIN, by Cyril Clemens and the Mark Twain Journal. Fortune Made His Sword, Glendower Country, Lionheart and The Alexandrian were reissued as Kindle Books in 2015 by Endeavour Press, a UK eBook publisher. Two of Rofheart's short stories have been published in Kindle format: \\"An Evening With Lynn Fontanne\\", is based Martha's last visit with a very old Lynn Fontanne, and the second story, \\"The Peppermints\\", is based upon the author's recollections of her childhood in Louisville.

It is largely a game of luck, and is suitable for players of any age. Games with more than four players are best when played without hesitation. The origin of the game is uncertain, although it is known to have been played in south-west London during the 1950s. A card game called red nines is mentioned in Holme Lee's Ashburn Rectory story from the 1850s. Objective The aim of this game is to make the lowest possible score by discarding as many cards as possible. At the end of each round of play, the value of the cards remaining in a player's hand counts against them. The player who ends the round by discarding the last of their cards thus makes a score of zero in that round. The number of rounds is determined by the number of players. Play One complete pack (without jokers) is used if there are four players, with an extra suit added for each additional player. There should be equal numbers of red and black suits if there is an even number of players. If there is an odd number of players there should be one more red suit than black suits. All the cards are dealt, so that each player has 13 cards. The player to the left of the dealer commences play by discarding cards in ascending numerical sequence. The player may start with any card, laying as many as they wish of the starting card's rank, but only one of each rank after this. The player continues to discard cards in ascending numerical sequence until reaching a point where they do not have the next card. The next player then continues the sequence if able to do so, otherwise that player must miss a turn and play is continued by the first player able to lay the required card. Players should announce their discards so that all players can follow what is happening easily; for example a player might say “eight, nine, ten, jack, no queen”. If the next player has a queen they would lay it and if possible a king as well. Discarding a king confers the right to start a new sequence at any number, including another king. Play continues until one player discards the last card in their hand or \\"goes out\\". Sometimes no player will have the next required card, everyone having announced “no–“ (whatever the required card is). When this happens the player who was last able to discard plays again, beginning a fresh sequence at any point. =Red 9 cards= Red 9s (i.e., and ) are wild cards and may be used to substitute for any card of a different rank. If a nine is the next number required in the ongoing sequence, a player with no nine other than a red one may say “no nine” and hold it in reserve. This could, however, be a risky strategy. It is not necessary to announce the use of the red 9 to substitute for any other card. The player simply announces the card that the red 9 replaces as if they had that card. It is up to the other players to observe that a red 9 is being used. =The first turn= Being the first to discard in a round confers a useful advantage, especially if the player has one or more aces. The player may, as stated above, play more than one of their first card. After this, no player may discard more than one card of the same rank at a time (although discarding a king and starting again with another king can give the appearance of laying more than one king as a discard). =Scoring= Each player has one opportunity to be the first to discard, so the number of rounds equals the number of players. After the end of the final round all the scores are totalled and the player having the lowest score is declared the winner. Each card from 2 to 10 scores its face value. Jacks score 11, queens 12 and kings 13. Aces, although representing 1 in the sequence, score 20. (An alternative simpler scoring convention, favoured by American players, is for the jacks, queens and kings each to score 10 and the ace 11.) If a player is caught with a red 9 in-hand when another player goes out, the caught player's score is doubled. Two red 9s would quadruple the score. Conversely if the last card discarded by the player going out is a red 9 that player should announce \\"out on a red 9\\", and the scores of all the other players are doubled. Strategy Success in red nines is mainly determined by luck rather than skill, although there are some opportunities for strategic decisions to be made. In general it is desirable to discard higher scoring cards when starting a sequence, especially an ace even if the player has no two (“ace, no two”). Deciding when to play a red 9 can make a big difference–they can be very valuable to fill in a gap, but getting caught with one should be avoided.

Stokes was the second holder of Smuts Professorship of the History of the British Commonwealth at the University of Cambridge. He was the author of The Peasant and the Raj: Studies in Agrarian Society and Peasant Rebellion in Colonial India and The Peasant Armed: The Indian Revolt of 1857. The Peasant Armed The Peasant Armed: The Indian Revolt of 1857, as per note of editor Christopher Bayly, represented a major historical revision typical of British historians of the 1960-1970s, and were to be studies in the Lower Doab, Indian agrarian tracts covered by Chief Commissioner of Oudh, the Commissioner of Benares and Western Bihar in mid nineteenth century. The detailed treatment of the social origins of the revolt would have extended to all regions where mutiny was complemented by civil rebellion in 1857 - 59. Stokes however had not begun to write his conclusion at the time of his death in 1981. As per Bayly, \\"in Stokes hierarchy of conditions for historical events of Indian Mutiny of 1857, ecology was the longue durée of Indian agrarian history in colonial period. Above this clustered a whole range of social and economic forces which determined the propensity to revolt and it was the specific decisions of British officers and Indian leaders which helped translate these propensities into historical action.\\" \\"Stokes felt that history was generally a 'harmless pursuit' from which few general conclusions could emerge. His own view of political and social priorities derived not from historical theory but from a notion of natural law and from revealed religion. The book chapters discuss the Military dimension of British strategy and tactics, as well of Sepoy Rebels, the Peasant World and British Administration. Stokes own passion for the links between sepoy mutiny and civil rebellion in 1857, are explored in detail, with reference to Delhi region, Haryana countryside, Meerut District, Muzaffarnagar District and Saharanpur district. The India Connection Bayly notes that, \\"Stokes returned again and again to the peasant world of India, by whose color and vitality he had been enthralled when serving as a subaltern in the Indian Mounted Artillery during the War. He completed detailed work on the Delhi area after visiting India in 1975-6. This visit seemed to prove to him the vacuousness of the broad caste categories.\\" =Stokes and Caste as Category of Analysis= Bayly mentions that the chapters in \\"The Peasant Armed\\", demonstrate a slow modification of the notion that caste was the key category of revolt or, in any simple sense, the basic unit of Indian rural society.

The word breaks down into tricho – \\"hair\\", thio – \\"sulphur\\", and dystrophy – \\"wasting away\\" or literally \\"bad nourishment\\". TTD is associated with a range of symptoms connected with organs of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm. TTD may be subclassified into four syndromes: Approximately half of all patients with trichothiodystrophy have photosensitivity, which divides the classification into syndromes with or without photosensitivity; BIDS and PBIDS, and IBIDS and PIBIDS. Modern covering usage is TTD-P (photosensitive), and TTD. Presentation Features of TTD can include photosensitivity, icthyosis, brittle hair and nails, intellectual impairment, decreased fertility and short stature. The acronyms PIBIDS, IBIDS, BIDS and PBIDS give the initials of the words involved. BIDS syndrome, also called Amish brittle hair brain syndrome and hair-brain syndrome, is an autosomal recessive inherited disease. It is nonphotosensitive. BIDS is characterized by brittle hair, intellectual impairment, decreased fertility, and short stature.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . There is a photosensitive syndrome, PBIDS.Hashimo S, and Egly JM. Trichothiodystrophy view from the molecular basis of DNA repair transcription factor TF11H.www.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/R2/R224 BIDS is associated with the gene MPLKIP (TTDN1). IBIDS syndrome, following the acronym from ichthyosis, brittle hair and nails, intellectual impairment and short stature, is the Tay syndrome or sulfur-deficient brittle hair syndrome, first described by Tay in 1971. (Chong Hai Tay was the Singaporean doctor who was the first doctor in South East Asia to have a disease named after him.) Tay syndrome should not be confused with the Tay–Sachs disease.Hashimoto S, and Egly JM, www.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/R2/R224 It is an autosomal recessive congenital disease. In some cases, it can be diagnosed prenatally. IBIDS syndrome is nonphotosensitive. Cause The photosensitive form is referred to as PIBIDS, and is associated with ERCC2 and ERCC3. =Photosensitive forms= All photosensitive TTD syndromes have defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is a vital DNA repair system that removes many kinds of DNA lesions. This defect is not present in the nonphotosensitive TTD's.Hashimoto S, and Egly JM http://www.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/R2/R224 These type of defects can result in other rare autosomal recessive diseases like xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome. =DNA repair= Currently, mutations in four genes are recognized as causing the TTD phenotype, namely TTDN1, XPB, XPD and TTDA. Individuals with defects in XPB, XPD and TTDA are photosensitive, whereas those with a defect in TTDN1 are not. The three genes, XPB, XPD and TTDA, encode protein components of the multi-subunit transcription/repair factor IIH (TFIIH). This complex factor is an important decision maker in NER that opens the DNA double helix after damage is initially recognized. NER is a multi-step pathway that removes a variety of different DNA damages that alter normal base pairing, including both UV-induced damages and bulky chemical adducts. Features of premature aging often occur in individuals with mutational defects in genes specifying protein components of the NER pathway, including those with TTD (see DNA damage theory of aging).

Geographical location Birs Waterfall and the small power station The geographical area called the Neue Welt (new world) evolved in the 17th century as the industry started establishing itself around the upper end of the \\"St. Alban-Teich\\". This is a canal, artificially constructed by the Basler Kloster St. Alban during the 12th century, so as to bring water and water power to the industry in Basel. Later, during the years 1624–25, the canal was prolonged through Brüglingen towards the Birs waterfall in Münchenstein and from here the water is diverged. The Neue Welt is the northernmost district of Münchenstein. Neue Welt lies along the western bank of the river Birs. To its east it borders on the municipality of Muttenz and to the west it borders on Dreispitz, a business and economic service neighbourhood that lies half in Basel and in Münchenstein. To the north Neue Welt borders on St. Jakob an der Birs (now part of Basel), this was the site of the famous Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs, on 26 August 1444. History and places of interest The hammer mill (Hammerschmiede), Neue Welt, refurbished in 1970 Villa Merian, Münchenstein, Main Entrance The hammer mill (Hammerschmiede), built in 1660 by Ludwig Krug, is the oldest building situated on the banks of the canal. In 1822 the hammer mill was refurbished as a cotton-spinning mill by Felix Sarasin (1771–1839). The hammer mill was restored and completely refurbished in 1970 by the Chr.Merianische Stiftung and was placed under monument conservation a year later. The Villa Merian, with its English Garden, stands upon the elevated plain directly above the watermill and the canal. The Baroque manor house was built in 1711 by Alexander Löffler. In 1801 the manor was rebuilt in early Classicism style and approximately ten years later the manor and its properties were acquired by Christoph Merian-Hoffmann who gave the estate to his son Christoph Merian as wedding present. The Villa Merian is now a coffee house. A late Gothic mill is situated directly below the Villa Merian. The mill is first mentioned in a deed dated 1259. The Operation of the mill continued until 1925. Since 1966 the watermill building is now being used as the Watermill Museum Brüglingen. Villa Ehinger (now the Music School), the Front Side and the Main Entrance Felix Sarasin's son Ludwig August Sarasin built his residence Villa Ehinger nearby. Ludwig Sarasin died in 1831; one of his daughters married into the Ehinger Family and that is how the villa acquired its name. The family Ehinger sold the estate and the villa in 1959 to the municipality (Gemeinde) Münchenstein. The municipality later passed the estate onto the canton Basel- Country. In 1973 the Villa Ehinger was refurbished as a music school and the canton built additional schools upon the estate grounds. The Kindergarten \\"Ehinger\\", the Primary School \\"Neue Welt\\" and Münchenstein grammar school stand on this development together with the \\"TSM-School Centrum for impeded children\\". The Kindergarten \\"Teichweg\\" is located in the residential area near the canal and the Kindergarten \\"Neue Welt\\" is to be found by the entrance to Brüglingen. At the beginning of the 20th century the fast expanding company André Klein, who specialise in the production of \\"Basler Läckerli\\", relocated their bakery into the former cotton-spinning mill \\"Sarasin & Heusler\\". Wasserhaus residential estate The Wasserhaus residential estate was built during the years 1920–21. The estate was developed by the Architect Wilhelm Eduard Brodtbeck from Liestal (canton Basel-Country, Switzerland), concluding the original plans drawn by Prof. Hans Benno Bernoulli, Basel, (1876–1959). Due to the unique archetype nature and the prototypical neighbourhood, the Wasserhaus estate was taken up in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance.

The exhibition was held on the grounds of the Merian Park in Brüglingen which belongs to the Christoph Merian Stiftung. About 3.5 million visitors came to the exhibition. The area is now officially called Park im Grünen but the local designation Grün 80 has prevailed. The name of the tram and bus stop (10 line (BLT) and busses no. 60/63)has meanwhile been changed from \\"Neuewelt\\" to \\"Neuewelt / Grün 80\\".

Biography Born in Leningrad in 1962, Nesis studied radiochemistry at the prestigious Lensovet Leningrad Institute of Technology. After graduation he worked as master supervisor at the Baltic Shipbuilding Yard (the largest and one of the oldest in Russia, est. 1856), which produced a variety of ships including nuclear icebreakers and submarines. In the early 1990s, Nesis left the shipyard to set out as an entrepreneur, opting to work for himself rather than for the state. Together with a small group of business partners, he first concentrated on the production of materials derived from uranium deposits located in the deserts of Uzbekistan. In 1991, the same group of entrepreneurs embarked upon a new venture to invest in the shipbuilding and metals industries. In 1993, their company became known as the ICT Group. In the same year, having made his fortune, Nesis returned to the Baltic Shipbuilding Yards as its controlling shareholder and Head of Board of Directors. ICT Group The ICT ('Investments, Construction, Technologies') Group, founded by Nesis in the early 1990s, is now one of the largest privately owned investment and industrial companies in Russia. It is headquartered in Moscow and has a large office in St. Petersburg. It invests in, develops and manages assets in wide range of industries, including the banking and financial industry, metals and mining, precious metal production, heavy engineering, logistics, construction and development. At present, the portfolio of assets under the Group's management includes such recognized leaders in their respective industries as NOMOS-BANK, Khanty-Mansi Bank, Polymetal and Tikhvin Freight Car Building Plant. The Group also holds large equity stakes in the potash producer Uralkali and Baltic Leasing. The group's assets are located primarily in Russia, but it also has interests in Kazakhstan. According to ICT's website, the total value of its assets under management stands at $8 billion.  Business Approach  Nesis and the ICT Group's preferred business strategy is to set up a project and grow it until it can be run independently. ICT has been described as a kind of incubator, which holds on to investments while they are in the design or technical research stage before spinning them out separately when they have reached a critical mass. In terms of engineering, he places a strong emphasis on the design stage: \\"If you make a mistake at the design stage, that's very difficult to repair. If you make a mistake at the construction page, it's easier to repair [...] it's very important to find the right technology solution.\\"  Corporate Governance Roles  *President of the ICT Group *Nesis served as Chairman of the Board of Directors at OAO Baltiysky Zavod between 1993 and 1998 and 2002-2005 *Acted as General Director and a member of the Board of Directors at Polymetal, 1998–2003 *Serves as Member of the Board of Directors at OAO Uralkali, 2010–present  Personal Wealth  As of March 2012, Forbes put Nesis's personal wealth at approximately $3.1 billion, putting him at No.367 in its list of billionaires and making him No.31 in Russia.

Great Mills High School serves the lower end of the county, including the town (census CDP) of Lexington Park. The area is site of some of the oldest agricultural settlements in Maryland, as well as English speaking North America. It had many links to the original Maryland colony in St. Mary's City. It is also now a suburb of Lexington Park and the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. History=Early Colonial era: 17th century= The area was part of the original agricultural expansion after the initial settling of the first Maryland Colony in St. Mary's City, which is located several miles south of Great Mills. Early planters established farms in the area by the mid to late 17th century. =War of 1812: Midnight riders= A secret pony express is suspected by historians to have run through Great Mills at night for over a year, carrying military intelligence messages from a clandestine citizen militia base in Point Lookout. The pony express carried messages all the way to Washington (possibly passing through the Great Mills area), keeping the President of the United States informed of British Naval movements on the Chesapeake Bay. The British finally came ashore in Point Lookout, seizing the area and putting a stop to the operation. =Civil War: Medal of Honor winners= Two Medal of Honor winners hail from Great Mills. William H. Barnes and James H. Harris were both free African-American farmers who grew up in Great Mills and served as soldiers in the Union Army during the American Civil War. They are both specifically mentioned and memorialized (including being discussed and depicted in a special permanent display) at the United States Colored Troops Memorial Statue which is just north of Great Mills in Lexington Park, Maryland. The site is also a memorial to the more than 700 African- American soldiers and sailors from St. Mary's County, Maryland who served in the Union forces during the American Civil War (this is also discussed in the educational display). Special celebrations are also held there each year. Modern town area Like most Maryland towns it has no local government, due to a history of strong county governance throughout the state as a whole. The legal term for this is \\"unincorporated area or township\\". The area is rapidly developing and is home to commuters who work in Lexington Park and the nearby military base, as well as St. Mary's College of Maryland several miles to the south. Some residents also commute to Leonardtown, Maryland. There are still farming, fishing and crabbing communities in the area, although all of these are under economic pressure. There is a public swimming pool adjacent. Great Mills Road, connecting the community with Lexington Park, has small shopping centers and small, low to middle-income housing developments. There is also a Big Park with office space, a playground, and space for sports.

These competitions can be classified into different categories, and most awards are product-specific, such as for wines, beers, and cheeses. Others focus on local, regional and/or national products. Finally, the international competitions test all kinds of foods and drinks available to consumers on a retail basis. Wine is probably the most tested drink, followed by beer and spirits. There is a variety of such food and drink competitions worldwide, where the taste and quality of products are assessed. Most evaluations are carried out blind, sometimes complemented by laboratory analysis. The jury usually consists of a panel of different types of \\"experts\\" in tastings such as chefs or sommeliers. The history of degustation tests is unclear; however, one of the earliest taste awards recorded for drinks is the Brewing Industry International Awards, dating back to 1888.Brewing Awards - Welcome to the International Brewing Awards For food, Monde Selection is the oldest award recorded, first run in 1961. Since then, as the variety of food products on the market has grown, so has the number of competitions and evaluations. Monde Selection states that \\"This bronze, silver, gold or grand gold quality label can be compared to the quality stars of a hotel or those of the Michelin Guide.\\" However, whilst both processes are anonymous, Michelin chooses the hotels and restaurants it reviews and pays for everything. Only products who pay the Euro 1,100 entry fee are reviewed by Monde Selection. Unlike Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals, where only one of each is awarded per event, there are no limits to how many can be awarded in each category. Other competitions use a similar business model. Most awarding organizations charge an entry fee. Alternatively, for some awards, producers or retailers pay a fee only if their products are awarded and/or they decide to communicate about the award (payment for the right to show the award on packaging).http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf2 In both cases, one might think that these recognitions can be bought. However, tastings are carried out independently and are blind-tested, where judges focus exclusively on sensory (organoleptic) features, such as taste, olfaction, vision, aspect, mouth-feel, after-taste, without being influenced by packaging, branding or marketing. Of course, only producers who pay the entry fee can make use of any award made.

A number of other Capital luminaries such as Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster were frequent visitors to the Piney Point Hotel, which was shut down after a hurricane in 1933. In the early 1940s Piney Point was also home to the U.S. Navy Torpedo Test Range. The Navy base was situated on the property, which is now the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training.

The film won that year's Louis Delluc Prize, and was nominated for nine César Awards including Best Supporting Actor, won by Patrick Chesnais.  Plot  Constance is a young French woman who is dissatisfied with her mundane life but has a talent for reading stories to others. As the movie opens, she is reading a book called La Lectrice to her boyfriend, in which the main character, a woman named Marie, reads literature to others for a living. She becomes engrossed in the book to the point that she begins imagining herself as Marie: Constance and Marie are played by Miou-Miou, and the movie weaves back and forth between their stories. Marie embarks on her new profession with gusto. As she reads to her clients, all of whom are seeking a little more than the solace of literature, she works a fantastical transformation on them. Her clients include the widow of a Marxist general (María Casares), a nervous businessman (Patrick Chesnais), a retired magistrate, and a handicapped teenage boy. Soon the clients' friends and families become involved, as does her professor (Christian Blanc). The general's widow's maidservant and the boy's friends from school become affected by the readings, and Constance has an affair with the businessman.

Originally based in Birmingham, London, Ipswich and California the label became a community organization in 2008, and since then has concentrated on music workshops and events alongside online broadcasting. The label is called Street Soul to pay tribute to the hip hop genre, in particular the Jazzmatazz movement from the mid-1990s. Created by James Kennaby, aka Vice in 2005, Street Soul Productions is aimed at an Alternative UK Hip Hop. Created in Birmingham, UK involve artists from around the World, embracing a wide range of different styles, and incorporating emcees, singers, DJs, Producers and session musicians to consistently create a unique brand of Hip Hop for the future. From Then Until Now=2002 = Vice, Halo and Venom began studying at the University of Lincoln. In the same year Halo formed a trio called The Micrippers. The group consisted of Halo, JD Sykex and Geo-Graphic. Within a few months the group began performing at various student nights and live events around the region and began to build a strong following. Venom was invited to DJ for the group and incorporated the performers into his existing Live shows. Alongside being a DJ, Venom was also an event promoter and radio show host and managed to build the Micrippers fan base. =2003= The following year the group began to record their debut project entitled The Four Chapters. At this point additional members began building around the core Micrippers team. The new members included Emcees Stevie Beko and Vice. The newly formed collective quickly established their roles, with Halo and Vice engineering the music, Geo-graphic concentrating on the production and Venom, JD Sykex and Stevie Beko concentrating on promotion. The project sold out within the first few weeks, and from there the music became stronger. Incorporating various session musicians from Beatboxers to singers, guitarists to DJ's, the sound evolved alongside the overall professionalism of the Micrippers approach. =2004= During the final year of University, The Micrippers released their second project entitled The Lost Chapters. The project was used as a promotional tool, and more importantly a way to connect with new musicians and extend the artists' existing network. =2005= After graduating from Lincoln University the group stayed in touch, and in September 2005 Vice approached Halo and Venom to become members of the newly formed Street Soul Productions record label. During this time James Kennaby (Vice) had started work on the label's debut project entitled The Tales Of A Street Poet. Enlisting the help of a variety of producers including Rise (Futuristica) and Arcaine (Hedphokis) alongside Emcee Solo Cypher of the Birmingham-based Vocal Swords collective. By the end of the year 1000 copies of the project had been pressed on to CD and the trio began to distribute the project around the country. =2006= The label decided to expand, with the addition of formed Micrippers member JD Sykex and Birmingham based REP. Also in 2006, Venom started work on Your's Sincerely mixtape. =2007= In 2007 the label started facilitating music workshops. Concentrating on lyric writing, emceeing, DJing and music production, the Street Soul Productions team are attempting to spread positive messages to a wide variety of schools, community projects and youth centres around the UK. During this year Halo started work on Halogenic, with the intention of creating a project that blends a variety of different styles and sounds to illustrate his skills as an Emcee. Around the same time Vice started work on con-X-ions after a successful internet based collaboration with Canadian Emcees Wio-K and Dan-e-o, and Australian Emcee Eljay. As part of the con-X-ions Vice connected with Rawkus Records / Glow In The Dark Panacea. The group later went on to be named Number 1 Hip Hop album of 2007 in Hip Hop Connection magazine, a UK-based magazine which was established in the early 1990s. The track Vice and Panacea created is entitled Momentary Emotions. =2008= 2008 saw the label go from strength to strength, with interest from BBC 1Xtra, Big Smoke Magazine and This Is Hip Hop (Blog). In the same year the team began promoting forthcoming projects. d. C. and Vice began a collaborative project entitled \\"The Transatlantic Connection\\". One track from the LP saw particular success. \\"Searching\\" was chosen to be part of a charity compilation by development charity Kamay a Puso which was distributed nationally across America in October 2008. In January 2008 Vice, Venom, Halo and REP were invited to appear on the long running pirate radio station Force FM for the DJ Shorty Show. The show wasn't recorded, and consequently a 20-minute podcast was created by Street Soul Productions as an alternative download for listeners. Also during 2008 California based d. C. officially joined the Street Soul team as an official producer. Like with all the Street Soul artists d. C. continues to work with non-Street Soul members, and already has worked with New York-based rapper Fokis (Aftermath Entertainment), Wu Tang International member Darkim Be Allah (see List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates), Lauren Santiago and many more. d. C. has contributed to a number of Street Soul projects including Vice's con-X- ions, Venom's Northern Soul, REP's Distant Traveller and Halo's For The Love Of The Music. =2009= By 2009 Street Soul Productions were becoming established within the UK Hip Hop community, and created a podcast called Basement Sessions to further promote the artists. Working with both up and coming and established musicians, DJs and promoters, the podcast built up a rapid fanbase via various social networking websites and blogs including Facebook, Blogger (Google) and MySpace. The label are strongly connected with the local music scene on a grassroots level. Not only concentrating on the music, the label also works with talented artists including photographer Karl R Dixon, illustrator Gemma Lewis, caricature artist Matt Brown aka Stilts, graphic designers Simon Randall and Hon To and many more talented individuals who create their work with a social conscience. In late January 2009, Vice and Venom, the co-creators of Street Soul Productions launched the Basement Sessions Podcasts. Utilising the Podomatic website, the podcasts were intended to promote new music from the Street Soul Productions musicians, however the podcasts rapidly expanded and Vice quickly became established as an interviewer and podcast host. In May 2009, Sensei FM, a London-based online radio station added Basement Sessions to its range of shows, giving Basement Sessions increased credibility and a larger audience. By June 2009, 500+ people had subscribed to the show using iTunes. In late 2009 the Street Soul Productions team began working on an event called the XLR Festival at Knowle West Media Centre in Bristol, UK after the very successful Basement Sessions Live event at Space 2 in Birmingham, which was granted funding from the Arts Council under the Grants For The Arts scheme. =2010= In collaboration with The Hip Hop Lounge promoter, producer and DJ Jagos aka Joss Holmes, Vice ran the first XLR Festival. With a host of top notch local performances, film showcases and talks, the festival gained local attention from residents and the press alike. Aimed at 10- to 19-year-olds, the daytime workshops, supported by sensei.fm, covered a wide range of musical areas.

Overview MakeDoc was originally designed to allow authors to create formatted documentation without the need for word processing software.Origins of MakeDoc Any ordinary text editor, including web input forms can be used for input, and the output can be HTML, PDF, or ordinary text. An additional goal of MakeDoc was that the text input format itself should be readable—uncluttered with markup notations commonly found in the SGML-based markup languages such as HTML and XML. This was done to enable distribution of documentation for software packages, where often such documents are being viewed (or even created) in text-only command shells. Basic Format The format of MakeDoc is intended for input and editing from any text editor, including those often used in shell-environments, such as vi and Emacs. =Titles, headings, and paragraphs= Title of document Optional boiler plate Such as author name, date, etc. = Primary headings This is an example paragraph. All this text will remain in the same paragraph until a blank line is reached. This is a separate paragraph. --- Subheading Text continues from here... =Command Lines= Bullets, numeric lists, definitions, and other special document formats are notated by beginning a line with a special character. For example: *Bullet item *Another #Numbered item #Another numbered item Other command lines begin with an equal (=) followed by the command itself. For example, to include an image: =image nyc.jpg Many other commands are also provided. See the reference links below. =Special Commands= The language also allows the evaluation (execution) of code sections in order to produce the results for example or output images. This make it possible to accurately generate code sections that contain accurate results. For example, if the command: =view follows a code example, the processor will automatically generate an image of whatever the code displayed in its window. Processing the Language The MakeDoc language is processed using a free script under an open BSD license.MakeDoc source (BSD open source) Its source code is written in the REBOL language and is only about 17KB. The processor is divided into a text-input scanner and an output generator. The scanner output is in REBOL block format and can be input into one of several output formatters. The output generator for HTML is included in the standard MakeDoc script. Output generators for PDF are separate.
