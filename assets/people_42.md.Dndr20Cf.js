The album followed a working hiatus by the band following the relative failure of 1993's Perverse compared to their international breakthrough album Doubt (1991). Although the band had come up with ideas that they submitted to Food Records for consideration, the label rejected them before finally accepting the reworked tracks featured on the release version of Already. It was their last album for EMI, and two singles were released from the album, \\"The Next Big Thing\\" and \\"Chemical #1\\". Already only reached No. 161 in the UK Albums Chart, although lead single \\"The Next Big Thing\\" had some radio play reaching No. 49 in the UK Singles Chart. EMI re-issued on the album on 1 March 2003. Background With their second album Doubt (1991), Jesus Jones found international fame after already charting in UK charts with Liquidizer and its singles. The album was an ever-greater success than Liquidizer in the UK, charting at number one in the UK Albums Chart whilst Liquidizer only entered the charts at number 31. In the United States, Jesus Jones became known for the hit singles \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" and \\"Real Real Real\\". Doubt entered the Billboard Top 200 at number 25. The Doubt era was also very successful critically. Following up Doubt was 1993's Perverse, which was a departure for the band lyrically and was one of the first ever albums to be fully recorded digitally. Although a critical success and reaching number 6 in the UK Albums Chart and number 59 on the Billboard 200, its full scale sales were significantly below that of Doubt. Recording Jesus Jones (pictured in 2011) submitted several albums to EMI before they selected Already. As the success of Perverse was below that of expected, lead singer Mike Edwards decided that their next album, to be released in 1994, would be \\"whatever he wanted to write\\" without as much pressure from Food Records, and would be more techno in nature. The label turned this album down, saying there wasn't enough single material on the album. Edwards wrote 16 more songs but the label again rejected the band's work. Alan Doughty later recalled that Edwards became disillusioned, but the band then gathered the best tracks from the two previous drafts of Already and reworked them. Very pleased with their results, Food Records finally accepted Already. Big beat had become a prominent feature of the music scene between the release of Perverse and Already. When asked if the success of big beat acts such as The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy had either stimulated Jesus Jones during the recording of Already or instead made them bitter, due to the arguable similarities between big beat and Jesus Jones' earlier alternative dance sound, Mike Edwards said that he didn't feel bitter and that there are \\"major differences between Jesus Jones and those bands\\" and commented on The Prodigy's pre-\\"Firestarter\\" success which he claimed the press had widely ignored, saying The Prodigy were also an influence on them so it would be \\"ridiculous to suggest they are following our footsteps.\\" Mike Edwards revealed following the release of the album that he was approached by EMI to make a solo album for Food Records, but chose to put this on hold to focus on Jesus Jones' US tour. During the hiatus between Already and London, Edwards found time for the solo album although the project was cancelled because, as he said in 2001, the said the idea was something \\"that they'd ultimately not be interested in (even though [he] thought some of the songs had some good points.)\\" Gen left the band in 1997 before the album's release but appears on the album. Tony Arther replaced his role as the band's drummer and percussionist in 1999. Release The album was released in August 1997 in the UK by Food Records and in the US by Combustion Records on the back of the lead single \\"The Next Big Thing\\" which reached number 49 in the UK Singles Chart. The album was promoted mostly online. Mike Edwards commented shortly after release that non-digital promotion failed. The second single from the album was \\"Chemical No. 1\\", which reached number 71 on the UK Singles Chart. Two of the album's outtakes were featured as bonus tracks on the US release. The album also notably carries the logo for EMI 100, a campaign celebrating 100 years of EMI. Chris Cunningham directed the music video for \\"The Next Big Thing\\". The album artwork was produced by London-based painter and illustrator Blaise Thompson, who also produced the artwork for the singles \\"The Next Big Thing\\", and \\"Chemical No.1\\". Critical reception The album received a mixed critical reception upon release and only reached number 161 in the UK Albums Chart. Mike Edwards said in 1997 that this album and Perverse are the albums he is most proud of for \\"being done properly and as [he] wanted them, not hurried and rushed like the first two\\", further commenting that Already is \\"the most consistent album, the one with the best songs.\\" Following Already, the band parted ways with Food Records, alongside their parent label EMI. The band took a different, more acoustic approach to London, which was released on Mi5 Recordings. London was a deliberately low-key release in terms of promotion, initially only being released in the United States. In 2002, EMI released Never Enough: The Best of Jesus Jones, a compilation of the tracks Jesus Jones recorded with Food Records. The two singles from Already were chosen for inclusion alongside \\"They're Out There\\" and \\"February\\". The album has been re-released several times. EMI in re-released the album on 1 March 2003, whilst Edsel Records released a deluxe edition on 24 November 2014,f featuring three discs; the original album with previously unreleased material on the first disc, the album's B-sides and The \\"Lost\\" Demos on disc two, and a DVD featuring the music videos and a short concert film titled Live at TJ's Newport, 1996.

Situated on the east side of Tower Hill, it was built between 1853-4 for Ormskirk Local Board of Health, and is reputed to be the oldest remaining water tower in the country. It was awarded Grade II* listed status in 1976, and is on the Heritage at Risk Register. The area immediately surrounding the tower has been used as allotments since the mid 20th century. Structure The tower is built in the Romanesque Revival style, constructed of coursed, squared sandstone, and arranged in a square plan. On each side are two narrow full-height Romanesque arches, all with stepped surrounds and arch-bands, and linked by an impost band. Above the arches is a plain frieze with carved grotesques at the corners, topped with machicolated corbelling. The stone is a pale red and mottled form of Ormskirk Sandstone, probably extracted from nearby Ruff Wood. In its present state, the tower stands at a height of approximately . Originally, the stonework was surmounted by a metal water tank with a pitched slate-covered roof, which added an extra to the height of the structure. Due to its poor condition, the tank was removed in the early 1990s. Proposed developments Planning permission was granted in 1988 for the conversion of the tower into a single dwelling, though the scheme was never implemented. Subsequent applications to convert the tower into offices or an apartment block were either refused or withdrawn. A more recent application for conversion into seven apartments was made in 2004, though this has also been rejected, and an appeal against the decision was dismissed in April 2008. Development of the site has met with opposition from local residents, and local Conservative councillor Adrian Owens was amongst critics of the most recent application.

Viewed on 2008-07-29 His brother, Major General Toyohisa Matsue was commandant of the Bandō prisoner-of-war camp in World War I. Biography=Early years Matsue was born in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima as the second son of a former samurai of Aizu Domain. In 1899, he graduated from Tokyo Technical School and found employment with Dai-Nippon Sugar Company. However, in 1903 he passed an acceptance examination held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and received a scholarship to study overseas. He was sent to the Louisiana State University, well-known at the time for its work in sugar cultivation, and graduated with a master's degree. He returned to Japan in 1907 and was appointed plant manager at Dai- Nippon Sugar’s Osaka factory. However, Matsu left the company in 1908 after it became the center of a public scandal involving the bribery of several noted members of the Diet of Japan and moved to Taiwan. He worked for two sugar companies in Taiwan, but left due to disagreements with their senior management and after realizing that both companies were in precarious financial situations. Visiting Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands, he realized their potential for development for sugar cane cultivation, and returned to Japan seeking investors.  Nan’yō Kōhatsu Kabushiki Kaisha Meanwhile, the first governor of South Pacific Mandate, Toshiro Tezuka, was turning to the Oriental Development Company for assistance in reviving the economy of Saipan and rescue the former employees of two failed companies, Nishimura Takushoku and Nan'yō Shokusan. With the capital from these companies and government approval, Matsue acquired the assets of Nan'yō Shokusan. In 1921 he founded Nan’yō Kōhatsu (South Seas Development Company). He trained Japanese laborers living on Saipan and others brought over from Okinawa and the Tōhoku region to clear the land, cultivate and harvest sugar cane, and build his refineries. By 1925 Matsue had built an alcohol factory and ice plant on Saipan, planted over 3000 hectares of sugar, and extended his operations to Saipan's neighboring islands. By the end of the decade, he had brought more than 5,000 workers to the Marianas. The company quickly grew to become the largest private company in the Japanese Mandate, and at its height employed over 40,000 people. Matsue also built numerous recreational facilities for his workers on Saipan and other islands. A fervent supporter of the Nanshin-ron doctrine, which advocated Japanese territorial expansion and colonization of the islands of Oceania and eventually the European-held territories of the Indonesian archipelago, Matsue led the company in developing a wide range of activities in Dutch, Portuguese and Australian territories in southeast Asia, especially in Sulawesi, Portuguese Timor and in New Guinea. The company bought out local Japanese copra plantations and fish processing plants, and established a shipping company. He also cultivated close relations with the Imperial Japanese Navy. Matsue resigned as president of Nan’yō Kōhatsu in 1940 and withdrew completely from the company in 1943. He donated money from his successful business to his home town of Aizuwakamatsu. A technical high school, Aizu Kōgyon kōkō (会津工業高校), was constructed using these funds. He died in November 1954 of a cerebral hemorrhage.

Ishmeet's family have listed their concerns on the Ishmeet Singh Foundation website. His father, Gurpinder Singh, and uncle, Charan Kamal Singh, recently paid a three-day visit to the Maldives to investigate \\"unexplained\\" head injuries. His family members had earlier said that the post-mortem and forensic laboratory reports stated death was by drowning but later stressed \\"under noticed\\" injury marks on Ishmeet's forehead and temple. According to a report by ADK Hospital, Maldives, where Ishmeet was taken after his death, a linear cut on the forehead was recorded. The post- mortem report in India also mentions a blood clot, \\"hematoma\\", under the skin behind the right eye and bloody froth in the nostrils and the mouth. \\"We have inspected every nook and corner of the resort and the pool from every possible angle,\\" said Charan Kamal Singh, a pathologist in Ludhiana. \\"The pool has no pointed surface that could lead to such an external injury,\\" Ismeet's uncle stressed, \\"his injuries show inflammatory change. Inflammatory alterations cannot take place after a person's death and nor in a swimming pool. These injuries could have taken place only when he was outside the pool. Ishmeet was living but unconscious when he was slipped into the pool,\\" he claimed. According to The Indian High Commission, Maldives... Narayan Swami, first secretary, Indian high commission in Maldives, was not in the country while Ishmeet's family visited the Indian high commission there. However, Mr Thomas, the official spokesperson of the high commission told us, \\"Ishmeet's father and two uncles had visited Maldives. They met the police authorities and have requested for further enquires about the incident. So, the Indian high commission in Maldives has forwarded the family's request for further enquiries into the matter to the government of Maldives. The letter has already been forwarded. We are taking appropriate steps now, following Ishmeet's family's request.\\" The case was investigated by CBI, who approached Professor T D Dogra of AIIMS for opinion. Funeral Thousands of people, including commoners and celebrities, attended Singh's journey from his home to the cremation ground on 31 July 2008. Shops in the area closed out of respect for their star.  Posthumous events  BIG Music released two albums in tribute to Ishmeet Singh, both of which contain songs that were recorded prior to his death. The first album is entitled Mool Mantar, and contains the first hymn of the Sikh holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib. The second album, titled We'll Miss You, contains around six tracks, including the popular song Shukriya: We'll Miss You has been released on both CD and DVD, and is distributed worldwide. Under the ISF banner, Principal Sukhwant Singh and Gurpinder Singh, father of Ishmeet, travelled to Malaysia to spread the message of the foundation.

Following the commercial failure of 1997's Already which led to the band and EMI parting ways, the band took a hiatus before regathering for the recording of London for Koch/Mi5 Recordings, with a more alternative rock approach as opposed to the techno sounds on their previous albums. The album had low-key promotion, initially only being released in the United States. Two EP's were released from the album, \\"Nowhere Slow\\" and \\"In the Face Of All This\\". Background Already, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 1997 to mixed reviews and very bad commercial success, where it only reached 161 in the UK Albums Chart (their third album Perverse reached number 6 in contrast.) They band chose to focus on the US tour following the album's release. The band and EMI/Food Records parted ways in 1998, for unspecified reasons but presumably due to record sales. The band ultimately fell into recording hiatus following this although Tony Arther joined the band in 1998/99 as the band's drummer to replace Gen, who left during the Already era. Mike Edwards formed the side project Yoshi for which he played lead guitar. He also worked on a solo album that he was approached to make by EMI in 1997 which he initially chose to put this on hold to focus on Jesus Jones' Already US tour,Jesus Jones Archive - 1994 although when Edwards found time for the solo album, the project was cancelled because he said the album was something \\"that they'd ultimately not be interested in\\" despite he himself finding some of the tracks to have \\"good points\\".Jesus Jones Archive - 2000 to 2010 Mike Edwards got re-interested in Jesus Jones with the idea that some of his solo songs from the cancelled project could be shaped into Jesus Jones and then to sell via the internet. Gen, who left the band years prior, then got in contact with Mike Edwards indicating he was keen to work again. Lastly, Mi5 Recordings in the United States got in touch with the band in spite of a record contract. Mike Edwards travelled to New York City where he met with the label's manager and discovered they both had similar thoughts on the state of the music industry. The band subsequently signed to the label in 2001 and played several gigs in the UK and US. Music and release When asked in 2001 if London bore musical similarities to the band's previous work, Mike Edwards said there was influences that were \\"less popular as he was writing the last album that are a central part of this album.\\", citing drum and bass and garage music as influences on London. He further commented that \\"those things make it sound very different, although saying that my signature hasn't changed in the last 10 years either so I think it's still clearly a Jesus Jones album\\" and that he thought the album was much more relaxed and happy since \\"it's been made in a far better atmosphere than the last two [Jesus Jones] albums.\\" Mike Edwards said in promotion of the album that London was a US release primarily, where it was released on 9 October 2001, although the band were currently working out ways \\"of getting sold [the album] around the world. Obviously the UK is important to us but there are plenty of fans around the world still that we need to look after\\". Two singles were released, which were also the last two songs on the album, \\"Nowhere Slow\\" and \\"In the Face of All This\\". They did not chart. The band embarked on a US tour in December 2001. Critical reception The album received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic however gave the album three out of 5 stars, noting \\"London is about [the band] and the natural progression in perfecting the music they want to play out live. However, the loyalists who made them superstars nearly ten years prior to this release might have outgrown them.\\"London - Jesus Jones  Songs, Reviews, Credits  AllMusic The album did not chart in the UK or US. The band transferred to Mi5 Recordings UK for the next release, Cultue Vulture !. Following the release of London, EMI released a compilation of pre-London material, Never Enough: The Best of Jesus Jones. The band also performed in November 2002 for a one-off gig in The Marquee, London where some of the setlist was chosen online by the band's fanclub. This was released as the DVD Live at the Marquee in 2003, and later as a live album with the same name in 2005.

It gives service through eastern Castle Rock to Franktown and then to Elizabeth then from Kiowa to I-70 and US 40 (Exit 352).  Route description  SH 86 (lower left corner to top) and SH 83 (left to right) in Franktown The route begins at I-25, US 85 and US 87 in Castle Rock, where it begins eastward. The route then exits the town and enters Franktown where it meets SH 83. It then crosses the county line into Elbert, where it meets many county roads in various towns before meeting its east end at I-70 and US 40.  History  The route was established in the 1920s, when it began at US 85 at Castle Rock. The route then moved eastward along CR 118 to US 40. In the 1960s, the eastward routing was changed so it follows its current routing. By 1954, the route was paved to Kiowa from US 85 by 1954 and to its entire length by 1972. Following the construction of Interstate 25, the terminus became a business loop of I-25; however, the business loop was deleted in the 1990s, leaving SH 86's terminus at a local road.

Apart from farming, there is an oil refinery and some minor industrial units. Political dynamics Nagapattinam Lok Sabha constituency, post 2008 delimitation. The 6 assembly constituencies shownNagapattinam Lok Sabha constituency is often seen as a traditional communist stronghold. The constituency has a large electorate of agricultural labourers. Nevertheless, the six assembly segments of the constituency display distinct political traditions and dynamics. The Nagapattinam assembly constituency, with strong presence of fishing communities, is traditionally dominated by AIADMK. Tiruvarur assembly constituency, on the other hand, is the home area of DMK supremo M. Karunanidhi. Another traditional DMK stronghold is Vedaranyam.

The Kilvelur assembly constituency, formed after delimitation, includes areas were CPI(M) is strong. In the delimitation process the Keechankuppan and Akkarapettai were moved from Nagapattinam assembly constituency to the Kilvelur constituency. The Kilvelur assembly constituency is dominated by poor farmers and agricultural labourers. The 1968 Kilvenmani massacre of Dalit agricultural labourers shaped the political map in the area. Demography Dalits (Scheduled Castes) constitute the largest community in the Nagapattinam Lok Sabha constituency, representing 32.95% of the population. The two other largest communities are Vellalars and Mukkulathors. Muslims constitute the fourth largest community in the constituency, as of the late 1990s representing 9% of the population.

It is a member of the Sunflower Family (Asteraceae). It is one of the rarest species of sunflower in the United States. It is common along utility and highway rights-of-way in North Carolina and South Carolina. There are only about 90 known populations, many containing less than 40 plants each.“Languishing Species: Southeast, Schweinitz's Sunflower.” National Wildlife Federation, Fair Funding For Wildife, www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Wildlife/SchweinitzsSunflower.pdf. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services listed Schweinitz's sunflower as an endangered species on May 7, 1991.Hilton Pond Schweinitz Sunflower Recovery. Retrieved on 2008-07-29. History and Physical Characteristics Botanists John Torrey (1796-1873) and Asa Gray (1810-1888) first mentioned the species in 1842. It is named for Lewis David von Schweinitz (1780-1834), a Salem, North Carolina clergyman and botanist who discovered the species.Torrey, John, + Asa Gray. 1842. Flora of North America 2(2): 330 Schweinitz's Sunflower grows from 3 to 13 feet (1 to 4 meters) tall. It usually grows to about 6.5 feet and sometimes reaching heights of 16 feet. The sunflower produces tubers and rhizomes underground. Its stems are purple and usually solitary, branching only at or above mid-stem. Its leaves are thick and stiff, tending to droop towards the end. The sunflower is perennial, and flowers for about two to three weeks in early October.Flora of North America, Helianthus schweinitzii Torrey & A. Gray, 1842. Schweinitz’s sunflower Siler, Robert. “Schweinitz's Sunflower.” South Carolina Wildlife Federation, South Carolina Wildlife Federation, 16 July 2003, www.scwf.org/schweinitzs-sunflower. Schweinitz’s sunflower spreads through dispersal of seeds without a dormant period. One plant generally produces 3-6 yellow flower heads. Each head has 8-15 disc florets surrounding 40 or more disc florets.Schweinitz’s Sunflower. Schweinitz’s Sunflower, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, 2011, www.fws.gov/southeast/pdf/fact- sheet/schweinitzs-sunflower.pdf. Habitat Schweinitz’s sunflower is only found in the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina. The sunflower is generally found growing on shallow, poor, clayey, and/or rocky soils.[5] The flower grows best in full to partial sun. Most populations grow near power line right-of-ways or roadsides. In 2003, 80% of the known populations were found near railways, utility roads, and roadsides. 13 known populations exist in North Carolina today. Conservation The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services listed Schweinitz’s sunflower as “Endangered” May 7, 1999. The sunflower does not have a designated critical habitat. It is eligible for relisting as “Threatened” under certain circumstances. It met none of the \\"Threatened\\" criteria during its 5 year evaluation. It did not meet the “10 geographically distinct, self-sustaining populations are protected in at least 4 counties in North Carolina and one in South Carolina” criteria. Fish and Wildlife Services also failed to choose managers for each population, and design and put in place management plans. Populations were not maintained for 5 years. De- listing has not been discussed, since the requirements are stricter. The sunflower also did not meet \\"Threatened\\" criteria within 5 years. Instead of being reclassified, the sunflower was given a new priority number. This new number corresponds to a high level of threat, as well as a high recovery potential and a potential for economic conflict. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 1994. Schweinitzs Sunflower Recovery Plan. Atlanta, GA. 28 pp. https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/plantbiology/ncsc/rare/Recovery_Helianthus.pdf Currently all populations are monitored. Methods of monitoring vary, but no population displayed a steady increase. The number of individuals has increased. The increase is different by population and location, so it does not meet criteria. Since this flower occurs in rapidly-developing areas, some of its greatest threats are human impact. Some threats include: construction and utility workers, industrial developments, and construction improvements. Fire suppression also contributes to loss of population. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects the sunflower and other wildflower habitats. The North Carolina Plant Protection Act also protects wildflowers. It limits commercial trade and collection of these flowers without a license. In South Carolina, the state code prohibits “gathering, damaging, or destroying” of all plants on the owned by the state’s Department of Natural Resources. There is currently no International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listing for Schweinitz's sunflower.

Khan is known for his understanding in spark gap and plasma-induced Lasers in ionized environment. His career is mostly spent at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission before taking professorship at the GIK Institute of Technology and Engineering and eventually becoming its rector. Besides teaching educating on physics, Khan is known for his strong public advocacy for scientific education in Pakistan and sustainable development through technology.Strengthening of Technology & Innovation Policy Research Institute at COMSTECH, Secretariat by Dr. S. T. K Naim; Launch Meeting of International Science Technology and Innovation Centre for S-S Cooperation. Biography Khan was born in Lahore, Punjab in India on 4 September 1941 and completed his matriculation in Lahore. In 1957, Khan enrolled at the Gordon College in Lahore where he graduated with BSc with honors in physics in 1961, and earned the Rhodes scholarship that allowed him to study in the United Kingdom. He attended the University of Oxford in England, and graduating with BA in mathematics in 1964, and BSE in electrical engineering in 1965 from the Oxford University. He started his doctoral studies in physics and became interested in optics and theory of Light– the electromagnetic radiation. At Oxford, he played cricket for Brasenose College, and was noted as a pace bowler. His classical work at the Oxford University was based on the gas laser based on the nitrogen filled gas tube through the spark gap. His research work was supported by the funding made possible to study the applications of Lasers by the United States, whose agency, the DTIC eventually released his thesis work as public domain. In 1968, Khan submitted his doctoral thesis, titled: The Laser Triggered Spark Gap, which was approved in 1969, and was conferred with PhD in physics with laser applications in 1969 by the University of Oxford.  Career in Pakistan government =Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission In 1969, Khan returned to his native country, Pakistan, with doctorate in optical physics but found research interests in the applications of nuclear physics when he found employment with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). Khan was instrumental figure in establishing the Laser Group in 1969, serving its first founding director until 1981. In December of 1971, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, a reactor physicist, and later attending the conference that was instrumental in decision-making process of developing nuclear weapons program in January of 1972. His career mostly spent at the Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, a national laboratory site, where his earlier work was focused towards designing and building the Laser rangefinder for the Pakistan Army in 1970s, building several prototypes for the military. After India's nuclear test in 1974, Khan's interest built in weapon-grade enrichment of U238 and was of the view of employing a complex laser-based isotope separation as opposed to relatively easier gaseous centrifuges which was being favored by Bashiruddin Mehmood at that time. Despite his expertise and advocacy, the program went in favor of employing the gaseous centrifuges method initially under Bashiruddin Mehmood in 1974 but later went to qualified scientist, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan in 1976. Nonetheless, Khan continued working on laser-based isotope separation with support provided by Munir Ahmad Khan and later used his expertise in laser-based atomic isotope separation of Pu239 in successive years– an interest in his research that he remained passioned throughout his career. In 1981, Khan went to established Optics Laboratory within the Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in Nilore, of which, he served its first director. In 1990, Khan was at a center of controversy when his laser rangefinder program caught between the rivalry with the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in Kahuta. The MoD awarded a contract to conduct preliminary studies in laser rangefinders for the Pakistani military and a prototype was successfully performed alongside with British, American, Russian and Chinese LRF programs. The federal contract and the funding was later directed to KRL in Kahuta as a preference, and there was a story published in the Pakistan Observer in 1990–91. In 1998, Khan became the chief scientist at the PAEC, and participated with his optics team in eye- witnessing the nuclear testings in Balochistan in Pakistan. Public service and government work In 2005, Khan retired from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission as chief scientist and joined the Planning Commission as a consultant, attaching to the Ministry of Industry (MoInd). PC appoints two members on less salary Friday, June 20, 2008, by Aftab Maken, The News. Khan provided the strong advocacy for the Vision 2030 program of which he was its director— the Vision 2030 was a policy measure program that aimed towards defining a preferred future for Pakistan from several possible futures.Members of the Vision Themes In 2009, Khan left the Planning Commission and affiliated with the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDC) till 2010 when he accepted an advisory position at the Ministry of Industry in 2010. During this time, Khan served on the board of directors of the Heavy Mechanical Complex and later served as the Chairman of the Rhodes Selection Committee. In 2014, he joined the COMSTECH as its chief coordinator till 2020. Academia and public advocacy In 2007, Khan joined the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering and Technology and briefly taught courses on physics before becoming its rector in 2008 till 2009. He later instructed courses on physics at the University of Sialkot and later became the university's technical adviser on building up the research engineering programs at the university. In 2014, he joined the faculty of science at the Comsats University in Islamabad and was later elevated its chief coordinator. In 1969, Khan authored a textbook on Lasers, titled: The Laser Triggered Spark gap, which is roughly based on his doctoral thesis, as well authoring a college textbook, \\"Optics\\" for graduates in physics and engineering in 1998. At the public circles, Khan is known for his strong public advocacy for science education, and is a member on a platform of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) since 2012. Work in CERN In 1999, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission approved Khan's candidacy to join the CERN in Switzerland as a senior scientist and a program director for the optics system and Lasers that were installed at the Large Hadron Collider. At CERN, Khan was the chief designer and had helped design the Compact Muon Solenoid employed in the Large Hadron Collider project at CERN in Geneva.Pulsating detection work by Tom Shelley, Eureka Magazine, 14 November 2008. Khan serves as the co-chairman of Information Communication Technologies taskforce.Sub-committees on IT sector formed ... Flare Magazine, November 29, 2008. In 2001, Khan left CERN and re-joined PAEC; he was appointed director of PAEC in 2002. In 2002, Khan headed the Plasma physics lab at PAEC and printed numerous scientific articles about the discoveries in laser and plasma physics. He founded the laser programme in Pakistan which has now grown into the Optics Laboratories and a National Institute of Lasers and Optronics with several hundred researchers.

During the late 18th century, this was part of a residential area called Faubourg Sainte Marie (English: St. Mary Suburb). The park was designed in 1788 by Charles Laveau Trudeau aka Don Carlos Trudeau (1743–1816), Surveyor General of Louisiana under the Spanish government; who later served as New Orleans' acting mayor in 1812, after Louisiana statehood. The Square was named after Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat and general who fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.Lafayette Square at the Historical Marker Database, retrieved 4 Nov. 2017. The park has a bronze statue of Henry Clay in the center of the park, and statues of John McDonogh and Benjamin Franklin on St. Charles Avenue and Camp Street. Gallier Hall, the former City Hall of New Orleans faces the square on St. Charles Avenue. Although the city government has moved elsewhere, the square is still used for inaugurations and civic events. The square also often hosts live music. From 1834 to 1938 First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans occupied much of the Western side of the square and was the tallest steeple in the city. It was from this steeple that General Benjamin Butler used the bell to ring curfew during the occupation of New Orleans (1862-65) during the American Civil War. Most of the architectural elements (including the bell) were moved to First Presbyterian's subsequent location at the corner of South Claiborne and Jefferson Avenues in New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina severely damaged the trees in the park, with broken glass and debris from nearby buildings making the park unsafe. A group of neighborhood residents and downtown workers formed a charitable organization, the Lafayette Square Conservancy, to transform it into a premier urban space.

Judge has also worked with such artists as: Liam Finn, Bell X1, John Doe, Paul Weller, Public Enemy, Daniel Lanois, Martin Sexton, Sloan, Concrete Blonde, The Supersuckers and others. In 2010 Second Motion Entertainment (the label's parent company) purchased the assets of Blurt Magazine and is the publisher of the highly respected Magazine and On-line media outlet. Blurt has often been called the \\"Mojo Magazine of the United States\\". In Feb 2012 Second Motion announced that both Blurt Magazine and the label would be relocating their offices to Raleigh, NC and that they had more \\"big news\\" forthcoming in April 2012. History Second Motion started releasing albums in the fall of 2008. Their first release was Irish singer (and Mercury Award nominee) Gemma Hayes.

In 2009 Second Motion moved their operations from Chapel Hill, NC to East Lansing, MI for two years before moving back to Chapel Hill at the end of 2010. The label had an extremely successful year starting with the reissues the first two acclaimed albums from Swervedriver \\"Raise\\" and \\"Mezcal Head\\" to high critical acclaim. The two Swervedriver releases have been digitally remastered with 4 extra bonus tracks on each and a special digipak artwork and liner notes form band members and are widely considered two of the top alternative albums of the 90's. Then the label also released a new studio album from Australia's legendary band, The Church which concluded with a successful North American tour from June to July 2009 with support from label mate and Swervedriver front-man Adam Franklin and his band Bolts of Melody. In addition to Swervedriver and The Church the label also released albums by Church frontman Steve Kilbey, Church guitarist Marty Willson-Piper. Swervedriver frontman Adam Franklin, Oslo, Norway's The DiSCiPLiNES which features Posies frontman Ken Stringfellow on lead vocals and the 8th studio album from power-pop songwriter Tommy Keene. 2010 saw releases from Steve Kilbey & Martin Kennedy (from the Church and All-India Radio respectively), a reissue campaign of Church frontman Steve Kilbey including a limited edition box set and 30th Anniversary catalog reissues from The Church. A new album from Dutch favorites Bettie Serveert, new studio album from Adam Franklin & Bolts of Melody, Canadian singer-songwriter Emm Gryner and a retrospective from legendary Raleigh, NC band Finger and power-pop legend Tommy Keene who recently toured playing his classic album \\"Places That Are Gone\\" a huge college radio hit in the 80's. At the end of 2010 Second Motion started to celebrate The Church's 30th Anniversary by reissues/remasters of the band's major label catalog.. with reissues (and bonus tracks) of the albums \\"Of Skins & Heart\\", \\"The Blurred Crusade\\", \\"Seance\\" and \\"Heyday\\" the label also released the first 30th Anniversary Singles collection, a 2xCD collection of singles from the band's entire career 1980-2010, with extensive booklet of photos and liner notes from legendary Rolling Stone magazine editor, David Fricke. In 2011 Second Motion released the classic albums from The Church \\"Starfish\\" and \\"Priest=Aura\\" and in Feb did an 11 city completely sold-out tour of the United States where the band played both of those albums, as well as their latest release \\"Untitled #23\\" in its entirety. The tour was called \\"Future, Past Perfect\\". Upon the band's 30th Anniversary they were inducted into the ARIA Australian Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, where lead singer Steve Kilbey brought the house down with an amazing ad lib speech when accepting the award and put the band back to national prominence from the attention. Then in April the band capped off the successful campaign with a sold-out show at the legendary Sydney Opera House with a 70 piece orchestra backing them up. The entire show was recorded and a DVD release is planned for sometime in 2012. At the end of 2011, Second Motion released another studio album from Tommy Keene which made many critics choices as a top 30-50 album of the year, and they also released an album from the Finnish rock band The Latebirds which features guest appearances from artists such as Levon Helm, Kris Kristofferson, Neils Cline of Wilco and others. In 2012 the label was quiet at the first half of the year as they were working on another entity to join the fold in April 2012, the label does have plans to do more releases in the fall of 2012, including a potential new studio album from Dutch rockers Bettie Serveert.

Its fossils have been found in Europe, Transcaspia and Mexico. Shell has compressed, rectangular till depressed and trapezoidal whorl section. There are strong umbilical bullae from which, prominent ribs are branching and these are interrupted on venter. Ends of ribs on the venter are prominent and can be both alternate or opposite. Some species have zigzaging ribs and these ribs ends usually thickened, or they can be raised into ventrolateral tubercules. These tubercules are mostly oblique clavi. Evolution Subgenus H. (Isohoplites) has evolved in Early Albian from Otohoplites normanniae that gave rise to H. (I.) steinmanni, which is the only member of subgenus Isohoplites. From this, subgenus Hoplites has evolved and gave subsequently rise to Anahoplites (from H. (H.) dentatus) and Euhoplites (from H. (H.) canavarii).

If the system is an election by majority (absolute or relative), the list that win get all or a part of the representatives for that area. If the system is an election by list by proportionality, the seats allocated to that area are split between winning lists, depending of their results, and a prime can be given to the first list. The system can be with one or two rounds. Such system of election exist in France, Tunisia, or Ecuador, as examples.  Election by list by majority  An election by list by majority is an electoral system by a list used for parliamentary elections in Djibouti, Lebanon, Singapore, Tunisia, Ecuador, Switzerland and Senegal or for municipal elections in France. Each party proposes a list of candidates which citizens vote on. The list that obtains the majority of votes earns all or a part of the seats contested in the election. If the election is at one round, the list who receives the most votes in the first round of voting wins the election, while in a two-round system, the list must win by an absolute majority at first round, or by a relative majority in the second round. There can be a lower limit for a list to be present for the second turn. In the two-round system of French municipal elections of cities over 1,000 inhabitants, the majority list earns 50% of the seats and the rest is attributed proportionally between all the lists present at second round including the one who won. Such a system is advantageous for large political parties, but usually not for smaller parties. It allows the possibility for a powerful majority, capable of imposing major reforms in the country. This system is the opposite of the proportional representation system, which matches the percentage of votes received to the percentage of seats won in an election. This system can be more easily adapted than other voting systems to allocate seats to minority or female representatives.

The inauguration of the President of Brazil is composed of several ceremonies that happen in the same day. Through democratic elections or coups, resignations and deaths, presidential inaugurations have been important events in Brazilian history. Ceremonies The only required part of the inauguration ceremonies, according to Brazil's Federal Constitution, is the taking of the constitutional oath of office before a joint session of the National Congress. However, other ceremonies, such as a parade leading up to the arrival of the president-elect in Congress, the transfer of the presidential sash from the former president to the new holder of the office, and a presidential reception at night also take place in the case of planned inaugurations. In the case of non-planned inauguration ceremonies (such as those that take place as a result of the death or resignation of a president), the non essential festivities, including the investiture with the presidential sash, do not take place: in those cases, the inauguration of the new president consists only of the joint session of Congress, during which the new president takes the constitutional oath. The ceremonies described below are those observed for planned inaugurations since Brasilia became the federal capital.  Inaugural Parade  The president-elect and the vice-president elect ride to Congress, where they are to take the oath of office, in a ceremonial parade. The inauguration parade starts at the Cathedral of Brasília, located at the beginning of Ministries Esplanade. In front of the Cathedral, the president-elect and vice-president-elect take the presidential Rolls Royce and proceed in parade down the Ministries Esplanade to the National Congress, while escorted by the Independence Dragoons. A number of presidents-elect have chosen to attend Mass at the Cathedral of Brasilia before the start of the inaugural ceremonies. In that case, a Solemn Mass is scheduled to take place in the Cathedral before the time set for the beginning of the State-sponsored inauguration ceremonies. The president-elect then hears Mass and leaves the Cathedral at or around the time scheduled for the start of the inauguration parade. Other presidents-elect have chosen not to attend Solemn Mass in the Cathedral before the inauguration ceremonies (some have attended no religious service at all, and others, while still attending Mass, opted for a private celebration in the morning of inauguration day instead of a major event in the Cathedral): in that case, instead of proceeding to the Parade from the Cathedral, they simply arrive in front of the Cathedral in their private cars, and at that point enter the presidential State Car for the start of the Parade. During the parade, the Ceremonial State Cars carrying the president elect and their spouse, the vice-president-elect and their spouse are flanked by a formation of Dragoons from the presidential guard of honor. However, except in the case of a re-elected president and vice-president, the flagpoles in the Ceremonial State Cars (that usually bear the National Flag and the Presidential or Vice-Presidential Standard) remain empty during that part of the ceremonies, as those being transported are not yet president and vice- president. The parade ends at foot of the entrance ramp to the Palace of Congress.  Oath of office before a joint session of Congress  Arriving at the National Congress, the president and vice-president elect are greeted by the President of the Senate (the upper house; the president of the Senate is ex officio the President of Congress, and in that capacity chairs all joint sessions) and the President of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Inside the Palace of Congress, a joint session of Congress takes place. The center seat of Congress' directing board's table is taken by the President of Congress. The President-elect of the Republic is seated at the right hand side of the President of Congress, and the Vice President-elect of the Republic seats at the President of Congress's left hand side. Also present at the table together with the members of Congress' directing board, are the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who sits to the right of the president-elect, and the President of the Supreme Federal Court, who sits to the left of the vice president elect. Although the President of the Supreme Court is not a member of Congress, he is invited to the table to witness the act. Other members of Congress' directing board (the Vice-Presidents and Secretaries of Congress) take the remaining seats at the table, to the right of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, and to the left of the President of the Supreme Court. During the joint session, the President of Congress states the purpose of the meeting and acknowledges the receipt of the diplomas of election of the president-elect and of the Vice president-elect, issued by the Superior Electoral Court. All those present are then asked to stand, and the president- elect and the Vice president-elect are successively invited to take the constitutional oath. The president-elect and vice-president-elect take their oaths of office, and each oath is followed by applause. At that time, immediately upon taking the oaths, they become President and Vice-President of the Republic. As soon as the constitutional oaths are taken before the assembled Congress by both the president and the vice-president, the new office holders are declared by the President of Congress to be invested in the Presidency and the Vice Presidency of the Republic. Normally, the national anthem is played at this point by a band of the Brazilian Navy Marine Corps, as soon as the oaths are taken and the declarative announcement by the President of Congress is made, and in military language the anthem is said to be played \\"in salute to the President of the Republic\\" (em continência ao Presidente da República). In some inaugural ceremonies, however, such as Dilma Rousseff's second inauguration in 2015, the National Anthem was not played at this point of the proceedings, being instead played at the beginning of the Congressional ceremony (in that case, the President of Congress invites those present to hear the National Anthem as soon as the joint session of Congress is declared open). Once the National Anthem ends (if it is played after the oaths of office and the declarative announcement of investiture), one of the Secretaries of Congress reads out the instrument recording the oaths taken and the investiture of the president and vice-president in their offices. If the National Anthem is played at the beginning of the joint session, then, immediately after the oaths of office and the declarative announcement by the president of Congress, the instrument recording the investiture is read out. That instrument, a proces-verbal of the constitutionally essential part of the inauguration ceremonies, is written in a special investiture book recording the investiture of all presidents and vice-presidents. Once the reading of this document finishes, the new president and the new vice-president then sign the instrument recording their investiture, and the document is also signed by the President of Congress, the President of the Chamber of Deputies and other members of Congress' directing board. The document is also signed by the President of the Supreme Federal Court. Once that deed is signed by all who are to sign it, the President of Congress then invites the President of the Republic to address the joint session. The president's inaugural address is given at this point (the president speaks standing, but from his place at the table), and the inaugural address is followed by a short speech by the President of Congress, who then finishes thanking the foreign heads of state, heads of government, Ministers of Foreign Relations and other special envoys for their presence, and also acknowledges and thanks for their presence the members of the diplomatic corps (usually saluted in the person of the Apostolic Nuncio, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps), the governors of States, the governor of the Federal District, judicial, civil and military authorities, as well as religious representatives, and after those thanks the President of Congress closes the proceedings of the joint session. The inaugural address of the President of the Republic and the concluding speech by the President of Congress are only delivered in the case of planned inaugurations. In the case of a non-planned inauguration, the President of Congress closes the joint session as soon as the instrument recording the investiture of the president and the oath taken has been read out and signed. Once the joint session of Congress is closed, the congressional leaders then escort the new president and the new vice-president from the Chamber and accompany them to the front ramp of the Palace of Congress. Military review in front of the Palace of Congress Once the president emerges from the National Congress, he pauses at the top of the front ramp of that palace, and, upon sight of the new head of state, a 21-gun salute is immediately fired by the Cayenne Battery. During the firing of the salute, the National Anthem is again played. A brief military ceremony then takes place outdoors. As the president is the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, he is received at the doors of the National Congress by the Presidential Guard Battalion of the Army, and by Navy and Air Force troops presenting arms. The president then reviews the troops and salutes their colours. After that, the president and the vice-president take the ceremonial state cars to the Planalto Palace, the seat of the presidency of the Republic. While, except in the case of a re-elected president, on the parade leading up to Congress the car flagpoles were empty, the car flagpoles now display the National Flag and the Presidential Standard or Vice-Presidential Standard.  Ceremonies at the Planalto Palace  Arriving at the Planalto Palace, the new president and vice-president pause at the foot of the Palace's entrance ramp (only used in state ceremonies), while a military band of the presidential guard plays the Presidential Salute (consisting of the initial and final bars of the Brazilian National Anthem). Once the salute is given, the new president and vice-president ascend the entrance ramp, and are greeted at its top by the former president and by the former vice-president. Troops of the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment, forming a guard of honour, are lined at both sides of the entrance ramp during the entire ceremony. This is the first time the new president and his predecessor meet during the inaugural ceremonies, since the former president and vice- president take no part in the preceding stages of the inaugural solemnities. The new president and the former president, followed by the new and former vice-presidents, then go side by side to the spot where the ceremony of the transfer of the presidential sash is to take place. The former president uses the sash up to the moment when he places it on the shoulder of the new president. The presidential sash is the insignia that symbolizes the office of the president. In Brazil, the sash was created in December 1910, when it was instituted as a symbol of the presidency by a statute signed into law by President Hermes da Fonseca, Brazil's eighth president. Thus, in Brazil, unlike other Republics, the creation of the sash was not simultaneous with the establishment of the office of president. Also, while in other Latin American countries the transfer of the presidential sash takes place before Congress, in Brazil that is not the case. While in other South American countries the reception of the sash by the new president forms part of the essential solemnities of the inauguration, and takes place immediately at the moment of the assumption of office, in Brazil the transfer of the sash, while still highly symbolic of the installation of the new president, is not an essential part of the presidential investiture, and therefore it only takes place in the case of planned inaugurations. Nevertheless, the handover of the sash from the former president to the new office-holder is considered an important symbol of the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next, in accordance with the will of the people and the constitutional order. Indoors or, more commonly, in the outdoor Parlatorium of the Planalto Palace, the former president hands over the presidential sash to the new president. The National Anthem is played for the third time as soon as the sash is placed over the shoulder of the new president. In the case of a re-elected president, there is, of course, no ceremony for the handing over of the presidential sash. Instead, the re-invested president merely re-assumes the use of the sash, and that is not done in the Parlatorium, but before the president's arrival there. Three Brazilian presidents have been re-elected, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. In Cardoso's case, as soon as he re-entered the Planalto Palace after the joint session in the Palace of Congress, he went indoors and received the presidential sash on a cushion. His chief of staff placed it on the president's shoulder. The President then went on to present himself at the Parlatorium. In the case of President Lula's re-election, the President received the sash at the foot of the entrance ramp of the Planalto Palace, and thus entered the palace via the ramp already wearing the sash, going directly to the Parlatorium. In the case of President Dilma Rousseff, she received the presidential sash from an aide at the top of Planalto Palace's entrance ramp, immediately after ascending that ramp. While reelected Presidents Cardoso and Lula had the sash placed on their shoulders by the aide who brought it to them, President Dilma Rousseff took the sash and she placed it on her shoulder herself. President Rousseff then remained at the top of the Palace's front ramp, facing the square, as the National Anthem was played, and once the National Anthem finished she then proceeded to the Parlatorium. The prior re-elected presidents merely resumed the use of the sash without the ceremony of the National Anthem being played at this point. In the outdoor Parlatorium the president (new or re elected), already using the presidential sash, delivers a public address facing the Three Powers Square where the people are assembled. In the case of a new president, the speech begins as soon as he has received the sash from the former president and the National Anthem has been played, and the former president listens to the speech at the side of the new president. The president then escorts the former president to the main entrance, and the former president and vice-president walk down the palace's front ramp. Reaching the foot of the ramp, the former president and vice-president take official cars that transport them home or to the airport. By entering the car at the foot of the Palace's ramp and being transported away, the former president takes his leave of the official ceremonies of his successor's inauguration. The parts of the ceremony involving the front ramp of the Planalto Palace are also considered highly symbolic: when the new president and vice-president walk up the ramp to enter the palace, this is considered to represent the ascent of the new chief executive to power and to the exalted position of the presidency, whereas the moment when the former president and the former vice-president walk down the ramp towards the people who are assembled below is regarded as representative of the fact that they have surrendered power to the new administration, and now become once again ordinary citizens of the republic. In reality, however, there is no actual transfer of power taking place at the above-mentioned symbolic moments: the term of office of the predecessor had ended since midnight, and at that moment the four-year term of office of the successor began. His four-year term having started, the successor entered into office immediately upon taking the oath, while the predecessor, divested of the power of the presidency since midnight, was allowed to continue to use the presidential sash until the moment in the ceremonies when the sash is transferred, and reside in Planalto Palace until the moment in the ceremonies when the solemnly descends the front ramp, only as a matter of ceremony and protocol. The ceremonies only emphasise, with their symbolic ritual, the reality of the change of government. If the former president desires to leave the city of Brasilia immediately after leaving the palace, he is usually allowed the courtesy of a last trip in the presidential airplane, that takes the former president to his hometown or to another Brazilian city of his choice. During the flight, however, the airplane does not bear the callsign \\"Brazilian Air Force One\\", as the passenger is no longer the President of the Republic. Usually, when the plane carrying the former president arrives at its destination, the former president is received at the airport by a gathering of his political supporters.  First duties  The first duty of the new president is to appoint the Minister of Justice and the rest of the Cabinet. Thus, when the former president has left Planalto Palace, the new president goes indoors and enters a hall of the Planalto Palace where his future Cabinet and several guests are already waiting. There the investiture of the president's Cabinet takes place. The president first signs a decree appointing the Minister of Justice. The appointed minister then comes forward to sign the investiture book. After the Minister of Justice signs the investiture book, the president proceeds to appoint the remainder of the Cabinet members, signing decrees that are counter-signed by the Minister of Justice. When each decree is signed, the appointed Minister comes forward and signs the investiture book. Once the entire Cabinet has been invested, the general officers chosen as professional commanders of each branch of the Armed Forces (who discharge their duties under the Minister of Defence, a civilian), are appointed and invested by the president, who is ex officio the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Then follows the appointment and investiture of other senior officers of the Executive branch, such as Cabinet-level officials of the presidency of the republic. Once all the Cabinet and Cabinet-level officers have been invested, the act of their investiture usually ends with a \\"family photo\\" of the new Administration around the new president and vice- president. For this photo, the new ministers' alignment and proximity to the president is dictated by the order of precedence, with the ministers who head older departments standing in the first row, and the heads of the newer departments standing in the back rows. Some departments, such as the Department of Defence, take precedence from prior departments now abolished. When the all the Cabinet, the professional commanders of each branch of the Armed Forces and other senior executive officials have been appointed and invested, the president then goes to another hall of the Palace: a queue is formed and the new president greets one by one the Heads of State and Heads of Government present, as well as the Heads of mission and other foreign envoys. Once all official foreign representatives have had the opportunity to greet the new president, he then goes on to greet other Brazilian authorities, such as Supreme Court justices, Congressional leaders and State Governors, as well as representatives of the civil society, such as Brazilian Cardinals, rabbis, etc. For the inauguration of President Dilma Rousseff, the usual order of the presidential first duties was slightly reversed: first the new President greeted the foreign heads of state, heads of government and official envoys, and only then she proceeded to the ceremony of the investiture of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level officers. After that ceremony of investiture and the taking of the \\"family photo\\" of the Administration, the President went on to receive the Brazilian authorities and the representatives of civil society. This change in protocol, with the meeting of the foreign representatives preceding the investiture of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level officers, was adopted so that the foreign representatives would not be left waiting for too long before having an opportunity to shake hands and exchange a few words with the President. However the ceremonial downside of the new arrangement was that, during the meeting with the queue of foreign representatives, the President of the Republic had at her side the soon-to-be Minister of Foreign Relations, but the minister-in-waiting was not yet formally appointed and invested in his office. It is unknown whether this new arrangement of the first duties will prevail in future inaugurations. Reception At the night of the inauguration, the president holds a formal reception at the Alvorada Palace, the presidential residence, or at the state rooms of Brasilia's Itamaraty Palace, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. This reception is often a ball with dinner, and traditionally the presidential ball was a white-tie event (white-tie events are very rare in Brazil). However, Presidents Lula da Silva and Rousseff have opted for less formal and less lavish parties, and have instead hosted more simple cocktails, to which guests were expected to attend in suit and tie.

Format of presidential inaugurations when Rio de Janeiro was the Capital of Brazil  Rio de Janeiro was the Brazilian capital until the construction of Brasília in 1960. The ceremonies were different but had a similar format. They started at the seat of the Chamber of Deputies (housed at the Tiradentes Palace from 1926 until the transfer of the Capital to Brasília) where the president took the oath of office before a joint session of Congress and delivered an inaugural address. Using the ceremonial state car, he then proceeded in parade to the seat of the Presidency (the Catete Palace in the later years of Rio's history as Capital of the Republic). After receiving the presidential sash indoors, in the presence of dignitaries and guests assembled in one of the Halls of Catete Palace, the president appeared on the balcony and addressed the crowds. Some presidents, instead of appearing in the balcony to deliver the speech facing the people, chose to deliver the address in the same hall of the Catete Palace where the ceremonial transfer of the presidential sash took place (in the early days of the Republic, the president only took the oath before Congress, without delivering a speech in the presence of the Legislature; thus, in those days, the Catete Palace speech was the only inaugural address delivered by a new president; the later addition of a speech before Congress created the situation of the president delivering two speeches on inauguration day, a situation that continued after the Capital's transfer to Brasilia and that remains to this day). The new president then escorted the former president as he left the presidential palace. The appointments, greetings and reception were held at the Catete Palace. In 1891, the first President and Vice-President of the Republic were sworn-in at the Imperial Palace of St. Christopher, that in the First Brazilian Republic was known simply as Palace of the Quinta da Boa Vista (in reference to the park where the Palace stands). This Palace had been the residence of the Emperors of Brazil, and, after the military coup d'état that proclaimed Brazil a republic, it was chosen as the seat of the republican Constituent Congress (1890-1891) precisely because it had been one of the seats of the deposed Brazilian monarchy. The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate assembled there for their joint sessions during the drafting of the Constitution, and also for the election and inauguration of the first President and Vice-President. Afterwards, the Chamber of Deputies returned to its seat in the now demolished Paço da Cadeia (literally, Jail Palace), a building that stood in the same site now occupied by the Tiradentes Palace, and that had served as a jail in the colonial era and was reformed several times, first to serve as the seat of Rio's municipal chamber, then to serve as the seat of the 1823 Constituent Assembly, then to serve as seat of the Chamber of Deputies from 1826 onwards. Meanwhile, after the 1890-1891 Constituent Congress, the Senate was housed in the same building that served as its seat in the imperial era, the Paço do Senado (Senate Palace) - previously known as the Conde dos Arcos Palace when it was the private residence of a Portuguese count who had severed as the last viceroy of Colonial Brazil - a building adjoining the Campo de Santana park, now officially known as the Republic Square. The Senate Palace now houses the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's National Faculty of Law. In 1922, Senate was moved to the newly built Monroe Palace. As for the Chamber of Deputies, it was temporarily moved to the National Library of Brazil also in the year 1922, while its seat, the Paço da Cadeia was demolished, and work on the construction of Tiradentes Palace, its replacement situated in the same address, began. In 1926 the Tiradentes Palace was opened for business, and the Chamber of Deputies settled there, leaving behind its temporary quarters at the National Library. During the period when the Chamber of Deputies was temporarily housed in the National Library, joint sessions of Congress took place in the Senate's Monroe Palace. From 1926 onwards, joint sessions of Congress were held at the Tiradentes Palace. Accordingly, the presidential inaugurations from 1894 onwards were first held at the Paço da Cadeia (from the 1894 inauguration to the 1919 inauguration), then at the Monroe Palace (the 1922 inauguration only), and later at the Tiradentes Palace (from the 1926 inauguration to the 1956 inauguration). As for the part of the inauguration ceremonies taking place at the seat of the Executive Branch, the Presidency was initially housed at Rio's Itamaraty Palace. The building, a former noble residence, served as the residence and workplace for the Head of the Provisional Government of the Republic from 1889 to 1891, and then, with the creation of the office of President of the Republic, it became the Presidency's seat from 1891 until 1898. Thereafter, the seat of Presidency of Brazil was moved to the Catete Palace, that served as the seat of the Presidency during two periods: between 1898 and 1926; and again between 1946 and 1960, when the newly built city of Brasilia became the Capital of Brazil. In 1898, after ceasing to be a presidential palace, the Itamaraty Palace became the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (when the Brazilian Capital was moved to Brasília the Ministry's Palace in that city was also given the name Itamaraty, that had by then become synonymous with the Brazilian foreign service). Rio's Itamaraty Palace today houses a branch office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while the Catete Palace is now a museum. From 1926 to 1946 the seat of the Presidency was housed in Guanabara Palace (that in the imperial era was built as the private home of the Princess Imperial Isabel, and became a government guesthouse after the proclamation of the Republic). In 1946 Guanabara Palace became the seat of the Mayor of the Federal District, and currently houses the State Government of Rio de Janeiro. Back in the days when Rio was still the Capital of Brazil, all the acts of a planned inauguration, including the joint session of Congress for the swearing-in of a new president, were white tie events. After the 1960 transfer of the Brazilian capital to the newly built city of Brasilia, the inauguration of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 was the last inauguration during which all acts, including the joint session of Congress, were white tie events. Image:Rio- PalacioTiradentes.jpgTiradentes Palace Image:Catete-CCBY.jpgGrand Staircase at Catete Palace Inauguration Day In the Old Republic era (Republica Velha), that lasted from 1889 until 1930, the Constitution adopted on 24 February 1891 established that the first presidential term would finish in 1894; the president and vice-president for the first presidential term would be elected by the Constituent Congress as soon as the Constitution was promulgated under the transitional provisions of that document (the first presidential inauguration took place on 26 February 1891). Subsequent presidents were, as per the permanent provisions of the Constitution, elected by direct popular ballot. Presidential elections were held on 1 March in the last year of a presidential term, and new presidents were inaugurated on 15 November (the anniversary of the Proclamation of the Republic). Accordingly, 15 November was inauguration day during the Old Republic era. The first inauguration under the permanent provisions of the Constitution took place on 15 November 1894. In the wake of the 1930 Revolution, the Constitution adopted on 16 July 1934, in its transitional provisions, empowered the Constituent Assembly to elect the president for the first presidential term. Chosen by the Constituent Assembly, Getúlio Vargas, until then Head of the Provisional Government, took office as president on 20 July 1934. Subsequent presidents would be elected by direct popular ballot and the next president would take office on 3 May 1938. Accordingly, 3 May would be Inauguration Day under the 1934 Constitution (3 May had also been the date of the State Opening of Parliament in the imperial era). The 1934 Constitution was however short-lived due to the presidential coup d'etát of 10 November 1937, so that no presidential elections were held under its permanent provisions. Under the Constitution imposed by President Vargas on 10 November 1937, the Brazilian Government was in effect a dictatorship. The referendum announced in the Constitution, in which the people would confirm or reject the new constitutional system, was never held (the date of that referendum was never set by the Government). The Constitution nominally established a six-year presidential term, with the first presidential term starting on the date of adoption the Constitution, but another provision of the document allowed the serving president (Vargas) to remain in office until the referendum on the Constitution was held. The said Constitutional provision indicated that, if the Constitution was confirmed in the referendum, then Vargas would complete his six-year presidential term. Thus, the referendum should have taken place in the first six years of the Constitution, but that was not done: Vargas ignored the duration of the presidential term mandated by the Constitution that he had imposed. In reality therefore, after the 1937 coup, Vargas retained power for more than the six-year period that had been announced, ruling Brazil as dictator for almost eight years, from his coup d'etát in November 1937 until his deposition in October 1945. When Vargas was deposed, new elections were summoned for a Constituent Assembly and a president, both chosen by direct popular ballot. The first presidential term subsequent to the deposition of the Estado Novo dictatorship began on 31 January 1946, and the Constitution adopted on 18 September 1946 established five-year presidential terms, but did not change the Inauguration Day. Accordingly, the subsequent five-year presidential terms also started on 31 January. In the wake of the 1964 military coup, it was established that the president elected in April 1964 would serve until 31 January 1966. Marshal Castelo Branco subsequently extended his term until March 1967, by establishing that his successor would be inaugurated on 15 March 1967. On that same date, a new Constitution entered into force. Under the 1967 Constitution, 15 March remained as the presidential inauguration day. With the adoption of Brazil's current Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988 in the wake of the country's transition to democracy, it was established in the permanent constitutional provisions that the presidential term of office would begin on 1 January. However, the transitional constitutional provisions stipulated that the mandate of the then serving President of the Republic would continue until he completed five years in office. Accordingly, the transitional provisions of the Constitution established that the first presidential elections under the Constitution, by direct popular ballot, would be held in 1989 and that the president and vice- president elect would be sworn-in on 15 March 1990. A 1993 Constitutional Amendment reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years. Accordingly, President Collor, the first president elected under the 1988 Constitution was sworn-in on 15 March 1990, but his presidential term would only end on 31 December 1995. Collor resigned the presidency in December 1992 and, was succeeded by Itamar Franco. His term of office was shortened by the Constitutional Amendment that reduced the duration of presidential terms from five to four years. As a result, Itamar Franco served until 31 December 1994, and, since 1995, Inauguration Day has been on 1 January as dictated by the permanent provisions of the Federal Constitution. Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the first President of Brazil to be inaugurated on 1 January, the current Inauguration Day under the permanent provisions of the Constitution adopted in 1988. Form of the oath of office The oath of office taken by the president and by the vice-president, officially known as the compromisso constitucional (constitutional commitment;constitutional pledge), is prescribed by article 78 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The Federal Constitution currently in force in Brazil was promulgated on 5 October 1988. Article 78 of the Constitution prescribes that \\"the President and the Vice- President of the Republic shall assume their offices in a sitting of the National Congress, by taking the pledge to maintain, defend and uphold the Constitution, observe the Laws, promote the general welfare of the Brazilian people, and to sustain the union, the integrity and the independence of Brazil\\" (O Presidente e o Vice-Presidente da República tomarão posse em sessão do Congresso Nacional, prestando o compromisso de manter, defender e cumprir a Constituição, observar as leis, promover o bem geral do povo brasileiro, sustentar a união, a integridade e a independência do Brasil). No words are added to the oath, so that the constitutional commitment consists only of the vow prescribed by the Constitution. No religious invocation, and not even the names of the officers taking the oath are added to the formula. Accordingly, the form of the oath of office, for both the president and the vice-president, runs as follows: Recent inauguration ceremonies=Inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had the most popular presidential inauguration in history. Citizens from all corners of Brazil went to the national capital for the inauguration ceremony. There were 3 innovations: * Concerts before the ceremony for those who arrived early. One main stage at Square of the Three Powers and others around the Ministries Esplanade. * Projection screens were placed around the Ministries Esplanade and secondary rooms of National Congress and Planalto Palace, allowing everyone to follow the televised ceremony. * A second presidential parade was held after the official ceremonies, for the president to pass through the crowds and greet them. Inauguration of Dilma Rousseff Dilma Rousseff was inaugurated as President of Brazil on 1 January 2011. The event - which was organized by her transitional team, the Ministries of External Relations and Defense and the Presidency of the Republic - was awaited with some expectation, since she became the first woman to hold the office of president. Important female figures in Brazilian history were honored with panels spread across the Monumental Axis. Until 21 December 2010, the publishing house of the Senate had printed 1,229 invitations for Rousseff's inauguration. The National Congress had expected a total of 2,000 guests for the ceremony. The ceremony was attended by delegations from 47 countries. As reported by the press, a total of 23 heads of state and government had confirmed their presence. Among them were José Sócrates, Juan Manuel Santos, Mauricio Funes, Alan García, José Mujica, Hugo Chávez, Álvaro Colom, Alpha Condé, Sebastián Piñera, Evo Morales, and Boyko Borisov. U.S. President Barack Obama sent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to represent him. Former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso also attended. In addition to the formal ceremony, Rousseff's inauguration also featured concerts by five female Brazilian singers: Elba Ramalho, Fernanda Takai, Mart'nália and Zélia Duncan, and Gaby Amarantos. The Ministry of Culture organized the cultural part of the event, having provided a budget of 1.5 million reais (around 0.8 million U.S. dollars) for it. The concerts started at 10:00 hours (local time) and stopped at 14:00 hours, with the start of the official inauguration ceremony. The concerts continued at 18:00 hours until 21:00 hours. Rousseff did not attend, as she held a reception at the Itamaraty Palace to foreign authorities which attended her inauguration. Each foreign authority had the opportunity to talk to her for 30 seconds.  Inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro  Jair Bolsonaro was inaugurated as President of Brazil on 1 January 2019. The event was made secure with 3,000 police contingent patrolling the capital, with tanks and fighter jets being deployed. Bolsonaro succeeded President Michel Temer, who served as the country's president following the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in early 2016.https://www.timesofisrael.com/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-sworn-in- as-new-president/ The inaugural events were attended by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and Bolivian President Evo Morales. The ceremony notably was not attended by representatives of countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, whose leaders saw a rift with a conservative Bolsonaro government and their socialist platform.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/americas/brazil- bolsonaro-inauguration.html  Gallery  Image:2247RS017-1-.jpgThe President delivers the inaugural address at the National Congress Image:President Lula passing by troops.jpgThe President reviews the troops of the Presidential Guard Battalion Image:2041WD245.JPGThe President delivers a public address at the Parlatorium of the Planalto Palace Image:Planalto Palace, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.jpgScreen inside the Planalto Palace showing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivering his public address at the Parlatorium Image:Inauguration ceremony of President Lula.jpg21-gun salute being fired by members of the Cayenne Battery File:Posse_dilma_2010_1.JPGThe inauguration parade of President Rousseff  References  *Information and pictures regarding the presidential inauguration Presidency of Brazil.

It has the morphological classification SA(s)a pec, which indicates this is a pure, unbarred spiral galaxy with tightly-wound arms and peculiar features. There is an asymmetrical spiral arm and an extended halo around the galaxy. This is a LINER 2 galaxy that displays an extended emission of X-rays in the region of the nucleus. A hard X-ray source at the center most likely indicates an active galactic nucleus. The stellar population in the nucleus, and a ring at an angular radius of 6″, shows an age of only one billion years and is generally younger than the surrounding stellar population. This suggests that a burst of star formation took place in the nucleus roughly one billion years ago. In 1984, a Type II-L supernova was discovered in this galaxy. Designated 1984E, the spectrum of this event at maximum light showed prominent balmer lines that indicated the explosion occurred inside a dense shell of hydrogen surrounding the star. This shell was likely created by a strong stellar wind from the progenitor star. A second supernova was discovered in 2003; this time of type 1a. It was designated SN 2003 cg and reached peak magnitude 15.94. NGC 3169 is located in close physical proximity to NGC 3166, and the two have an estimated separation of around 160 kly (50 kpc). Their interaction is creating a gravitational distortion that has left the disk of NGC 3166 warped. Combined with NGC 3156, the three galaxies form a small group within the larger Leo 1 group. The three are embedded within an extended ring of neutral hydrogen that is centered on NGC 3169.

Three major geographical entities, the Himadri (greater Himalaya), Himanchal (lesser Himalaya) and the Shiwaliks (outer Himalaya) extending almost uninterrupted throughout its length, are separated by major geological fault lines. Mighty but older streams like the Indus, Sutlej, Kali, Kosi and Brahmaputra have cut through steep gorges to escape into the Great Plains and have established their antecedence. The northernmost range of mountains are the Karakoram Mountains that continue into Pakistan and China. To the south of the Karakoram Range lies Parallel to the Zanskar Ranges and parallel to Pir Panjal Ranges. These three mountain ranges lie parallel to each other in the north-western part of India, most of its area lying in the state of Jammu and Kashmir as its capital Srinagar, too. Some of the highest mountains on earth are found in the region. Many rivers considered holy like the Ganga and supplying 13th to draw a flow from the Himalayas. Trans-Himalaya Trans himalaya is created due to the collision with the Eurasian plate. This Zone is the northernmost area in the country in the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. It is an extension of Tibetan plateau around the Himalayas. The Main Himalayan Ranges are as follows: *Pir Panjal Range (part of middle Himalayas) *Dhauladhar Range madya himalaya *Zanskar Range *Ladakh Range *East Karakoram Range *Mahabharata range (middle Himalayas in Nepal) Pir Panjal Range To the south of the main Himalayas lies the Pir Panjal Range at an average height of . From Gulmarg in the northwest it follows the southern rim of the Kashmir valley to the Banihal Pass. Here the Pir Panjal meets the ridgeline that separates the Kashmir valley from the Warvan Valley. The major passes here in Pir Panjal are the Pir Panjal Pass due west of Srinagar, the Banihal Pass which lies at the top of the Jhelum River at the southern end of the Kashmir valley, and the Sythan Pass linking Kashmir with Kishtwar and Salooni. Dhauladhar Range To the south of the Pir Panjal lies the Dhauladhar range. Both ranges are visible from Salooni of Chamba. It is easily visible because of its distinct feature of the snow-capped ridge, which forms the division between the Ravi and the Beas valleys. In the west it divides the Chenab valley and the Tawi Valley. Towards the east it extends across Himachal Pradesh forming the high ridges of the Large gorge and extending towards the south of the Pin Parvati Valley before it forms the ridgeline east of the Sutlej River. The rivers flow from it. Zaskar Range The Zaskar Range lies to the north of the main Himalaya. It acts as a backbone of Ladakh south of the Indus River, extending from the ridges beyond Lamayuru in the west across the Zanskar region; there it is divided from the main Himalaya by the Stod and Tsarap valleys, the Zanskar valley. On the east of the Zanskar region the range continues through the Lahaul and Spiti district and Pangi of the Chamba. While in the north it continues across the Kinnaur before extending towards west across Uttarakhand. Some of the main passes are the Fatu La, on the Leh- Srinagar road, while the main trekking passes into the Zanskar valley are Singge La, the Cha Cha La and the Rubrang La. Ladakh Range To the north of the Leh lies the Ladakh Range and it is an important part of the Trans- Himalayan range that merges with the Kailash Range in Tibet. Here the important passes are the famous Khardung La, and Digar La, which lie to the northeast of Leh. East Karakoram Range The Karakoram is a giant range, which geographically divides India and Central Asia. The range consists of high mountain peaks like Saltoro Kangri, Rimo and Teram Kargri. The Korakoram Pass acts as the main connector between the markets of Yarkand, Leh and Kashgar. Shivalik Hills The Shivalik Hills lie to the south of the Dhaula Dhar, with an average height of 1,500 to 2,000 m. It includes the Jammu hills and Vaishno Devi, and extends to Kangra and further east to the range south of Mandi. In Uttarakhand it stretches from Dehradun to Almora (covers almost the entire Kumaon and Garhwal region) and across the southern borders of India. The hills are in the foothills of Himalayas.

Stiff in 1951. It is widely used by hydrogeologists and geochemists to display the major ion composition of a water sample. A polygonal shape is created from four parallel horizontal axes extending on either side of a vertical zero axis. Cations are plotted in milliequivalents per liter on the left side of the zero axis, one to each horizontal axis, and anions are plotted on the right side. Stiff patterns are useful in making a rapid visual comparison between water from different sources. An alternative to the Stiff diagram is the Maucha diagram. Stiff diagrams can be used: :1) to help visualize ionically related waters from which a flow path can be determined, or; :2) if the flow path is known, to show how the ionic composition of a water body changes over space and/or time. Example of a Stiff diagram A typical Stiff diagram is shown in the figure (right). By standard convention, Stiff diagrams are created by plotting the equivalent concentration of the cations to the left of the center axis and anions to the right. The points are connected to form the figure. When comparing Stiff diagrams between different waters it is important to prepare each diagram using the same ionic species, in the same order, on the same scale. Environmental laboratories typically report concentrations for anion and cation parameters using units of mass/volume, usually mg/L. In order to convert the mass concentration to an equivalent concentration the following mathematical relationship is used: :(mass concentration) * (ionic charge) / (molecular weight) = (equivalent concentration) For example, a water with a calcium concentration of 120 mg/L would have the following calcium equivalent concentration: :(120 mg/L) * (2 meq/mmol) / (40 mg/mmol) = 6 meq/L Software programs in common use * HyCA Commercial software available from KWR waterware * AqQA Commercial software available from RockWare, Inc. * AquaChem Commercial software from Schlumberger Water Services * ChemPoint Pro Commercial software from Starpoint software, Inc. * Sanitas Commercial software from Sanitas Technologies LLC * The Geochemist's Workbench Commercial software from Aqueous Solutions LLC * GWB Student Edition Free student edition of the popular geochemical modeling software package. * RockWorks Utilities Commercial software from RockWare, Inc. * EnviroInsite Commercial software from HydroAnalysis, Inc. * Python Scripts Free open-source Python scripts that can plot stiff diagrams.

The project was created as an expressive medium inspired by his experiences with taking LSD in the Königsforst, a German forest situated near his hometown of Cologne, for long periods in his youth. He has claimed that the intention of the project is to \\"bring the forest to the disco, or vice-versa\\". History Wolfgang Voigt began creating music under the name of Gas starting in 1995, when he released the EP Modern on the label Profan. However, he has regarded individual pieces created from 1989 onward as being part of the Gas project, marked by a compiled 2008 release under his real name. A hiatus for the Gas project started after the release of Pop in 2000, but this concluded when in 2008, Voigt's own label Kompakt re-released all four of his Gas albums, albeit with subtle changes made to the tracks, as a four-CD box set entitled Nah und Fern. A limited double vinyl version of the set was also released, with one track from each album per side. In 2016, Kompakt reissued Zauberberg, Königsforst, Oktember and Pop as a 10-LP box set called Box, again editing or expanding many of the tracks. Voigt has intermittently revived the project for remixes and released new Gas albums since, including Narkopop on April 21, 2017 and Rausch in 2018. Musical style Gas's music is primarily regarded as ambient techno and minimal techno, combining ambient music and 4/4 techno. It is the most abstract of Voigt's many projects, with albums consisting of several long untitled tracks. All Gas material shares a characteristic sound, based on a hazy ambient wash of drones and sampled loops, \\"barely-audible fragments of horns, strings, record hiss and wind\\", usually accompanied by a repetitive four-on-the-floor kick drum. The Wire described it as \\"an outdoor rave, heard floating through the air from a neighbouring village\\". Voigt has declared it to be \\"GASeous music, caught by a bass drum just marching by, that streams, streams out through the underwood across the forest soil\\". He also said it \\"[moves] around in constantly overlapping loop structures\\" and \\"there is no definite start nor end\\". His live performances, which he performs using MIDI controls and Ableton Live, have this same organic quality. He commented that he builds his tracks using samples, which are manipulated beyond recognition to create what can better be described as textural environments than songs. He described the technique as \\"a certain kind of loops and reverse, and alternated reverses, which has no ending and no start, and it's just totally confusing\\". Most of the time there is no clear musical progression in a Gas track and, because it lacks any trace of orthodox melody or chord change, many would not describe it as musical.Voigt has responded directly to this statement in this Wikipedia article in an interview with online music journal Globecat: > Q: In your Wikipedia entry, whoever wrote it says: \\"Because Gas music lacks > any trace of melody or chord change, many would not describe it as > *musical*.\\" How would you respond to the writer of the article -- and where > do you personally draw the line between \\"musical\\" and \\"non-musical,\\" if > there is such a line? > A: I think the boundaries between \\"musical\\" and \\"non-musical\\" are in a state > of flux. Otherwise, I do not really care about any \\"musicality\\" related to > GAS. Emotions, structure, aesthetics are more important to me. Melodies in > the classical sense are not supposed to be in GAS, although they exist, as > hidden and overlayered as the chord changes. But you have to notice them. However, the sources of Voigt's samples are often of musical origin, encapsulating \\"old pop record stuff\\" as well as classical music such as Richard Wagner and Arnold Schoenberg.

He has been the chancellor of the University of Western Australia since 2017. French was born in Perth, Western Australia, and is a graduate of the University of Western Australia. He was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in 1972, and appointed to the Federal Court in 1986, serving as a justice on that court until his elevation to the High Court. He also held a number of other positions during that time, notably serving as chancellor of Edith Cowan University (1991–1997), chairman of the National Native Title Tribunal (1994–1998), and on the Supreme Court of Fiji (2003–2008). In July 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd named French to succeed Murray Gleeson as chief justice, taking office just over a month later. He became the first chief justice from Western Australia, and the third justice overall (after Sir Ronald Wilson and John Toohey). Early life and education French was educated at St. Louis School (now John XXIII College) in Perth.Who's Who in Australia Notably, he was one of two students from Western Australia to attend the International Science School, then known as the Nuclear Research Foundation Summer Science School, in 1964 at the University of Sydney. French attended the University of Western Australia in Perth, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1968. He then continued with further study at the University of Western Australia, earning a Bachelor of Laws in 1971. He was President of the University's Liberal Club and served briefly as treasurer of the University of Western Australia Student Guild. Career In 1969, at the age of 22, French contested the safe Labor Federal seat of Fremantle for the Liberal Party, which he lost to Kim Beazley, Sr.. He is a close friend of Kim Beazley, Jr.. French served as President of the Fremantle Branch of the Liberal Party and hence on the State Executive of the Party. In 1972, French was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in Western Australia. The Hawke government appointed French to the Federal Court in 1986, at the age of 39. During the Tampa Affair, French was part of the Full Court of the Federal Court that reversed the order of habeas corpus that had been earlier granted by a single judge. Chief Justice French (right) swearing in Governor-General Peter Cosgrove in March 2014. On 30 July 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that French would succeed Murray Gleeson as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He was sworn in on 1 September 2008. He is the first Chief Justice of the High Court not to have taken silk at appointment. French has served on numerous bodies including as part-time Commissioner of the Australian Law Reform Commission (2006–08), Additional Judge of the Supreme Court of the ACT (2004–08), Judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji (2003–08), President of the National Native Title Tribunal (1994–98), Council Member of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration (1992-08), Chancellor of Edith Cowan University (1991–97), Member of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia (1986), Chairman of the Town Planning Appeals Tribunal of Western Australia (1986), Associate Member of the Australian Trade Practices Commission (1983–86), member of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia (1983–86), Member of the Barrister's Board of Western Australia (1979–86), and Chairman of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (1973–75). On 18 January 2017, French was appointed a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He is given a Chinese name \\"范禮全\\" by the Hong Kong Judiciary. French retired as Chief Justice on 29 January 2017. He was succeeded by Susan Kiefel. On 20 June 2017, the University of Western Australia announced French's appointment as UWA's fifteenth chancellor. He succeeded Dr Michael Chaney AO as chancellor on November 2017. Beliefs and positions=On politics Although once the President of the Liberal Club of the University of Western Australia, French's views are described as being closer to social progressive, small-L liberal, and moderate. On republicanism French said in a WA Law Society speech in May 2008: > \\"It is unacceptable in contemporary Australia that the legal head of the > Australian state... can never be chosen by the people or their > representatives, cannot be other than a member of the Anglican Church, can > never be other than British and can never be an indigenous person.\\" On indigenous issues Justice French is known for working for the rights of Indigenous Australians: in the early 1970s, he helped found the WA Aboriginal Legal Service. He was also the first president of the National Native Title Tribunal. At his swearing-in ceremony as Chief Justice, French specifically referred to the long history of indigenous Australia: > Recognition of their presence is no mere platitude. The history of > Australia's indigenous people dwarfs, in its temporal sweep, the history > that gave rise to the Constitution under which this court was created. Our > awareness and recognition of that history is becoming, if it has not already > become, part of our national identity.Pelly, > Michael,https://archive.today/20120913185920/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,24274358-2702,00.html?from=public_rss] > The Australian, 1 September 2008. Accessed 2008-09-08. However, the 'French Testing' incident has coloured the legacy of French on indigenous issues. French admitted his 'error' when he explained the incident: > As I soon discovered, the responsibilities of an administrator trying to > develop procedures to implement a legal process are very different from > those of a judge required to decide a particular case about whether an > administrator's decision is legally flawed. The Tribunal was judicially > reviewed on many occasions. The high point or low point, depending on your > point of view, occurred after I had refused registration of a claim by the > Waanyi people over land the subject of the proposed Century Zinc mine in > North Queensland. I refused registration on the basis that the application > could not succeed because of the extinguishing effects of historical > pastoral leases in the area. I took the view that observations about the > extinguishing effects of leases made by Brennan J in Mabo put the matter > beyond doubt. My refusal to register the claim was an administrative act in > the application of a test designed to screen out hopeless claims. The > decision was overturned by the High Court in North Ganalanja[2] with such > moral enthusiasm that the Court gave judgment immediately and reasons later. > In so doing, it described my approach as \\"tantamount to a proleptic exercise > of federal jurisdiction\\". To add insult to injury, members of the Waanyi > people were sitting in Court wearing T-shirts with the message \\"Ban French > Testing\\". I have no doubt, in retrospect, that I was properly found to have > been in error.

He played college football at Northern Arizona University. Early years Lewis attended Horizon High School where he was an All-conference and All-city selection in football, baseball and basketball. He gained over 1,000 rushing yards in his last 2 seasons in football. As a senior in baseball, he batted for a .492 average and tallied a 3-1 record as a pitcher. He accepted a scholarship from Northern Arizona University, where he became a four-year starter at quarterback (41 straight starts) and a three- time team captain. After being redshirted in 1991, he finished his college career with 785 completions of 1,315 passes for 9,655 yards and 67 touchdowns. At the time he was second on the school's all-time list in passing yards (9,655), completions (785), attempts (1,316), pass completion percentage (59.7) and touchdowns (67). He also set the NCAA Division I-AA career record for interception avoidance (1.82). In 2003, he was inducted into the Northern Arizona Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career=Denver Broncos Lewis was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round (100th overall) of the 1996 draft. As a rookie, he was the third-string quarterback. The next year, he was named the backup behind John Elway and was seen as the heir apparent to the future hall of famer. In 1998, he was lost for the season after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament while playing a pickup basketball game and made matters worse by hiding how he suffered the injury. He fell out of favor with head coach Mike Shanahan and was traded to the Carolina Panthers, in exchange for a 1999 third round (#67-Chris Watson) and a 2000 fourth round draft choice (#112-Cooper Carlisle) on March 1, 1999. Carolina Panthers The Carolina Panthers acquired Lewis in 1999, because new head coach George Seifert saw potential in Lewis' athletic ability and wanted to eventually replace starter Steve Beuerlein. In 2001, Lewis was named the starter after Beuerlein was released. He had a bad preseason, including a game where he threw three interceptions in four attempts, which eventually led to him be released on August 31. Rookie Chris Weinke was given the starter job and proceeded to go 1-15 during the regular season. New Orleans Saints On February 19, 2002, he signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints. He was released on August 19. Colorado Crush On January 30, 2003, he was signed by the Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League. He was promoted to the active roster on April 4. Personal life Lewis died on January 5, 2013, at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. An autopsy revealed the cause of death was an accidental drug overdose caused by a mix of morphine and zolpidem (Ambien). At the time of his death he was the wide receivers coach at Northern Arizona, after serving at Louisville as an offensive administrative assistant from 2007 to 2008 and wide receivers coach in 2009. He had one son, Elijah Jaymes.

She worked with and was a close friend of Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Edward Weston and other photographic masters of the period. Biography Lavenson was born to Amy Furth and Albert Lavenson, who was the son of German immigrants and the co-owner of Capwell Department Store in San Francisco. Growing up, Lavenson attended both public and private schools in San Francisco. In 1919 Lavenson graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in psychology. Her first photos were snapshots of family and friends taken with a small Kodak camera. She learned to develop and print her negatives by watching a technician at an Oakland drugstore in the early 1920s, and from the technical information she found in popular magazines such as The Camera and Camera Craft. She traded her Kodak for a 1910 3 ¼\\" x 4 ¼\\" Ensign box reflex camera, fitting it with an inexpensive, uncorrected lens for the soft-focus quality of Pictorialism promoted by those magazines, and made weekend photographic expeditions with friends to the Oakland Estuary and Marin County.Wolff, E. (1999). Alma Lavenson: Mother Lode Photographs. California History, 78(2), 103-105. In 1923 Lavenson had the opportunity to travel Europe for seven months, along the way she kept a travel journal that would become \\"My Discovery of Europe\\".  Recognition  Lavenson's first published photograph, an image of Zion Canyon entitled The Light Beyond, appeared on the cover of Photo-Era magazine in December 1927. In her early work she concentrated the geometric forms of structures and their placement in the landscape. She frequently exhibited in photographic salons and became a member of the influential Pictorial Photographers of America, and continued to be heavily influenced by Pictorialism. In 1930 she was introduced to Adams, Cunningham and Weston by art collector Albert Bender. Bender also wrote Lavenson a letter of introduction to give to Edward Weston. Two years later she was invited to participate in the famous Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, although there is some uncertainty about whether she should actually be called a \\"member\\" of Group f/64, given her association with Pictorialism.Morgan, A. f/64 group. In (Ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists. : Oxford University Press The announcement for the show at the de Young Museum listed seven photographers in Group f/64 and said \\"From time to time various other photographers will be asked to display their work with Group f/64. Those invited for the first showing are: Preston Holder, Consuelo Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, Brett Weston.\\" However, in 1934 the group posted a notice in Camera Craft magazine that said \\"The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, Imogene [sic] Cunningham, Consuela [sic] Kanaga and several others.\\" Lavenson was not mentioned by name in that notice, but her name is always listed as being associated with the group because of her place in the first exhibition. She was included in an exhibition of photography 'by members and associates of Group f.64' held at Gallery 210, Lucas Hall, University of Missouri, St. Louis, Apr. 3-30, 1978. In 1933 Lavenson began taking a series of photographs of abandoned buildings in the Mother Lode region of California. She continued documenting the remains of the Gold Rush period for more than two decades, and her images are now noted both for their artistic beauty and as a record of a vanishing piece of the California landscape.Spaulding, Jonathan. (2011). Spotlight.(Alma Lavenson). California History, 88(2), 72-72. Critical reception Lavenson's Masts and Funnels (1930) was admired by Edward WestonNakasone, M. (2013). Alma Lavenson's \\"Masts and Funnels\\". Yale University Art Gallery Bulletin, 112-115. for its geometric formal qualities but he advised her to abandon her soft- focus lens for a sharper model and persuaded her to abandon her pictorial approach.\\". Though Weston recalled Lavenson as a photographer who \\"fought my criticism (self-invited) of her work a few years ago, but now has seen the light.\\"Edward Weston, The Daybooks of Edward Weston: Volume II, California, ed. Nancy Newhall (New York: Aperture, 1973), 265. Marisa Nakasone argues that Masts and Funnels attracted Weston because it successfully amalgamated \\"straight\\" and \\"pictorial\\" styles he regarded as mutually exclusive, because its soft focus smoothed surfaces and thus supported an abstracted rendition of a subject, supported also by the way it was printed.  Exhibitions  Edward Steichen selected Lavenson's classical portrait study of a San Ildefonso Indian couple, made in 1941, for inclusion in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man that was visited by 9 million people on its world tour. The picture, which had won her third prize in the first Annual Salon 'Photography West of the Rockies' at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1941, was also included in the exhibit and publication Facets of the Collection: Faces Photographed, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1984. Lavenson’s Self-Portrait (with Hands) in 1996-1997 was fashioned into a huge banner and adorned the entrance to the New York Public Library’s exhibition on the history of women photographers. In 1999, the University of California hosted a major retrospective on the photography of Lavenson and Imogen Cunningham., which used the self-portrait as a central image. The self- portrait is used as a cover photograph for the book Watkins to Weston : 101 Years of California Photography (1992). A print of Lavenson’s self-portrait was sold at Christie's New York 'Photographic Masterworks 2' In 2000 for $58,750.The Photograph Collector, Volume 21, Photograph Collectors Newsletter, p.4 2000  Legacy  Alma Lavenson, though she was prolific and successful in the late 1920s and early 1930s, remained an amateur, claiming photography only as \\"my avocation\\". Once she married and had children, her creative productivity slowed.Susan Ehrens, 'Alma Lavenson: An Enduring Vision'. In Alma Lavenson: Photographs, ed. Ehrens (Berkeley, Calif.: Wildwood Arts, 1990), 7-8. She has been a continuing influence on generations of women photographers, especially through her posthumous inclusion in exhibitions at the New York Public Library and the University of California and in publications such as Lucy Lippard's Defining eye : women photographers of the 20th century.

Hồ Quý Ly also made claims that his family was descended from Duke Hu, the founder of Chen, along with the Hồ's being descendants of Shun of Yu 虞舜, which was the reason Hồ immediately changed the name of his country from Đại Việt to Đại Ngu 大虞, using 虞 as a reference to Shun's fiefdom of Yu (Sino-Vietnamese, Ngu). Hồ Quý Ly was born in 1336 at Đại Lại village, Vĩnh Ninh district, Ái Châu, Thanh Đô town with aristocracy's standing. His birth name was birth name Lê Quý Ly (黎季犛), courtesy name Lý Nguyên (理元) or Nhất Nguyên (一元), owed to the fact that he was adopted by Lê Huan, after whom he took the family name. It was not until Hồ Quý Ly deposed of the last Trần emperor that he reverted his family name of Hồ. Throne In 1400, Hồ Quý Ly dethroned the last Trần emperor and declared himself emperor, establishing the Hồ dynasty and renaming the country from Đại Việt to Đại Ngu. During his reign, he made several significant economic and administrative reforms.Corbin, Justin, The History of Vietnam, 2008, p. 10–11. In 1396, he enacted a law issuing paper money instead of minting bronze coins but failed, mostly because of the lack in credibility in paper money as it was easy to duplicate at that time. In 1397, he began to work on land reform policies, limiting the area of land to be owned by aristocrats, mandarins and landlords to 10 acres for each household. He also ordered standardisation of measurement methods, imperial examination reforms and promote the use of Nom script as official writing system instead of Han script. In 1401, he abdicated in favor of his second son Hồ Hán Thương. In accordance with the former Trần dynasty's tradition, Hồ Quý Ly styled himself as Emperor Emeritus and still possessed much power over state affairs. From 1400 to 1403, Hồ Quý Ly and his son, Hồ Hán Thương sent three expeditions against Champa. The first and third expeditions ended with Champa's defensive victory; however the second one (1402) resulted in the Champa King Jaya Simhavarman V relinquishing southern Quảng Nam and northern Quảng Ngãi to the Hồ dynasty.

It serves as the parish church for St. Joseph's Parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile. St. Joseph's Parish is the third oldest in Mobile. It was formed in 1857 to serve Catholics too far removed from the downtown Cathedral and the Church of St. Vincent de Paul in South Mobile. St. Joseph's Parish is approaching it's 160th year of service with its congregation of faithful parishioners.  History  Bishop Michael Portier appointed a Jesuit priest, Father Peter Ismand as the first pastor of St.Joseph Parish in the year 1857. Father Peter Ismand was a popular priest who ministered the soldiers of both the Confederacy and the Union Armed Forces. He was also very active during the Yellow Fever epidemic. The Sisters of Mercy came to Mobile in 1884 for service in St. Joseph's Parish. Their social works mission included visiting the sick, the destitute and prisoners. They founded St. Joseph's School, later to be called the Convent of Mercy Academy. The convent was moved to another location in 1969. Membership of the Parish began to swell and a need arose to plan and construct a larger Church. The present land at Springhill Avenue was purchased from the Prador family. The Jesuits of Spring Hill College were entrusted with the erection of a Church, which they built close to the city hospital in 1858. The new parish was made up primarily of German immigrants. A magnificent church building with its soaring nave and spectacular, stained glass windows was designed in Gothic style. The corner stone was laid by the then Bishop Allen on August 8, 1907. Construction was completed within a year and the present sanctuary was dedicated on August 4, 1908. In 1907 several organizations were established by the church under the leadership of Father Linus Schuler. Among these were: The Altar Society, The Holy Name Society, St. Vincent de Paul Conference, The Society for Propagation of Faith and The Holy Child Association. In September 1908 the Mobile Daily Register wrote a short article about the newly completed church calling it \\"one of the handsomest churches in the state.\\" The paper noted the lack of interior columns as a \\"striking feature\\" resulting in an \\"entirely open interior.\\" The church has a seating capacity of 800. The Jesuits continued to manage the Church and established an endowment to provide ongoing support for the Parish. In 2009 the Jesuits turned over management to the Archdioceses of Mobile.  Architecture  Diboll and Owen of New Orleans were the architects and G. A. Chamblin of Mobile was the contractor. The Church itself is an impressive example of the Gothic Revival style. It is sixty by one hundred feet/ brick with a granite water table and a one hundred and twenty foot tower. The building is a classic medieval reproduction with a gable (slate) to the front nave, a 120-foot centered square tower/ transepts and apse. The facade is dominated by the tower, which has a central entrance of paired wooden doors with Tudor arch tops and corbeled in, battlemented parapet over the entrance. The tower features monumental buttresses with a set of tripled stained glass Tudor windows in the second story and tripled louvered vents in the third story. The side elevations feature large Tudor stained glass windows delineated by buttresses. The transepts are buttressed and include each a pair of tall Tudor windows and large stained glass window above. There is a copper cross atop each transept. The church is entered by the tower and double wooden doors and stained glass windows lead into the sanctuary. The interior consists of a large nave with four rows of pews and open transepts. The aisles are covered by low arches and a high arch covers the nave. There are no columns supporting these arches. The walls are clad with marble wainscoting. The stained glass windows (imported from Germany) are interspersed with the Stations of the Cross. Lantern lights are suspended along each side of the nave. The marble chancery rail extends across the west end of the interior. The apse features free standing Corinthian columns with gilded capitals to either side and massive engaged Corinthian pillars behind. The marble altar is carved with a scene of the Last Supper and the high altar is marble as well with intricate carvings and spires. Each transept includes a large round stained glass window with a niche below containing statuary. A small free standing semi-circular balcony over the main entrance includes organ pipes but no seating.  National Historic Register Significance  St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church retains its integrity of location/ materials and design. The original Gothic cupolas atop the tower corners were destroyed by Hurricane Frederic in 1979. There are no other exterior changes of note. Interior integrity is excellent as well. Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic Church is significant under National Register Criterion as an important high style example of the Second Gothic Revival in Mobile. The high style design, quality materials and workmanship are typical of Catholic architectural endeavors in the city. The property is further significant for the Rectory, contemporary with the church and stylistically compatible through its details. No other rectory in the city is so architecturally similar to its church as this one. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1991 as part of the Historic Roman Catholic Properties in Mobile Multiple Property Submission.

Initially known as a publisher of licensed properties, Millennium adapted works by Arthur Conan Doyle, Lester Dent, Frank Frazetta, Robert E. Howard, Harlan Ellison, H.P. Lovecraft, and Anne Rice; and even TV series like The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Wild Wild West into comic book form. The company expanded its repertoire of horror comics into original titles in the mid-1990s, and further branched out in its later years to embrace the alternative comics genre, starting a short-lived creator-owned imprint called Modern Comics. Millennium was distinctive in that they mostly published one-shots and mini-series, with only a couple of their titles running for more than four issues. The company gave now-established comics artists such as Darryl Banks, Dean Haspiel, Josh Neufeld and Mike Wieringo their first steady exposure, while also working with comics legends Jim Mooney and Don Heck on a number of projects. Other notable comics creators who published with Millennium include Brian Michael Bendis, John Bolton, Joshua Dysart, Bob Eggleton, Dærick Gröss Sr., Kelley Jones, Rik Levins, David W. Mack, and Terry Pavlet.  Publishing history  In many ways representative of the boom period of independent comic book publishing, Millennium thrived in the early years of the 1990s and fell on lean times as the decade came to a close. The company's first offerings, in 1990, were Anne Rice's The Mummy, adapting her novel, The Mummy, or, Ramses the Damned; and The Wild Wild West: The Night of the Iron Tyrants, a four-issue sequel to the TV series scripted by Mark Ellis, who also served as Millennium's comics editor for three years. In 1991, Millennium debuted a series of comics titles featuring Lester Dent's Doc Savage, including the four-part limited series Doc Savage: The Monarch of Armageddon. That series, which was also written by Mark Ellis (and drawn by Darryl Banks), was said by The Comics Buyer's Guide Catalog of Comic Books \\"to come closest to the original, capturing all the action, humanity and humor of the original novels.\\" Also in 1991, Ellis conceived and scripted the critically acclaimed Nosferatu: Plague of Terror, a four-part series which provided a complete story of the title character's origin quite apart from the Dracula legend. Finally, Ellis again turned to adapting and expanding another writer's concepts (H.P. Lovecraft), with the three-issue limited series Cthulhu: The Whisperer in Darkness, which featured the first appearance of The Miskatonic Project. In 1992-1993, Millennium introduced another Anne Rice-related project, Anne Rice's The Witching Hour, which ran for five issues; and another Doc Savage book, Manual of Bronze. In addition, again with Ellis as scripter, they adapted the cult-classic horror film It! The Terror from Beyond Space into comics form. Ellis and Banks teamed up again to produce two issues of Justice Machine, a super-hero title which had previously been published by Comico Comics and Innovation Comics, among others. During this period, Millennium also published its first nonfiction title, Don Hillsman and Ryan Monihan's By Any Means Necessary: The Life and Times of Malcolm X, an unauthorized biography in comic book form. Before leaving Millennium at the end of 1993, Ellis once again flexed his adaptation skills with The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Birds of Prey Affair two-parter. At the end of 1993, co-owners Ellis and Martin, who also functioned as the editorial and production staff, sold their shares in Millennium, but retained ownership of a number of comics properties, such as Nosferatu, The Miskatonic Project, and the new Justice Machine.Transfuzion press release: \\"Transfuzion Publishing and Millennial Concepts Join Forces\\" (July 9, 2008). (When Ellis and Martin left Millennium, the company moved its headquarters from Tampa, Florida, to Rhode Island, first to Narragansett, and finally to Kingston.) The mid-1990s saw the company publishing more original material, still mostly in the horror vein, though they also adapted material created by Robert E. Howard (The Black Reaper) and Arthur Conan Doyle (The Lost World). (The Black Reaper was notable in that it featured Howard's poetry alongside illustrations by comic book artists; it was halfway between a book and a comic book.) During this period, Millennium also picked up the Night's Children series from the defunct Fantaco/Tundra. In 1996, Millennium also debuted Dean Haspiel and Josh Neufeld's eclectic two-man anthology Keyhole, which ran for three issues in 1996-1997 until it moved over to the Modern Comics imprint for issue #4. (Keyhole then was picked up by Top Shelf Productions for the remainder of its six-issue run.) 1997 was notable in that Millennium debuted its creator-owned line, Modern Comics, which featured creators from the minicomic, self- publishing, and zine scenes. This new direction for the company didn't help their fortunes, however, as in 1998 Millennium only published one title, with Modern putting out a paltry two books. Neither Millennium nor Modern released any books in 1999, and Modern's only title in 2000 was Yvonne Mojica's The Bathroom Girls Guide to Christmas Chaos. In 2000, Millennium/Modern closed its doors for good. In late 2007, Ellis and Martin formed Millennial Concepts, reviving the stylized \\"M\\" that had served as Millennium's first company logo. In July 2008, Millennial Concepts joined forces with Caliber Comics founder Gary Reed's Transfuzion Publications in a joint graphic novel-publishing venture.

Today it is on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It has a Pacific-type or 4-6-2 (Whyte notation) wheel arrangement and was built in 1926 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) at their Richmond works. History It pulled Southern's highest-level passenger trains from 1926 until dieselization in the early 1950s, mostly on Southern's Charlotte Division. On Saturday night, April 25th, 1942, #1401 and fellow class locomotive #1403, derailed and landed on their sides when they hit a stalled truck on the crossing at Norcross, Georgia. Its most famous and historic use was as one of the locomotives that pulled President Franklin Roosevelt's funeral train from Warm Springs, Georgia, to Washington in April 1945. The Smithsonian Institution gathered information on two of 1401's engineers from a 1962 Greenville, SC, newspaper interview with one of the Southern's fireman nicknamed \\"Box Car\\". \\"Box Car\\" (fireman for \\"DC\\") accidentally confused the engineers, who happened to be brothers. Oscar \\"OC\\" Surratt was one of the engineers on the train that took Roosevelt to Warm Springs. His brother Cleve \\"DC\\" Surratt was one of the engineers that brought Roosevelt's body back to Washington. In the 1950s, war hero and outside legal counsel to Southern Graham Claytor (who would later become Southern's president) convinced then-Southern president Harry deButts to donate one of the retired Ps-4s to the Smithsonian instead of scrapping it. In this way 1401 was saved, and has been on display at the Smithsonian since it was delivered there on November 25, 1961. Current status Today Southern Railway 1401 is one of the attractions at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Southern cosmetically restored the locomotive just before sending it for display at the Smithsonian, and it was probably stored serviceable when it was retired from active service, but it has not operated in more than half a century. When Graham Claytor was a Southern executive in the mid-1960s, he attempted to lease 1401 from the Smithsonian for operational use in Southern's steam excursion program. The Smithsonian refused, and Claytor leased Southern Railway No. 4501 (originally a freight locomotive with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement) and painted it in the green, gold, and silver scheme instituted for the Ps-4s. Accordingly, it seems unlikely that 1401 will ever steam again. However it is believed to have been in good condition when retired, and has spent most of the time since inside; it is probably in relatively good internal and mechanical condition. Cosmetically, it is in excellent shape. In 2012, the locomotive made an appearance in an episode of Parks and Recreation. Andy (Chris Pratt) mistakes it for Sierra #3, the locomotive seen in Back to the Future Part III, and attempts to climb on it.

On April 19, 1775, during the Battle of Concord, Robinson was the second highest-ranking officer in the field after Colonel James Barrett. Robinson marched next to Major John Buttrick at the head of the American column which advanced on and defeated the British Regulars at the Old North Bridge that day. Robinson would later fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, serve under General George Washington during the Siege of Boston and, in 1786, would take part in the agrarian insurrection known as Shays' Rebellion. Early life Robinson was born in Topsfield, Province of Massachusetts in 1735. At age 29 he married Miss Huldah Perley of Boxford, Massachusetts, the niece of French and Indian War Major General Israel Putnam of Pomfret, Connecticut. Soon after migrating from Topsfield to Westford in search of open farmland, Robinson was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, or second in command of the Minuteman regiment commanded by Col. William Prescott of Pepperell, Massachusetts.Hodgman, 105. Lexington and Concord One of four iconic engraving prints Amos Doolittle produced in the aftermath of Concord and Lexington, Plate III depicts the battle at the North Bridge in Concord. The exact manner in which Robinson was alarmed on the early morning of April 19, 1775 has been lost to history. Most documents relay the story of an unknown, lone alarm rider rousing the officer and his family in the dead of night.Prescott, 5. However, historian David Hackett Fischer asserts that the township as a whole was alerted by the firing of an alarm signal from the nearby village of Carlisle, a Northern precinct of Concord, thereby creating a more general internal alarm throughout the vicinity.Fischer, 146. Regardless, once roused, Robinson moved in haste to join his fellow Minutemen. Robinson, Rev. Joseph Thaxter, and a handful of Westford Minutemen rode on horseback and arrived at Concord in time to participate in the engagement at the Old North Bridge. Robinson and his companions, having traveled by horse, arrived before the companies of Westford militia and minutemen who traveled on foot. Only a very small number of Robinson's regiment were present as the Americans prepared to attack the small British force holding the Old North Bridge. The militia and minutemen present at that time were almost entirely of Col. James Barrett's regiment of Middlesex militia and Col. Abijah Pierce's regiment of Middlesex minutemen. As he had no command present on the field, Robinson requested permission from Major John Buttrick (who had been designated second in command by Barrett and charged with leading the advance) to march at the head of the American column at Buttrick's side. Recognizing Robinson's superior rank, Buttrick offered command of the column to Robinson, despite the fact that it was not Robinson's regiment. Robinson declined and asked to accompany Buttrick as a volunteer.Galvin, 142 and 149. Buttrick and Robinson led the column, side by side, from a hill near Buttrick's farm down to the North Bridge. The first shot fired by the Regulars splashed into the Concord River, fired either accidentally or as a warning to the oncoming Americans. The British then fired several more shots, killing Captain Isaac Davis of Acton who commanded the leading company in the American column. Another of these shots sent a ball through Robinson's coat, just under the arm, severely wounding an Acton volunteer behind Robinson.French, 66-68. Buttrick gave the command to commence fire, resulting in 12 British casualties (three of them fatal). The British retreated almost immediately after the Americans opened fire.Galvin, 151-152. Battle of Bunker Hill Robinson fought from the redoubt on Breed's Hill under the command of Col. William Prescott of Pepperell, Massachusetts. His bravery and valor in outflanking a charge of British regulars along a low fence on Breed's Hill was noted by Prescott in an August 25, 1775 letter to Continental Congressman John Adams. \\"I commanded my Lieut Coll. Robinson...with a detachment to flank the enemy\\" Prescott related, \\"who I have reason to think behaved with prudence and courage.\\" Letter by William Prescott Service at Cambridge Col. Robinson commanded a regiment of over 400 militiamen at Cambridge under the authority of General George Washington during the Siege of Boston from late 1775 to March 23, 1776.Lacroix, 2. His official tenure ended soon after Henry Knox's famous display of captured Fort Ticonderoga artillery brought to a close the British occupation of Boston and forced the wholesale evacuation of Royal forces from the colony. However, the mirth of the Royal retreat was short lived for the Robinson family. The unsanitary conditions of Cambridge camp life brought about a scourge of diseases which were quickly spread throughout New England by the returning soldiers. Almost immediately, these diseases were to have devastating effects on both soldier and citizen alike. In a period of less than two weeks, between the days of August, 30 and September 9, 1775, three of John Robinson's daughters, all under the age of ten, would perish from camp fever. Shays' Rebellion In 1786, Robinson took up arms against the Massachusetts Courts in the post-war farmer's revolt later known as Shays' Rebellion. Little is known of his actual role in the rebellion, his great- Granddaughter Olive Ann Prescott, describing his action as \\"an honest mistake\\" yet noting that he always had fought \\"with an innate hatred of injustice wherever found\\".Prescott, 13 It is known that he acted in concert with Job Shattuck of neighboring Groton, MA, a notable leader in the uprising who Robinson had commanded in Prescott's militia and at the Regimental camp at Cambridge. On September 12, the day on which the Middlesex County Court in Concord was forced to adjourn by an armed mob of Shaysites, \\"The number at 11 o’clock was about seventy, but increased in the afternoon to about two hundred and fifty, by the arrival of others from Worcester county; and from other towns in Middlesex, among whom Col. Robinson of Westford was conspicuous.\\"Shattuck, 125. Legacy The Col. John Robinson elementary school in Westford, Massachusetts is named in his honor, as is the Col. John Robinson chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Westford, Massachusetts. Robinson Rd. in Westford is also named in his honor. There is a small memorial on Westford Town Common with a plaque commemorating his service and the \\"All War Monument\\" at the head of the Westford Town Common also mentions his service during the revolutionary war. A memorial plaque is placed at the entrance to the Westlawn Cemetery on Concord Road in Westford, where Robinson is buried, put there by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Carls was commander of German naval forces, during the Spanish Civil War, and then became Commanding Admiral for the Baltic. At the same time he held the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Group Command East. Still later he became Chief of the larger Naval Group Command North. Early in 1943, Erich Raeder resigned as the commander of the Kriegsmarine after a dispute with Hitler. Raeder nominated either Carls or Karl Dönitz to succeed him, and Hitler chose Dönitz. Carls later resigned, possibly to prevent friction among the naval leadership. Death Admiral Carls was killed in an air raid of the Royal Air Force on Bad Oldesloe on 24 April 1945.

In the first, \\"Three and - an Extra\\", she is introduced as: > Mrs Hauksbee appeared on the horizon; and where she existed was fair chance > of trouble. At Simla her by-name was the 'Stormy Petrel'. She had won that > title five times to my certain knowledge.... She was clever, witty, > brilliant, and sparkling beyond most of her kind; but possessed of many > devils of malice and mischievousness. She could be nice, though, even to her > own sex. But that is another story. Four stories later in the same volume, there is a story where she is shown in a good light - \\"The Rescue of Pluffles\\". In \\"Consequences\\", she does Tarrion's career great service. In \\"Kidnapped\\", she does Peythroppe equally great service, against his will. Mrs Hauksbee exemplifies many of the characteristics of Rudyard Kipling's characteristic writing. She is partly a stereotype (in this case, of the clever woman of the ruling classes [here, the British in India; and the administrative class of them]), and yet a very clearly delineated individual member of that stereotypical group. Her motivations are not simple nor clear cut. Physically, \\"She was a little, brown, thin, almost skinny, woman, with big, rolling, violet-blue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world\\" ('Three and - an Extra'). A characteristic gesture when she is thinking is to draw the lash of her riding whip between her lips - which may indicate her underlying cruelty. There is something feline about her. Her character is dominated by her cleverness. She likes to gather the intelligent and the young around her. Tarrion, in \\"Consequences\\", \\"because he was clever and amusing, ... gravitated naturally to Mrs Hauksbee, who could forgive everything but stupidity\\". \\"She had the wisdom of the Serpent, the logical coherence of the Man, the fearlessness of the Child, and the triple intuition of the Woman\\" \\"Kidnapped\\"). In essence, she is the clever woman who is to be seen as far more clever than men.

AMD uProf is the CPU and Power profiler for the AMD's Zen based processors. AMD CodeAnalyst was a GUI-based code profiler for x86 and x86-64-based machines. CodeAnalyst has similar look and feel on both Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms. CodeAnalyst uses specific hardware profiling techniques which are designed to work with AMD processors, as well as a timer-based profiling technique which does not require specific hardware support; this allows a subset of profiling features to work on non-AMD processors, such as Intel processors. As of March 2013, CodeAnalyst has been replaced by AMD CodeXL. Code optimization CodeAnalyst is built on OProfile for the Linux platform and is available as a free download. The GUI assists in various kinds of code profiling including time based profiling, hardware event-based profiling, instruction-based profiling and others. This produces statistics about details such as time spent in each subroutine which can be drilled down to the source code or instruction level. The time taken by the instructions can be indicative of stalls in the pipeline during instruction execution. Optimization could be as simple as reordering the instructions for maximum utilization of a data line cache or altering/removing the branches and loops so that the maximum number of execution units(Load/Store units, ALU, FP execution unit...) are utilized in parallel. Support for PERF was added in CodeAnalyst 3.4, allowing users to choose between OProfile and PERF as the profiling backend. Instruction-Based Sampling CodeAnalyst supports IBS (Instruction-Based Sampling) that was introduced in Family 10h AMD processors (Barcelona). With IBS support, CodeAnalyst can more precisely identify instructions that cause pipeline stalls and cache misses.

Irish Rebellion and Civil War The younger Coote became an MP for Leitrim in the Irish Parliament between 1634 and 1635 and again in 1640, a year before the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1641. The elder Charles Coote was active in the suppression of the Irish insurgents in 1642, launching attacks on Clontarf and County Wicklow in late 1641 in which many civilians died; he was killed in action defending Trim in May 1642. After the death of his father, Charles Coote also led some of the King's forces under Ormonde against the Confederate army, but was captured defending a stronghold in the Curragh of Kildare by an Irish army led by Castlehaven. He was released during the 1643 cessation of arms. At this time Coote travelled to England with a number of Protestants to agitate for harsh anti-Catholic measures and an end to the cessation. In Dublin Archbishop Ussher condemned the extremism of Coote and his fellows, but Coote was unbending. The King, however, ignored these demands and so Coote joined the Parliamentarians.Meehan, Confederation of Kilkenny,pg 101 Coote was appointed commander of Connacht by the Parliamentarians in 1645. Operating from west Ulster, he temporarily overran the north-west of the province over the next two years. The Cromwellian Conquest The execution of Charles I in 1649 led local Protestant and Scottish forces in Ulster to join the Duke of Ormond's royalist coalition, thus isolating Coote. He defended Derry against a protracted siege (March–August 1649), with the unlikely assistance of the Irish Confederate Ulster army under Owen Roe O'Neill. After the New Model Army under Cromwell captured Drogheda, a force of several thousand Parliamentarians under Robert Venables headed north into Ulster, where Coote joined Venables to destroy the Scottish Ulster Royalists at the Battle of Lisnagarvey. By early 1650, however, the Irish Ulster army (now under Heber MacMahon, as O'Neill had died a few months earlier) became active once more, and Coote was again forced onto the defensive. After being reinforced, he advanced on the Irish army at Scarrifholis and routed them, killing over 2,000 soldiers and taking no prisoners. After this, Coote's army attempted to take the formidable fortress of Charlemont, which was defended by the remnants of the Ulster army, but his soldiers suffered heavy casualties before the stronghold surrendered. Having largely cleared Ulster, in June 1651 he advanced on Athlone from the North- West, evading a blocking force. Through this movement the town was gained; the town contained a stone bridge over the Shannon and this action thus opened up Connacht to the Parliamentarian army for the first time. He besieged Galway in the winter of 1651 and it surrendered in April 1652. Coote inherited the substantial plantation lands of his father in the midlands of Ireland. Restoration In December 1659, Coote took part in a coup against the government, seizing Dublin Castle. In February 1660 he sent a representative to Charles II, inviting him to make an attempt on Ireland.Dictionary of National Biography 1887 volume 12-page 157 Coote was a central figure in the Convention Parliament.Patrick Little, 'Coote, Charles, first earl of Mountrath (c.1610–1661)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, January 2008 accessed 3 July 2010 Following the Restoration, Charles II ennobled him Earl of Mountrath in 1660 as a reward for his support. In the remaining months of his life, he was one of the three most powerful men in Ireland, as the King appointed him Lord Justice of Ireland, together with Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery and Sir Maurice Eustace. Pending the appointment of the Duke of Ormond as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Lords Justices acted as the interim government. However, deep divisions among the three men, particularly on the question of whether dispossessed Roman Catholics should be allowed to recover their lands, seriously weakened the effectiveness of the regime. He built Rush Hall near Mountrath, which was the family's main residence for several generations. Coote died of smallpox in 1661 and was buried in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. Family He married firstly Mary Rushe, daughter of Sir Francis Rushe and secondly Jane Hannay, daughter of Sir Robert Hannay and had issue by both wives, including Charles who succeeded as 2nd Earl. His widow, Jane, quickly remarried Sir Robert Reading, 1st Baronet, and had further issue.

It is just a few meters from another state university, Western Mindanao State University and about 500 meters from Pilar College along R.T. Lim Boulevard. It is nestled along the university belt of the city where most of the colleges are. History The Zambonga City State Polytechnic College was established in July 1905, at the present site of the Zamboanga Central School. It was administered by American teachers with Mr. Hogges as its principal. He was succeeded by Mr. Ash, where the original shop class was increased to two shop classes and a drawing class added. In 1912, due to the increased enrolment, this classes were separated from the Zamboanga Central School and were moved two kilometers away to barangay Baliwasan (the present site). The shop classes were held at the nearby Zamboanga Normal School. Mr. Parker was its first principal. In 1921 it was converted into a provincial trade school known as the Zamboanga Trade School and was authorized to offer the secondary curriculum. Mr. Parker was succeeded by Mr. Vicente Macairan in 1924. It was during his term as principal that a two-storey building was erected. Mr. Vicente Enrile took the place of Mr. Macairan as principal in 1934. After the granting of the Charter of Zamboanga City in 1936 by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 39, the Zamboanga Trade School was placed under the administration of the city and was converted into the Zamboanga City Trade School. The school was authorized to continue offering the secondary trade curriculum. The school was temporarily closed during World War II. Four shop buildings were constructed under Mr. Enrile's administration. Classes resumed after the war in 1945. In 1954, by virtue of Republic Act No. 846, the Zamboanga City Trade School was converted into regional school of arts and trades known as the Zamboanga City Regional School of Arts and Trades, with Mr. Marcelo S. Bonilla as its first superintendent. RA 846 authorized the school to offer post-secondary courses in Trade Technical Education. Moreover, during the school years 1954-55 and 1955–56, five shop buildings were set up: two FOA-PHILCUSA buildings, a Girl's Trade Building, and two shops for Auto Mechanics and Boat Building. In 1959, by virtue of Republic Act No. 2300, the school was converted into a national school known as Zamboanga School of Arts and Trades. Since then, in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) and in all communications from the Bureau of Public Schools, the term “City Regional” has been deleted. In the same year, Mr. Bonilla was transferred to Ilo-ilo School of Arts and Trades and Mr. Mariano P. Dagdag became the new superintendent of the school. Beginning in 1962 the Four-Year Industrial Teacher Education Curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE) was offered by virtue of Republic Act No. 3268. Mr. Dagdag likewise introduced improvements including the construction of a science building, a related-subjects building, an administration building and a gymnasium. In 1966, in order to help workers in the industry update and enhance their skills and competence and give opportunity to out of school youths, the school started to offer the two-year Special Trade Curriculum otherwise called the Evening Opportunity Program Classes in school year 1966–67. Upon retirement of Mr. Mariano Dagdag in 1967, Mr. Felizardo Camilon came in as a Superintendent of the school. Mr. Camilon was succeeded by Mr. Pedro Gomez, Sr. in 1971. During the latter's term, the TVEP programs were established and the TEI Building was constructed. In 1975, because of the growing need for industrial technologist the Zamboanga of Arts and Trade was chosen as one of the trade schools authorized by the Department pf Education, Culture and Sports to offer the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (Four-Year BSIT) through Department Order No. 28, s. 1975 dated August 8. 1975, the World Food Bodega Building was constructed. The ROTC building and another prefab building adjacent to it were also constructed. Shops like the industrial arts, drafting and boat buildings were refurbished. In 1978 the school was given authority by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) to offer the six-month Basic Seaman Training Course under MECS Permit No. 5, s.1978. In 1982 the school was selected as one of the twenty-one trade technical schools to become Technician Education Institute (TEI) under the ROADB Technical-Vocational Education Project (TVEP). This project through MECS Order No. 38, s. 1982, authorized the offering of the two-year Diploma of Technology. Mr. Pedro F. Gomez, Sr. retired in 1985 and Mr. Utumama Abdulla became the officer-in-charge of the school. During Mr. Abdulla's term the technician programs were enriched and lengthened to three years starting school year 1986-87 when MECS Order No. 17, s. 1986 superseded MECS Order No. 38, s, 1982. Dr. Jausan Tahil came over from Samar and became the Superintendent of the Zamboanga School of Arts and Trades. By the authority of DECS Order No. 56, s. 1987 the school offered the one-year Craftsman Certificate and two-year Certificate of Technology. As the school developed in its pursuit to meet the challenges of the times, in 1991 it was authorized to offer the Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE) through the issuance of DECS Order No. 22, s. 1991 on March 5, 1991. Also, in the same year, the school started offering the Master of Arts in Teaching Vocational Education (MATVE) with major fields in Industrial Arts and Home Economics through DECS Order No. 59, s. 1991. During the incumbency of Dr. Jausan L. Tahil, the construction of the TEI Building was finally completed. Renovations were made in the Machine Shop Technology, Automotive Technology, and Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology buildings. And the Boat Building Shop became the Civil Technology Shop. The old College Building was re- constructed, the ESF High School building and BSIE Buildings were constructed thru the efforts of Congresswoman Maria Clara L. Lobregat. The school became a recipient of Philippine Australian Technical Vocational Education Program (PATVEP). Because of her great concern for the improvement and development of technical and industrial education, Congresswoman Maria Clara L. Lobregat sponsored the bill in 1992 converting the Zamboanga School of Arts and Trades into Zamboanga City Polytechnic College by virtue of Republic Act No. 7474. Due to the untimely death of Dr. Jausan L. Tahil in 1996, Mr. Lionel R. Villavieja the College Dean, assumed as officer-in-charge and eventually became the Superintendent in 1998. During this time the school was undergoing a process where Republic Act 8292 played a vital role. While integration with Western Mindanao State University was deemed imminent, Mr. Villavieja stood firm on his stance against it. This conversion was finally paid-off when Republic Act 9142 was approved on July 20, 2001. The College once more evolved into an institution known as the Zamboanga City State Polytechnic College. This special law, sponsored by Congressman Celso L. Lobregat, pursues the excellenc in technical and industrial education and in the development of research in these areas. Mr. Lionel R. Villavieja, is the last Superintendent of the College and is the first President of the Zamboanga City State Polytechnic College, his appointment was approved on September 13, 2002. Dr. Nora M. Ponce became the second President of the College on January 13, 2009. During her term, more curricular programs was offered. Among these are: Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Development Communication. It was also during her stint as president that several infra projects were built including the ZCSPC Gymnasium. The quest towards becoming a university had also begun under her term. The third and current President – Dr. Nelson P. Cabral assumed office on May 5, 2017. His administration prioritizes the development and enhancement of the engineering and technology programs of the College with massive procurement of laboratory equipment in engineering, science and technology as part of its vision to become one of the best polytechnic schools in the country. Infrastructure projects for the improvement of the school's facilities are on the pipeline as part of its priority projects alongside with many other programs and projects all geared towards inevitably becoming a university.

It was one of the first actions of the campaign and involved an overland advance by elements of a Marine Raider battalion, supported by a United States Army infantry company. Supported by airstrikes, the Marines carried out an enveloping attack on the Japanese defenders around the harbor and forced them to withdraw. The harbor was subsequently used by US forces to support further operations, although plans to build a PT boat base in the area were later canceled when the harbor was found to be unsuitable. Background The battle was one of the first actions of the New Georgia campaign. Located on the southwestern coast of New Georgia island, Viru Harbor lies along a key avenue of approach towards Rendova and Munda Point.Miller p. 69 (map) In formulating their plans to secure the New Georgia islands, US planners assessed that several preliminary operations were required ahead of the main operation to capture Japanese airfield at Munda Point. This included the capture of Viru Harbor. Because of its proximity to New Georgia, it offered the Allies an important sheltered harbor that could support lines of supply as they advanced north from the Solomons through New Georgia and towards Bougainville. Consequently, they planned to use the area as a staging base for landing craft proceeding towards Rendova, where the main US force would be built up prior to landing around Zanana and advancing to Munda Point to capture the Japanese airfield there.Rentz pp. 25–29Miller p. 93 Allied landings in the New Georgias Other preliminary operations were envisaged to capture Wickham Anchorage to secure staging base further south to provide a chain to support the movement of troops and equipment from the Russells and Guadalcanal. Another operation was also envisaged to capture Segi Point as a location for an airfield; these operations were to be conducted simultaneously at the end of June, but the Segi Point operation was brought forward due to concerns about the safety of Allied intelligence personnel, including District Officer Donald Gilbert Kennedy, a New Zealand coastwatcher, operating in the area.Rentz pp. 25, 29 & 37Miller p. 73Morison p. 141 Segi Point was subsequently secured by an unopposed landing from two companies from Lieutenant Colonel Michael S. Currin's 4th Marine Raider Battalion (Companies O and P) that had embarked upon the high speed transports Dent and Waters. The Marines were later reinforced by two companies from the 103rd Infantry Regiment (Companies A and D), which landed on 22 June from the transports Schley and Crosby. Currin's force then established a defensive position and began patrolling the nearby area.Rentz pp. 37–40Shaw & Kane p. 53 Battle The original US plan for the capture of Viru Harbor involved B Company, 103rd Infantry Regiment (Captain Raymond Kinch)Shaw & Kane p. 70 coming ashore directly inside the harbor from three destroyer-transports (Hopkins, Kilty and Crosby), while Companies O and P from the 4th Marine Raider Battalion—other elements from the battalion had been sent to secure Wickham Anchorage—advanced overland from Regi, near Lambeti Village, to the south. The Segi beachhead would be held by the Companies A and D, 103rd Infantry Regiment.Rentz p. 38 The Marines had begun moving to Regi by rubber boats from Segi Point on 27 June,Miller pp. 81–84 having arrived at Segi Point on 21 June during the preliminary operation to protect Kennedy and his small group of local forces.Morison p. 141 The troops from B Company, 103rd Infantry Regiment were reinforced by part of D Company, 103rd Infantry Regiment and were supported by a battery of the 70th Coast Artillery Battalion and part of Company D, 20th Naval Construction Battalion.Rentz p. 26Miller p. 80 These troops formed part of Colonel Daniel H. Hundley's Eastern Landing Force.Miller p. 82 Seizure of Viru harbor The Japanese troops defending the area were commanded by First Lieutenant Takagi and amounted to 245 men from a company from Major Masao Hara's 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment (Colonel Genjiro Hirata), which had been detached from Major General Minoru Sasaki's Southeast Detachment. Hara's infantry company was reinforced by personnel from Commander Saburo Okumura's Kure 6th and the Yokosuka 7th Special Naval Landing Forces under Commander Takeda Kashin. Together these units formed part of the 8th Combined Special Naval Landing Force. Fire support included several guns including a 3-inch coast defense gun, four 80 mm guns, and eight other guns of varying types and calibers.Rentz, pp. 24 and 37Rottman pp. 65–66.Day p. 79 The US destroyer-transports entered the harbor early on 30 June, but found that the Marines' advance had been delayed. Coming under fire from a Japanese 3-inch field gun from Tetemara Point, and having been unable to establish radio contact with Currin's Marines, the US naval commander, Commander Stanley Leith, decided to withdraw from the harbor.Rentz p. 41 After waiting offshore for the agreed upon signal from the Marines while remaining out of range of the defending Japanese coastal artillery, the ships moved towards Segi Point instead, landing the company from the 103rd Infantry at Nono. Leith assessed that the Marines were potentially in trouble and needed assistance, which could be provided by Kinch's company if they advanced overland to link up with them. As the landing force departed Viru Harbor, Hara reported that his forces had repulsed the landing attempt.Rentz pp. 41–42 Meanwhile, the Marine raiders' approach saw them advance through dense terrain, and had been delayed due to several skirmishes with the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army troops that were guarding the approaches to Viru Harbor. During the advance, Currin's men clashed with Japanese troops around the Lambeti Plantation on both sides of the Lakuru River on 28 June and then again around the Choi River on 29 June.Rentz p. 41 (map) He then received intelligence that the main concentration of Japanese forces was around the western shore of the harbor, at Tetemara, with an outpost across the harbor at Tombe.Rentz p. 42 Funeral for Marines killed during the fighting for Viru Harbor The Marines stopped short of the junction of the Tetemara–Tombe trails, close to their objective (Viru Harbor) on the evening of 30 June, and prepared to launch their attack the following day. Currin's men subsequently launched two-pronged attack the following morning; two platoons were detached to attack Tombe from the northeast, while the rest of the regiment skirted around the harbor to the north, crossing the Viru, Tita and Mango Rivers, and assaulted Tetemara from the southwest.Rentz pp. 42–43 The outpost at Tombe was quickly overwhelmed around 08:45 on 1 July, while the main body of Marines drove the Japanese out of Viru in a running battle that lasted until the early afternoon. They were supported by preliminary air attacks by seventeen US Navy Dauntless dive- bombers, while landing craft with combat supplies (ammunition and fuel) entered the harbor to ensure rapid resupply. As Hara's troops withdrew into the jungle, the Marines began constructing defensive positions to wait for reinforcement.Rentz p. 43Morison p. 152 Aftermath Casualties amounted to 13 US personnel killed and 15 wounded, while 61 Japanese were killed and around 100 were wounded.Melson, p. 6 The surviving members of Hara's 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment, totaling about 170 men,Rottman p. 66 spent the next two weeks withdrawing back to Munda where they were concentrated around Lambeti Plantation—halfway between Munda Point and Ilangana—during preparations for a counterattack in mid-July.Rentz pp. 43, 82 (note 61) & 85 (map) On 4 July, Viru Harbor was occupied by the company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment which followed the Marines' advance overland and U.S. Navy personnel and ships.Miller pp. 84–85 The troops from 4th Marine Raider Battalion and 103rd Infantry Regiment held the area until 9 July when they were relieved; Currin's men returned to Guadalcanal. They were later sent to reinforce Colonel Harry B. Liversedge's Northern Landing Group around Bairoko, arriving off Enogai Point on 18 July.Shaw & Kane, pp. 133–134 In the aftermath of the battle, Segi Point was subsequently developed into an airfield, while Viru Harbor was to developed into a staging base to support subsequent operations aimed at supporting the Landings on Rendova and the Drive on Munda Point. Nevertheless, plans to establish a PT boat base in the harbor were canceled when the harbor was determined to be unsuitable. Personnel from the 20th Naval Construction Battalion remained in the area until October 1943, working to unload vessels and carry out base development tasks. This included road construction and improvement, construction of a marine railway, and construction and occupation of beach defenses. They also worked to repair the already existing wharf utilizing local materials, including coral and coconut tree logs.Bureau of Yards and Docks, pp. 264–265 NotesReferences   Further reading   - Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

It is the first appearance in book form of the fictional character Strickland. (It was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on 25 April 1887.) Strickland, a policeman who is regarded as disreputable for his habits in going undercover disguised as a native, falls in love with Miss Youghal. Her parents do not approve, not only are \\"ways and works\\" untrustworthy, but he works in \\"the worst paid Department in the Empire.\\" Her parents forbid him from speaking with or writing to their daughter. \\"'Very well,' said Strickland, for he did not wish to make his lady- love's life a burden.\\" Then he takes three months leave, disappears, and is employed as her Sais, or native groom, called Dulloo. One day, towards the end of the three months, \\"an old and very distinguished General\\" takes Miss Youghal riding, and flirts with her. Strickland \\"stood it as long as he could. Then he caught hold of the General's bridle, and, in most fluent English, invited him to step off and be flung over the cliff.\\" Miss Youghal explains, and the General begins to laugh. He intercedes on the behalf of the young pair to her parents, and they are married. :All quotations in the plot summary above have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899. The text is that of the third edition (1890), and the author of the article has used his own copy of the 1923 reprint. Further comment, including page-by-page notes, can be found on the Kipling Society's website, at . Further appearances of Strickland Strickland made six further appearances in the Kipling canon, figuring in two tales of the supernatural in Life's Handicap. \\"Mark of the Beast\\" tells of the possession of a naive Englishman by a werewolf-like spirit as punishment for defiling the image of a native god, and its exorcism by Strickland and the narrator. \\"The Return of Imray\\" is cast in the classic form of the ghost of a murdered man returning to seek justice. Both stories are set in the time before Strickland's engagement, and refer to his reputed knowledge of Indian customs and psychology. In The Bronkhorst Divorce (in Plain Tails from the Hills), a brutish army officer tries to divorce his wife, using the perjured testimony of Indian servants as evidence of adultery. Although Strickland has sworn not to go undercover officially, following his marriage, he nevertheless hangs around Bronkhorst's compound in various disguises. In court, one sight of \\"Estrakheen Sahib\\" is enough to make Bronkhorst's servants retract their statements. Strickland makes his fourth appearance in Kipling's \\"Kim\\", where, as a District Superintendent of the Police, he rescues E23 with Kim's help. He is described by E23 as \\"no less than the greatest\\" of those who play in the Great Game. Strickland and his son, Adam, appear in two more stories: \\"The Son of His Father,\\" set in Adam's childhood, and \\"A Deal in Cotton,\\" which depicts Adam's own adventures in the Civil Service in Africa. 1887 short stories Short stories by Rudyard Kipling Rudyard Kipling stories about India Works originally published in the Civil and Military Gazette ","title":"Miss Youghal's Sais"},{"id":"18642532","text":"Yzerfontein in 2006 Yzerfontein, or Ysterfontein, is a small harbour town with about 1200 inhabitants on the west coast of South Africa about 90 km north of Cape Town.

Duguit's novel objectivist theory of public law, developed in amicable rivalry with his colleague Maurice Hauriou of Toulouse, was to have a lasting effect on the development of these parts of law. In Duguit's opinion, the state was not a mythical Sovereign inherently superior to all its subjects, or even a particularly powerful legal person, but merely a group of people engaged in public service, the activity constituting and legitimising the state.

The small Japanese garrison was quickly overwhelmed by US troops, but the island was subjected to heavy attack by Japanese aircraft over several days. The landings were some of the first Allied landings during the New Georgia Campaign of the Pacific War and were successful in securing the island and providing a base from which the Allies could support the subsequent invasion of New Georgia island and the eventual capture of Munda airfield in early August 1943. Background Rendova Island forms part of the New Georgia group and is situated off the western coast of mainland New Georgia, separated from it by the Blanche Channel. It is roughly rectangular in shape, oriented northeast, with a southwestern tip that extends like the toe of shoe towards Tetepare Island.Miller p. 69 (map) At the time of the battle, the island's significance lay in its proximity to Munda Point on the western coast of New Georgia island, where the Japanese had established an airfield. In the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, concluded in early 1943, the Allies formulated plans to advance through the Central Solomons towards Bougainville, in conjunction with further operations in New Guinea, as part of the effort to reduce the main Japanese base around Rabaul under the guise of Operation Cartwheel.Miller p. 73Rentz p. 52 350px The campaign plan for securing New Georgia, designated Operation Toenails by US planners, involved initial landings to secure staging areas and an airfield in the southern part of New Georgia, to support the movement of troops and supplies from Guadalcanal to Rendova, which would be built up as base for further operations in New Georgia focused on securing the airfield at Munda. Rendova's beaches were well suited to being used as assembly points for landing craft, and the high terrain in the center of the island offered good observation. The harbor would be used to support PT-boat operations against Japanese barges operating in the area and artillery emplaced on the island to support actions on the western coast of New Georgia.Morison, p. 153 The Japanese garrison on Rendova was small and consisted of between 120 and 290 troops from two companies of the Kure 6th Special Naval Landing Forces and the 229th Infantry Regiment. These two companies formed part of Major General Minoru Sasaki's Southeast Detachment,Rottman, p. 66 which was headquartered at Munda; Colonel Genjiro Hirata was in command of the 229th, based on New Georgia.Rentz, pp. 20, 57 & 72 These troops had arrived on New Georgia between February and May 1943 as part of Japanese efforts to reinforce the sector following the Guadalcanal campaign.Rottman, p. 65 June 30 landings The landings were timed to take place in conjunction with similar operations at Nassau Bay, in New Guinea, and on Woodlark and Kiriwina.Morison, pp. 132 & 134 After sailing from Guadalcanal on June 29,Miller, p. 85 the Allied landing force, Task Force 31, was hampered by rain and fog. The main ground combat element assigned to this force was Major General John H. Hester's 43rd Infantry Division. The task force's approach was covered by Catalinas flying night patrols through the Blanche Channel. In the pre-dawn hours (approximately 02:25 hours) the American destroyers USS Talbot and USS Zane detached from the main force to land New Zealand-trained and led Fijian and Tongan commandosHorton, pp. 54–57Larsen, pp. 9 & 108 and Companies A and B of the American 169th Infantry Regiment on Sasavele Island and Baraulu Island. The islands were quickly secured, although Zane, due to poor visibility, became grounded on a reef, remaining so until the afternoon. These islands were strategically important because they are located just off the coast of New Georgia and control the entrance to Roviana Lagoon from the Blanche Channel.Rentz, p. 54Morison, p. 147 Ships laden with equipment and troops approach Rendova Admiral Richmond K. Turner commanded the invasion fleet—consisting of four transports and two supply ships, screened by eight destroyersMorison, p. 148—from his flagship, the attack transport McCawley. A small advanced party of two companies from the 172nd Infantry Regiment was sent ashore around Rendova Harbor guided by a British officer, Major Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Frederick Rhoades, a Royal Australian Navy officer. Along with a small group of local police constables, they intended on linking up with an Australian coastwatcher, Flight Lieutenant Dick Horton, who would assist them in establishing the beachhead prior to the main landing. Strong winds pushed the advanced party off course and ultimately they did not make contact with Horton until the first wave was making its run to the shore. After arriving at the correct beach, Clemens and Rhoades led their men in a quick attack on a house in Rendova Plantation, killing two Japanese behind the beach.Hammel, pp. 49–50 By 06:00 hours, the main Allied landings on Rendova, delivering troops from the 43rd Division, had begun, albeit chaotically. The U.S. Marine Corps' official history describes the initial landing as \\"hurried\\", \\"[having] all the appearance of a regatta rather than a coordinated landing\\" and \\"chaotic in the extreme\\";Rentz, p. 55 nevertheless, troops from the 103rd Field Artillery Battalion, along with Marines from the 9th Defense Battalion and Seebees from the 24th Naval Construction Battalion secured the beach although they were hampered by sporadic sniper fire. The appearance of a Japanese \\"Betty\\" bomber which circled the landing zone but did not attack also slowed progress.Rentz, p. 56Shaw & Kane, p. 80 The Japanese defenders reported back to their commanders that \\"due to the tenacious interference by enemy fighter planes, a decisive blow could not be stuck against the enemy landing convoy\\" and that the landings were an \\"absolutely miraculous\\" and \\"speedy disembarkation of the enemy.\\"Miller, pp. 90–91 Marines landing at Rendova Harbor on D-Day Following the first echelon, the 43rd Division's assistant commander, Brigadier General Leonard Wing, and Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, in command of the operation to secure New Georgia, waded ashore under sniper fire after their boat became grounded about from the beach.Hammel, pp. 50–51 The 2nd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment established a defensive perimeter around the beachhead, but experienced trouble digging-in due to the heavily waterlogged ground. Eventually, they were forced to move their defensive lines to higher ground.Hamel, p. 52 As the invasion progressed American supplies crowded the beaches as infantry pushed the Japanese defenders inland. The 9th Marine Defense Battalion, in addition to skirmishing with Japanese forces, began securing and clearing their predefined artillery position objectives and the Seabees from the 24th Naval Construction Battalion began clearing an encampment for a medical aid station.Rentz, p. 56 The Seabees' work was hampered by sniper fire, while the heavy rain quickly turned the ground to mud which disrupted the movement of vehicles and heavy tractors that were tasked with dragging the heavy artillery pieces into position.Hammel, pp. 52–53 thumb In response to the landing, Japanese artillery batteries based on Bangaa Island and around Munda then began shelling four US destroyers that were sailing through the Blanche Channel offshore from the landing beach. This shelling damaged the destroyer Gwin, killing three and wounding seven, before two other ships from the screen—Farenholt and Buchanan—began engaging the shore batteries, while the damaged Gwin obscured the transports with smoke to prevent them from being engaged.Morison pp. 148–149 A force of 27 Zeros from the 11th Air Fleet, undertook a fighter sweep over the beachhead just before noon, delaying the unloading of the US transports while Allied fighters engaged them, shooting down four.Morison p. 150Stille p. 42Hammel, pp. 55–58 The assault, although initially chaotic, successfully landed six thousand American troops on Rendova. These forces came ashore largely unopposed as the island's small garrison was taken by surprise and were unable to man their defenses in time before the US troops arrived. The Japanese initially assembled in a coconut plantation behind the landing beach and sought to establish radio contact with Munda, while undertaking minor skirmishing and laying down harassing fire from machine guns in the nearby plantation. In the initial fighting, about 12 Japanese were killed. They then withdrew into the hinterland. Troops from the 172nd Infantry Regiment pursued the withdrawing Japanese, shooting down several snipers and destroying several machine gun positions as they advanced slowly towards the Pengui River. There, the Americans came under sustained fire, but after gaining fire superiority with mortar support, and establishing a firm base along the riverbank, the US troops attacked. By the end of the day between 50 and 65 Japanese had been killed, including the Japanese commander. Four US soldiers were killed, and another five wounded including the 172nd Infantry Regiment's commander, Colonel David Ross.Hammel, pp. 51–52 In the afternoon of June 30, the transports weighed anchor and began to depart the area around 15:00 hours. Half an hour later, Japanese air attacks began in earnest when Admiral Jinichi Kusaka ordered a strike by 25 Betty torpedo bombers, escorted by 24 Zeros. Despite being intercepted by 16 Corsairs from Marine Fighter Squadron 221, and coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire, one of the Bettys was able to release a torpedo, which struck McCawley, killing 15 sailors and wounding eight others. While under tow from Libra, the ship again came under attack from Val dive bombers, which formed part of a larger air attack consisting of 21 Zeros, nine Vals and 13 F1M floatplanes. This attack was repulsed with no Allied losses,Stille p. 43 as the Japanese air attacks on the landing zone were successfully beaten off by American fighter planes as well as land and sea- based anti-aircraft defense guns.Rentz, pp. 57–58Morison pp. 148–151 Allied aircraft began bombing Japanese positions around Villa and Munda,Shaw & Kane, p. 83Rottman, p. 66 and by 17:00 hours, 105 mm artillery guns from the 103rd Field Artillery Battalion had been established in the harbor and began registering targets on the mainland.Rentz, p. 57 Air and naval losses on the first day are disputed. The Japanese claimed to have shot down 50 Allied aircraft, although the Allies reported only 21 planes lost. Additionally, the Japanese claimed to have sunk a cruiser and a destroyer, and damaging two more destroyers and eight transports; Allied reported shipping losses amounted to one destroyer damaged and one transport sunk. On the Allied side, they claimed to have shot down 106 Japanese planes, but Japanese figures support only 30 lost. Japanese naval and aerial counter-attacks During the night, McCawley, having rendezvoused with the tug Pawnee, was mistakenly sunk by American PT boats, being struck by two torpedoes at 20:23 hours. By this time, Turner had transferred his flag to the destroyer Farenholt.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Volume 4, p. 290Morison p. 151 Meanwhile, the same night, a Japanese naval attempt to attack the American beachheads failed when five Japanese destroyers appeared off the west coast of Rendova but could not attack due to a violent squall.Rentz, p. 61 After the lightly contested landings on June 30, the bulk of the surviving Japanese forces retreated to Munda Point on nearby New Georgia, moving back via canoe. Troops from the 172nd Infantry Regiment expanded the beachhead on 1 July, with patrols securing half the island, while the 3rd Battalion, 103rd Infantry Regiment landed around the Poco Plantation in Landing Craft Infantry vessels.Hammel, pp. 69–70 Fires burning on \\"Suicide Point\\" after the Japanese air raid on 2 July that caught American forces by surprise and left over 150 Americans dead or injured. In the harbor, the unloading process had been hampered by poor planning and a failure to allocate adequate personnel for beach control and unloading duties. To clear the beachhead and distribute combat stores, infantrymen were detailed to carry out the work.Shaw & Kane, pp. 81 & 85 When the second transport echelon arrived, many of the boats grounded offshore and had to be unloaded manually by troops wading ashore. Heavy rain continued to slow the distribution of stores and movement of heavy equipment.Hammel, pp. 70–71 The second echelon also landed heavy artillery from the 192nd Field Artillery Battalion and a battery from the 9th Defense Battalion.Miller, p. 91 With their arrival, the U.S. forces constructed artillery positions on Rendova and were able to bring 155 mm \\"Long Tom\\" guns into action, firing shells across the 15 km-wide Blanche Channel onto the Japanese positions at Lambeti plantation and Munda air field.Rentz, p. 57 The 192nd established their positions on Kokorana Island where strong coral substratum offered natural hard standing for their heavy guns.Hammel, p. 72 Six PT boats under the command of Lieutenant Commander Robert B. Kelly also arrived at Rendova early on 1 July; it was this force that accidentally sunk McCawley during their passage through the Blanche Channel.Morison p. 151 On 2 July, the US infantrymen on Rendova commenced preparations to reembark for further operations on New Georgia island.Shaw & Kane, p. 85 That afternoon, a Japanese aerial counter-attack consisting of 24 Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers and 44 fighters bombed the American beachhead from the south.Rentz p. 62 American fighters planes had been withdrawn at the time of the attack due to poor weather conditions and the Japanese planes were unopposed. The bombing was accurate and the unsuspecting American troops had no time to react. As a result of the attack a gelignite dump exploded on a peninsula thereafter known as \\"Suicide Point,\\" killing 64 soldiers and injuring at least 89 more.Rentz p. 63 A few hours after this first raid a follow up raid was conducted by 25 Japanese fighter aircraft. These were intercepted by American fighter aircraft and in the ensuing air battle six Japanese planes and three American planes were shot down.Rentz p. 64 The aftermath of an August air raid on Rendova During the night of 2–3 July the Japanese cruiser Yūbari and nine destroyers attempted a bombardment of the Rendova beachhead but bad weather and the small size of the beachhead caused all their shells to fall harmlessly into the surrounding jungle. Meanwhile, that same night, small groups of US infantry were transported in LCMs across the Strait to New Georgia's offshore islands in the opening phase of the Drive on Munda Point operation. A Japanese sortie of 35 Mitsubishi Ki-21 bombers and fighter aircraft attempted to attack positions on Rendova on 3 July, but were intercepted by American fighter planes who reported downing 11 Japanese aircraft with a loss of 3 Allied aircraft. In the afternoon a large flight of American and New Zealand planes bombed Munda Point and reported causing large amounts of damage. On 4 July, American Independence Day, Rendova was reported \\"secure\\" by American commanders. Shortly after this, the Japanese launched a heavy air attack on the island. The US garrison had been heavily reinforced with antiaircraft guns and radars, and a strong fighter screen had been established to protect unloading operations in Rendova Harbor. A force of over 80 Japanese aircraft, consisting of 17 bombers and 66 fighter escorts, subsequently attacked the island from the east. At least 11 Japanese aircraft were shot down, although US losses and claims remain uncertain, with the Japanese claiming to have shot down a large number defending fighters and having sunk several transport ships. Ultimately, according to U.S Marine Corps historian John Rentz, as a result of the heavy antiaircraft fire, the Japanese abandoned large scale air attacks on Rendova,Rentz pp. 65–67 although minor air raids on Rendova continued into August.Melson p. 28 Aftermath The Allied forces fought off continuous Japanese air-raids in the months following the landings. These raids caused human and material losses but never seriously threatened the American foothold and bases on the island. As a result, Rendova was successfully used as an artillery base during the subsequent stages of the New Georgia campaign, covering a crossing of the channel to the mainland on 2 July, as US troops from the 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments landed around Zanana. This landing was then followed by a westward drive on Munda Point and the eventual capture of the airfield during the Battle of Munda Point in early August.Miller pp. 90–94 Base development work around Rendova began shortly after the landings, with the 24th Naval Construction Battalion undertaking road construction work, including the creation of corduroy roads to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles and artillery in the muddy conditions. Under the threat of air attack, three bulldozers were destroyed in this effort, and 20 men were killed.Bureau of Yards and Docks, p. 264 The beach was extended using coral fill, while Marston Matting was also laid in an effort to combat the mud, but their weight, coupled with that of the heavy vehicles employed to move the 155 mm artillery pieces resulted in the roads sinking into the mud.Hammel, pp. 53 & 71 The 118th Engineer Regiment attempted to drain the area around the eastern landing beach, but this proved fruitless and the area was ultimately abandoned in favor of some of the barrier islands, which were used as staging areas.Miller, p. 93 The Seabees were also employed in stevedore work, unloading stores and equipment from the transport ships. The movement of the entire 24th NCB to Rendova was not completed until 1 August, but in the middle of the month it was moved to Munda. After the recapture of Munda Point the artillery was redeployed to Munda and during October 1943, the U. S. Navy's 20th Naval Construction Battalion \\"Seabees\\" built a PT boat base, camp area and warehouses on Bau Island. During March 1944, the 73rd Battalion Seabees added an engine warehouse, additional roads and fuel lines to the facility.Bureau of Yards and Docks, pp. 264–266 Gallery File:9th Defense Battalion landing on Rendova Island.pngThe 9th Defense Battalion landing on Rendova Island File:Lot 8754-8 (USMC 57835) (22051118426).jpgThe landing area crowded with supplies immediately following the invasion File:MarineRendova155mmCrew.jpgThe US Marine crew of the 9th Defense Battalion's 155 mm \\"Long Tom\\" artillery fires from Rendova or a nearby island in support of the US Army's offensive on New Georgia, July 1943 File:90-mm- gun-rendova.jpg90 mm antiaircraft guns on Rendova File:RendovaTowed155mm.jpg155 mm \\"Long Tom\\" artillery being towed on Rendova File:Rendova July 4 1943.jpgMarine AAA and \\"Long Tom\\" artillery positions on Northern Rendova, July 4, 1943 NotesReferences     Further reading     - Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

It is an adventure novel by Sophie Kinsella, a pseudonym of Madeleine Wickham. It follows the story of Becky Bloomwood and her adventures when she's offered the chance to work in New York City. Along with the first novel in the series, it provided the basis for the film Confessions of a Shopaholic. Plot synopsis Life looks good for Becky Bloomwood. She has a great relationship with boyfriend Luke as well as a steady job giving financial advice on television. Furthermore, she is on good terms with her bank manager, Derek Smeath. Life becomes problematic for Becky when Mr. Smeath retires from Endwich Bank and Luke announces he wants to make it big in New York, big changes are in store for Becky. She takes to New York like an angel to heaven. Becky has never been happier and the reader is treated to Becky seeing the Guggenheim in a unique way, winning the attention of employees at Barney's and discovering sample sales. Becky spends a substantial amount of money, but is sure she's financially secure, with the job offers on T.V. piling up. She also justifies her expenses by convincing herself that the items are an investment in the future. An article in the Daily World reveals her high debts, calls her a fraud for telling people how to manage their money when she is herself feckless. This causes a fight between her and Luke, as there are current rumours about that his PR company, Brandon Communications, will lose Bank of London as their client, and her being revealed as in debt (and Luke not even knowing about it) doesn't help situations. More and more opportunities are ruled out, when more and more people read the article. She even loses her current job on Morning Coffee, and is replaced by her former co-worker Clare Edwards, who Becky never liked, being boring and smug. She returns home to her roommate and best friend Suze, while Luke remains in New York, and their relationship comes to an apparent end. Becky and Suze go to Becky's new bank manager to ask for a bigger overdraft, but are met with nothing but hostility and disgust. A woman who worked for her former employers Morning Coffee contacts her and asks her to lunch, Becky becomes hopeful, but it turns out she only wants her to come on and be told off by Clare for TV. She becomes depressed and Suze tries to comfort her. On a trip to Luke's office to collect a package for her delivered there, Becky decides that she will see Mel, Luke's secretary, for a bit because she missed her. She collects her package, but also notices how quiet it is with no moral. She hides in Mel's desk just in time so no one catches her in the office. During that time, she overhears Alicia's conversation with her fiancé, Ben Bridges, and another Brandon C. worker, which confuses her. Becky discovers she, along with her colleagues and Bridges, are planning to steal Luke's clients, along with Bank of London, and run the company out of business to embarrass Luke. She waits for them to leave, which they do after a few tense minutes and she safely leaves Brandon C. Instead of going home to Suze and tell her about what she had witnessed, Becky decides to do a little detective work and find out more about Alicia's plans. She heads down to King Street and ask a tenant about any new businesses coming into the street. He tells Becky the empty 2nd floor of the building he owns, will be the future home of a financial public relations business called \\"Bridges and Billington\\" and the Bank of London will be one of their future clients. Furious at Alicia's actions for what she did to Luke as well as herself, Becky thanks the tenant for his help and leave for home. After returning home, she immediately contacts Luke's colleague in America, Michael Ellis, and tells him the truth about what she had seen. He thanks her for informing him, but Becky requests that Michael does not tell him that it was her. When asked about her reasons against it, Becky admits that she's concerned that Luke will think she's spreading rumors by gossiping behind his back to prove a point after a remark she made about Elinor. Michael agrees to cover for her by telling Luke that he found out from an anonymous tip and will look into it. The next day, Suze suggests for a healing and empowering exercise that Becky throw out all her unnecessary possessions. She was against it at first, but later agrees when she saw how cluttered her room is and needed something to take her mind off of losing her job and Alicia's plans. While trying to tidy up, Becky comes up with a better idea after watching an art sale auction on TV. When Suze and Tarquin comes in to her room, Becky tells them the great idea that she had in mind. She has decided to sell off all her unnecessary possessions in a sales auction to make a lot of money. To her surprise and relief, Suze and Tarquin are on board to helping her advertise the sale. During that time, Becky gets a call from Michael, who invites her to lunch at the Savoy Hotel. At the Savoy Hotel, he congratulates her for helping them out because her information saved Brandon C. from being run out of business by exposing Alicia and her colleagues for trying to ruin the company's reputation with their clients. Michael reveals that Luke has returned to London to try and salvage his company's reputation with his clients while trying to keep interest open in America. He also mentions that because of Alicia's fiancé's wealth, Ben was a key player in her plans and he was able to finance the project that they've been working on for some time. They were planning to steal all of Brandon C.'s clients and set up business elsewhere in King Street. As soon as Luke left with Becky for New York, she and her colleagues got to work immediately by telling their co-workers and clients a bunch of rumours that he will close the UK branch. As a result, clients are threatening to sue him and workers were leaving earlier, all the while she was telling him a different story. Once Michael told Luke the truth, he immediately returned to the UK branch of Brandon C. to search their desks and found plenty of evidence. Furious, he took Alicia and her colleagues by surprise in the meeting room and he fired them for it. Michael mentions that Luke plans to press charges of embezzlement against Alicia, Ben and four others involved in their scheme. Noticing that Becky has no job and is in debt, he offers her a job in Washington D.C. and can help her with immigration as he's got a good lawyer and friends in immigration to convince them. Michael also offers her good advice in finding work that she's real passionate about and not fall into a job she doesn't like. That night, Becky holds an auction for her clothes and items. She sells all of it, even her Denny and George scarf, a big symbol for her and Luke's relationship, which makes more than three times her money back to pay off her debts. Becky accepts the slot on Morning Coffee, but shocks them all by telling them she has no more financial problems, has paid of all her debt, and is heading off to New York now to work at Barneys as a personal shopper (all of which is now true). Her former co-workers beg her to stay and answer questions from people on the phone wanting to know how she got out of debt. Becky refuses and heads to the airport with her travelling luggage ready to head to New York. Though unable to get an upgrade, the clerk was able to get her a window seat near the emergency exit with plenty of leg room. Becky comes across an article from the Financial Times, detailing Luke's risky business plans to save his company. Though feeling bad for him, she also accepts the fact it's over between them and she must move on with her own life. Luke turns up at the airport and tells Becky that Michael told him all about what she did for his company. He thanks her, although Luke admits he was angry about it because she should have told him. Becky defends herself by stating she was worried that Luke wouldn't believe her if she came to him about Alicia and would think she was gossiping behind his back. Thus, she thought telling Michael about Alicia's plans was a safer bet since he would not betray her. While having a drink at the airport bar, Luke revealed that he confronted the reporter from Daily World that wrote the bad article about Becky to reveal her source and was enraged when he found out Alicia was involved. After returning to London, Luke did extensive search in her desk and had found bank statements that belonged to Becky. This revelation makes her feel bad for leaving her bank statements behind, unaware of the trouble it and the excessive shopping caused her. However, Luke reveals that he was Alicia's real target and she was a mere stepping stone. He admits he realized his mistake in accusing Becky for ruining his deal and apologizes after learning Alicia ruined her T.V. career intentionally so she had an easier shot at embarrassing him by ruining Brandon C's reputation with their clients and running it out of business. She tells Luke that it was also her own fault, because if she had been keeping tabs on her money and not gone shopping excessively in New York, she wouldn't have put herself in the mess she was in. In a lot of ways, Becky was glad she read the article because she realized she had to grow up and start paying back her debts. Luke begs her to stay, to come and work at Brandon Communications. He also reveals how much Alicia decimated his staff, including firing his trustworthy secretary, Mel, when she suspected Alicia and a few others for lying to him. Becky refuses and tells Luke that she doesn't want to settle down at a job she doesn't want, as she's too young for that. When he asks her reasons against it and starts to believe she has taken up Michael's offer to live in Washington DC, Becky reveals her intent to return to New York to work at Barneys as a personal shopper. She also admits that she didn't take Michael's offer and that he was being a good friend in giving her good advice in finding a job she is passionate in working at. Realizing this, Luke apologizes to Becky again for his assumption. Before she leaves, Luke gives Becky back her Denny and George scarf, revealing that the two bidders pitting against each other were him. Becky leaves for New York to accept a job at Barneys. Some time later, Becky is working as a personal shopper at Barneys in New York. She has regular TV appearances representing fashion styles, which gains her more than three times her viewers back. Becky is helping out a female customer to accessorise an outfit, when Luke shows up as a customer. Becky soon realizes she really missed him and they get back together.  Characters  *Becky Bloomwood *Suze Cleath-Stuart *Luke Brandon *Tarquin Cleath-Stuart *Tom Webster *Graham and Jane Bloomwood *Martin and Janice Webster *Lucy *Derek Smeath *Clare Edwards *Alicia Billington Characters introduced in the novel Ben Bridges: Alicia's fiancé and key player in her plans. He was the one who funded the project because of his wealth and it was carefully well thought of. He and Alicia had gotten a new business in King Street which got derailed when Luke found out the truth and returned to England. Michael Ellis: Luke's colleague in America. He and Becky becomes good friends. It was she who told him about what Alicia had done that lead him to telling Luke the truth, but keeping Becky a secret to himself. Michael offers her a job in Washington D.C. when he learns that she is in debt and has no job. He also encourages her to find work she's passionate about and not fall into anything she's doesn't like. Christina Rowan: The head of the personal shoppers at Barney's in New York. Becky comes as a customer there, but ends up working for her after losing her job on the Morning Coffee. Elinor Sherman: Luke's biological mother, whom Becky immediately dislikes as she's cold, disinterested and uncaring of her son's attempt to try and reach out to her. This plays a crucial role in Shopaholic Ties The Knot when she calls out Elinor for being cold and selfish towards her son. In turn, she greatly despises Becky as she's immature and a flake for Luke's taste. She and Elinor would eventually reconcile in Mini Shopaholic, when she accepts responsibility for her actions and helps plan for Luke's surprise birthday party. John Gavin: The new manager of Endwich Bank which Derek Smeath used to work. After reading the article from the Daily World, he greatly shows hostility towards Becky when she and Suze arrive and ask for a bigger overdraft. He sneeringly tells Becky that she needs to stop living in a fantasy world and grow up. Mel: Luke's secretary introduced in the first novel. She and Becky presumably became friends in the 2nd novel. It's unknown what happened to Mel, but it's presumed Alicia had her fired when she found out that Mel suspected her of lying with intent to tell Luke the truth. Reception Critical reception for Shopaholic Abroad has been mixed. Kirkus Reviews criticised the work as \\"lackluster\\", as they felt that it just a rehash of the much funnier Confessions of a Shopaholic. The Akron Beacon Journal was more positive in their review and called it \\"bathtub reading at its best\\", but stated that \\"although Kinsella wants to avoid anything really dark in the book, you have to wonder why the question of professional help for Becky is never raised.\\"  Film adaptation  A film adaptation of the novels starring Isla Fisher as Becky Bloomwood, Hugh Dancy as Luke Brandon, and Krysten Ritter as Suze was released on 13 February 2009.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093908/releaseinfo The film focused on some plots, while eliminating others to make room for the 2nd novel's plot Shopaholic Abroad. Differences between Film and Novel * In the novel, Luke and Becky travel to New York, while in the film they go to Miami. * In the novel, Alicia exposes Becky via the British Tabloid magazine \\"The Daily World\\" for her credit card debts and as a result she loses her job at The Morning Coffee, along with prospects in America. In the film, Alicia helps Derek expose Becky and publicly humiliate her. She did it out of fear that her boss, Alette Naylor, will fire Alicia and replace her with Becky. * In the novel, Becky returns to England in shame after a fight with Luke concerning his mother, Elinor. In the film, Becky returns to her family home in an unknown small town in the Midwest in shame. * In the film, Luke immediately suspected Alicia's involvement thanks to his private investigator keeping tabs on the latter and informs Alette right away. Whereas in the novel, he had to find out the truth from Michael about Becky's suspicion on Alicia ruining Brandon Communications in London. * In the novel, Becky is told by Suze to clean up her room and get rid of her unnecessary items. Becky soon comes up with a better idea after watching a show on TV involving an art sale, sell off her possessions instead. In the film, Clare and the others in the Shopaholics support group, suggest Becky sell off her possessions in a sale auction. * In the novel, Alicia and four others are secretly caught by Becky for their plans to ruin Brandon Communications and she informs Michael(Luke's Colleague in America) about it, who then informs Luke about it. They are fired by Luke with impending embezzlement charges. In the film, she is caught by Alette who demanded an explanation for her public humiliation of Becky. Furious for her behavior and the embarrassment of the \\"Alette\\" fashion magazine, Naylor fires Alicia and replaces her with Becky(who later turns down the offer). * Unlike the film, Luke meets Becky at the airport and confronts her for not having told him Alicia's plans to ruin him. * In the novel, Derek Smeath is replaced by John Gavin who is much stricter. In the film, while omitted, Gavin's personality merges in Smeath. * Unlike in the novel which Becky shows class in giving Gavin a check, she pays Smeath back by giving him the money in coins and forcing him to count them much to his co-workers' pleasure (as they hated Smeath). * In the film, Suze is upset with Becky for losing an expensive bridesmaid dress, while in the 3rd novel, Becky's bridesmaid's dress is made by her friend, Danny Kovich. * In the novel, the \\"Financial Times\\" details Luke's risky business to save Brandon Communications. In the film, Luke quits Successful Savings to start his own PR firm. * In the novel, Suze begs Becky to keep her Denny and George blue-gray scarf. In the film, it's Jane who does this. In both versions, Becky refuses. * In the novel, Luke gives back Becky's scarf and informing her the two bidders were him, while in the film, Luke revealed the woman was his sister, Zoe, and paid by his agent to outbid him. * Unlike in the 2nd novel, Becky reveals in a narration epilogue that she is a reformed shopaholic. * In the novel's end, Becky works at Barneys New York as a personal shopper and had made more than three times her viewers back with her regular television appearance on tips about the fashion trends and how to accessorize them. In the film's end, Becky works as a fashion reporter for Brandon Report and of which makes her more successful. * In the film's end, it's revealed Alicia had found another job, but because of her public humiliation of Becky and Alette, she was disgraced from the magazine world in general.

Life Hazart was born at Oudenaarde in the County of Flanders. He entered the Society of Jesus on 24 September 1634 and was ordained priest, 6 April 1647, at Louvain, where he had already the reputation of perfectus orator. He made his religious profession on 1 November 1651; and preached during a period of thirty-six years, for a time at Dunkirk and Brussels, then permanently at Antwerp, where he died. Hazart's life, apart from the duties of his pastoral office, was almost exclusively taken up with his struggle against the Calvinists of the Low Countries. His \\"Epistola ad Langravium Hassiæ- Rheinfeldtium\\" suggests some activity in Germany too. He delivered, at the church of the professed house at Antwerp, a series of sermons on controversial questions. Some of these he preached in the 'Grote markt' (main market-place) of Antwerp, there for the festivities held in connection with church dedication services. His sacred eloquence attracted Calvinists too. Works Sommervogel enumerates about ninety writings of his, chiefly in Flemish. The \\"Kerckelycke Historie van de gheheele werelt\\" (Ecclesiastical history of the whole world), 4 vols. (Antwerp, 1667–71) was translated into High German and enlarged by other Jesuits, under the title \\"Kirchengeschichte, das ist katholiches Christendum, durch die ganze Welt verbreitet\\". All of Hazart's writings are apologetic and polemical in character. They treat of controversial questions: Holy Mass, the Real Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, the invocation and veneration of the saints, the force of good works, auricular confession, extreme unction, purgatory, idolatry, the primacy and authority of the pope, the Roman catechism. Hazart relied on Scripture and the early Church Fathers: he was quick to refute, but himself was flawed. In the case of Schuler, he contented himself with a \\"Vriendelyke t'saemen-spraek tuschen D. Joannes Schulen Predicant tot Breda ende P. C. Hazart\\" (A friendly colloquy between John Schuler, preacher of Breda, and P. C. Hazart). Many of his writings, such as \\"Triomph de pausen van Roomen\\" (Triumph of the pope of Rome), gave rise to voluminous literature.

Modern vehicle tracking systems commonly use GPS technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology can also be used. Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the Internet or specialized software. Urban public transit authorities, Mining companies and Transport/Freight companies are an increasingly common user of vehicle tracking systems. Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as \\"passive\\" and \\"active\\". \\"Passive\\" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a computer for evaluation. One such example of a passive device would be a GPS Log Book that gathers the data and stores it for later upload \\"Active\\" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in real-time via cellular or satellite networks to a computer or data center for evaluation. The information is typically analysed and presented using web based technologies. Many modern IVMS devices combine both active and semi-passive tracking abilities: when a cellular network is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in internal memory and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again. So, although the actual upload is Active, there is a time delay between the time the position is recorded and the time it is sent back-to-base, making the units semi-passive. Where IVMS is used to drive driver safety and improve on general driver behaviour, this makes no difference in reality: data gets uploaded (delayed) but is still available for post-processing purposes, so overnight safety reports are not affected by this provided the vehicle comes back into coverage later during that day. New advanced active vehicle monitoring functions are being developed like the one used by Mobileye, a specialist in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). It not only tracks incidents recorded by its G-sensor (that measures acceleration) but also those recorded by the four safety alerts it installs in the vehicle such as headway monitoring & warning (which may indicate tailgating), forward collision warning, pedestrian and cyclist collision warning, and lane departure warning. Recording these alerts (along with when and where they occurred) provides data for detailed, comprehensive reports on driving behavior. Historically IVMS has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system. For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging cell phone technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle. These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, Web use and generally provide a wider safety net for the staff member and the vehicle. IVMS Units track many different types of activity within a vehicle such as GPS Position, Various inputs such as seatbelt and 4x4 engagement, Speed, Impact/Rollover, Harsh events (acceleration and deceleration, usually performed by a Triaxial Accelerometer) over revving, excess idle time just to mention a few. The implementation of IVMS often has significant cost savings: by getting drivers to slow down and drive more carefully, stress is also taken off vehicles. This in the end has savings not only in terms of fuel, but also in terms of general vehicle wear-and-tear like brake pads and disks and engine wear.

Approval by the Government of Western Australia for the construction and operation of the port and rail facility was announced on 29 July 2008; Oakajee Port & Rail Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Murchison Metals Ltd and Mitsubishi Corporation, were to be the developers. Delays Including an associated rail project, the project was estimated to cost about A$4 billion. The port was to have an initial capacity of 45 million tonnes of iron ore annually. Construction was expected to start in 2011, with completion possible by 2014. In 2012, media speculation about cancellation of the project increased with announcements of delays and cutbacks.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-08/opr-more-difficult-to-get- up/4301946http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-08/oakajee-port-and-rail-project- on-hold/4361300 However, the premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, stated his desire to facilitate conciliation between the parties.http://www.skynews.com.au/businessnews/article.aspx?id=814425 In June 2013, Mitsubishi announced that work was to be suspended work until an investment partner could be found.http://www.dsd.wa.gov.au/8080.aspx the project was mothballed.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-27/tradional-owners- reach-agreement-on-mid-west-mine/5919636  Location  The port and facilities were to be constructed within approximately of land owned by the state government. The property had been used as farmland but was zoned for heavy industrial and zoned for support industries. It is bordered approximately by the Buller River to the south, Coronation Beach Road to the north, and the Moresby Ranges to the east.  History  Between 1879 and 1957, Oakagee was a siding and locality on the Northampton railway line. The site was first considered as a port and railway terminus in the 1980s. Opposition to the project from local residents centred on environmental concerns, especially in relation to nearby Coronation Beach. Advocacy for the project was from a partnership known as Geraldton Iron Ore Alliance, which included miners Mount Gibson Iron, Midwest Corporation (ASX:MIS), Murchison Metals Ltd (ASX:MMX), Gindalbie Metals (ASX:GBG), Golden West Resources, Royal Resources Ltd, Asia Iron Holdings Ltd, and Atlas Iron Ltd. An alternative project considered by the government was to deepen and enlarge the existing Geraldton Port. However, environmental factors associated with the proposal being relatively close to Geraldton militated against it.  Railway  The port was intended to be served by a dual gauge railway line providing for both narrow gauge and standard gauge .

Biography=Education Serra received a scientific baccalauréat in 1957, and an engineering degree from the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy in 1962. He also obtained a Bachelor's degree in philosophy/psychology, from the University of Nancy, in 1965. He obtained a PhD in Mathematical Geology from the University of Nancy in 1967, and a doctorat d'etat in Mathematics, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, in 1986. He speaks French, Russian, English, and Spanish. Mathematical morphology From 1962 to 1966, while a research engineer at the Institut de recherche de la sidérurgie, France, Serra was a PhD student under the supervision of Georges Matheron. The subject of his thesis was \\"stochastic modeling of the iron deposit of Lorraine, at various scales,\\" one of the goals of which was to quantify petrographic characteristics of its iron orebody. During that period, Serra came up with the idea of using structuring elements for transforming images of cross sections of the ore, in order to gain information about it. The result was a device called \\"Texture Analyser\\", which was patented in 1965. This work also lead to the concept of hit-or-miss transform, which evolved into the concepts of erosion, dilation, opening and closing due to Matheron. Granulometry and other concepts followed. In the Winter of 1966, in a pub of Nancy,\\"Appendix A: The 'centre de morphologie mathematique': An overview\\" by Jean Serra, in (Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994). Matheron, Philippe Formery, and Serra decided to give a name to this body of works: \\"Mathematical morphology\\". The new theory and method has since evolved to be applied in a variety of image processing problems and tasks, and is researched worldwideSee, e.g., (Banon, Barrera, and Braga-Neto (Eds.) 2007) (main article: Mathematical morphology). In 1968, the Centre of Mathematical Morphology (CMM) of the École des Mines de Paris was created (after 1979, it was called Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology). Matheron was named director, and Serra was hired as master of research (\\"Maître de Recherches\\") and assistant director. In 1986, upon the split of the Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology into two separate centers, Serra became director of research (\\"Directeur de Recherches\\") and the director of the new CMM. Serra has continued to contribute to mathematical morphology over the years; In fact, some of the most important theoretical developments are due to him: * Generalization of mathematical morphology to complete lattices * Theory for morphological filtering, with Matheron * Connections Additional highlights * 1979-1983: Vice-president of the International Society for Stereology. * 1983-: Member of the editorial board of Acta Stereologica. * 1988-1991: Member of the scientific board of the French T.V. cultural program. * 1989-: Member of the editorial board of the Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation. * 1990-: Member of the editorial board of the Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision. * 1991-1993 : Chairman of the \\"Image Algebra and Morphological Processing Conference\\" in SPIE annual meeting, San Diego, California, USA. * 1993: Chairman of the first Int.

From its headwaters in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation near Abbot Pass in the Cascade Range, the river flows generally west through Mount Hood National Forest in Clackamas County to the unincorporated community of Ripplebrook. Here it enters the main stem of the Clackamas River. Oak Grove Fork feeds Timothy Lake and Lake Harriet, two artificial impoundments built along its course to control water flows to hydroelectric plants. Course The Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River arises at an elevation of above sea level and falls between source and mouth to an elevation of . The main stem begins in the Cascade Range near Abbot Pass, a mountain gap at , on the border between Clackamas County and Wasco County. Originating on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, the river flows generally west about through the Mount Hood National Forest to the unincorporated community of Ripplebrook, where it joins the main stem of the Clackamas River. From its source, the river flows about through a landform known as Big Meadows before leaving the reservation. Shortly thereafter, it crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, which follows the river from there to Timothy Lake. Oak Grove Fork then flows between the Clackamas Lake Campground and Clackamas Lake, which lies to the left of the river, before entering Timothy Lake about from the mouth. From here to Ripplebrook, Forest Road 57 follows the river. Campgrounds on the lake shore to the left include Oak Fork, Gone Creek, Hood View, and Pine Point. Meditation Point Campground lies on the opposite shore. While flowing through Timothy Lake, the elevation of which is above sea level, Oak Grove Fork receives Crater Creek, Cooper Creek, and Dinger Creek, all from the right. The river exits the lake via a spillway from the mouth. Just below the spillway, the river passes the USGS gauge station at Timothy Lake, then receives Anvil Creek from the right, Stone Creek from the left, Buck Creek from the right, Peavine Creek from the left, and Shellrock Creek and Cat Creek, both from the right, before reaching the USGS gauge above Lake Harriet. Lake Harriet Campground lies along the shore to the right. Flowing through the lake, the river receives Kelley Creek from the left, then exits the lake and receives Sam Creek from the left about from the mouth. Then the river receives Skunk Creek and Canyon Creek from the right, Butte Creek from the left, and Station Creek and Pint Creek, both from the right, before passing Ripplebrook, Ripplebrook Campground, the Ripplebrook Ranger Station and Heliport, and the southeastern terminus of Oregon Route 224, which all lie to the right. Shortly thereafter, the river flows by Rainbow Campground, which lies to the left, and enters the Clackamas River about above its confluence with the Willamette River at Gladstone. Discharge The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of Oak Grove Fork at two stations, one below Timothy Lake, from the mouth, and the other above a Portland General Electric (PGE) power plant intake, from the mouth. The average flow of the river at the Timothy Lake gauge is . This is from a drainage basin of . The maximum flow recorded there was on December 24, 1964, and the minimum flow was on September 23, 1968. At the power plant gauge, the average flow is from a drainage basin of . The maximum flow recorded there was on January 7, 1923, and the minimum flow was on August 16, 2004. Fishing The Oak Grove Fork has fishing for Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) close to the Timothy Lake dam, wild coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarkii), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) further down, and Brown trout (Salmo trutta) close to Harriet Lake. All species respond well to flies or artificial baits. Only artificial lures and flies allowed on the Oak Grove Fork, with barbless hooks. Hydroelectric dams As part of its efforts to generate electricity from water power in the Clackamas River basin, PGE built a dam on the Oak Grove Fork in 1923. The company's power plant at Lake Harriet, created by the dam, began making electricity in 1924. To regulate flows on the Oak Grove Fork and on the mainstem Clackamas River, the company built a dam at Timothy Meadows, upstream of Harriet Lake, in 1956. The new dam formed Timothy Lake, a impoundment that doubles as a recreation site.

Life O'Leary was born at Fanlobbus, County Cork, Ireland. He was educated with the Capuchins of Saint Malo, where he was ordained and spent twenty-four years as a prison chaplain.Webb, Alfred. \\"Arthur O'Leary\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878 In 1777 he returned to Cork to engage in missionary work. His preaching soon attracted large audiences. He is charged by James Froude with having received secret-service money from the Government, but other historians consider this unproven. In 1786-88 he argued the Catholic case in the so- called \\"Paper War\\" between conservative Protestants and moderates that sought further legal reform of the Penal Laws, leading towards Catholic Emancipation.See:The Dublin Paper War of 1786-1788: A Bibliographical and Critical Inquiry, including an Account of the Origins of Protestant Ascendancy and Its 'Baptism' in 1792 by W. J. McCormack; reviewed in Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an dá chultúr, Vol. 10, (1995), pp. 165-167. O'Leary's arguments helped Henry Grattan with his proposal in 1788 to remove the tithe paid by Roman Catholics to the Church of Ireland, but this was voted down by the Parliament of Ireland. From 1789 till his death he was chaplain to the Spanish embassy in London. He was a wit, and socially acquainted with the circle of Edmund Burke, Richard Sheridan, and Charles James Fox, and an honorary member of The Monks of the Screw. In the 1790s he built the original St Patrick's Church, Soho Square for the poor London Irish living around St Giles.Obituary in the Annual Register, 1802 He died in London and was buried in Old St Pancras Churchyard. His name is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to the eminent graves lost from the graveyard. Works Famous as a preacher, writer, and controversialist, he published tracts characterized by learning, religious feeling, toleration, and allegiance to the Crown. His work for reform of the anti-Catholic penal laws was too heterodox for some Catholics. O'Leary, Edward. \\"Arthur O'Leary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 20 March 2020 Formerly, Catholics had been loyal to the Jacobite movement, and some felt that O'Leary was being too friendly to the Hanoverian dynasty. He realised that an engagement with Protestants was necessary to ensure reforms from the British and Irish parliaments, whose members were all Protestant at that time. Reforms had just started with the Papists Act 1778 and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. During the 1790s he was, like many Catholics, horrified at the Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution. At the time when the penal laws were slowly being reformed, his aim was for Catholics in Britain and Ireland to achieve legal equality with Anglicans, and he was a precursor of those who finally obtained Catholic Emancipation in 1829.

Plot summary In the outer circle of a nested narrative, a woman named Sheila writes to her childhood friend Charlie about her brother, Johnny, a psychiatrist who recently committed suicide. Sheila suspects it was due to a patient Johnny referred to in his notes anonymously as the eponymous \\"N\\". In the inner circle of the narrative, N. is diagnosed by Dr. John Bonsaint as suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoid delusions related to \\"keeping balance\\". N. has become convinced that a circle of stones in a field on the outskirts of a nearby town, Ackerman's Field, contains a potential doorway (best described as a place where the walls between realities are thin, or perhaps breaking down) to another reality, where a terrifying monster, repeatedly said to be a \\"helmet-headed\\" being named Cthun, is trying to break through. A warning sign of the monster's imminent penetration is when a person viewing the field sees seven stones, when there are in fact eight. N's belief, shared by those who came before him, is that verifying the presence of eight stones when he is in the field, and his obsession with order when he is absent, somehow strengthens the barrier between our world and the one Cthun dwells in. However, the process is a perpetual and exhausting struggle. N.'s obsession eventually leads to his death by suicide, despite Johnny's best efforts. Following a mysterious compulsion, John goes out to the field to see the stones for himself. He begins to suspect that N. might not have been delusional after all when he suffers from the same symptoms as his patient. Most notable are his obsession with numbers: odd numbers are bad, especially prime ones, even ones are safe, especially if they have a lot of factors, and if the sum of their digits is also even. The effect recedes as winter sets in, since the level of danger seems to be synchronized with the solstices (winter is safest, summer is most dangerous). However, as June approaches, John is driven to madness, and finally kills himself. A newspaper clipping reveals Sheila's fate: after she read her brother's manuscript, she jumped from a bridge near Ackerman's Field and killed herself, in a manner identical to her brother. A copy of an e-mail indicates that Charlie intends to visit the field in Maine. Influences King in interviews and in the book itself said the story was inspired by Arthur Machen’s The Great God Pan stating: \\"Not Lovecraft; it’s a riff on Arthur Machen’s 'The Great God Pan,' which is one of the best horror stories ever written. Maybe the best in the English language. Mine isn’t anywhere near that good, but I loved the chance to put neurotic behavior—obsessive/compulsive disorder—together with the idea of a monster- filled macroverse.\\" Adaptations The story, even before its first publication, had been adapted as Stephen King's N., a multi-part graphic video series, as part of the marketing campaign for King's upcoming collection. The series consists of 25 one and a half-minute episodes totaling approximately 30 minutes in length. Featuring sophisticated production values, the episodes were drawn by artist Alex Maleev, whose work has appeared on NBC's Heroes, and colored by comic-book colorist José Villarrubia, best known for his collaborations with Alan Moore, with animation and production by motion graphics studio Motherland, Inc. They were adapted by Marc Guggenheim, co- creator of the ABC TV series Eli Stone with creative oversight from Stephen King. The episodes are presented in a cutout animation format, complete with comic book–style graphics, an original score, sound effects, and a full cast of voiceovers that includes actor Ben Shenkman. The series is available on DVD as part of the special collector's edition of Just After Sunset. The first episode went online on July 28, 2008 (although viewers who signed up for updates online were given a sneak peek at the first episode the day before). Conceived in a partnership with Scribner, Simon and Schuster Digital, Marvel Entertainment, and CBS Mobile, it is a completely new concept for an online comic series as it is available on mobile phone networks in addition to the iTunes Store and the series official website. According to Simon and Schuster, the series has been viewed over 1 million times via mobile phones and on the Internet. In March 2010, Marvel published the first issue of a comic book adaptation of N., a four-issues limited series. While adapted from the novella and using much the same artwork of the graphic video series, the comic also contains additional scenes and information providing a fuller story, such as, the fate of the Ackermans, revealing N.'s full name and who spoke it to him in the field, who was responsible for giving N. the key and further expanding on Charlie's fate.

The album was the second compilation to use the title The Best of Bette, the previous version with different cover art and an entirely different track list having been released on the Atlantic Records label in both the UK, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand in 1978. Background The K-tel compilation is highly notable in Midler's discography for a number of reasons, the first of them being that it was released by the US based K-tel label instead of Midler's original label Atlantic Records (today a subsidiary of Warner Music Group). K-Tel was a budget-price label specialising in releasing as-seen-on-TV compilations including the latest chart hits but at this stage rarely released a whole albums' worth of recordings by the one and same artist. Atlantic Records had exclusive rights to Midler's catalogue worldwide, the sixteen tracks were consequently licensed from Atlantic - but obviously only for release in Australia and New Zealand, not in the US or Europe. The second reason making the album both notable and collectable is the track selection; the album includes songs that by 1981 already had become standards in Midler's repertoire such as her signature tune \\"Friends\\", \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\", \\"Delta Dawn\\" and \\"Do You Want To Dance\\" and combines these with ten tracks taken from her then three most recent albums; a) the disco- flavoured Thighs and Whispers (1979) and the two hit singles \\"Married Men\\" and \\"My Knight In Black Leather\\", b) the soundtrack The Rose (1980) and live recordings like \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\", \\"Midnight In Memphis\\" and \\"Love With A Feeling\\" (the latter two never issued as singles) as well as the studio-recorded title track \\"The Rose\\" (the single version with orchestral overdubs, in effect making its debut on this album) and finally c) the soundtrack to the concert documentary Divine Madness (1980) and the tracks \\"My Mother's Eyes\\" (the only single release from the album) and \\"Fire Down Below\\" (also featured in the movie The Rose, but first released on the Divine Madness album). The K-Tel compilation couples these with a few selections from the albums Broken Blossom and Live at Last such as \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" and \\"You're Moving Out Today\\", the latter, a rare single mix with an additional verse making its second appearance on a compilation album. The pictures used for the cover of the K-Tel version of The Best of Bette show Midler in concert, taken from the movie The Rose. The compilation is sometimes listed as having been released in 1980, other times in 1981. Considering the fact that the Divine Madness album was released worldwide in November 1980 it was more likely issued in 1981. The first Bette Midler greatest hits compilation to be released worldwide, including the US and Canada, was 1993's Experience the Divine.

During the operation US Marines and US Army troops landed by ship around Oleana Bay on Vangunu Island and advanced overland towards the anchorage where they attacked a garrison of Imperial Japanese Navy and Army troops. The purpose of the attack by the U.S. was to secure the lines of communication and supply between Allied forces involved in the New Georgia campaign and Allied bases in the southern Solomons. The U.S. forces were successful in driving the Japanese garrison from the area and securing the anchorage, which would later be used to stage landing craft for subsequent operations. Background The battle was one of the first actions of the New Georgia campaign. Located on the southern tip of Vangunu, Wickham Anchorage lies at the southern end of the New Georgia Islands archipelago between Vangunu and Gatukai. In formulating their plans to secure the New Georgia islands, US planners assessed that several preliminary operations were required. This included the capture of Wickham Anchorage. The anchorage had little value for the Japanese, who secured the area with only a small garrison, but because of its proximity to New Georgia, it offered the Allies an important sheltered harbor that could support lines of supply as they advanced north from the Solomons through New Georgia and towards Bougainville. Consequently, they planned to use the area as a staging base for landing craft proceeding towards Rendova, where the main US force would be built up prior to landing around Munda Point to capture the Japanese airfield there. Other preliminary operations were envisaged to capture Viru Harbor and Segi Point to secure another staging base and a location for an airfield.Miller p. 69 (map) & p. 73Rentz p. 44 Battle At around 18:00 hours on 29 June, a small force of United States Marine Corps Raiders from the 4th Marine Raider Battalion and United States Army soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, 103rd Infantry Regiment embarked from the Russell Islands. A detachment of Colonel Daniel H. Hundley's Eastern Landing Force, these troops formed the Wickham Group, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lester E. Brown.Miller pp. 80–82 The Marine element amounted to two companies (N and Q) who had not been deployed to Segi Point with the rest of their battalion as part of a preliminary operation a few days earlier. These companies were commanded by the battalion's executive officer Major James R. Clark, and were augmented by a demolitions platoon and headquarters element from the 4th Marine Raider Battalion, as well as a battery of 105 mm howitzers from the 152nd Field Artillery Battalion and a battery of 90 mm anti-aircraft guns from the 70th Coastal Artillery Battalion. A detachment of Seabees from the 20th Naval Construction Battalion were also assigned for base development work and engineer support tasks.Shaw & Kane p. 73Rentz p. 26 350px The invading force was carried aboard the destroyer transports and , upon which the Marines embarked, as well as seven Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs) for the US Army soldiers, escorted by a naval covering force under Rear Admiral George H. Fort aboard the destroyer . The force was bound for a landing beach around to the west of the Vura village, around Oleana Bay.Miller p. 82 The area was defended by a platoon of Japanese troops from the 229th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Genjiro Hirata,Stille p. 32 and a company of the Kure 6th Special Naval Landing Force. These forces formed part of Major General Minoru Sasaki's Southeast (Nanto) Detached Force.Rentz p. 21 US intelligence had estimated that the Wickham–Viru area was defended by between 290 and 460 Japanese personnel; in actuality there were a total of 310 troops (260 Army and 50 Navy) in the area.Rentz p. 20 Prior to the operation, the Allies had carried out a reconnaissance of the area and the District Officer Donald Gilbert Kennedy, a New Zealander, had worked to establish a track inland from Oleana Bay along which his scouts operated without the knowledge of the Japanese. In conceiving the landing, US planners had determined that a landing at Oleana Bay, followed by an advance overland via this track, would be the best approach to Wickham Anchorage. They estimated that the march would take about five to six hours.Miller pp. 82–83 Bad weather hindered the voyage to Oleana Bay, but by 03:35 hours on 30 June the convoy reached their destination. Embarkation of the Marines into their LCVPs began shortly afterwards only to be stopped when US naval commanders realized they were too far west than had been planned. As a result, the Marines disembarked and the vessels moved further east. After this was completed, the Marines embarked once again, but found their run to the shore hampered by bad weather; rain and mist obscured the shore and the flares that had been fired by the scouts of the previously-landed reconnaissance party. In the confusion, the LCIs carrying the US Army troops veered off course and broke into the formation of LCVPs causing it to lose its cohesion. Disorganized, each boat made its own way to the shore where several were badly damaged by waves as they crashed against the coral reef; nevertheless, the landing was unopposed and the Marines suffered no casualties. A further wave of Marines landed around 06:30 hours, while the LCIs carrying the 103rd Infantry waited until daylight and landed around 07:20 hours at the intended landing beach.Miller p. 83 As the troops came ashore and the scattered groups rallied around a beachhead, they made contact with the reconnaissance party. Officers from this group had determined that the Japanese were concentrated around Kaeruka, and not at Vura as intelligence had previously assessed. As a result, Brown decided to change his plans: while the main body advanced overland towards Kaeruka via the inland track, another force moved along a coastal track in the direction of Vura. To support their advance, the battery of 105 mm howitzers fired from Oleana Bay. Naval gunfire support was also provided, as was air support from US Navy dive bombers. As the Marines and soldiers advanced, the beachhead was held by the artillery batteries and Seabees.Shaw & Kane p. 76 The first major action between US and Japanese troops took place in the afternoon of 30 June in the Kaeruka area. During this action, Marine casualties amounted to 12 killed and 21 wounded. US Army losses were 10 killed and 22 wounded, while Japanese casualties amounted to around 120.Rentz p. 48 Map of the battle Meanwhile, also on 30 June, another action was fought around Vura by a company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment. As a result of this engagement, a detachment of 16 Japanese was forced to withdraw under heavy fire. After this US troops began consolidating their position around the beachhead for the night amidst heavy rain. Throughout the night, the perimeter came under mortar and machine gun fire from Japanese troops around Cheeke Point. Several Japanese barges attempted to land in the early morning, believing the area to be held by their own troops. Taken under heavy fire, 109 men out of the 120 on board the barges were killed; a further five were eventually killed ashore. The Marines lost two men killed during this fighting, while one US Army soldier was also killed. At daylight, the US commander, Brown, decided to move to Vura village. This was subsequently built up into a stronghold and from there, over the course of the next three days, the US troops harassed the Japanese, undertaking patrols supported by airstrikes and artillery. On 3 July, Brown led a force back to Kaeruka, fighting several minor actions that killed seven Japanese and destroyed several supply dumps.Rentz pp. 48–50 Aftermath After Wickham Anchorage was secured on 3 July; the Marines then moved by landing craft to Oleana Bay for rest before moving to Gatukai Island on 8 July in response to reports of a Japanese force there. The Marines spent two days searching for Japanese there before returning to Oleana Bay and from there to Guadalcanal; meanwhile, a US Army patrol eventually located the Japanese on Gatukai.Rentz p. 51 The area was subsequently used as a staging base for US landing craft taking part in further operations in the New Georgia campaign, supporting the movement of shipping from Guadalcanal or the Russel Islands. Ultimately, though, it was never developed into a major base.Morison p. 153 Rendova was secured by US forces and by 2 July they began crossing from there to the western coast of New Georgia island, landing around Zanana. They began the advance westwards towards Munda Point several days later.Miller pp. 92–94. On 5 July, a force of Marines landed in the Kula Gulf region, on the northern coast of New Georgia island, around Rice Anchorage, to secure the Enogai and Bairoko areas and to block Japanese reinforcements heading south towards Munda.Rentz p. 65Miller pp. 94–96 NotesReferences  Further reading    *- Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

He was Mayor of Fremantle, MLA of South Fremantle, and the first Member for Fremantle in the Australian House of Representatives.  Early life  Solomon was born in London, England to Leah and Moss Solomon and migrated to Australia as a child, living at first in Sydney and then Adelaide. His uncle Emanuel Solomon owned the Queen's Theatre in Adelaide, and Solomon's father Moss was for a short while made manager. The family returned to Sydney until Moss' death in 1849 when Leah again moved to Adelaide and Solomon was educated at Adelaide Educational Institution.  Career  After finishing school, Solomon joined another of his uncle's business concerns and in 1857 was sent to Mauritius to purchase goods. On his return, he worked for the firm of Solomon and Salom in Adelaide, and also Falk and Co. of Melbourne. At the age of 29 Solomon headed west to Fremantle in Western Australia, arriving on 20 January 1868 aboard Eliza Blanche and initially living in Henry Street. Soon the same year he was joined by two of his nephews and together then formed Solomon & Nephews, Auctioneers and Agents of which Solomon was clerk and auctioneer. This venture was part-financed by his half-brother Judah Moss Solomon (of Melbourne) and brother-in-law Isaac Solomon (of Adelaide). The weight of conducting business in a depressed economic environment bore on Solomon, and this was not helped by his nephews being active members of Fremantle's Amateur Dramatics Company, performing at the Oddfellows in William Street. He wrote to them in July 1869: \\"…that you may not be under any misunderstanding with regard to my present dissatisfaction, I will be more explicit. You have taken up time belonging to the firm in Amateur Theatrical matters which, I believe, is acting prejudiciously to the business…\\" In 1881 he was elected to the Fremantle City Council. In 1892, he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for South Fremantle, where he remained until 1901. In that year, he transferred to federal politics, winning the Australian House of Representatives seat of Fremantle for the Free Trade Party. He was defeated by Labor's William Carpenter in 1903. Solomon died in 1909. Solomon was at one time head of the Fremantle Cemetery board, which is where he is buried.  Family  Solomon was married twice, firstly to Agnes Elizabeth Bickley ( – 22 April 1886) and after her death, to Elizabeth Stokes (16 September 1868 – 3 December 1898) on 1 May 1887. They had five children. * Wallace Elias Bickley Solomon (1878–1950) was the first secretary, and honorary solicitor, of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society in 1926. * Maurice Elias Solomon (1888–1977), lawyer and councillor of the City of Fremantle.

Biography The grandson of Finnish immigrant builders, Eldred was raised in Minnesota. Eldred moved to Kansas City in 1959, fresh out of the University of Michigan. Within a year, he was named chairman of the sculpture department of Kansas City Art Institute. Eldred possessed an imposing physical presence and was a college football fullback. He was known to be resilient in the face of challenge, such as the fire in 1991 that destroyed a studio that contained his library and many valuable artworks. Eldred chaired the sculpture department at KCAI for 33 years, exerting a powerful influence on thousands of students, including: James Clover, Gary Freeman, Shawn Brixey, Ming Fay, Michael Rees, John E. Buck, and the collaborative couple, (the late) Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler who met at KCAI. He also was the artistic director of Biosphere II, and was a fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Advanced Visual Studies. Dale Eldred was a victim of the \\"500-year\\" flood in the summer of 1993, when the Missouri River inundated parts of Kansas City. He was killed in a fall trying to rescue equipment in his West Bottoms-neighborhood studio. Sculpture Eldred's early sculptures were large works in clay. Influenced by the monumental steel sculptures of David Smith and Alexander Calder, he began to work in steel, wood and other materials, creating large sculptures and environments. Examples of these include a sculpture composed of a pair of large cantilevered slabs of wood and steel, placed near the entrance of the Kansas City Art Institute; and a park in northern Kansas City, Missouri housing a large stone and lumber environment. His work of this time was reviewed favorably by critic and artist Donald Judd. Eldred was commissioned to redesign downtown Kansas City, Kansas. His challenging modernist design included futuristic fountains, irregular streets, and steel curbs. Received poorly, its unpopularity led the city to modify much of his work, but aspects still exist today. Eldred expressed his desire to reveal natural phenomena. He created a towering sculpture in a Kansas City park that sprayed water in order to create prismatic light refractions. His emphasis increasingly focused on light; he used mirrors, pure pigments, gas flames, fluorescent paint, refraction tape, glass, neon tubes and other materials to create light effects. \\"I want the sculptures to remind us all,\\" he said, \\"that our lives are inextricably linked to light, and that our universe is in constant motion.\\" He created the Light+Time Tower at the city of Raleigh, North Carolina designed to diffract the morning and afternoon sunlight into vibrant colors visible to the commuters who pass by it. His Steeple of Light, originally proposed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Community Christian Church in Kansas City, was completed by his partner and collaborator Roberta Lord after Eldred died in 1993 before the sculpture was finalized in 1994. In collaboration with choreographer Todd Bolender, he created the set and costumes for \\"Voyager,\\" a ballet performed by the State Ballet of Missouri. He collaborated with other highly regarded artists and musicians, including composer Philip Glass.

A LED display is a flat panel display that uses an array of light-emitting diodes as pixels for a video display. Their brightness allows them to be used outdoors where they are visible in the sun for store signs and billboards. In recent years, they have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles, as well as variable-message signs on highways. LED displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to visual display, as when used for stage lighting or other decorative (as opposed to informational) purposes. LED displays can offer higher contrast ratios than a projector and are thus an alternative to traditional projection screens, and they can be used for large, uninterrupted (without a visible grid arising from the bezels of individual displays) video walls. microLED displays are LED displays with smaller LEDs, which poses significant development challenges. History Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) came into existence in 1962 and were primarily red in color for the first decade. The first practical LED was invented by Nick Holonyak in 1962 while he was at General Electric. The first practical LED display was developed at Hewlett-Packard (HP) and introduced in 1968. Its development was led by Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, at HP Associates and HP Labs, who had engaged in research and development (R&D;) on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968. In February 1969, they introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator. It was the first LED device to use integrated circuit (integrated LED circuit) technology, and the first intelligent LED display, making it a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the Nixie tube and becoming the basis for later LED displays. Early models were monochromatic by design. The efficient Blue LED completing the color triad did not commercially arrive until the late 1980s. In the late 1980s, Aluminium Indium Gallium Phosphide LEDs arrived. They provided an efficient source of red and amber and were used in information displays. However, it was still impossible to achieve full colour. The available \\"green\\" was hardly green at all – mostly yellow, and an early blue had excessively high power consumption. It was only when Shuji Nakumura, then at Nichia Chemical, announced the development of the blue (and later green) LED based on Indium Gallium Nitride, that possibilities opened for big LED video displays. The entire idea of what could be done with LED was given an early shake up by Mark Fisher's design for U2's “Popmart” tour of 1997. He realized that with long viewing distances, wide pixel spacing could be used to achieve very large images, especially if viewed at night. The system had to be suitable for touring so an open mesh arrangement that could be rolled up for transport was used. The whole display was 52m (170ft) wide and 17m (56ft) high. It had a total of 150,000 pixels. The company that supplied the LED pixels and their driving system, SACO Technologies of Montreal, had never engineered a video system before, previously building mimic panels for power station control rooms. Today, large displays use high-brightness diodes to generate a wide spectrum of colors. It took three decades and organic light- emitting diodes for Sony to introduce an OLED TV, the Sony XEL-1 OLED screen which was marketed in 2009. Later, at CES 2012, Sony presented Crystal LED, a TV with a true LED-display, in which LEDs are used to produce actual images rather than acting as backlighting for other types of display, as in LED- backlit LCDs which are commonly marketed as LED TVs. Large video-capable screens The 2011 UEFA Champions League Final match between Manchester United and Barcelona was broadcast live in 3D format in Gothenburg (Sweden), on an EKTA screen. It had a refresh rate of 100 Hz, a diagonal of 7.11 m (23 ft 3.92 in) and a display area of 6.192×3.483 m, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest LED 3D TV.EKTA’s Ukrainian produced 3D Led TV makes The Guinness Book of World Records , www.ekta-led.comLargest LED 3D TV. guinnessworldrecords.com Development= Early prototypes  A claim for the 'first all-LED flat panel television screen‘ is presented in this section.

Additional recognition included letters from Iowa senators John Culver and Dick Clark, the Air Force, the Army, college and university letters acknowledging the Westinghouse STS paper entry. This project marked some of the earliest progresses towards the replacement of the 70+-year-old high-voltage analog CRT system (cathode-ray tube technology) with a digital x-y scanned LED matrix driven with a NTSC television RF video format. Mitchell's paper and operational prototype projected the future replacement of CRTs and included foreseen applications to battery operated devices due to the advantages of low power consumption. Displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection, electron beam and color convergence circuits and has been a significant achievement. The unique properties of the light emitting diode as an emissive device simplifies matrix scanning complexity and has helped the modern television adapt to digital communications and shrink into its current thin form factor. The 1977 model was monochromatic by design.  Recent developments  MicroLED displays are currently under development by numerous major corporations such as Apple, Samsung, and LG.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for the seat of Fremantle from 1913 to 1922, initially for the Australian Labor Party and after the 1916 Labor split for the Nationalist Party. Burchell was born in North Adelaide and educated in South Australia, but moved to Western Australia in 1897. He worked in the clerical division of the Western Australian Government Railways as a transport officer and became a railway trade unionist, serving as president of the West Australian Railway Officers' Association, during which time he attempted to affiliate the various railway unions. He was elected to the Cottesloe Roads Board in 1911 and served as its chairman. Burchell was narrowly defeated for the colonial seat of Claremont at the 1911 state election, during which he developed a reputation as a strong campaigner. In 1913, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Fremantle, defeating the sitting Liberal member, William Hedges. He publicly campaigned for a \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1916 Australian conscription referendum, and that year joined Prime Minister Billy Hughes in leaving the Labor Party over the issue of conscription, joining Hughes' new National Labor Party. In 1917, the National Labor Party merged with the Liberal Party to form the Nationalist Party. In January 1917, Burchell enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force to serve in World War I and was appointed to the rank of lieutenant. He was re-elected at the 1917 election with a very large 25.2% swing, and embarked for Europe the following week. He served with the 4th Company, Australian Railway Corps, attached to the Royal Engineers, on the Western Front at Ypres, the Somme and Dunkirk, and was awarded the Military Cross for controlling railway operations during a successful evacuation at the Somme. He returned to Western Australia in April 1919. He retired in 1922 and began working for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, rising to become its South Australian manager in 1927. However, he soon after moved to Sydney, where he worked as advertising manager for The Sunday Times and board director of Beckett's Newspapers Ltd, then as a representative of Australian Radio Technical Services and Patents, a subsidiary of Amalgamated Wireless. He remained occasionally involved in politics, opening the NSW state election campaign of Hughes' splinter Australian Party and serving as its organising secretary in 1930 and campaigning for a \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1933 NSW referendum on Legislative Council reform.

Description Adult feeding from Cotoneaster sp. Adults are purplish blue on the upper wing surface with a black body and black or brown wing margins. These margins are larger on the female than the male. The lower wing surface is brown to pale brownish grey with a pattern of fawn bands and spots, with the body covered in white or grey hairs. The wingspans of females are slightly larger than males, females having a wingspan of 23 mm and males 20 mm. Common grass blues have a weak, fluttering flight and so usually fly near ground level close to a food source. Eggs are white or pale blue and have a mandarin shape with a pitted surface. Caterpillars reach about 7 mm in length, and their appearance is primarily green with a yellow stripe at the sides and a darker green stripe on the back, and brown or black head usually obscured under the thorax. In captivity, fed on an artificial diet, larvae come in highly variable colours, ranging from white through red to dark purple. Pupa are 10 mm long with erect hairs. Colouration varies, ranging from pink, greyish or greenish cream and contains mottled dark spots. Distribution The subspecies Zizina labradus labradus is found over most of continental Australia, as well as on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Christmas Island, while the subspecies Zizina labradus labdalon is restricted mainly to Cape York Peninsula. The common grass blue is often misidentified as the lesser grass blue, Zizina otis. Zizina labradus labradus, as its name suggests, is very common and can be found in suburban gardens, particularly perching in grass; lawns and fields. Growth Single eggs are laid which can hatch in a matter of days. The eggs are laid on leaves, stems, flower buds and young pods of food plants, chiefly legumes of the family Fabaceae such as beans, clover, and various native species. Newly hatched larvae eat small holes from young leaves or flower buds, and later feed mainly inside flowers. The larvae are considered a minor pest and will feed on leguminous plants such as garden beans by eating a small hole into the pods and then devouring the soft seeds within. In captivity when food is scarce the larger larvae will cannibalize smaller ones. The larvae are typically attended by ants of the genera Paratrechina, Rhytidoponera, and Tapinoma. The pupa attaches to the lower leaf surface of the food plants with anal hooks and a central girdle.

He was an independent member of the Australian House of Representatives for the seat of Fremantle as an independent from 1922 to 1928 and 1931 to 1934. Watson was born in Campbells Creek, Victoria and was educated at Guildford State School. He left school at 13 and was variously a manual labourer, miner, navvy, bricklayer, plasterer, axeman, dairyman, farmer and commercial traveller before operating his own grocery shop in Melbourne from 1889 to 1895. In 1895, he moved to Western Australia and settled in Fremantle, where he opened the Watson Supply Stores. Watson's business began with a grocery store and tea room in Fremantle and another store in Perth, but expanded over decades to include a bacon factory and abattoir at Spearwood, butter and dairy factories and a large international export operation in bacon and ham. He also became known as a generous local benefactor, particularly towards returned soldiers after two of his sons were killed in World War I; he made a large donation towards the construction of the Fremantle War Memorial and was made an honorary member of the Fremantle branch of the Returned and Services League. In 1922, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as an independent representing the seat of Fremantle. Watson was an outspoken opponent of the party system throughout his career, believing that it \\"prevented men giving their best service to the country and it made them decidedly dishonest, although they would rather it not be so\\"; however, politically he usually voted with the conservative parties in the House. He held the seat until he retired in 1928, citing his frustration with the political system and his inability to \\"mitigate the sectional division in parliament\\". He was re-elected to the House in 1931 - defeating John Curtin - citing his concern about the governmental response to the Great Depression for his decision to return to politics. However, he retired for a final time in 1934, stating that he had decided not to seek re-election unless it was proved to him that it \\"would be of some definite advantage to the people\\" if he were to be returned and this had not occurred. Watson retired from the business in July 1937 and sold it to his three sons. He died at his home in Peppermint Grove in December 1938 and was buried in the Methodist section of Fremantle Cemetery. Watson married Eliza Annie Showell on 2 April 1888 at Campbells Creek. They had ten children, with two sons dying in World War I and two daughters also predeceasing them. Watson did not live to see Curtin become Prime Minister in 1941. Curtin was a pallbearer at Watson's funeral, describing him as a \\"generous and friendly opponent\\".

The blue flowers appear over the warmer months and are pollinated by bees and flies. Taxonomy Commelina cyanea was one of the many species initially described by the botanist Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen and still bears its original name. The genus name Commelina was chosen based on the Asiatic dayflower. Linnaeus picked the name in honour of the Dutch botanists Jan and Caspar Commelijn, using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them. The specific name is the Latin adjective cyaneus, meaning \\"blue\\". As well as scurvy weed, alternative common names include (native) wandering Jew, forget-me-not, and creeping Christian. People have given several names but basically the leaves looks similar to ivy, and the plant has long branches. Description Commelina cyanea is a trailing herbaceous perennial plant, whose stems grow along the ground. It readily roots at the nodes when they come into contact with the soil. They die off in winter. The leaves are ovate to narrow-ovate, and measure long by wide. The flowers can occur at any time from spring to autumn. They are deep blue and about in diameter, followed by a capsule bearing 2-5 2–3 mm long seeds. Distribution and habitat The species range is across eastern New South Wales, from Narooma northwards, up into Queensland. It also occurs on Lord Howe Island, and Norfolk Island. It grows in wetter shaded areas in forest habitats. Ecology Commelina cyanea is pollinated by a variety of native bees such as Nomia aurantifer, Amegilla pulchra, halictid and colletid bees, and syrphid flies (genus Syritta). Wallabies and rabbits eat the vegetation. Vegetation is also possibly dispersed by water. and along Oxnard California coast and back yards. Uses The leaves are used as an edible vegetable. The leaves were used by early non-indigenous colonists to alleviate scurvy, and hence its common name.Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants (ASGAP), Commelina cyanea. Attractive in flower, Commelina cyanea adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a groundcover or in hanging baskets. It is easily propagated from cuttings. It resembles the introduced weed wandering Jew (Tradescantia fluminensis), but the latter has white flowers and a segmented stem as well as a weak root system. It also lacks the hairy leaf sheathes of C. cyanea. However, C. cyanea can itself be weedy in gardens at times.

It is located at Bayn al-Qasrayn on al-Mu'izz street and includes a hospital (bimaristan), a madrasa and his mausoleum. It is widely regarded as one of the major monuments of Islamic Cairo and of Mamluk architecture, notable for the size and scope of its charitable operations as well as for the richness of its architecture. History= Historical context and background  The Qalawun Complex was built over the ruins of the Fatimid Palace of Cairo, with several halls in the Palace. It was sold to several people until it was finally bought by the Sultan Qalawun in 1283 AD. The structure resides in the heart of Cairo, in the Bayn al-Qasrayn, and has been a center for important religious ceremonies and rituals of the Islamic faith for years, stretching from the Mamluk dynasty through the Ottoman Empire. Facade of Sultan Qalawun's complex on al-Muizz Street Construction The funerary complex of Sultan al-Mansur Sayf al-Din Qalawun, including both madrasa and mausoleum reportedly took 13 months to build, from 1284–1285. This fact is remarkable considering the sheer size and scope of the total complex. The relatively short amount of time it took to construct the complex is in large part due to the slave like labor the Sultan commanded. The hospital took less than six months to complete, the mausoleum and madrasa each taking about four months. The building project was supervised by emir ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar al-Shuja‘i al-Mansuri (, romanised: ʿAlam ad-Dīn Sanǧar aš-Šuǧāʿī al-Manṣūrī), who forcefully employed hundreds of Mongol prisoners of war, calling upon workers throughout Fustat and Cairo to aid in the project. Al-Shuja’i used whatever means necessary to procure the large labor force needed to complete the project, even calling on people walking through the streets. The Complex was considered one of the most beautiful buildings at that time, where it included a school (Madrasah), a hospital (Bimaristan) and a mausoleum, with a Beautiful Dome. Historians claim that the columns holding the mausoleum structure were made of granite, marble, and other materials that were taken from another palace in Roda Island. The complex was built in three stages, where the Hospital was finished first, the Mausoleum and then finally the school.  Restorations  The structure was restored several times in the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, the son and successor of Sultan Qalawun. He restored the minarets after a strong earthquake occurred in 1327 AD; he recorded the date of restoration on it. Another restoration came when Abdul-Rahman Katkhuda, created a beautifully built Ottoman Sabil on the other side of the street in 1776.  19th Century  Architect Pascal Coste used the complex as one of his sources for his book Architecture arabe: ou Monuments du Kaire, mesurés et dessinés, de 1818 à 1825. Coste worked at the complex from July 1822 creating a ground plan in which he attempted to impose right angles where there were none. As identified by Eva-Maria Troelenberg, Coste's drawings corrected the structure in a number of ways. In addition to falsifying the ground plan, his façade drawings \\"literally re-interpret the entire ensemble as a vision of modernized urban space\\".  Description = Overview  A slightly horseshoe arched portal leads into a passage separating the mausoleum from the madrasah. The tomb is on the right, and the Madrasah, on a cruciform plan, is to the left of the entrance. Inside the four Iwans once contained the four different law schools, on the east side is a fine stucco Mihrab. The interior was in a poor condition until 2000, when a massive Historic Cairo Rehabilitation Project (HCRP) plan was made for the entire Muizz Street, planned to be completed by October 2008. The Mausoleum contains the bodies of al-Nasir' mother, and his son. while the sultan is buried in the adjoining Mausoleum built by his father, Sultan Qalawun = Exterior = The exterior structure of the Qalawun complex has many unique firsts in Mamluk architecture. The whole complex is said to be the earliest example of an “Urban aesthetic” in Mamluk architecture. This urban aesthetic starts with the layout of the madrasa and mausoleum in relation to each other. The minaret is not attached to the madrasa but to the mausoleum. Also, the minaret does not reside near the entrance of the building, as was a customary practice of the time. The overall effect is the first real juxtaposition of the minaret with the dome. Thankfully the funerary complex is still well preserved today, with certain renovations throughout the years helping to maintain its grandeur. One visits the city of Cairo today it is the Mamluk Cairo they largely see as the various Mamluk buildings dominate the scene. = Interior = Worth noting about the interior of the various buildings of the total complex is the evidence that its architecture was influenced by Norman Sicilian qualities. One such instance of this influence is in the triple windows, which are \\"composed of two arched openings surmounted by an oculus\\", which reside in the upper level of the mausoleum façade. The same triple window placement can be seen on the madrasa's façade, corresponding to the mihrab. \\"The entire façade design with its double-framed and pointed recess arches recalls the façade of the Palermo Cathedral as it was before restoration\\". The marble mosaics seen throughout the complex and the large canopy dome are stylistic tendencies also seen in Norman Sicilian architecture, though numerous differences still exist. Mihrab of Qalawun's mausoleum. The mausoleum The Mausoleum of Sultan Qalawun in Cairo is considered by many to be the second most beautiful mausoleum, succeeded only by the Taj Mahal in India. Al-Nuwayri (an Arab Historian), has said in his book Nihayet al Irab (The Utmost Desire), that the Mausoleum was not intended to become a burial site, but a Mosque and a school, and that it was first used as a tomb when he died, and hosted his body. His body was kept in the Cairo Citadel for two months until the tomb was ready to replace the Citadel's Burial location, later when Qalawun's son died, he too was buried in the Mausoleum. The mihrab of the mausoleum is often considered as the most lavish of its kind. This is in contrast to the mihrab of the madrasa, which is less grand in size and general esthetics. With a horse-shoe profile the mihrab is flanked by three columns made of marble. The Mausoleum later on, and under the mamluks included a Museum for Royal Clothes of those buried in it. The Mausoleum of Qalawun is significant in that its dome served as a ceremonial center for the investing of new emirs. Indeed, the dome was a symbol of new power, a changing of the guard, signifying a new center of Mamluk power, which enjoyed great prosperity at the time. The Mausoleum's Dome was demolished by the Ottoman Governor over Egypt Abdul-Rahman Katkhuda and was then rebuilt in Ottoman architecture, However the Comite for reservation of Arab monuments built another dome to replace that in 1908. The madrasa Within the madrasa the four legal schools, or the four madhhabs of Islamic law were regularly taught. Other teachings housed in the madrasa included the Hadith and the teaching of medicine. The madrasa had two iwans and two recesses as evidenced by the accompanying waqf document. The large courtyard of the madrasa was paved with polychrome marble. The sanctuary of the madrasa \\"faces the courtyard with a tripartite two-storeyed façade consisting of a central arch flanked by two smaller ones, and surmounted by similar arched openings. These were originally surmounted by three oculi, one above two, and not only one, as is the case today.\\" The mihrab of the madrasa has a horse-shoe arch similar to the mausoleum but is smaller and less elaborate than that of the mausoleum and its conch is marked with glass mosaics and mother-of-pearl, rather than marble mosaics. The deep red color used in the mosaics stands out. The hospital Though not visible from the street the hospital once stood as the most lavish and impressive hospital of its time. The hospital functioned through the late Ottoman period before being demolished in 1910. The hospital offered many amenities to the sick and poor in addition to medical treatment, including drugs, shelter, food, and clothing. Production of drugs for medical treatment, as well as research and teaching occurred within the hospital. Most of this information has been gleaned from a waqf document from the time. The Medieval Islamic historian al-Maqrizi has his own observations regarding the history of the hospital. According to Maqrizi, the hospital was built from the Fatimid palace of Sayyidat al-Mulk, and could be reached from a corridor leading from the madrasa and mausoleum. Large fountains residing within its walls marked the beauty of the interior of the hospital. Within the hospital also stood a large central courtyard measuring 21x33m.

In 1602, Cane began a ten-year apprenticeship to his older brother Richard, who had finished his own apprenticeship and established himself as a goldsmith in 1600. The younger Cane won his \\"freedom\\" in the goldsmiths' guild in 1611. Cane married and began a family in 1612. Jigging clown Cane's stage career had begun by 1622, when he moved from Lady Elizabeth's Men (at the Cockpit) to the Palsgrave's Men (at the Fortune). After 1631 he was a \\"chiefe\\" member of the Prince Charles's Men (II) troupe, and received their payments for their performances at Court.G. E. Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage, vol. ii, pp.398-401. One of his jobs was dancing the jig that concluded each performance, a traditional task that clowns from Richard Tarlton to John Shank had fulfilled. Like other clowns in this function, Cane used the opportunity of a solo turn on the stage to develop a satiric rapport with his audience. He excelled at the task, and was said to possess \\"the tongue of Mercury.\\"S. P. Cerasano, \\"Must the Devil Appear?: Audiences, Actors, Stage Business,\\" in: A Companion to Renaissance Drama, Arthur Kinney, ed., London, Blackwell, 2002; p. 199. By the late 1630s, his political satire had grown so sharp that the Privy Council took notice; in 1639 the Council ordered the Attorney General to address the matter of Cane satirizing politicians from the stage of the Red Bull Theatre (though the surviving records do not specify the outcome of the matter).Jane Milling, \\"The development of a professional theatre, 1540-1660,\\" in: The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Vol. 1, Jane Milling and Peter Thomson, eds., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 150-1. Cane's stage career was not limited by the official scrutiny. His fame led to non- theatrical expressions: in 1641 a pamphlet titled The Stage Players Complaint was printed, which portrays Cane and another famous clown, Timothy Read, exchanging witticisms on the issues of the day, and talking up the worth and value of playacting.Darryll Grantley, Wit's Pilgrimage: Drama and the Social Impact of Education in Early Modern England, London, Ashgate, 2000; p. 103. Goldsmith A number of figures in English Renaissance drama maintained formal membership in the guilds of London; this allowed them to bind apprentices to contracts, something that actors, as retainers in noble households, could not legally do under the system of the time. Most of these men kept only a formal guild membership: John Heminges maintained his membership in the grocers' guild, but didn't peddle groceries; Ben Jonson kept his membership in the bricklayers' guild, but didn't lay bricks. Andrew Cane, however, was one of a number of actors who pursued a career beyond the stage; he was a member of the goldsmiths' guild and an active goldsmith.David Kathman, \\"Grocers, Goldsmiths, and Drapers: Freemen and Apprentices in the Elizabethan Theater,\\" Shakespeare Quarterly Vol. 55 No. 1 (Spring 2004), pp. 1-49. He crossed his two careers without hesitation, turning his goldsmithing apprentices into boy actors. The 14-year-old Arthur Savill was apprenticed to Cane the goldsmith on 5 August 1631 -- and before the end of the year he was playing Quartilla, one of the female roles in Shackerley Marmion's Holland's Leaguer. The same production featured, in the role of Millicent, the 17-year- old John Wright, who'd become a Cane apprentice in 1629. (Other theatre figures of the time -- actors Robert Armin and John Lowin and manager Robert Keysar -- came from or maintained membership in the goldsmiths' guild.Alexander Leggatt, Jacobean Public Theatre, London, Routledge, 1992; p. 31. Evidence of their activity as goldsmiths, however, is lacking.) The records of the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate (which was near the Fortune Playhouse and the home of many theatre people) state that a foundling child called Hester, \\"her parents unknown,\\" was christened on 18 April 1628; she is noted as having been \\"taken up\\" at Andrew Cane's \\"stall,\\" his place of business.G. E. Bentley, \\"Records of Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association, Vol. 44 No. 3 (September 1929), pp. 789-826; see p. 797. Aftermath After the theatres were closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Cane was an active supporter of the Royalist cause. By 1644, goldsmith Cane was coining the Royalists' debased coinage; he may have had to spend time in prison as a result.Milling, p. 151. Cane did not abandon acting permanently, however. On 22 January 1650, he was one of eight performers arrested at the Red Bull Theatre, for play-acting against the regulations of the Commonwealth regime. In 1654 Cane became involved in a lawsuit with actor William Wintershall and his wife, over a thirty-year-old debt of £40. The debt stemmed from a 1624 agreement between theater manager Richard Gunnell and a group of actors, one of whom was Cane. Wintershall had married Gunnell's daughter Margaret in the early 1640s, and so was drawn into the matter. The outcome of the suit in not known. The date of Cane's death is also unknown. His son Edward and grandson Andrew continued Cane's trade -- not as actors, but goldsmiths.

Military career Vicente San Bruno was born in Aragon, and in his youth he took minor order in a Franciscan convent. In 1808, San Bruno left the convent and joined the Spanish army as a soldier at the time of the French invasions. He fought bravely during the Peninsular War and won a promotion to officer. On December 25, 1813, he set sail for Peru under the command of Rafael Maroto as a captain in the Queen's Talavera Regiment. They disembarked at Callao on April 24, 1814 to support Viceroy José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, who had been working arduously to maintain his viceroyalty and the bordering territories under Spanish control. Maroto and his troops, which included San Bruno, were placed under the orders of Brigadier Mariano Osorio and sent to Chile, which had risen in rebellion after the French invasion of Spain. In Chile San Bruno and the Talavera Regiment embarked on July 19, 1814, arriving at the naval base of Talcahuano, the nucleus of royalist activity, on August 13. Brigadier Osorio succeeded in organizing local elements into a mobile army of some 5,000 men, of which the troops of the Talavera Regiment were practically the only Spaniards. This circumstance led the Talavera Regiment to manifest a marked disdain for its opponents and the Criollo troops in general, typical of Peninsulares recently arrived in the Americas. On October 1, the two sides fought in Rancagua, an attempt to prevent the expeditionaries from taking Santiago. The Talavera attacked the enemy fortifications without bothering to send in either scouts or guerrillas. The result was that bombarded by the volley of shots, they were forced to retreat with heavy losses. Nevertheless, by November Spanish control had been reestablished, and San Bruno was put in charge of carrying out the orders of imprisoning the civilians suspected of having helped or sympathised with the independentists. On February 6, 1815, he became infamous when he opened the doors of the public jail of Santiago, and when the prisoners came out, had them all killed under the pretext that they were trying to escape. After Francisco Marcó del Pont became Royal Governor, San Bruno acquired almost unlimited authority. Two of the squadrons of the Talavera Regiment were sent back to Perú, but San Bruno stayed in Chile as commander of the remaining squadron. On January 17, 1816 he was named president of the Court of Vigilance and Public Security, which acted as a secret political police. As such he instituted a reign of terror in order to quash any possible rebellion. Death San Bruno was captured during the Battle of Chacabuco, which took place on February 12, 1817, while he was trying to organize the resistance. He was taken to Santiago, where the populace tried to lynch him. The victors refused to treat him as a prisoner of war, and he was instead tried as a common criminal on March 6, sentenced to death on April 10 and executed on the main square of Santiago on April 12.

Founded on 8 July 1968, by noted documentary filmmaker Gerald Thompson, the independent film company broke new ground in the world of documentaries, using new filming techniques and capturing footage of never before filmed activities of its various subjects. In 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was sold to Circle Communications, where it retained its own identity as a division within the company. The following year, Circle Communications was taken over by Southern Star Entertainment UK. Under the new ownership, Oxford Scientific Films continued to enhance its reputation for innovative film-making, producing multiple award-winning series and films, including the highly acclaimed Animal Planet series, Meerkat Manor. In March 2008, Southern Star merged its Sydney-based factual business division into the Oxford Scientific Films division, retaining the brand name for specialist documentaries, while using \\"Southern Star Factual\\" as the brand name for its features and entertainment style documentaries. When Southern Star was sold to Endemol, Oxford Scientific Films was retained by parent company Fairfax Media. In 2011 Oxford Scientific Films was acquired by Boom Pictures Productions, who own a 70% share of the company. History=Formation and growth In 1967, cinemicrophotography pioneer, professional film maker, and Oxford University lecturer Gerald Thompson, was approached by the Ealing Corporation of Harvard about expanding its catalogue of short educational films. Universal Education and Visual Arts, a New York City, company also was interested in talking with Thompson about the works he'd produced. Thompson and five of his associates and former students: Peter Parks, who worked with plankton; John Paling, a fish specialist who worked with Parks; recent Oxford graduate Sean Morris; zoologist John Cooke; and Eric Skinner, who assisted Thompson with his films, wanted to form an independent film company. Thompson and Parks travelled to America to meet with the two companies to show their work. At the end of the meeting, they told the head of the company about their desire to open their own company and, impressed with the films he'd seen, he offered to finance them for the first three years and give them the funds to build a place to work. When they returned to the United Kingdom, Thompson sold them a quarter acre of his garden, at a steeply discounted price, to be the home for the new building. They formed Oxford Scientific Films, taking part of the name from Parks' existing company Oxford Biological Films. Thompson, Parks, Morris, Paling, and Thompson's son David, headed the new company, which began operating on 8 July 1968. Thompson remained at his position at Oxford University while the company building was being completed, while the other four travelled to America to make the film loops for Ealing. Thompson resigned from the university on 2 September 1969, taking on the work at Oxford Scientific Films full-time. The company focused initially on filming nature at a microscopic level, including insect and aquatic wildlife. Using specialised equipment and camera techniques the developed themselves, the company gained fame for its ability to record never before seen footage of the natural world. Its cinematographers became experts in micro, macro, snorkel, slow-motion and time-lapse photography. As the company grew, it expanded into other innovating filming and post-production techniques, and moved from creating short loops to creating television programmes and series, commercials, and feature films. Southern Star acquisition In September 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was purchased by film and television rights company Circle Communications for £3.9 million. £3.85 million of the purchase price was paid in cash, with the rest paid through a stock exchange. Less than a year later, in May 1997, Australia-based Southern Star Entertainment made a £8.3 million take over bid for Circle Communications, due to its distribution business, strong catalogue, and the company's drama and factual production business. Oxford Scientific Films, which had retained its own identity under Circle Communications, became a core division of Southern Star Entertainment. On 4 December 2003, Oxford Scientific's extensive libraries of over 350,000 still images and over 2,000 of film footage libraries were acquired by Photolibrary. The acquisition was done as a share exchange,with Photolibrary acquiring shares in Oxford Scientific Films Limited, and Southern Star paying A$1 million to purchase a 46.46% equity in Photolibrary. Photolibrary retained existing employees of the library divisions, and continues using the names \\"Oxford Scientific\\" and \\"OSF\\" in promoting the libraries. Southern Star retained full control of Oxford Scientific Films production unit, and through that unit, continues supplying images and footage to the Photolibrary. In March 2008, parent company Southern Star Group merged its Sydney-based \\"factual business unit\\" into the Oxford Scientific Films division. The merged company now uses two brands, with the existing Oxford Scientific Films name being used for its \\"specialist factual programmes\\", while the Southern Star Factual brand will be used for \\"features and factual entertainment shows.\\" Oxford Scientific Films today Some time later, Oxford Scientific Films became part of the Twofour Group, which was acquired on 24 June 2015 by ITV Studios. Notable works Oxford Scientific Films has produced numerous award-winning programmes and films. In 1998, its film \\"The Forbidden Fruit\\" produced for the BBC's long-running series The Natural World and WNET Nature, won seven industry awards. Heroes of the High Frontier, produced as a National Geographic Special, won four awards and was a finalist for the Best of the Show Grand Award Trophy at the New York Festivals. In 2005, the company launched Meerkat Manor, a docu-drama commissioned for Animal Planet. The series has since become Animal Planet's highest rated series, and has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Awards and was a finalist at the 2006 Wildscreen Festival It won multiple awards at the 2006 Omni Awards and 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Gala. The series is also noted for capturing never before seen aspects of the lives of meerkats, being the first to capture meerkat infanticide on film, and for expanding the boundaries of the documentary genre.

He joined the fight against the Spaniards since the start of the revolution. He later became a one-term governor of Cavite from 1910 to 1912. Biography=Early years Tomás Mascardo was born in the town of Cavite del Viejo (now Kawit, Cavite province) to Valentín Mascardo and Dolores Echenique. The affluent couple, a landowner and a rice dealer, respectively, had a total of seven children. Tomás finished his teacher's diploma from Escuela Normal in Manila and became a teacher at the barrio school of Halang in Amadeo, Cavite.\\"Tomas Mascardo (1871–1932)\\". Webcitation. Retrieved on 2013-10-21.  Philippine revolution  Mascardo joined the revolution against the Spaniards from the beginning. He became the chief of the revolutionary intelligence service in Manila, succeeding Miguel Liedo who was captured and sentenced to death by the Spaniards. He was ordered by General Emilio Aguinaldo to attack a Spanish stronghold in Tanauan, Batangas, where the general was awed by Mascardo’s courage. In time, he was promoted to brigadier general. Mascardo, together with his commander, General Edilberto Evangelista, fought at the Battle of Zapote Bridge on February 17, 1897 where Evangelista was killed and Mascardo wounded. Philippine-American War During the Philippine-American War, Mascardo was assigned as commanding general of the revolutionary forces in Pampanga, Bataan, and Zambales provinces with barracks in Bagac, Bataan. Following Aguinaldo's capture by the Americans on March 23, 1901 in Palanan, Isabela, he ordered his subordinate, Major Manuel L. Quezon, to surrender as well so he can verify the capture and if so, consult Aguinaldo for final orders as there was also an order for Mascardo to surrender. Quezon was able to meet Aguinaldo in a room at the Malacañang Palace where he was detained. After relaying Mascardo’s message, Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision to surrender is up to Mascardo himself. Mascardo surrendered on May 15, 1901, calculating that his deficiency in weaponry would mean sure defeat from the well-armed Americans. Political career and death Mascardo returned to Cavite following his release by the Americans. He was influenced to enter politics, and won the gubernatorial seat of Cavite, a post he held from 1910 to 1912. He retired and lived a private life after only one term. On July 7, 1932, he died from a heart disease. Personal life Tomás Mascardo was married to Carmen Topacio of Imus, Cavite. The couple had eight children – Modesto, Dominador (who became a general), Petra, Pura, Jaime, Tomás, Salvador (a former collector of customs at the Manila International Airport), and Emiliano.

She studied cello with Ivor James and Harvey Phillips at the Royal College of Music and later became a professor at the same college. Her pupils have included Alexander Baillie, Martin Johnson, Natalie Clein, František Brikcius and Kathy Hampson (née Jewell).  Early life  On 2 May 1937, Shuttleworth was born in Bournemouth. Shuttleworth's father was a retired Indian Civil Service and her mother was a Polish-Irish. Studying the Cello In 1943, Shuttleworth went to study the cello at the Royal College of Music (RCM) as a scholar. There she learned with Ivor James and Harvey Philips. While at the RCM, Anna became a founding member of the Vivien Hind String Quartet, an ensemble that she played with for a number of years. After leaving the RCM her friend Joan Dickson organised for the cellist Enrico Mainardi to give lessons in London for which Anna took part. She also continued her studies with Franz Walter in Geneva. Shortly after leaving college, Anna was invited to play at the Newbury Festival with the Newbury String Players, both in the orchestra and later as a soloist. This initiated a long friendship with the family of Gerald Finzi and their musical circle, including Ursula and Ralph Vaughan Williams. This period also witnessed a richly varied freelance career, playing in a number of festival orchestras, as a chamber musician and soloist. She was once affectionately referred to as “The Swellest Cellist” by Vaughan Williams. In 1953, at the recommendation of the composer Herbert Howells, Anna entered for the Boise scholarship and in 1954 was awarded a substantial sum to further her cello studies. This she used to study with Mainardi in Salzburg and Rome, and with Pablo Casals in Zermatt and Prades. Personal life Anna Shuttleworth has been married twice, first time to Noel Taylor, a fellow cellist, in 1957, and the second time to David Sellen, a biophysics researcher, since 1973. Professional life In the 1960s, Anna’s career took off and she became a member of several ensembles and performed for many BBC broadcasts. In 1964 Novello published “Learning the cello” which Anna wrote jointly with Hugo Cole. Anna had a lesson with Rostropovich who complimented Anna on her beautiful cello sound and musicianship. This is also the year when she is invited to teach the cello at the Junior Department at the RCM, followed by the appointment to the Senior Department in 1967. In 1968 she is approved as an Associated Board examiner and also buys her very first Renault 4, the car that was to become her habitual transport, travelling around the country. The 1970s was Anna’s golden period and through the connection with Hilary Finzi, Jacqueline du Pré’s sister, Anna was allowed to play on Jacqui’s Davidov Stradivarius for two years. She became a “sought after” cello professor at the RCM and taught many of today’s well-known musicians, including Adrian Brendel, Alexander Baillie, Clare Finzi, Elizabeth Wilson and Jonathan del Mar. But, as Anna felt like she had neglected her academic career, and partly to better understand David’s work at the Leeds University, she took an Open University course 1971-75 and was awarded a BA (Hons) degree in 1975. In 1972 Anna put Stuart Lowe (a keen amateur cellist) in contact with Sue Jennings (one of Anna’s cello students at the RCM) and later Stuart and Sue married. Later Anna taught Matthew, Daniel and Time Lowe at Sue’s request. Anna and Sue developed a longstanding teaching relationship and together, and with the Lowe family members and Alexander Baillie, they created “Gathering of the Clans”, a long running cello course with teachers such as Baillie and Johannes Goritzki as well as Alexander teachers/cellists Vivien Mackie and Rhuna Martin. Other cellists included Joan Dickson, Amanda Truelove, Sasha Boyarsky, Lowri Blake, Andreas Burzik, Melissa Phelps, Louise Hopkins, and Moray Welsh. Since the 1960s Anna has performed many successful piano and cello recitals with some of the leading pianists in Britain, including Bernard Roberts, Ian Brown, Martin Roscoe and John Thwaites. Since leaving the RCM in the late 1940s Anna has been a member of numerous chamber music ensembles including a string trio with Elisabeth Watson (viola), Georgian String Quartet, Leonardo Trio (first with David Roth, later with Maureen Smith, violin and with Ian Brown, piano), London Harpsichord Ensemble, Glickman Trio and Aulos Ensemble. When in London she knew Sylvia Cleaver who in 1964 asked Anna to become the principal cellist of the Midland Sinfonia Orchestra (later renamed the English Sinfonia). She held this post until she retired from the orchestra in 1996. Apart from this, Anna has worked with many orchestras over the years such as the Alexandra Orchestra (founded by Denys Darlow) which later became the Tilford Bach Orchestra, Chelsea Opera Group, Kalmar Orchestra, Sadler’s Wells Opera Orchestra (now English National Opera) and Orchestra d'Amici. Music Courses and Travel Anna has always loved to travel and has spent many holidays around the world with a particular fondness for Scandinavia. In the early seventies, at Jacqueline du Pré's suggestion, the Swedish cellist Frans Helmerson stayed at Anna’s house and they became friends. Then while teaching at the Great Missenden Summer course in Berkshire, Anna met the Swedish musical Frankmar family who brought her over to Sweden for various summer courses. There she met cellists Ludwig Frankmar and Tomas Sterner who came to study with her in London. In 1979 Tomas became her cello student at the RCM and, in 2009, has published her memoirs. Tomas and Anna also helped to organise two string courses in Guernsey in the early 1980s. In 1985, while on tour with the Associated Board in Malaysia, Anna met Toya, a Batik artist living in Penang, and his nephew Kia. Anna helped both of them, firstly by organising exhibitions of Toya’s work in England and secondly by sponsoring Kia to study at Leeds University, where he is now on the staff. In 1986 she again worked for the Associated Board, examining in New Zealand. Teaching the Cello Anna’s teaching career evolved over the years. From initially teaching at independent schools and later being appointed a professor at the RCM she eventually took on many teaching positions in England, including Canterbury, Leeds and students from York University, as well as at Leeds Girls High School. On top of this she had many private pupils. In 1994, Anna’s teaching became more widely known when her pupil, Natalie Clein, won both the UK and European Young Musician of the Year competitions. Although this was at a time when Anna was near retirement, she was now very much a sought after teacher. Much later she taught the very talented Czech cellist Frantisek Brikcius, who came to Leeds University as an Erasmus scholar. In retirement Anna has slowed down but not yet stopped. She made her final cello and piano duo recitals in 2003 and now plays the Treble and Bass Viols and sings early music. She teaches the cello if requested. In 2008 Anna was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Royal College of Music from Prince Charles. This follows a number of years when she has supported the RCM and also created a cello prize in her own name. Publications Anna Shuttleworth has co-written a cello method for young cellists aged 10 and upwards , and her memoirs were published in July 2009 . Recordings Anna Shuttleworth has made several recordings with Alfred Deller (counter-tenor). For example, Purcell's Ode for St. Cecilia's Day and Purcell's Te Deum and Jubilate Deo .

Supporting up to four players, the game is controlled by the paddle controllers. Gameplay A blackjack game in progress Displayed from an overhead perspective, there are three card games to choose from: blackjack, five-card stud poker, and poker solitaire. Except for poker solitaire, each game always has the computer as the dealer, and bets are made by rotating the wheel on the controller and then pressing the button. There are two different blackjack games: Game 1 allows for up to two players and hand splitting, and Game 2 allows for up to four players yet there is no hand splitting. There are variations in the game depending on the setting of the difficulty switches. If the left switch is set to \\"A\\", the computer will shuffle after 34 hands, and if set to \\"B\\", the computer will shuffle after every hand. If the right switch is set to \\"A\\", the dealer will stay (not draw anymore cards) after drawing a 17, and if set to \\"B\\", the computer will stay after drawing an 18 or better. Furthermore, the player will win if he draws the maximum number of cards; in Game 1, that is three or eight hits, and in Game 2, three hits. Stud poker, which comprises Game 3, allows for up to four players. The computer, as the dealer, issues a card to each of the players and itself. Before the first card is dealt, and after each subsequent hand, until five cards have been dealt, each player must either make a bet or fold. If the left difficulty switch is set to \\"A\\", the dealer's first card is dealt face down; otherwise, it is dealt face up; likewise for the right difficulty switch for each player. Poker solitaire is different in that no bets are made and there is no dealer; rather, the goal is to arrange cards to create the best twelve poker hands in 25 cards, with five rows, five columns, and the two diagonals. Points are scored depending on the hands created, with a pair yielding 10 points and a royal flush yielding 500 points. The highest possible score is 3340 points.

The helix of sustainability is a concept coined to help manufacturing industry move to more sustainable practices by mapping its models of raw material use and reuse onto those of nature.The environmental benefits of the use crop origin sustainable materials have been assumed to be self-evident, but as the debate on food vs fuel shows, the whole product life cycle must be examined in the light of social and environmental effects in addition to technical suitability and profitability.

In 2004 the concept was presented by Professor John Wood, then Chair of the Materials Foresight Panel at a DTI event hosted by the then Secretary of State for Industry (Jacqui Smith).\\"Opportunities in Horticulture: A Proposal for Academic Posts in WMG\\", WMG Report, David Mullins, 26 April 2004 In the same year it was also used in the European Science Foundation exploratory workshop on environmentally friendly composites.\\"Environmentally Friendly European Composites Workshop\\", K Kirwan, N Tucker, M Johnson, C Halstead, D Jacobs, Report, European Science Foundation, April 2004 The advantages of working with crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the Triple bottom line), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised it is essential that attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?). The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. snap-fits) may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of waste reduction techniques such as lean manufacturing. Conventional cycles of use and reuse are circular. Consider the mechanical recovery of conventional polymers. A complex infrastructure is needed to recover the material at the end of an article's useful life. At the end of an article's life - say a PET carbonated drink bottle, the article must be separated from the waste stream, either by the consumer who throws it away, or by manual labour at the rubbish dump. It must then be transported to some facility to be reprocessed (using more labour and energy) back into a raw material. The heat and shear forces associated with the process of remanufacture tends to produce material with slightly degraded properties compared to the original material. For sustainable material articles there is not such a great requirement for a dedicated recovery infrastructure. If a litter lout throws a crop origin biodegradable article on the ground, it will ultimately biodegrade into humus, water, and non-fossil CO2. If the article is placed into a compostable waste stream, the humus can then be used as fertiliser for the next generation of crops, there is also no requirement to sort biopolymer articles as there is with fossil polymer recycling. Note difference between landfill and compost - the limited biological activity in landfill is slow, and mostly anaerobic resulting in the production of methane, whereas composting is a rapid aerobic process resulting in humus, water and non-fossil CO2. The energy bill for breaking down biodegradables into the fundamental building block molecules, and then reassembling them into usable raw materials is large, but is uses direct solar energy rather than metered electricity. There is also no loss of properties with successive journeys through the cycle.

With a plotline steeped in psychological horror, the movie echos the styles and themes of numerous classic foreign thrillers such as the South Korean horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, a movie which features the appearance of a similar stepmother character. The film's setting also resembled the American-Spanish The Others (2001) in creating a haunted house atmosphere, although this setting is also one common feature of Khmer stories and movies.

Teacher of Geophysics from 1915 to 1925 at the University of Rome, then professor of Experimental physics at the University of Bari from 1928. It had been observed that an electroscope in a vessel at earth potential gradually lost its charge, even if very carefully insulated, due to the ionization of the air. Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization on mountains, over a lake, over the sea, and underwater. In an experiment performed in June 1911, Pacini concluded that ionization underwater was significantly lower than on the sea surface. He could then demonstrate that a certain part of the ionization itself must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth, thus contributing to the discovery of cosmic rays.

The museum mission defines it as cultural institution primarily devoted to collect, research and communicate the tangible and intangible heritage related to traditional and popular Valencian culture. The mission underlines that the museum also aims to permanently question fundamental aspects of the culture, as the dynamics that built it and force it to evolve, as well as its diversity. Although fundamentally devoted to Valencian cultural identity within a Mediterranean context, this museum also works to give visitors the chance to understand the challenges and dynamics of culture as a whole and from a contemporary perspective. History The end of Franco's dictatorship and the political transition of the late 1970s and early 1980s witnessed the re-emergency of culturally distinct identities within the Spanish state. As part of this wave, and somehow revitalizing some other historical attempts,Martínez, R. (2006) A la recerca del museu identitari. In Revista Valenciana d’Etnologia, nº1. Pp: Museu Valencià d’Etnologia, Diputació de València. Valencia. the Valencian Museum of Ethnology was originally impulsed by Joan Francesc Mira, an intellectual and anthropologist deeply interested in the valencian cultural identity. The institution was finally created in 1982 by the regional government called Diputació de València and placed in its current location at the Beneficència Cultural Centre, in the city center of València. The museum finally opened its doors in 1983 with four staff members. Among its initials goals was to built up an ethnographic collection referring to valencian traditional culture and in particular that part of it related to rural areas and activities, already then, in a clear process of disappearance. In a few years an interesting collection in agrarian technology was gathered constituting the core collection of the museum that has been enlarged in later years. Activities As an institution rooted within the city of Valencian and the region of Valencia, the museum is constantly engaged in working with different communities along this territorial framework. Traveling exhibitions and workshops are part of its day-to-day activity; museum curators are constantly learning and sharing their knowledge in villages and cities in the area in close collaboration with cultural associations are individuals. The museum has developed a close relationships with many smaller museums across the territory with the aim of helping local communities access to quality cultural events, or else, broadcast their views, knowledge and identities through closely related cultural institutions. At its site in the Centre Cultural la Beneficència in València city, the museum has a permanent exhibit presented in three sections: La ciutat viscuda. Ciutats valencianes en trànsit, 1800-1940 (The lived town. Valencian towns in transition, 1800–1940), Horta i marjal (Market gardens and marshes) and Secà i muntanya (Drylands and mountains), that show a summary of the many aspects of popular and traditional valencian culture. In this center, the museum offers its programme of temporary exhibitions that revise topics related to the museum mission. Along with temporary and permanent exhibitions, an intense activity of cultural events as educational workshops for children and families, seminars, film sessions, music performances and guided visits by the museum staff, are also part of the museum everyday life. Most of these are activities relate to traditional and popular culture and often bring multicultural perspectives, helping the museum to engage with its surrounding community at the city of València. The museum equally aims to stimulate research and engage in public education in the fields of ethnology and anthropology; It is a close partner of the Valencian Association of Anthropology (AVA) and works hand to hand with the university community. Among the museum research projects,The Valencian Oral Memory Project stands out. This project started by the museum staff in the early 2000s, has been, and still is, collecting oral memory from informers in communities all along the Valencian territory. Today, this project is one of the most important oral memory databases referring to a mediterranean culture and it is an essential research tool for scholars interested in sociology, anthropology, contemporary history and Catalan/valencian language. An important part of the interviews can be seen in the web site: www.museudelaparaula.es The museum publishes a periodical: Revista valenciana d’etnologia (Valencian journal of ethnology) and the monograph collections “Temes d’etnografia valenciana” and “Ethnos”. The majority of articles are published in castillian or Catalan/valencian languages. The Museum has a library and document centre (including a photographic archive) specialised in ethnology and anthropology. The facilities of the museum include the former psychiatric hospital of Bétera, where the museum staff manages a collection of about 10,000 catalogued objects . They also have a collaboration programme with 20 local museums. Material Culture Collection The objectual collection of the museum has key examples of objects relating to traditional farming and everyday life in the area. After the initial effort to gather rural based material culture, the museum staff moved also into urban origin items. In later years collection policies have broaden to allow the arrival of more contemporary, significant items related to popular culture. Most of the objects are of a valencian origin, only a small amount (as the Carsi Collection with material from the Congo/Zaire area) belongs to other geographical areas. In the last few years the section of the museum related to clothing has been increased greatly. The arrival of the Casa Insa collection, mainly conformed by theater and festivals customs reflecting most of the 20th century, and still being processed by the museum staff, represents an important quality impact on the museum collection.

With King Gesar and Avalokiteśvara, of whom he is an incarnation, he is one of the most important figures in Tibetan culture.The myth is attested in the book Maṇi bka' 'bum, allotted to King Songtsen Gampo. Pha means \\"father\\", Trelgen \\"old monkey\\" and Changchup Sempa refers to the bodhisattva (Changchub meaning \\"enlightenment\\" and Sempa meaning \\"intention\\").  Birth of the first Tibetans  A very popular Tibetan creation myth holds that in the beginning the world was covered by water, which evaporated little by little, leaving room for animal life. To the flooded land of Tibet came a monkey that had withdrawn there to immerse himself in meditation and to follow a life of asceticism and chastity. He settled on Mount Gongori. One day, while he sat in meditation, a female demon came to seduce him. Tradition has it that she was the manifestation of the bodhisattva Tara (Jetsun Dolma in Tibetan), a symbol of compassion and protector of merchants and travelers. She threatened that if he refused to sleep with her she would visit a demon and conceive a multitude of small monsters that would destroy all living creatures. The wise monkey yielded and requested Avalokiteśvara's authorization to marry her. Avalokiteśvara blessed the monkey and the female demon, and a few months later six small monkeys were born of their union. The monkey let his six children grow up in the forest, but three years later he discovered that they had become five hundred. The fruits of the forest were no longer sufficient to feed them, and the five hundred monkeys beseeched their father to help them find food. Not knowing what to do, he went again to ask help from the god of compassion. Then Avalokiteśvara went on the mount Meru, or Sumeru (believed to correspond to today's Mount Kailash), a sacred place for Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Bönpo. Some say that at the top of the mountain he gathered a handful of barley, others that he extracted five cereals from his own body to offer to the monkey father. Then the monkey father learned agriculture and, after a good harvest, could finally feed all his children. As they fed on the cereals, the monkeys gradually lost their hair and their tails. They also started to use bone and stone implements, then made clothes and built houses, forming a civilization from which the Tibetan people descended.  Another version  Another account says that, seeing the world peopled by demons, Avalokiteśvara the bodhisattva of compassion took pity on the Earth, incarnated himself as a monkey and mated with an ogress of the rock. From this union were born six monkeys, which represent the six principal clans of the Tibetan people.Khar, Rabgong Dorjee (1991). \\"A Brief Discussion on Tibetan History Prior to Nyatri Tsenpo.\\" Translated by Richard Guard and Sangye Tandar.

The supposed Macquarie Parakeet in the collection of Canterbury Museum. Notornis 52(2): 117-120 History When Macquarie Island was discovered in 1810 the parrots were widespread in tussock grassland and abundant on the shoreline, feeding on invertebrates in beach- washed seaweed. Despite the introduction of dogs and cats to the island by 1820, as well as being hunted for food by sealers, the parrots remained common there until about 1880.Taylor, R.H. (1979). How the Macquarie Parakeet became extinct. New Zealand Journal of Ecology 2: 42-45. The transition from abundance to extinction took little more than a decade. The critical events leading to the extinction of the parrot were the introductions of both wekas and European rabbits to the island in the 1870s and their subsequent spread during the 1880s. Until then winter, with the seasonal absence of burrow- nesting petrels and breeding penguins, was a period of food scarcity for terrestrial predators, which served to keep their numbers low. The presence of rabbits provided a year-round food supply for cats and wekas and allowed their numbers to expand, leading to increased predation on the parrot, the last sighting of which was in 1891.

Born about the end of the fourteenth century, he must have died between 1437 and 1440, as a manuscript of the Carthusian monastery of Memmingen speaks of the gift made to it by Krämer in 1437, and the general chapter of the Carthusian Order held in 1440 mentions his death.

Works His works include two treatises published by Bernard Pez in his Bibliotheca ascetica. Typically for the Carthusians of the fifteenth century, they show a rigorous asceticism, only a little qualified (under the influence of Denis the Carthusian). One of these is entitled \\"Breviloquium anirni cujuslibet religiosi reformativum\\"; it consists of two parts. In the first part the author teaches a good religious divers means and practices which he should observe in order to remain a faithful child of the Church, to acquire, on earth, the grace of perfection and, in heaven, ever- lasting happiness. In the second part, by a quaint allegory, he puts the religious on his guard against the faults of monastic life which are represented by twenty birds of prey, the eagle, the vulture, the hawk, the owl, etc., whose characteristics and manners he describes. Though written in an uncultured style, the book was much read in the monasteries of the Middle Ages. The subject of Krämer's second book is against anger, as indicated by its title, \\"Tractatus exhortativus ad evitandam malam iram\\".

Festivals The local festivals are connected with a temple, church, a national phenomenon. The festivals are cultural events which bring together people from all walks of life, all castes and creeds. These are perhaps the only occasions when one gets to watch the wealth of classical and folkarts of the land which are otherwise fast being relegated to memory. In this the most important one is Madathikavu Bhagavathys utsavam which is celebrated on Makaram 7th and 8th of every year (in January). The festival with an unmatched pageantry of drums, 3 caparisoned elephants and brilliant fireworks are so inseparably integrated that the extravaganza of Utsavam, excites you in the same breath when you hear the name of Pooppathy. Besides the major utsavam, the temple has a unique distinction of hosting Utsavams of two backward communities with equal fervency. 'Desavilakku Utsavam'is celebrated in great enthyusiasm. The 'Soyustar Soccer Fest' is a major event which was revived in the recent past by Football frenzy people and give unmatched enthusiasm to the every category of locals.

Life He studied at Vienna and Krems, and in 1699 entered Melk Abbey. Having studied the classical languages, he was made professor in the Melk monastery school in 1704, and in the same year went to the University of Vienna, where he studied theology. In 1708 he was ordained priest. He took up history, and in 1713, became librarian at Melk. As a model for his historical works he followed the French Maurists. He studied the archives of the order at Melk and Vienna, and in 1715-17 he, with his brother Hieronymus Pez, searched for manuscripts in the Austrian, Bavarian, and Swabian monasteries. In 1716 he published a plan for a universal Benedictine library, in which all the authors of the order, and their works, should be catalogued and reviewed. He obtained from the monasteries of his order no less than seven hundred and nine titles. He also had friendly literary relations with Johann von Eckhart, Schannat, Uffenbach, Schmincke, Mosheim, Lünig etc. In 1728 he accompanied Count Sinzendorf to France, where he made the acquaintance of Montfaucon, Martène Durand, Le Texier, Calmet etc., and enriched his collection from the libraries of the order. Works His chief works are: *\\"Thesaurus anecdotorum novissimus\\" (6 fol. vol., Augsburg, 1721-9), a collection of exegetic, theological, philosophical, ascetic, and historical literary sources; *\\"Bibliotheca ascetica\\" (12 vols., 1723–40), containing the sources of ascetic literature; *\\"Bibliotheca Benedictino-Maruiana\\" (1716).

The operation was launched on 29 July 2008 by elements of at least three Iraqi Army divisions, with four U.S. armored cavalry squadrons from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in support. The U.S. led operation was designated Operation Iron Pursuit and consisted of three sub- operations: Sabre Pursuit, Eagle Pursuit and Bastogne Pursuit. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence, the first phase of the operation was concluded on 11 August. Major-General Mohammed al-Askari reported that the Iraqi security forces had achieved half of the goals set for the operation. Al- Askari reported that 800 suspects had been arrested, including 42 Islamic State of Iraq leaders. Background In January 2008, U.S. forces throughout Iraq launched Operation Phantom Phoenix, a corps-level operation with a significant focus on Diyala. Despite a decrease in violence, partly attributable to Awakening Councils, groups formed by Sunni sheiks and supported by American forces, attacks remained at high levels. Many of these attacks were directed at the leaders of these groups. Insurgents retained strongholds in the western desert regions of Diyala, in the foothills of the Hamrin mountains and around Lake Hamrin. These locations were a fall-back position for al-Qaida in Iraq and other insurgent groups and were targeted by U.S. special operations forces in the months leading up to the operation. The operation On 29 July, the Diyala Operational Command imposed a curfew throughout the province, restricting all unofficial vehicle movement, and a number of checkpoints were set up in the capital, Baqubah. Iraqi forces conducted a number of house searches in Baqubah and Khan Bani Saad, 15 miles south of Baqubah. On 31 July, Iraqi forces captured Abu Anas al-Baghdadi, Al- Qaeda in Iraq's media expert in the country, as well as four members of the Mujahideen Shura Council during a raid in western Diyala. Iraqi security forces lifted the curfew throughout the province. On 2 August, the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment handed over responsibility for security in Balad Ruz, in the east of the province, to Iraqi security forces from the 18th brigade, 5th Iraqi Army Division, indicating that the region appears to have been cleared. By 5 August, Iraqi forces had captured a number of key Al-Qaeda in Iraq leaders, including Qussai Ali Khalaf, the head of Islamic State of Iraq in Diyala; Adnan Gumer Mohammed, Basem al Safaah and Antisar Khudair, a woman suspected of recruiting female suicide bombers. According to U.S. forces, insurgents appeared to be fleeing from Diyala westwards towards Salah-ad-Din as Iraqi forces pushed up the Uzaym River valley. U.S. forces from the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, set up blocking positions in Salah-ad-Din to catch these insurgents. It also conducted a number of air assaults into known Al-Qaeda rear areas. Aftermath On 25 August, the insurgents struck back when a suicide bomber attacked a police recruiting station killing 35 recruits in Jalawla.

The historian Charles Firth states Sydenham's political importance really begins with the expulsion of the Long Parliament in 1653.. He was a member of the council of thirteen appointed by the officers of the army on 29 April 1653; was summoned to the Rump Parliament, and was re-elected by that assembly to the Council of State on 9 July and 1 November 1653.. Cites: Commons' Journals, vii. 283, 344. His views, however, were too conservative for him to sympathise with the policy of the Rump Parliament. On 6 February 1649 he had been one of the tellers for the minority in the Long Parliament who wished to retain the House of Lords, so on 10 December 1653 he performed the same duty for the minority of the Rump Parliament who voted for the retention of an established church.. Cites: Commons' Journals, vi. 132, vii. 363. Two days later Sydenham took the lead in proposing that the assembly should dissolve itself, and may therefore be considered one of the founders of the protectorate..

Cites: Burton, Diary, i. 51, 68, 86, 218, 257. When the Protector's intervention on behalf of Naylor raised a complaint of breach of privilege, Sydenham recalled the house to the real question. \\"We live as parliament men but for a time, but we live as Englishmen always. I would not have us be so tender of the privilege of parliament as to forget the liberties of Englishmen\\".. Cites: Burton, Diary, i. 274.

When in December 1657 Sydenham was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords, a republican pamphlet remarked that, though \\"he hath not been thorough-paced for tyranny in time of parliaments\\", it was hoped he might yet be \\"so redeemed as never to halt or stand off for the future against the Protector's interest\\".. Cites: Harleian Miscellany, iii. 478. After the death of Oliver Cromwell Sydenham became one of Richard Cromwell's council ; but in April 1659 he acted with Fleetwood, Desborough, and what was termed the Wallingford House party to force him to dissolve the third Protectorate Parliament.

State Papers, Dom., 1658-9, p. 354. On the restoration of the Rump Parliament Sydenham became a member of the Committee of Safety on 7 May 1659 and of the Council of State just over a week later on 16 May, though he had conscientious scruples against taking the oath required from members of the latter..

When John Lambert turned out the Rump Parliament again, Sydenham took part with the army, and was made a member of their Committee of Safety.. Cites: Ludlow, ii. 131, 139, 143. Sydenham attempted to justify the violence of the army to the Council of State, \\"undertaking to prove that they were necessitated to make use of this last remedy by a particular call of divine Providence\\".. Cites: Ludlow,. ii. 140. When the Rump Parliament was again restored, Sydenham was called to answer for his conduct, and, failing to give a satisfactory explanation, was expelled on 17 January 1660.

He was named for his maternal grandfather, Hillyer Rolston Speed, an insurance executive. He had one sibling, Marguerite, who became a voice coach for Southern-themed films such as Baby Doll, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Long, Hot Summer, and Raintree County.

Similarly jaundiced was Dodie Smith, an English novelist and playwright, who described Lamkin as \\"a nice bright child but with an ounce of talent only, and not a reliable critic\\". He became a sensation at age 22 with the publication of his 1950 novel, Tiger in the Garden.

Writer-artist Dick Briefer presented two loose adaptations of the story in publisher Prize Comics' successive series Prize Comics and Frankenstein from 1940 to 1954. The first version represents what comics historians call American comic books' first ongoing horror feature. Publication history=Comics' first horror feature In Prize Comics #7 (cover-dated Dec. 1940), writer-artist Dick Briefer (using the pseudonym \\"Frank N. Stein\\" in the latter role) introduced the eight-page feature \\"New Adventures of Frankenstein\\", an updated version of 19th-century novelist Mary Shelley's much-adapted Frankenstein monster.Prize Comics #7 (Dec. 1940) at the Grand Comics Database Considered by comics historians to be \\"America's first ongoing comic book series to fall squarely within the horror genre\\",Frankenstein (1940) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

On page 5 of the latter, the author notes, \\"...there were no horror comics as such in the earliest days. The first real horror series seems to have been the 'Frankenstein' series by Dick Briefer, in Prize Comics ... [which was] a superhero title, featuring the Black Owl, the Green Lama, and the like, except for this one aberration\\". the feature, set in New York City circa 1930, starred a guttural, rampaging creature actually dubbed \\"Frankenstein\\" (unlike Shelley's nameless original monster). In Prize Comics #11 (June 1941), Briefer dropped the \\"Frank N. Stein\\" pen name of the previous three stories and introduced the doctor's adopted son Denny \\"Bulldog\\" Dunsan as Frankenstein's ongoing antagonist. Prize Comics #24 (Oct. 1942) pitted the monster against Bulldog and publisher Prize Comics' superheroes the Black Owl, the Green Lama, and Dr. Frost; the non-superpowered teens Yank and Doodle (\\"America's Fighting Twins\\"); and the namesake characters from the humor feature \\"General and the Corporal\\".Prize Comics #24 (Oct. 1942) at the Grand Comics Database In some stories, the monster also teamed up with two other occult menaces, the Witch and the Mummy. As with many comics characters of the time, the monster found himself in the European theater of World War II fighting Nazis. In 1942, scientist Dr. Ullrich offers a bride for Frankenstein, in exchange for the monster resolving to aid humans instead of fighting them, but an angry mob burns down the lab, killing both Ullrich and the bride. Horror to humor Prize Comics #33 (Aug 1943) brought an abrupt change to the strip. Another scientist, Professor Carroll, performs another experiment that makes Frankenstein look and act more human. A caption explains, \\"Frankenstein has left behind him a trail of wrecks, disaster, tragedy and murder — but, as we said, he has left it behind him, for thanks to the miraculous work of a great scientist, Frankenstein is a changed person! With a new suit of clothes, a haircut and a facial, he goes out to become a part of human society!\\" The humanized monster spends a few issues helping with national defense, and then enrolls in grade school. The character shifted back to horror for a brief period in 1944, beginning with February's Prize Comics #39. The monster was brainwashed by the Nazis to destroy the resistance in occupied territory. The character managed to break free of his conditioning and destroy the Germans' hypnosis machine, but then rampaged through Europe for a while with a female vampire, Zora, and a male zombie, Rollo. After a while, the three characters moved to New York City, and opened a hotel for monsters. Solo comic Briefer's better-known version of the Frankenstein monster, however, developed upon the monster's return from the war. The character was so popular at that point that they gave him his own series, with Frankenstein #1 (1945).Frankenstein Comics at the Grand Comics Database. (Note: Series title per its postal indicia and all covers except that of #1 is simply Frankenstein) Like many returning veterans, Frankenstein settled into small-town life, becoming a genial neighbor who \\"began having delightful adventures with Dracula, the Wolfman and other horrific creatures. The only two times he was featured on the Prize Comics cover (both in 1947), he was referred to as 'The Merry Monster'\\". Briefer, with his trademark \\"loose and smooth ink and brush skills\\" began telling stories that would \\"straddle some amorphous line between pure children's humor and adventure and an adult sensibility about the world\\". In his book Art Out of Time: Unknown Comics Visionaries 1900-1969, author Dan Nadel described Briefer as Briefer's humorous Frankenstein ran through Prize Comics #68 (March 1948), and his humorous Frankenstein ran through issue #17 (Feb. 1949). Three years later, Briefer (1915–1980) revived the series with his original, horrific Frankenstein from #18-33 (March 1952 - Nov. 1954).

In the following campaign Crawshaw was part of the Wednesday side which won the FA Cup, he played in all six ties, scoring in the 3–1 semi-final replay victory over Bolton Wanderers.

The 1896 publication Famous Footballers described Crawshaw as \\"A thorough worker always …he plays a good game from first to last and is unselfish to a degree.

Geography Fair Play is located in the southern corner of Oconee County, which occupies the northwestern corner of South Carolina. The CDP extends from the town center south to Lake Hartwell, a large reservoir on the South Carolina–Georgia line. Interstate 85 passes through the CDP, with access via exits 2 and 4. Greenville, South Carolina, is to the northeast, and Atlanta, Georgia, is to the southwest.

In October 2014, the CEO Guru won an award for a special episode that featured the China Entrepreneur Club (CEC).

Members include: Jack Ma of Alibaba, Wang Jianlin of Wanda, Liu Chuanzhi of Lenovo, Li Shufu of Geely. Tappin was the first Westerner to gain access to the CEC for interviewing Chinese CEOs for his book, \\"Secrets of Chinese CEOs\\" and \\"Dreams to Last\\". Through his unique experience, he brings to life the motivations of Chinese leaders, understanding how they tick and how to best work with them. Tappin was recently appointed as one of China's Leading Lights by the British Council and was an ambassador for the London 2012 Olympics.  Early career  Tappin began his career with the chemical giant ICI, working from the bottom-up on a fast track management scheme. ICI's fortunes turned around under the leadership of Sir John Harvey-Jones. After he left, Tappin was mentored by Sir John Harvey-Jones.Official Sir John Harvey Jones tribute website Some of the problems Tappin encountered as part a large global company convinced him that there must be a better way to lead global companies and that the starting point is the CEO. Tappin also set up his own company, Edengene, which helped large corporations set up new businesses. During this time Edengene helped British Telecom set up BT Broadband. Edengene won Management Consultancy Association Awards for Best Small Business and Best Assignment. In his late 20s and early 30s Tappin worked as a consultant and managing partner at KPMG, PA Consulting and Heidrick and Struggles. It was here he noticed these global professional services firms faced similar challenges to the major corporations they advised. This motivated Tappin to create Xinfu.
