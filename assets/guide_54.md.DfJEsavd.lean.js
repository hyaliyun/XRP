III consisted of two parts, the computor, and the sighting head, shown here. The bomb aimer looked through the glass plates to see an image of moving horizontal lines, and released the bombs when their motion matched the motion of the target. The computor for the Mk. III was very simple, with inputs for the airspeed and altitude only. The range can be read off the series of lines on the white cylinder visible through the perspex window. The Low Level Bombsight, Mark III, sometimes known as the Angular Velocity Sight, was a Royal Air Force (RAF) bombsight designed for attacks by aircraft flying below altitude. It combined components of the Mark XIV bomb sight with a new mechanical computer. It featured a unique solution for timing the drop, projecting a moving display onto a reflector sight that matched the apparent motion of the target at the right instant. The Mk. III was designed for, and mostly used by, Coastal Command aircraft in order to attack submarines. In this role, it was found to increase the chance of destroying a U-Boat by 35%, and damaging it by 60%. It also saw some use in Bomber Command on the De Havilland Mosquito in the tactical role, and in a single case, on the Avro Lancaster. It remained in use in the post-war era, equipping the Avro Shackleton throughout that aircraft's lifetime until 1991. History In 1941 Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (ORS) had been investigating Coastal Command operations against German U-Boats, which until this time had been only moderately successful at best. Comparing average bombing accuracy with the bombs being used, they suggested that a larger bomb be developed for attacking U-Boats on the surface. This study also demonstrated that the aircraft were able to aim the bombs accurately in azimuth, but they had serious problems determining the proper instant to release them. This suggested that a new bombsight dedicated to the role be developed. Early examples of the Mk. III were delivered to two squadrons. At a 16 December 1942 meeting of Coastal Command's Anti-Submarine Committee, No. 59 Squadron RAF reported that three aimers were selected to make bombing runs on a stationary target, and then again on one moving at . Of the forty-two bombs dropped on the moving target, the average range error was . In one example they demonstrated error from in a level attack, and only when dropped from while pulling up from a approach. Wing Commander G.C.C. Bartlett and his navigator Pilot Officer Longmuir stated that the sight was a great advance over previous systems. Patrick Blackett, head of the ORS, was also attending the meeting. He reported that the earlier Low Level Bombsight, Mark II produced error when flying level, as did the Mk. XIV. He suggested that both could be improved through the addition of a radio altimeter. However, others in the group were not convinced, with Air Vice-Marshal Wilfrid Oulton expressing his opinion of the Mk. XIV that he \\"never trusted that device.\\" Considering these reports, Air Chief Marshal Philip Joubert, made the Mk. III an operational requirement. However, apparently due to limited supplies, he limited its use to patrols over the Atlantic, as opposed to those taking place over the Bay of Biscay. Attacks over Biscay generally took place at night, and were carried out by eye with the aid of a Leigh Light. However, an 8 January 1944 report by the Coastal Command Development Unit reported on attempts to use the Mk. III with the Leigh Light on a Wellington, and suggested that the Mk. III be fitted to all aircraft and the bombs dropped by the light operator rather than the pilot. Strike Wings It was the problem of accurately determining range that had led both the RAF and Royal Navy to believe that torpedoes were \\"always considered to be the most effective weapon against shipping at sea.\\" This pre-war thinking proved to be largely wrong, and repeated attempts to attack convoys with torpedoes produced little result. A joint Admiralty/Air Ministry meeting on 11 June 1942 led to the formation of the Aircraft Torpedo Attack Committee to improve operations. Among several suggestions of their own, in August they contacted ORS to consider the issue as well. The ORS report was delivered in December 1942. They demonstrated that torpedoes could only be dropped from low altitudes and speeds, or risked breaking upon impact with the water. They also tended to dive after entering the water, which make them largely useless when attacking convoys hugging the shoreline in shallow waters. But most of all they were expensive, which was of little concern when attacking capital ships, but of rather questionable value against tramp steamers. They went on to suggest that bombs would be much more effective against small ships, especially if the Mark XIV bombsight was available. In one of the few wartime examples, the Air Ministry did not take all of ORS' advice. Henry Tizard sounded a contrary note in a January 1943 letter where he stated: This coincided with the introduction of the Strike Wing tactics in Coastal Command. Previously, attacks would be made by a variety of aircraft organized into loose groups, with fighter protection. Strike Wings were based on attacks by groups of identical high-speed aircraft that would arrive as a single force, make a quick attack, and then fly away. This not only eliminated the problem that the first group to arrive would alert any anti-aircraft batteries in the area to any slower aircraft soon to appear, it also made it much easier for defensive fighters to provide cover as the group flew together. These sorts of attacks began in November 1942, and were immediately successful. By early 1943, a wholesale conversion to Strike Wings was underway, with slower aircraft like the Handley Page Hampden removed from service. The introduction of Strike Wings led to some use of the Mk. III, as well as older bombsights. Late in the war, Bomber Command passed off its obsolete Handley Page Halifax bombers to Coastal Command, who re-equipped them with the Mk. III and used them in long-range strikes against German ships in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. The Mk. XIV was ultimately never used by Coastal Command in the anti-shipping role. Bomber Command Bomber Command was aware of the Mk. III through its development, and as its own operations expanded to include more tactical attacks at low level, Arthur Harris ordered it into production for Bomber Command use in October 1942. Coastal Command had priority on deliveries and only small numbers reached Bomber Command. The first examples arrived in May 1943 and were fit to Douglas Boston bombers of 2 Group. In 1944 the sight was trialled on the Avro Lancasters of No. 617 Squadron RAF, the Dambusters, who carried out a single low-level attack with them in late 1944. Most examples sent to Bomber Command equipped a small number of De Havilland Mosquito aircraft in No. 627 Squadron RAF (who normally operated as pathfinders) and No. 8 Group RAF (Pathfinder Force). Post war The Low Level sight can be seen in the bomb aimer's window of this retired South African Shackleton. The sight remained with Coastal Command after the war, equipping the Avro Shackleton through that type's lifetime until 1991. High vs. low level bombing The basic concept behind any bombsight is the determination of the range, the distance the bombs will move forward after they are dropped from the aircraft. When dropped at relatively low speeds, as in the case of World War II aircraft, the primary force on the bomb when it leaves the aircraft is gravity. Acting alone, gravity will accelerate the bomb downward, and when this is added to the initial forward velocity given to it by the motion of the aircraft, the path becomes a parabola. However, this path is modified by drag, which reduces the initial forward velocity over time, causing the path to become more vertical. In addition, the wind can move the bomb as it falls, but given the well- streamlined shapes and high density, this tends to be relatively a small effect. In typical examples of bombs dropped from altitudes of , the range will be on the order of . Simple trigonometry reveals the range angle, the angle the target appears at when the bomber is at the correct range: ::arctanleft(frac{7500}{20000}right)approx 20 text{ degrees} This angle is measured in front of the vertical line below the bomber; 20 degrees is just in front of the bomber. Conventional bombsights of the era consisted of some form of iron sight or reflector sight that was set to that angle. Since the target was well below the aircraft during the approach, typically only the bomb aimer could see it. Looking along the line extending out the front of the bombsight, they would see if the bomber was going to pass over the target, and issue corrections to the pilot if it wasn't. Once they were lined up, they waited for the target to pass through the horizontal line of the crosshairs, and released. Although the effect of the wind after the drop is small, the wind's effects on the aircraft in flight are not. Winds at typical bombing altitudes tend to be fairly strong, and it was not uncommon for there to be a wind. Compared to the aircraft's typical speed, this represents 20% of the overall velocity of the aircraft when it drops its bombs. Measuring this wind is accomplished by looking through the bombsight at objects on the ground, and then calculating the angle needed to fly to offset this motion. High-level bombsights generally spent a considerable amount of their design complexity on trying to account for the effect of wind. In the pre-war period, it was found that a significant source of error was due to the bombsight not being level with the ground when the bomb aimer was trying to sight through it. This was especially a problem during the initial part of the bomb run. In order to turn the aircraft onto the correct approach, the pilot would bank the aircraft, during which time the bombsight no longer pointed at the target. The bomb aimer had to wait until the turn was complete and the aircraft settled down to level again before they could see if the new line was correct. This led to the introduction of simple stabilizer systems, today better known as inertial platforms, to keep the sights properly levelled in the roll axis as the bomber turned, eliminating these delays. If we consider the same bomb being dropped from an aircraft travelling at low level, , the range is about 1,000 feet as well. This means that the target is at about 45 degrees at the instant of drop, and well out in front of the aircraft during the approach. In contrast to the high-altitude case, the pilot can see the target for most of the approach, and all of the approach if they start a slight dive, or glide, during the last moments, pulling up just prior to release. This eliminates the need for roll stabilization because the bombsight is no longer needed to adjust the flight path during the initial approach, instead, the sight has to be stabilized in pitch because the pilot will be pulling up right about the time to drop. Additionally, because the wind tends to be slower at low altitudes, and attack aircraft generally travel faster, the relative effect of the wind is significantly less. Moreover, the pilot can easily adjust for any cross-wind visually without help from the bombsight. For this reason, a low- level bombsight simply doesn't need the same sort of windage correction complexity and can ignore it completely in most cases. This was the case in the Low Level sight, where the only inputs were speed and altitude. Angular velocity principle Another major difference between the high and low-level cases is timing the drop. In the high-altitude case, the target is far below the aircraft and appears to be moving directly rearward. A simple crosshairs is usually all that is needed, with the range angle dialled into the sights and the bomb aimer releasing the bombs when they pass through the horizontal hairline. Because the target moves with a constant speed and relatively slowly, accurate timing is not difficult to achieve. At low altitudes, this approach does not work well. When approaching a target from low altitude it initially appears to be not moving at all, just growing larger. Later in the approach, it begins to move downward, and it is normally during this period that the bombs need to be dropped. It is only when the aircraft begins to pass over the target that it has significant rearward motion, at which point it is too late to drop the bombs. This means the bomb aimer has to release the bombs while the target was moving only slowly in the sights but accelerating, making proper timing a significant problem. This is not a minor concern; a light bomber flying at , or per second, accuracy under of a second is needed to place a bomb within its lethal range of . Consider the apparent motion of a line of telephone poles beside a road as seen from a car. At long distances, they appear to have no motion, but they grow larger as the car approaches. At closer distances, they appear to begin moving to the side, away from the car. The angular velocity of any one of the poles is a function of its distance in front of the car, the speed of the car, and the distance between the roadway and the poles. Thus, any particular angular velocity corresponds directly to a distance. In the case of an aircraft, one of the poles represents the target, the speed of the car is the aircraft's airspeed, and the distance between the road and the poles is the aircraft's altitude. The Low Level sight used this angular velocity principle to time the drop. The aircraft's altitude and the type of bomb being used were used to calculate the time that the bomb would take to reach the ground, and when that was multiplied by the airspeed, the range was produced. The ballistics did not have to be more complex than that, there simply wasn't enough time for drag to be significant. The derivative of this calculation reveals the angular velocity of an object at that range as seen from the bomber's altitude and speed. To simplify operation, all of this was carried out in a simple mechanical computer. The computer was connected to a display that showed this angular speed as a series of lines moving downwards at that angular velocity. When the target first became visible it would have little vertical speed, so the lines would be moving down the screen faster than the target. As the aircraft approaches, the target begins to move down the screen at an increasing rate. At the instant the two were equal, the bombs were dropped. Description Basic layout The Mk. III used a number of components from the Mk. XIV, as well as much of its basic layout. Like the Mk. XIV, the Mk. III was built in two separate components, the computor that calculated the range angle, and the sighting head that displayed this for the bomb aimer. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window at the front of the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was positioned on the left side of the fuselage, and two units were connected via an electrical cable. This entire sight head mechanism was mounted on the same base as the Mk. XIV, which carried a standardized mounting system that clamped onto two vertical metal rods on the left side of the sight. This system was originally designed for the Course Setting Bomb Sight, and reused for the Mk. XIV, and now the Mk. III. The mounting base also retained the system for turning the entire sighting head to the left or right, which the bomb aimer used to keep the vertical line centered on the target and to call any required corrections to the pilot if he noticed any sideways drift. Unlike the Mk. XIV, this motion was unpowered. Although the computor was much smaller than the Mk. XIV's, it too could clamp into the same fittings in the aircraft. This allowed a Mk. III and Mk. XIV to be easily swapped in the field. Internal workings The computor for the Mk. III had only two inputs, one for airspeed and the other for altitude. Both were dialled in on large wheels positioned on either end of the long rectangular cabinet. The top of the cabinet was a perspex window that displayed the calculation. The altitude wheel was connected to the main part of the calculator, a large metal cylinder marked with lines showing the time it would take for the bombs to reach the surface. The operator selected a value by rotating the cylinder with respect to fixed pointers on either end of the case. The airspeed wheel was connected to a screw that moved another pointer back and forth along the long axis of the cylinder. The tip of the pointer was positioned so it could be read against the lines on the cylinder. The cylinder carried several sets of lines to account for the ballistics of different types of bombs and the number being dropped in a group, or stick. The cylinder was also connected to an electrical mechanism that output a varying current based on the settings. This was fed into a motor on the sighting head. The motor was calibrated to turn at a fixed speed depending on the output fed to it from the computor. The motor turned a ring with lines inscribed on it, positioned in front of a projector system. The entire mechanism was housed on a large triangular case on the left of the sighting head. This was the primary mechanical difference between it and the Mk. XIV; the Mk. XIV lacked this projector. The lines were projected onto a large rectangular glass plate at the very front of the sighting head. Located directly behind this plate was a second glass plate, the main reflector sight from the Mk. XIV. This was connected to the projector housing on the left side, where it was geared to the Sperry artificial horizon from Mk. XIV, but rotated to keep the plate stable in pitch rather than roll. A handle on the left of the plate, retained from the Mk. XIV, allowed the bomb aimer to rotate it up or down to cover the target. Operation Operating the Mk. III in combat was very simple. At some point during the approach the bomb aimer would dial in the aircraft's speed and altitude; although these changed during the approach, in most cases the changes were small enough to ignore. At this point the moving lines would appear on the display. Initially, the target would be well out in front of the aircraft, so the bomb aimer would use the handle to rotate the reflector sight up. They would then use the rotating base plate to move the line left or right to cover the target, calling out any corrections needed to account for drift or the motion of the target. As the aircraft approached the target, the vertical angle would increase and the bomb aimer would account for this by rotating the sight downward progressively. Normally the drop would occur when the target was about 45 degrees below the aircraft, so this needed to be adjusted only once or twice. At some point, the motion of the lines and the target would be equal and the bombs would be released by pressing a button on the end of a flexible cable connected to the timed release system positioned to the right of the bombsight.

His work has a particular focus on German history during the nineteenth century and the opening decades of the twentieth century. His historiographical directory of Germany history, which first appeared in 1971, proved sufficiently popular to reach 16 editions by 2006. Life Winfried Baumgart was born in Streckenbach, a hamlet then administered as part of Jauer in the Lower Silesian countryside to the west of Breslau. His father was a railway official. When he was 6 his family were caught up in the ethnic cleansing that was a feature of the times, and he fled with his two brothers to the Oldenburg region in the northwest of the British zone. Here he grew up. Between 1958 and 1963 he studied History and Anglistics at Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken.

It was erected by the British Thomson-Houston Company in memory of the firm's employees who left to fight in the First World War and were killed in service. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it was unveiled in 1921 and is now a grade II* listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. The Thomson-Houston Company memorial is one of 15 War Crosses by Lutyens, all of which share a similar design. British Thomson- Houston was an engineering firm based in Rugby, majority owned by General Electric. During the First World War, the Rugby factory produced components for the Royal Navy, including signalling and radio equipment. The memorial is dedicated to the 243 company employees who were killed fighting in the First World War and was later rededicated to include 175 employees killed in the Second World War. The British Thomson-Houston memorial was one of six war memorials designed by Lutyens for a private company, the others being the large Midland Railway and North Eastern Railway memorials in Derby and York respectively, and smaller indoor memorials for Imperial Tobacco, the London Assurance Company, and Lloyd's of London.Skelton, p. 96‚Äì97. History and design View from the side showing the names inscribed on the plinth The board of the British Thomson-Houston Company met in April 1921 and delegated responsibility for commissioning a suitable war memorial to its chairman. The memorial was unveiled six months later on 29 October 1921 by Field Marshal Sir William Robertson and dedicated by the Archdeacon of Warwick. During construction, undertaken by local builders' firm J Parnell & Son Ltd, a time capsule containing information about the company and its war records was buried beneath the memorial. the total cost of erecting the memorial was ¬£3,243 (1921). Following Lutyens' War Cross design, the British Thomson- Houston Company War Memorial consists of a single cross, high in Portland stone, with short arms set near the top of the tapering shaft. The cross is moulded to a base of four uneven square steps and a square plinth, which itself sits on a diameter plinth‚Äîmaking it unusual among Lutyens' memorials. The main inscription on the monument, on the square plinth, reads \\"IN MEMORY OF THE MEN OF THE BRITISH THOMSON-HOUSTON COY WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE GREAT WARS\\", with the dates of the two world wars inscribed to either side; below is the dedication \\"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\\". The names of the fallen are recorded on the round plinth. When unveiled, the memorial sat at the former entrance to the British Thomson-Houston factory on Mill Road. The site was redeveloped in 2010 and the memorial was relocated to a site around away on Technology Drive, formerly occupied by the firm's electrical engineering works. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 13 June 2007. In October 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded. As part of this process, the British Thomson-Houston Company War Memorial was upgraded to grade II* listed building status.

The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro has begun his beatification process. Biography Guido Vidal Fran√ßa Sch√§ffer was the son of Guido Manoel Vidal Sch√§ffer and Maria Nazareth Fran√ßa Sch√§ffer. His father is a doctor and his mother is a member of the Good Shepherd Community (Catholic Charismatic Renewal). Guido grew up in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, where he learned to enjoy the beach and surfing. He studied Medicine at the Faculty Technical Educational Souza Marques (1993-1998). Made residence and later joined the medical staff of the 4th and 20th Wards of the Holy House of Mercy of Rio. He decided to become a general practitioner, specialty that allowed him to assess the patient as a whole. During his academic education he was also dedicated to care for HIV patients, at the Evandro Chagas Hospital (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Remembered for his knowledge of the Word of God and for the importance he gave to the sacraments and the use of the charisms of the Holy Spirit, Guido founded several prayer groups and held many lectures. In 1999, during a retreat at the Can√ß√£o Nova (New Song) Community, Guido heard a priest preaching the following passage: \\" Never turn your face from the poor and God will never turn his from you‚Äù (Tob 4,7). At that moment he reflected how many times he had looked away from the poor. He asked God for forgiveness and said, \\"Jesus, help me take care of the poor.\\" A week later he met the sisters of the order founded by Mother Teresa (Missionaries of Charity), whose mission is the care for the poor. He realized that God had heard his request and was giving him the direction he wanted for his medicine. He offered his work to the sisters of charity and started to meet the homeless on the streets. He organized the volunteers inviting other doctors from the Holy House of Mercy and the youth of the prayer group. When reading the book \\"The brother of Assisi\\", by Ignatius Larra√±aga, he felt called to the priesthood. Guido fulfilled the first years of preparation at the Institute of Philosophy and Theology of the Monastery of Saint Benedict of Rio de Janeiro. As an external student he conciliated the preparatory studies for the priesthood with his volunteer medical work and the preaching of God's Word. In 2008, he joined the Saint Joseph Seminary (Rio de Janeiro). Death On May 1, 2009, at thirty-four years old, Guido died, victim of an injury to the neck that caused unconsciousness and drowning while surfing at the Recreio dos Bandeirantes beach, Rio de Janeiro. The funeral mass with the body present, held the next day (May 2), chaired by the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro - now Cardinal -. Dom Orani Jo√£o Tempesta, O. Cist, in the parish of Our Lady of Copacabana, called the attention of all that attended it. The church, which was packed with about 1700 people from all locations and social classes, was attended by approximately seventy priests and three bishops. Before the coffin closed at the end of the Mass, Archbishop Orani said: \\"This church so full shows me how this young man was a good shepherd, and as I know of his desire to become a priest, I will put the stole in his hands. \\" The bishop then came down the presbytery and placed the stole in Guido‚Äôs hands, and he was buried with it. Beatification process After his death, soon reports of cures started to appear, attributed to the intercession of the young doctor, seminarian and surfer. On January 17, 2015, with permission from the Vatican, the process of beatification and canonization was initiated, by the Cardinal Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro - Dom Orani Jo√£o Tempesta.

Working for the Indian Health Service, she brought modern health care to her people and traveled throughout the U.S. to assess care given to indigenous people for the Public Health Service. Yellowtail served on many national health organizations and received many honors for her work, including the President's Award for Outstanding Nursing Health Care in 1962 and being honored in 1978 as the \\"Grandmother of American Indian Nurses\\" by the American Indian Nurses Association. She was inducted into the Montana Hall of Fame in 1987 and in 2002 became the first Native American inductee of the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame. Early life Susie Walking Bear was born on January 27, 1903 on the Crow Indian Reservation near Pryor, Montana to native parents. Her mother, Kills the Enemy or Jane White Horse was Oglala Sioux and her father, Walking Bear, was Aps√°alooke Crow. Walking Bear's father died prior to her birth and her mother remarried Stone Breast. Raised by her mother and step father, she began school at the Catholic Mission in Pryor at age eight, but was orphaned when she was twelve and sent to the Indian Boarding School in Lodge Grass, Montana. In 1919, she accompanied a missionary, Francis Shaw, to Denver, for a Baptist convention, and though she had been promised she could return to the Crow school, she was sightseeing when her group returned to Montana. Shaw suggested that Walking Bear accompany her to Muskogee, Oklahoma and continue her schooling at Bacone Indian School. When Walking Bear completed her eighth grade studies, Shaw, then Mrs. Clifford Field, brought her to Northfield, Massachusetts and paid the tuition for Walking Bear to attend Northfield Seminary. Walking Bear worked as a nanny and maid while attending school to be able to pay her own room and board. The arduous schedule, cultural intolerance by the school administration which insisted she use the surname of \\"Bear\\", and suspicion of her employers was difficult for Walking Bear. In 1923, she applied to work at the Tall Pines Girl's Camp in Bennington, New Hampshire, planning on leaving Northfield permanently. She was accepted at the Franklin County Public Hospital in Greenfield, Massachusetts in 1924 to study nursing with Dr. Halbert G. Stetson and completed her internship at Boston General Hospital. Graduating in 1927, Walking Bear became the first registered nurse of Crow descent and one of the first Native American nurses graduated in the United States, though Elizabeth Sadoques Mason a full-blooded Abenaki and her sister Maude, obtained registration in New York State before Yellowtail. Elizabeth obtained her RN certificate in 1919, while Maude became a nurse probably in 1914. and Nancy Cornelius (later Skenandore) of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin graduated from the Hartford Training School for Nurses in 1890. Lula Owl Gloyne of the Eastern Band Cherokee Indian tribe graduated from Chestnut Hill Hospital School of Nursing in Philadelphia in 1916 and passed the registration exam in Pennsylvania the same year. She was a 1rst Lieutenant in the US Army in WWI. Career Graduating in September 1927, she returned briefly to the Public Hospital in Greenfield before taking a position in a private nursing facility in Oklahoma. Later she did home health nursing among the Chippewa of Minnesota, before returning to the Crow reservation. In 1929, Walking Bear married Thomas Yellowtail, who would become a spiritual leader in their tribe. Her first assignment in Montana was at the Indian Health Service's Hospital at the Crow Agency. For two years, she worked on the reservation to modernize the health services offered to her tribe and fight the forced sterilization of Native American women. Between 1930 and 1960, Yellowtail served as a consultant, traveling throughout the country and documenting problems in the Indian Health Service (IHS), like inadequate numbers of facilities, inability of non-native nurses to speak with their patients from a culturally sensitive perspective or in their native language, unsanitary living conditions, barriers to help from traditional healers, health care only being available from IHS to Indians living on reservations and many other concerns. Bureaucrats in Washington were aware of the failures of the IHS and from the early 1940s relied on Yellowtail's assessments of both the needs and challenges of the system. She served on an advisory committee for the Division of Indian Health (DIH) to assist sanitation engineers in relaying to tribal members the importance of hygiene and sanitation in combating disease. DIH projects provided water supply, sewage disposal and garbage disposal for homes and it was the committee member's job to interface with homeowners and explain the importance of maintaining the systems as well as the benefits of them. During this time, Yellowtail was also active with several cultural events. She was a dancer in a troupe, the Crow Indian Ceremonial Dancers, led by Donald Deernose. Other members, besides Yellowtail and her husband and Deernose and his wife Agnes, were Lloyd Littlehawk, Henry and Stella Old Coyote, Henry Rides the Horse, and Fred Two Warriors. The group began a European tour in 1953, performing in Algeria, Denmark, England, Holland, Israel, Luxembourg, Morocco, and Turkey. Yellowtail and the other dancers toured in Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden and spent an entire month in Paris performing to sold-out houses in 1954. Returning from the tour in 1955, the troupe performed at a benefit of the Montana Institute of the Arts for the Montana Historical Society. Yellowtail also served as the official chaperone for Miss Indian America from its inception into the 1970s. Yellowtail was awarded the President‚Äôs Award for Outstanding Nursing by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. In 1965, she was named Mrs. American Indian at the American Indian Youth Conference held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1968, she was appointed to serve a four-year term on the Public Health Service's Advisory Committee on Indian Health. In 1970, she was one of five featured speakers in a Health, Education and Welfare documentary concerning the services provided to indigenous communities by the Indian Health Service. That same year, at the All-American Indian Days festival in Sheridan, Wyoming, Yellowtail and her husband were honored as the \\"Outstanding Indian of the Year\\" for their leadership and public services to the Native American Community. In 1972, Yellowtail was reappointed by Governor Forrest H. Anderson to serve on the State Advisory Council for Vocational Education. She stressed the need for native education so that Indians could compete for jobs. She also voiced concern that native people needed to train for service sector jobs, like lawyers, doctors, nurses, and teachers so that children and adults had access to help from people who understood their culture. Yellowtail also served on the National Alcohol and Drug Abuse Committee and was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve on the Council on Indian Health, Education and Welfare and the federal Indian Health Advisory Committee. She founded the first professional association of Native American nurses and in 1978, was honored by the American Indian Nurses Association as the \\"Grandmother of American Indian Nurses\\". Yellowtail died on Christmas Day, 1981 at her home in Wyola, Montana. Posthumously, she was inducted in 1987 into the Montana Hall of Fame and in 2002 to the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame as the first Native American inductee.

Created in 1990, it was one of the first such reserves in Brazil. The residents extract rubber, nuts and other products in the dry season and farm or work outside the reserve in the rainy season, when large areas are flooded. Houses are built on stilts to avoid flooding and discourage animals from entering. Location The Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Guajar√°-Mirim (73.45%) and Nova Mamor√© (26.55%) in Rond√¥nia. It has an area of . The BR-421 federal highway runs east from the town of Guajar√°-Mirim on the Bolivian border, and enters the north part of the reserve. The reserve occupies the basin of the Ouro Preto River between two parallel east-west ranges of hills. It extends westward along the course of the Ouro Preto to where it joins the Paca√°s Novos River, which forms the western boundary of the reserve. Altitudes range from above sea level. The reserve is part of the largest block of environmentally protected land in the state, and forms a buffer between the cleared and farmed areas and the strictly protected forest areas. The Guajar√°-Mirim State Park lies to the north of the eastern part of the extractive reserve, the Rio Ouro Preto Biological Reserve lies in the hills to the south of the eastern part, and the Rio Paca√°s Novos Extractive Reserve lies to the south of the western part. History The Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve was created by decree 99.166 of 13 March 1990. It is administered by the federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The reserve is classified as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). The extractive reserve is used by the traditional populations who live by extraction of forest products as well as subsistence agriculture and small-scale animal husbandry, It protects their livelihood and culture while ensuring sustainable use of the natural resources. The Rio Ouro Preto reserve was one of the first four such units to be created in Brazil. On 5 September 2003 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria recognised that the reserve had the capacity for 109 families with access to PRONAF support. This was adjusted more than once, rising to 178 families on 16 October 2006. The deliberative council was created on 22 November 2006. In December 2010 the Association of Rubber Tappers and Agro-Extractivists was recognised as controlling the reserve. The usage plan was approved on 19 February 2013, and the management plan was approved on 20 August 2014. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The reserve has varied relief with many springs, rivers and bayous. Average annual rainfall is . The Ouro Preto water levels vary by over between the lowest level in September-October and the highest level in the middle of the rainy season in March. In the rainy season the river spills over its banks and floods the forest with dark water due to suspended organic matter. In the dry season it retreats between its banks and takes a greenish color. Navigation by larger vessels become difficult. Temperatures range from with an average of . Vegetation includes open forest, open forest with palms, pioneer dry land and flooded forest and open arboreal savanna. Most of the soils have low agricultural potential apart from some areas of rich black earth that were created by pre-colonial indigenous farmers. There is great biodiversity, with the greatest number of bird species in the state. The most economically valuable plants species are the Ita√∫ba, Ma√ßaranduba, Sorva, Caucho, Copaiba, Seringueira and Castanheira. Economy The reserve is home to about 500 people. Houses are built on stilts, both to protect against flooding and to prevent entry of animals. The walls and floors are made of paxi√∫ba palms and the roofs are thatched. Rubber extraction provides half the monthly income of each family. Agriculture is the next most valuable activity, followed by animal husbandry, hunting and fishing. Rubber is collected and processed in the summer months from July to December, mainly from the Hevea brasiliensis and the Hevea benthamiana. Brazil nuts are mainly collected from December to February. There are few areas of unflooded land near the rubber allotments, but these are planted with maize, rice, beans and other crops. Some families have \\"rubber paths\\" in one place and a winter residence in another, with a garden. Others move to the cities, mainly Guajar√°-Mirim, for temporary jobs in the summer.

Biography  photo by Hallgeir B Skjelstad John Philip Busby was born in Bradford in 1928 and attended Ilkley Grammar School. After National Service, he studied at Leeds College of Art and then at Edinburgh College of Art, ECA, where he was awarded post-graduate and major travel scholarships. On return from France and Italy he was invited to join the staff of ECA, where he taught drawing and painting from 1956 until 1988. In 1959 he was commissioned to paint the mural Christ in Glory in the Scottish Episcopal Church, St. Columbas-by-the-Castle in Edinburgh which was influenced by his travels and informed by his personal Christian faith. Busby was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy of Arts and Architecture (RSA) and the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, RSW, and served as President of the Society of Scottish Artists, from 1976 to 1979. A life-long bird watcher and naturalist, (at age 17 he was at the inaugural meeting of the Wharfedale Naturalists Society in 1945) he was a founder member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, SWLA. Having led courses in Switzerland, Crete, the Falklands and Galapagos Islands, in Orkney and at Nature in Art in Gloucestershire, in 1989 Busby began a Seabird Drawing course based at North Berwick which has continued each year since, attracting participants from many parts of the world. He took part in projects with the Artists for Nature Foundation (ANF) in Holland, Poland, Spain, Ireland, India, Portugal and Israel, and in SWLA/Forestry Commission projects in the New Forest and in the oak woods in the west of Scotland. In 1991 he was filmed in Shetland for the STV production Portrait of the Wild ‚Äì Summer. Busby illustrated over 35 books about birds and animals, mostly about behaviour, ranging from seabirds to tigers, garden birds to otters, and also a book of poems Wild Horses by Kenneth Steven. He created many of the illustrations in The RSPB Anthology of Wildlife Poetry. His own books ranged from a study of the art of Eric Ennion (The Living Birds of Eric Ennion 1982 Victor Gollancz), two editions of Drawing Birds for the RSPB (1986 and 2004), the limited edition Nature Drawings (1992 Arlequin Press), the more autobiographical Land Marks and Sea Wings (2005 Wildlife Art Gallery), and Lines from Nature (2016, Langford Press published posthumously). The book which summed up his whole approach to nature and art was the 2013 Looking at Birds ‚Äì An Antidote to Field Guides where he suggested that aspiring artists (and birdwatchers) could 'twitch' a single species, maybe \\"collecting shapes of blackbird\\". In 2009 Busby was declared Master Wildlife Artist by the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wisconsin USA. A much celebrated wildlife artist, Busby was also a dedicated landscape painter whose work was often executed in bold colours, in styles ranging from highly representational to near abstract. Views of the land from above ‚Äì a bird's eye view ‚Äì seemed to fascinate him and the expansiveness of the sky also held great appeal, becoming very nearly the sole subject of some paintings. Birds feature in many of the paintings and it's clear that the concept of habitat and territory was a rich seam of study. One long running series was of the rockpools at Tyninghame in East Lothian. The interplay of shapes, whether of man-made irrigation circles or transient cloudscapes featured often. 'Landscape in a Granite Rock II' was recreated as a tapestry by the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh. Busby exhibited widely both at home and abroad and had a major retrospective exhibition at Bradford City Art Gallery in 1999/2000. A retrospective exhibition was held at Nature in Art, Glos. in August 2015, and two major exhibitions were held in June 2016 at the Royal Scottish Academy and concurrently at The Scottish Gallery. An exhibition entitled John Busby; Friends and Influences was the final exhibition held at the Wildlife Art Gallery, Lavenham, in November and December 2016. He lived near Ormiston in East Lothian, married to the mezzo-soprano and singing teacher Joan Busby. Music was an abiding passion and he was a life-long Christian. He died in Edinburgh in June 2015.

Boulton held positions at the American Museum of Natural History and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and traveled widely on expeditions to Africa. With his first wife, ethnomusicologist Laura Boulton, he made the first recordings of African tropical bird calls. Boulton was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the Second World War because of his knowledge of Africa and his experience in foreign travel. He was responsible for monitoring the supply of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo for the Manhattan Project. Boulton transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947 and resigned in 1958. Boulton moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1959 with his third wife and established the Atlantica Foundation, a charitable organization to encourage the study of African birds. The foundation received funding from the CIA and Boulton was later interviewed by Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation over his links to the organization. Atlantica lost much of its funding following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and Boulton closed the foundation in 1978. He died in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia). Early life and career W. Rudyerd Boulton was born in Beaver, Pennsylvania, on April 5, 1901. His first name is given variously as Wolfrid and Wilfred but was generally not used, being known as \\"W. Rudyerd Boulton\\", \\"Rudyerd Boulton\\" or \\"Rud\\". He joined the American Ornithologists' Union at around the age of 15 ‚Äì he would remain a member for the whole of his life. He attended Amherst College and then the University of Pittsburgh, from which he graduated with Bachelor of Science degree in 1924. Immediately after graduation Boulton was made research assistant at the American Museum of Natural History's ornithology department. He was a participant of Arthur Stannard Vernay's 1925 expedition to Angola and in the same year married the ethnomusicologist Laura Boulton (n√©e Crayton). Boulton transferred to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1926 as assistant curator of birds and in 1929 joined the Sarah Lavanburg Straus expedition to Nyasaland (Malawi), Uganda and Kenya. In the course of this, with his wife, he made the first ever recordings of the calls of African tropical birds. Boulton was also a member of the 1929‚Äì30 Carnegie Museum African expedition and the 1930-31 Vernay-Lang Kalahari Expedition. In 1931 Boulton was appointed assistant curator at the Field Museum of Natural History and, the same year, accompanied Ralph Pulitzer on his expedition to Angola. During the expedition he discovered a previously unknown species of warbler that he named in honour of his wife. In 1933 he published a children's book entitled Travelling with the Birds. Boulton was a member of the 1934 Field Museum-Straus expedition that traveled 12,900 km from Dakar to Cameroon via Nigeria and later took part in expeditions to Panama, the West Indies and the Galapagos Islands. Boulton was promoted to curator of birds in 1937, a position he retained until 1946. He separated from his wife in 1938 and remarried four years later to Inez Cunningham Stark, an heiress, poet and patron of the arts. In 1948 he donated extensive film documentation of his research expeditions to the Field Museum. OSS/CIA career Boulton was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services, which was then the US intelligence agency, in 1942 due to his knowledge of Africa and overseas experience. He was appointed divisional deputy for Africa in the Secret Intelligence Branch. Boulton was responsible, from 1943, for co-coordinating a joint program with the X-2 Counter Espionage Branch to monitor the supply of uranium ore, vital to the success of the Manhattan Project, which was primarily obtained from the Belgian Congo. Despite his experience, Boulton was based primarily in Washington, DC, only once leaving the country ‚Äì to visit North Africa in 1944. During the war Adolph W. Schmidt, later to be the American ambassador to Canada, served as one of his intelligence officers. By February 1946 Boulton had become head of the Secret Intelligence Branch's Africa division and had to resign from his position at the Carnegie so that he could focus on his work for the government, although he remained a research associate of the museum. He transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency when it was established as the successor to the OSS in 1947. An ornithological expedition Boulton undertook in North Africa in 1952 may have been funded by the CIA as cover for an operation, or if not, by his wife. A further expedition to Southern Rhodesia and Angola in 1957 was funded by the Carnegie Museum. Boulton resigned from the CIA in April 1958, the same year his wife died. Rhodesia Boulton married for the third and final time in April 1959 to Louise Rehm, the widow of a former OSS colleague. Within months the couple had moved to Southern Rhodesia where they founded the Atlantica Foundation, a charitable organization to encourage ornithologists, particularly students, to study the birds of Africa. Boulton had a farm near Lake McIlwaine which housed an extensive art collection that was exhibited at the Rhodes National Gallery in December 1960. He sold some of his art, including works by Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee to fund the work of Atlantica. Boulton and his wife made frequent donations to the organization, contributing fully one third of their wealth to it, and it also received financial support from the CIA. The foundation funded scholarships at Nyatsime College and donated books to more than 100 educational establishments. In addition to his work at the foundation Boulton was managing editor of Rhodesia Science News and president of the Rhodesia Scientific Association. He also assisted with early conservation projects in the region to the south-west of Lusaka, which was established as Lochinvar National Park in 1972, and experimented with farming termites as a nutritional foodstuff. Boulton carried out expeditions with a mobile laboratory to the Kalahari Desert in Tanzania. The laboratory included advanced listening equipment and map-making tools, which he may well have used to carry out surveys for the CIA. Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation was suspicious of Boulton's CIA connections and advanced equipment and he was interviewed by them. Boulton lost his international funding following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and the introduction of US sanctions in 1967. As a result, Atlantica was forced to heavily reduce its programs. It may well be that the Boultons would have left the increasingly isolated Rhodesia if Louise was able to, but she was struck by blindness and senility and required 24-hour care. Louise died in 1974 and two years later Boulton returned to the United States to manage the process of closing Atlantica. He transferred the remaining funds to the Conservation Trust of Rhodesia in 1978. The Atlantica properties were used to educate students from within the country and from Mozambique by the new black- majority government of Zimbabwe (which Rhodesia had been renamed). Boulton suffered two strokes in later life and was a wheelchair user. He died on January 24, 1983, in Zimbabwe.

She has served as president of Femmes autochtones du Qu√©bec (Quebec Native Women) and the Native Women's Association of Canada. She served from 2004 through 2008 as Associate Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Relations with Citizens and Immigration of the Quebec government, where she was in charge of the Secretariat for Women. In 2017, she was appointed as one of the five commissioners of the government's national inquiry: Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.  Life  Audette's mother was returning to Schefferville by train when she unexpectedly went into labour. The train stopped and her mother was airlifted by helicopter to the nearest hospital, in Wabush, Labrador, where Audette was born. She grew up in Schefferville, Maliotenam, and Montreal. Her mother, Evelyne St-Onge, is Innu and her father, Gilles Audette, is French-Canadian from Montreal. The family was denied a house on her mother's reserve under federal law because her mother married a non-Native man. St-Onge was a co-founder of Quebec Native Women (FAQ), which fought against the clause in the federal Indian Act that stated that a Native woman who marries a non-Native man did not have the right to live in her reserve community. Native men who marry non-Native women do not suffer such restrictions. As Audette grew up, she too became an activist in indigenous affairs. She worked to raise awareness and gain government action on the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. She served as president of Femmes autochtones du Qu√©bec (FAQ), then led the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). She also acted in one of the short film vignettes on Canadian history known as Heritage Minutes as a member of an Attikamek family teaching early French settlers how to make maple syrup. Audette was appointed as Associate Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Relations with Citizens and Immigration Quebec government, in charge of the Secretariat for Women, serving from 2004 through 2008.

His poetry, spanning the period c.1420 to c. 1470, has been fully edited.Taylor, John Bernard, 'Cipolwg ar Waith Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf', Dwned 22 (2016), 11 - 24. The earliest dateable poem that can be confidently assigned to him are a cywydd in praise of Gwilym ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym ap Gruffudd ap Heilin (d. 1431) and his newly built home, Y Penrhyn, Llandyg√°i (built c. 1420Jones, J. R., 'The development of the Penrhyn estate to 1431' (M.A. thesis, University of Wales, 1955), 217.). The context of this poem seems to be the tradition of the'cyff cl√™r', with Ieuan, a 'prifardd', answering the taunts of lesser bards. Rhys Goch Eryri was present at the celebration and composed a perhaps more well-known praise poem to Y Penrhyn and its owner.Bowen, D. J., 'Y Canu i Gwilym ap Gruffudd (m. 1431) o'r Penrhyn a'i Fab Gwilym Fychan (m. 1483)', Dwned, 8 (2002), 59 - 78. Shortly after this, Ieuan composed a cywydd satiring the River Llugwy, into which the poet fell on his way to Y Penrhyn one Christmas. A cywydd to Saint Anna, mother of the Virgin Mary and two other daughters also named Mary, attributed to Ieuan in the only manuscript in which it survives, could also be from the same period or earlier. Dating to around 1450 is a cywydd by Ieuan in praise of Hywel ab Ieuan Fychan ab Ieuan Gethin and his wife Elen of Moelyrch, Llansilin. Moelyrch was destroyed during the Glynd≈µr Rising, probably at the same time as nearby Sycharth, the home of Owain Glynd≈µr himself, and the poem celebrates the rebuilding of Hywel's home.Huws, Bleddyn Owen, 'Ailadeiladu Bywyd ar √¥l Gwrthryfel Glynd≈µr: Tystiolaeth y Canu i Foelyrch', Dwned 13 (2007), 97 - 137. This was almost certainly the occasion of the 'ymryson' (bardic contention) between Guto'r Glyn (who was also present at the celebration and presented a praise poem there) and Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf. Dafydd ap Siencyn ap Dafydd ab y Crach, a man of great stature and daring, was an 'uchelwr' who supported the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses. Ieuan composed a praise poem to Dafydd while the latter was an outlaw on Carreg y Gwalch above Llanrwst. This poem probably dates to the 1460s. Dafydd succeeded in keeping the Yorkist forces out of Nantconwy until 1468. Also probably dating to the 1460s is a poem by Ieuan in praise of the plantation town of Aberconwy and its beer. Although a number of 'cywyddau brud' are attributed to Ieuan by some copiers, there is only one for which the attribution can be regarded as reasonably secure, and this is a cywydd in the form of a conversation between the bard and eog Llyn Llyw, one of the 'oldest animals'. It is difficult to date this poem from the content. Ieuan ap Gruffudd Leiaf had two sons, Robert Leiaf and Syr Si√¥n Leiaf.

Their leaves may be partly cut, into lobes, or fully divided into pinnae. Their veins are at most a few times forked, and lack hydathodes. Each lobe or pinna of a fertile leaf bears a single sorus near the tip; the edges of the lobes or pinnae are rolled under and fused near the tip to protect the sorus. Leaf hairs may be single setae (bristles), single catenate hairs (consisting of chains of cells), or branched catenate hairs, with setae for branches.

Within the shrine is the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Graces, transferred from the ransack of Constantinople and ultimately crowned by Pope Pius VII in 10 December 1822. History A church at the site, but smaller and in a different orientation, was erected in 1478, patronized by the last will of Prince Taddeo d'Este. The original church was located outside of the city walls in association with a Dominican convent. The church was rebuilt starting in 1717 with a single nave. In 1736, demolition of the old church began, and led to discovery of a fresco depicting the Piet√†, which became a source of veneration. In 1745 most of the interiors were complete. In 1770, however the monastic order was suppressed in Este, and the Dominicans expelled. By 1776, the church had been reconsecrated as parish church for the frazione of San Martino. Further work, including the construction of the octagonal dome was pursued, and completed in 1889 using designs by the architect Giuseppe Riccoboni. In 1924, the church was conceded the title of a basilica by Pope Pius IX. Interiors The new main altar was inaugurated by Girolamo Bortignon in 1950. In 1965, a fire devastated the Sacristy. The interior houses in the apse, the main altarpiece depicting a Byzantine (Cretan) icon of the Madonna of the Graces, given to Este by the Venice. A finely carved wooden choir stall is arrayed below in U-shape. The church also contains an altarpiece depicting the Martyrdom of St Sebastian (circa 1700) by Alberto Calvelli. Along the nave are niches with 15 stone sculptures of saints, prophets and allegories, sculpted by Pietro Zandomeneghi (1806‚Äì1866) and Valentino Panciera, called Besarel.La patria; geografia dell' Italia: Provincie di Verona, Vicenza, e Padova, by Gustavo Chiesi, Luigi Borsari, Giuseppe Isidoro Arneudo, (1903), main editor: Gustavo Straforello, page 436. The statues are meant to have presaged or relate to the Life of Virgin: they include Amos, Daniel David, Debora, Anne, Elisabeth, John the Baptist, Simeon, Maria Soror Moysis, Castitas (chastity), Costantia (constance), Oratio (prayer), and Humilitas (humility). The nave has eight slightly indented side altars and two chapels. The altarpieces of St Dominic and St Thomas Acquinas were painted by Antonio Zanchi. The altar of the Holiest Sacrament is made of polychrome marble. The center of the nave has a late-19th century fresco depicting the Coronation of the Virgin by Giovanni Battista Baldi. Baldi also painted the four evangelists in the spandrels of the dome, as well as the medallions along the nave depicting the doctors of the church (Leo the Great, Ambrosius, Augustine, and Jerome) and four allegories of virtues (justice, strength, temperance, and prudence). A canvas depicting the Consignment of the icon to the Dominicans (circa 1700) was painted by Nicola Grassi.Santa Maria Delle Grazie, official website.

Biography Pratt was born at London, England, on 9 August 1872, the son of Joseph and Jane Pratt. He was educated at London at the South Kensington School of Art before emigrating to Canada in 1891 and to Manitoba the next year. He worked as an architectural and engineering draftsman for the Canadian Pacific Railway at Winnipeg from 1895 to 1901, during which he created a standard plan for a station which was used at Virden, Manitoba, and other locations. Pratt then worked for the Canadian Northern Railway from 1901 to 1906. He created the first standard design 3rd Class station for the Canadian Northern in 1901, and other standard plans. Although Pratt left the Canadian Pacific in 1901, and the Canadian Northern in 1906, he continued to receive commissions from the railroads for other work, and both railroads continued to use the standard plans he had created, so the design of later stations is often attributed to him. Pratt formed the architectural partnership Pratt and Ross with Donald Aynsley Ross in 1906, specializing in structural and civil engineering projects. Pratt was a Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, served as president of the Manitoba Association of Architects from 1917 to 1919, and was a member of the Railway Engineering Association. Pratt married Euphemia Maude Monnington (1874‚Äì1977) on October 23, 1900, at Winnipeg. They had three children: George Ralph Monnington Pratt (1901‚Äì1983), Olive Maude Grace Pratt (1904‚Äì2004, wife of Herbert Carey), and Camden James Charles Pratt (1915‚Äì1984). In 1911, the family lived at 261 Carlton Street, Winnipeg. His recreations included canoeing and skating. He was a member of the Anglican church. He died at Saint Boniface, Winnipeg, on March 14, 1950, and was buried in the St. John's Cemetery.

It has a single hairy leaf and one or two yellow, cream-coloured or pinkish flowers. It is a variable species, similar to the Joseph's spider orchid (C. polychroma) but has a more northerly distribution and smaller flowers.Caladenia dimidia habitCaladenia dimidia close-up of labellum  Description  Caladenia dimidia is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows as a solitary plant or in small clumps. It has a single, erect, linear, hairy leaf, long and wide. The leaf is pale green and has purple-red blotches near its base. One or two yellow to cream-coloured, sometimes pinkish flowers, with dark maroon markings are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers are long and wide. The bases of the sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped and held stiffly for about one-third, then suddenly narrow to a dark brown, densely glandular thread-like section. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide at the base and has its edges slightly turned inwards. The lateral sepals are spreading and downcurved, long and wide at the base and are inclined downwards. The petals are long and wide at the base, spread widely near the base then incline downwards. The labellum is white or pale yellow with maroon stripes, spots and blotches. It is comparatively small, diamond-shaped, long and wide and curves downward at the front. The sides of the labellum curve upwards and have a fringe of small teeth decreasing in size towards the front of the labellum. There are 6 to 14 creamy-white or pale pink, narrow anvil-shaped calli in two rows in the centre of the labellum for at least half of its length. Flowering occurs from July to late September. This species is similar to Caladenia polychroma but its flowers, especially its labellum is smaller. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia dimidia was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected by Hopper south-east of Hyden. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (dimidia) is Latin word meaning \\"half\\" referring to the characters of this species being half-way between those of C. polychroma and C. paradoxa.  Distribution and habitat  The chameleon orchid is a common orchid in the eastern wheatbelt from near Paynes Find to near Ravensthorpe in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in a range of habitats that are generally wet in winter. Conservation Caladenia dimidia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The series premiered on February 21, 2020, on Netflix. A second season premiered on August 17, 2020. Premise Glitch Techs centers on teens Hector \\"(High) Five\\" Nieves and Miko \\"Me-K.O.\\" Kubota in the city of Bailley, where a group of people is secretly dealing with glitches that cause video game characters to manifest as energy beings into the real world that operate based on the coding of their affected games and thus create havoc. To stop such Glitches, these Glitch Techs, working at a local game store as a front, must use their gamer logic with their equipment to counter and win. After capturing and/or destroying the Glitches, they must also fix any damage and erase any memories in order to prevent further panic. Now, after unexpectedly becoming the newest Glitch Techs, High Five and Miko will have to use their skills as gamers to help out. Cast Bailley Glitch Techs =Dream Team= * Ricardo Hurtado as Hector \\"High Five\\" Nieves/Hi-5, one of the two main characters. An avid gamer with confidence issues who grows with Miko's friendship. Hector learned his gaming and computer skills from his father, Emilio, and continues to call him in prison weekly. ** Liam Ramos voices a young Five * Monica Ray as Miko Kubota/Me-K.O./„ÉüK.O., one of the two main characters. A sporadic gamer with energy to spare, she brings Five and herself into the Glitch Techs after remembering a Glitch event. She has bested Five in numerous online co-op games, and is also the only known person that is somehow impervious to the Glitch Tech's memory resetting. =Mitch Squad= * Luke Youngblood as Mitch Williams, a.k.a. MitchFTW, the number one Hinobi gamer in the city of Bailley. He is Five's and Miko's inhospitable and egotistical senior Glitch Tech who tends to abuse his authority, but does have a good side to him. He is later revealed to be the youngest of a four-sibling video game stream-team who gave up his gaming career to focus on his job at Hinobi. * Sandeep Parikh as Haneesh, one of the senior Glitch Techs. He is a proficient hacker and skilled Raid player. * Zehra Fazal as Zahra, one of the senior Glitch Techs. She is a skilled support type specialist, aloof, and willing to casually give an honest answer. In the episode \\"BUDS,\\" she is implied to have a crush on Five. * Greg Nix as Nix, a senior Glitch Tech who mentors and is partner to Bergy during the 'Castle Crawl' mission. He works publicly at the Joystick Junior Arcade to monitor the location, as it is a hotbed for frequent Glitch activity; often failing to spread his cool nickname \\"Scorekeeper.\\" =Bailley HQ Techs= * Scott Kreamer as Phil Altiere, the Glitch supervisor and trainer for the Bailley branch of Hinobi. Having an exhausted but calm demeanor when at peace, he has the experience needed to guide his trainees. In \\"BITT Prime\\", Phil ends up finding a secret file hidden in BITT. He subsequently finds it was made by his younger self, containing a recording that reveals Hinobi Corporate has repeatedly wiped his memory due to unknown circumstances, and other information that apparently could be helpful in the future. His last name is revealed in the same episode. * Dan Milano as BITT, the Binary Intelligence Tech Trainer, which serves as Phil's robotic assistant, personal data drive, and information provider for Five and Miko. In the episode \\"BITT Prime\\", BITT is discovered to store very important information about Phil's past. ** Milano also voices Miko and Five's pet Glitches Ally and Alpha, as well as other computers and glitches. In season two he voices Jimmy Alcorn, the owner of the Joystick Junior Arcade where Glitches frequently appear. * Josh Sussman as Bergy, another noob of Glitch Techs and a fast friend to Hi-5 and Me-K.O. after they join him on an XP Quest. He is often around for comedic relief and the butt of most everyone's jokes. * Felicia Day as Emma, a specialist in training companion pets for Glitch Techs. She views companion pet Glitches as living things, and teaches Miko and Five to reassess how they treat their companion pets. Dabney Glitch Techs * Jane Lynch as Joan Fishback, the supervisor for the Hinobi branch from Bailley's neighboring town Dabney.

Hinobi Corporate * Betsy Sodaro as Inspector 7, \\"Bookworm\\" Barbara. A former Glitch Tech from Phil's time, she inspects his store to ensure it operates within desired ranges. Covertly, she is to monitor Miko primarily due to her immunity to memory reset, and Five as well being her friend. * Fred Tatasciore as the Tech Specialist, a Hinobi agent mainly assigned to Perma-Ban players who abuse Hinobi products that routinely cause glitches. His design is partially inspired by Tatasciore's gaming voice over role as \\"Soldier: 76\\" in Overwatch. Other characters =Five's family= * Eric Lopez as Papi, Five's grandfather and owner of a Taco food truck. ** Lopez also voices Emilio Nieves, Papi's son and Five's father.

Her voice and design is based on Lupe from Eric Robles' animated series, Fanboy and Chum Chum. * Roshon Fegan as Casino, an old friend of Five's whom the latter separated from for a few years, but then reunited in \\"Smashozaurs\\". ** Dallas Young voices a young Casino * Cree Summer as Geraldine Lawson, an old friend of Five's father, Emilio Nieves, and the owner of a retro-gaming store, Game Kingdom. * Nathan Arenas as Mike Simms, a new kid in town with gamer skills on par with or rivaled against Miko's. After a rough first meeting and a competitive dance off that almost got out of hand, Mike decided to become friends with Miko. Ridley also mentioned to have had a grudge against him. * Johnny Young as Ryu Simms, Mike's older brother. * Amanda McCann as Blake, a drive-thru attendant at Mama Miyamoto's Spaghetti in a Bucket. She is implied to be attracted to Bergy. * Ashly Burch as Ridley, a hacker/modder who discovered Hinobi Glitches by experimenting on her personal console and modifies them to be docile pets. She is shown to have extensive trust issues and has panic episodes at the slightest feeling of \\"betrayal\\" from others. While initially a good acquaintance to Miko on their initial meeting, Ridley came to distrust her thinking she just wanted her to be \\"normal\\" like everyone else around her. She eventually does befriend Miko and Five, however, and even manages to gain Mitch's respect, who spares her from having her memory wiped.

He became director of the capital city's higher normal school in 1898, serving for a brief period of time. While in Ia»ôi, Quintescu belonged to Junimea society, contributing to its Convorbiri Literare journal, but came into conflict with other members due to disagreements over philology.

The Van Spanckerens were brothers who, along with their mother, Catharina Reerink Van Spanckeren and two other siblings emigrated from the Netherlands in the 1840s. Catharina bought property in Pella in 1849, which she divided into three parcels and sold to her three sons.

The shared wall of this two- story brick house is on the property line. with Both houses were divided into two units. In 505 both units were separate apartments. American frontier lawman Wyatt Earp spent 14 years of his boyhood in this row house. In 507, the upstairs was an apartment while the downstairs housed J.H.H.'s general store. Both houses were owned by separate owners until 1966. Dutch building techniques were utilized in the construction of both houses. They include the use of beam anchors, which are similar to tie rods, a floor system where the flooring rests on top of the floor joists without the use of a subfloor, the double hung windows on the second floor in 505 with the unique three over six configuration, and an economy of space that is provided in a rowhouse that was a rarity in Pella.

It protects an area of savanna forest and transition into rainforest. It is in an area where there is great pressure from loggers and ranchers. A road was illegally cut through the park, apparently by loggers supported by local politicians. This received federal approval after the fact, since it provides access to areas otherwise cut off by flooding of the Madeira River. Location The Guajar√°-Mirim State Park is divided between the Rond√¥nia municipalities of Nova Mamor√© (97.67%) and Guajar√°-Mirim (2.33%). It has an area of . The BR-421 Federal highway forms part of the northern boundary of the park. To the southwest it adjoins the Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve. To the east it adjoins the Paca√°s Novos National Park. There are two support bases on the banks of the Formoso River that are used by researchers and inspection teams. A road crosses the park and areas along the Corrente stream have been deforested, but there are no inhabitants. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Although much of the park is protected, the surrounding areas of Campo Novo de Rond√¥nia and Buritis are under great pressure. Environment The park covers parts of the Guapor√© plateau and the southern Amazon depression, with altitudes of . The park holds tributaries of the Jaci Paran√° River basin. Soils include red-yellow podzols, rocky outcrops, lithic soils and quartz sands. Vegetation is 60% savanna and 12% savanna-rainforest contact. There are estimated to be about 500 species of birds, including some that are threatened elsewhere by hunting. Between 40 and 50 species of amphibians have been recorded, similar to other Amazon regions. History The Guajar√°-Mirim State Park was created by decree 4.575 of 23 March 1990 with an area of about under the administration of the Instituto Estadual de Florestas of Rond√¥nia. The limits were revised by law 700 of 27 December 1996, with the area reduced to . Clear land titles had been proved for the that was lost. The limits were again revised by law 1.146 of 12 December 2002, with the area expanded to . The 2002 law excluded of the northern tip of the park to make way for the federal highway BR-421, which had been opened illegally by ranchers and loggers, but compensated by adding in the southeast of the park. A federal injunction in August 2004 required that the responsible agencies prevent acts of environmental degradation in the park. Despite this, an irregular opening of a road from BR-421 was allowed to split the park from east to west and thus segmented the Guapor√©-Mamor√© ecological corridor. The road was built beside the park headquarters, where the State Environmental Development Secretariat (SEDAM) personnel are installed. Apparently it was funded by loggers supported by senior state politicians. The bridges of that section of BR-421 were built from castanheira wood, and a report from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources showed that wood had been stolen along the route. The two cities of Guajar√°-Mirim and Nova Mamor√© were isolated in February 2014 because the BR-425 highway had been flooded by the Igarap√© das Araras, a tributary of the Madeira River. President Dilma Rousseff visited the state and supported work to open the road through the park. The road was opened in April 2014 after receiving authorisation from the federal court. The road connecting the municipalities of Buritis and Campo Novo to Nova Mamor√© and Guajar√°-Mirim cut off the northern 10% of the park. Control points were established at the two road entrances, and vehicle traffic between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m was prohibited, mainly to protect animals crossing the road at night. In August 2014 it was reported that the Associa√ß√£o de Defesa Etnoambiental Kanind√© was to implement a management plan. The Kanind√© environmentalist Ivaneide Bandeira noted that the opening of the park road had increased pressure on the park and had been used to transport stolen cars. The plan was to be prepared by involved people, including the environmentalists, park management and local residents. After defining the process, Kanind√© would start a full survey of the park's fauna and flora, physical characteristics, socioeconomic factors and so on. In May 2015 deputy Lazinho da Fetagro spoke in the state assembly against the invasion of the state park. He called on the state government and SEDAM to stop the invasion, which was not by landless workers. He said tracks had already been made into the forest and it was clear that logging would soon begin. In January 2016 SEDAM and Kanind√© reviewed the protection plan that had been in place since the park was created.

Six months later they took up residence in a trailer in Santa Fe. Flynn felt the need to travel and experience new things to keep his stories fresh. After Lindbergh‚Äôs 1927 flight across the Atlantic spurred new interest in aviation. Flynn decided to take flying lessons at the Franklin-Speakman airfield near Albuquerque to lend authenticity to his tales for Air Stories, the premier aviation pulp of the day. On August 11, 1929 his first wife died, and he remarried in 1930. His second marriage ended in divorce with one daughter named after his first wife, and he married a third time. This marriage lasted till he died, and he had two sons from this marriage. In the 1930s Flynn‚Äôs byline appeared on the covers of many detective pulps including Clues, Detective Fiction Weekly and Dime Detective. When Dime Western was launched, the editor, Rogers Terrill, asked Flynn to write a story for him. The first 1933 issue of Star Western featured a T.T. Flynn story. Flynn soon moved to New Mexico and lived in a trailer while exploring the American West, which added authentic local color to his fictionStar Western (1995) Jon Tuska. Gramercy Books. . Flynn began to regularly supply western stories from then onward. By 1938, he was also a regular contributor to Street and Smith‚Äôs Western Story Magazine. By the time of the World War II paper shortages Flynn began to turn out westerns for the newborn paperback market. In 1954, Flynn made his first and only sale to the Saturday Evening Post. The Man from Laramie appeared as a serial novel in eight issues from January 2 to February 20. In 1955, this was made into a film starring Jimmy Stewart. Another novel, Two Faces West, was optioned for film but never appeared. Many of Flynn's westerns remain in print and some of his series characters for various detective magazine have been collected by Altus Press.

The set of buildings are named for, and on the site of, the former Superior Ink Factory, which was built in 1919. The demolition of the Superior Ink Factory was controversial, and opposed by preservationists and residents of the community. The original architect chosen by Related, Charles Gwathmey, was eventually replaced with Robert A.M. Stern Architects. Gwathmey previously designed the Astor Place Tower for Related, a building that received negative reviews and poor sales. The building was one of Related's first to be built with a distributed antenna system to boost cell phone reception for its tenants. The building was flooded and damaged during Hurricane Sandy. Design The development is split between a condominium apartment building and nine town houses. The apartment building reflects the design of factories located near the original Superior Ink factory. Arthur Lublow, writing for The New York Times, criticized the town houses, complaining that they were not similar to other town houses in Greenwich Village, but rather resembled those on the Upper East Side given their heavy ornamentation.

The Rachel Dolezal case started when Rachel Dolezal reported numerous \\"hate crimes\\" against her that a police investigation failed to substantiate. Rachel Dolezal also accused her brother of sexual abuse and her parents of violence, which the Dolezal family disputed. An allegation against Joshua Dolezal over alleged sexual abuse 13‚Äì14 years earlier was dismissed as unsubstantiated and uncredible in 2015. The allegations were discussed in the 2018 Netflix documentary The Rachel Divide. Their brother Ezra Dolezal said \\"Rachel is not always honest, and neither is Esther.\\" In the film, Rachel and Esther Dolezal, said that Joshua had hired a private investigator to look into Rachel, and it was this investigator who revealed Rachel's racial identity to the local media in Spokane, a claim that KXLY-TV reporter Jeff Humphrey, who first questioned Dolezal on her racial identity in June 2015, corroborated. They suggested that this was an attempt to weaken Rachel's credibility in her claims of sexual abuse against Joshua Dolezal. The charges were subsequently dropped. In a written response to Rachel Dolezal's allegations, Joshua Dolezal said that \\"the lies my sister tells about me and my family are obscene.

Palatucci has served as the Finance Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee, was a senior advisor for the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He has also worked for President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush. He retains a close personal and professional association with Governor Chris Christie, serving as the Chairman of Christie's 2013 re-election campaign and Co-Chair of his Inaugural Committee in 2014 and 2010. He serves as counsel to the Leadership Matters for America PAC. Palatucci is presently Special Counsel at Gibbons, P.C. He has been named as one of the most powerful people by NJBIZ every year that the ranking has been published. He earned an Emmy Award nomination in the category of Outstanding Talk Program Series for \\"The Battling Bills,\\" a program he created jointly with William J. Pascrell, III. Palatucci serves on the Board of Visitors of the Seton Hall University School of Law and the National Advisory Board for the Rutgers University Heldrich Center, as well as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the University of Phoenix. Early life and education Palatucci was born in New Jersey and is one of five children of Frank Palatucci, proprietor of Frank's Tavern in the Haskell section of Wanaque, New Jersey, located next door to the family's home. According to Palatucci, his father was a \\"lifelong Republican\\" who was 50-years-old at the time of his birth; during World War II the elder Palatucci served as chair of the ration board of Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Bill Palatucci says that, due to his father's work schedule, the few times the pair socialized was when they would watch Crossfire together. He is of Italian heritage and has been described as a \\"devout Catholic\\". Palatucci graduated from Rutgers University where, in his final year, he worked as chauffeur to Thomas Kean during his election campaign for governor of New Jersey. He later went on to receive a J.D. from the Seton Hall University School of Law. Career Politics Described by some sources as Chris Christie's \\"right hand\\", Palatucci has worked as an organizer and fundraiser on a number of Republican political campaigns since the 1980s, including serving as New Jersey executive-director of Bush-Quayle 1992. He was elected to the Republican National Committee in 2010 and subsequently went on to serve as co-chair of Christie's 2013 campaign for Governor of New Jersey. Since 2010 Palatucci has served on the New Jersey Apportionment Commission, which is responsible for drawing legislative and congressional district boundaries in New Jersey. He formerly served as chair of the Westfield, New Jersey town recreation commission. During the 2016 Republican National Convention, Palatucci was one of four informally designated \\"whips\\" on the party's rules committee who had been tapped by the Donald Trump campaign to quash a possible insurrection by the \\"Never Trump\\" movement. Afterwards, he was appointed by Christie as general counsel for the planned presidential transition of Donald Trump but was removed from this position in November 2016. Palatucci has donated money to a number of Republican political candidates, as well as to Democratic Party congressman Albio Sires. Law Palatucci began practicing law at the Trenton, New Jersey law firm of Dughi & Hewit in 1993, initially heading the firm's government affairs practice. In 2001 he was made a partner of the firm, whose name was changed to Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci. During the George H.W. Bush presidential campaign of 1992, Palatucci met Chris Christie whom he recruited to the firm, ten years later recommending Christie to Karl Rove for appointment as United States Attorney. Palatucci subsequently went on to serve as general counsel of Community Education Centers, leaving the company in 2012 after his relationship with Christie, then governor of New Jersey, came under media scrutiny; Community Education Centers was the recipient of millions of dollars worth of contracts from the State of New Jersey. As of 2016 he is counsel at Gibbons, P.C.  Halfway Home Controversy  Palatucci was a senior executive for Community Education Centers (CEC), a nonprofit organization that operates halfway homes across the country. In his role as a senior executive, he lobbied for the Center to have increased state aid. Ultimately the inmates were being diverted from entering public prisons where stricter restraints would prevent attacks and assaults by escaped inmates, according to a lawsuit. In 2012 a lawsuit by law enforcement unions violations of state law by acing county inmates into the care of Palatucci‚Äôs nonprofit. The county which filed the lawsuit was Essex County which is led by County Executive Joe DiVincenzo, a democrat ally whom endorsed Christie‚Äôs reelection. Community Education Centers came under scrutiny for avoiding pay-to-play laws through its shell company, Education and Health Centers of America.https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/report_on_essex_county_nj_immigration_detention_expansion.pdf The avoidance of such regulations led to the Essex awarding Community Education Centers a county contract. In 2011 New Jersey's state comptroller issued a report highlighting that about half of the state's $62M half-way home contracts were held by Education and Health Centers of America. Although laws requiring that such programs be non-profit, CEC's contracts were paid to its for-profit by using its political connections. It is believed that the agreement to allow the for-profit to operate was struck either between Palatucci or Chris Christie. In 2010 CEC's political contributions were at $110,000. A New York Times investigation uncovered Palatucci‚Äôs lobbying efforts by Palatucci on behalf of Community Education Centers. In 2010 Governor Christie‚Äôs budget increased funding for halfway homes, increases as large as $3.1M. Assaults in the halfway homes led to lawsuits, one which arose from an inmate being strangled to death. Derek West Harris was murdered by three other inmates, highlighting the dangers that continued at Community Education Center‚Äôs Essex County facility known as Delaney Hall. Harris‚Äôs murder led to an investigation by Essex County which ultimately decided not to press any charges.

She is also the founder of Liberos LLC, an independent research institute.  Education and career  Prause obtained her doctorate in 2007 at Indiana University Bloomington, with joint supervision by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. Her areas of concentration were neuroscience and statistics. Her clinical internship, in neuropsychological assessment and behavioural medicine, was with the VA Boston Healthcare System's Psychology Internship Training Program. Her research fellowship was in couples' treatment of alcoholism with Timothy O'Farrell at Harvard University. Prause became a tenure track faculty member at Idaho State University at the age of 29. After three years there, she accepted a position as a Research Scientist at the Mind Research Network, a neuroimaging facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2012, Prause was elected a full member of the International Academy of Sex Research and accepted a position as a Research Scientist on faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles in the David Geffen School of Medicine. While there, she was promoted to Associate Research Scientist in 2014. Institutional attitudes towards sex research and ongoing safety threats from anti-porn organizations prompted her to found Liberos LLC in 2015. This private research institute and biotechnology company is funded entirely by non-profit grants from the federal government and a foundation. She also is a licensed psychologist in California. Brain stimulation to alter sexual desire Prause was lead author on a study that was the first to apply brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) to alter sexual responsiveness, using a high frequency form known as Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS). The same study also was the first in the US to use primary sexual rewards in the laboratory, adopting from a history of this approach in European laboratories, to overcome the problem of sex films used as secondary reinforcers in previous research. This is thought to raise new possibilities for intervention for those with high or low sex drive, which could be altered semi-permanently by repeated TBS. Sex addiction studies Prause co-authored a high-profile study into the neurophysiology of pornography addiction, published in 2013, which concluded that hypersexuality might be better understood as a \\"non-pathological variation of high sexual desire,\\" rather than an addiction. This first functional neuroscience study of the topic was replicated in 2015 with a study that remains the largest neuroscience study to date on the topic. Penile size preference study In collaboration with psychologist Geoffrey Miller at the Mind Research Network, a neuroimaging facility in Albuquerque, Prause conducted a study in 2015 concerning women's preference in penis size, their preference across different kinds of relationships, and how important they considered penis size in the context of traits in a male partner. The study was the first to use 3d printed penes to rummage through and handle, rather than flat images. Results suggested that most women preferred a penis only slightly larger than average size, that their preference differs slightly across different types of relationships, and that they found penis size to be relatively unimportant in a partner, less important than cooking skills or dress, and only more important than eye color and car type. Twenty percent of participants reported never having experienced sexual intercourse prior to the start of the study. A similar percentage reported having ended a relationship \\"in part\\" because of penis size. Blueprints of all the model phalluses used in the study are publicly available.

They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe, in accordance with The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 Indian Constitution.http://tribal.nic.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/7%20-%20Act%201976%20No%20108%201976.pdf The AnƒÅl tribe is one of the 'sixty six Naga tribes' of the Naga ancestral homeland.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67748/9/09_chapter%203.pdf The members of this tribe are found both in India and Myanmar. In India, they are situated in the States of Manipur and Nagaland but mostly concentrated in the former. In the State of Manipur, the AnƒÅl Naga population concentrated in Chandel and a few AnƒÅl villages are located in its neighbouring districts, Churachandpur district has about three villages and Thoubal district has one or two. The AnƒÅls in Myanmar live in the Sagaing sub-division. The AnƒÅl population in this part has been dwindling. At present, there are three AnƒÅl villages, 'Nga Kala, Napalun and Haika'. Formerly the AnƒÅls had no problem to move or visit AnƒÅl areas now in Myanmar and vice versa. However, with the demarcation of boundaries, they came under two distinct units and the consequent restriction imposed on the movement of the people of both sides, the AnƒÅls had to stop such free movement between them. Consequently, there has not been any interaction between the members of the same tribe now existing under two different countries. The AnƒÅl community is one of the oldest inhabitants of the hill areas in Manipur state. The archaeological findings at Chakpikarong also point it. Despite this, the numbers of AnƒÅls remain small. According to Census of India, the AnƒÅl population was 21,242 and 1991 census placed as 10,642.http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_manipur.pdf The AnƒÅl Naga is recognized as a tribe in Manipur since 1951. This recognition of AnƒÅl tribe was done by Rochunga Pudaite who met the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Delhi in 1951 and requested him to give Scheduled Tribe recognition to the Hmar tribe of Northeast India by wearing a traditional Hmar attire. The PM then asked him if he knew of the existence other tribes which had not been included in the list. Rochunga then added the tribes of AnƒÅl, Kom, Paite, Vaiphei, Ralte, Chothe and others, thus paving way for their recognition. However, it was only after the Scheduled Tribes Reorganisation in 1956 that all the aforementioned tribes were recognised by the Manipur government. Therefore, AnƒÅl Naga is one of 33 tribes in Manipur. The AnƒÅl Language falls under Tibeto-Burman languages family. Referred to them as one of the \\"Naga\\" tribes of Manipur and recognised as part of the List of Naga tribes by the state government of Manipur. History The AnƒÅl tribe is one of the oldest indigenous tribes in the state of Manipur in Northeast India. Chakpikarong is a land of the AnƒÅls since the time the earliest settlers occupied the hill country of Manipur. The AnƒÅls settled both in India and Myanmar, their settlements crossed the Indo-Myanmar border. In India, the members of the tribe are found in the state of Manipur, mainly in Chandel district and a few villages in Churachandpur district and Thoubal district. There are hundred and forty one villages in Chandel district. The neighbouring districts, Churachanpur district has three AnƒÅl villages, namely Kolen, Dutejol and Warkhu, and the Thoubal district has one AnƒÅl village- Moirankhom. Under the Myanmar administrative unit, there are three AnƒÅl villages namely, Ngakala, Napaleen and Haika. According to the census report of 2001, the total AnƒÅl population in India ais 21,242. The AnƒÅl population in Myanmar is not known because many of them are assimilated to the major community. Originally, the AnƒÅls were animistic but are now largely Christian. However, Christianity became a religion for the AnƒÅls only after India's independence. Today, more than 95 per cent of AnƒÅls are Christians and are concentrated in Chandel of Manipur. One of the positive impacts of Christianity among the AnƒÅls is education. The AnƒÅls are amongst the indigenous of Manipur. The history of Moirang (a Meitei kingdom) and the AnƒÅl traditional songs and tales suggests an existence in the presence of inhabited areas since the beginning of the 1st century AD or much earlier. The AnƒÅl cultural and traditional relationship with the Meitei brethren dates backs to 33 AD, and the Meitei King Wangbarel (Pakhangba) married an AnƒÅl woman belonging to the Wanglum clan of AnƒÅl Khullen. Folklore In the words of Horam, in ‚ÄòNaga Polity, \\"it can be said that the Nagas at first live in stone caves or in the womb of the earth\\". YL. Roland Shemmi also writes, \\"Angami, Lotha, Rengam belief that they came out from the earth hole. Tangkhul Naga came out from earth hole at Hundung. Ao tribe believes that they were the first to come out of underground cave\\". Thus cave theory as an epicenter of their origin is common among many tribes and all the Nagas tribe shared this theory. AnƒÅl legend states that the AnƒÅl, together with the other Pakan tribes, originated in Mongolia. They lived in a cave guarded by a man-eating tiger. Two AnƒÅls, Hanshu and Hantha, killed the tiger with the help of birds from the sky. After the tiger's death, the tribes left the cave, traveling through China, Tibet, and numerous other areas before settling in Manipur. The AnƒÅls are divided into two groups based on who they believe they are descended from, Hanshu and Hantha .  Etymology  The origin of the name Anal is not clear. One hypothesis is that the group name comes from the surname of R.D. Angnal. Another suggested explanation is that the name derives from the Meitei word anan, which means \\"clean,\\" suggesting that the group had a reputation for cleanliness. The Anaal generally describe themselves as the Pakan. Ethnic identity The political relationship between the Nagas and the Kukis since the eve of British colonialism to post- British era has always been opposed to one another. The AnƒÅls oral history says they were always at war with the Kukis. In Chakpikarong (The AnƒÅls Naga habitation) Stone Age culture age has been explored and found the existence of this culture.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/21873/8/08_chapter%202.pdf This shows the AnƒÅl Naga tribe is one of the oldest tribes of Manipur state. The oral history of the AnƒÅls says that AnƒÅls were oppressed by the Kukis during the Kuki rebellion of 1917. Demographics The AnƒÅls live in the Manipur region of Northeast India, which is surrounded by the Imphal valley to the north, Churachandpur districtto the west, the Chin Hills to the south and Kabaw valley to the east. The area is very hilly, with thick jungles and many wild animals. According to the 2001 census, there are approximately 21,242 AnƒÅls in Manipur. In 1981 they were living in 45 villages. In 1981 they were living in 45 villages.http://planningmanipur.gov.in/pdf/MSDR/Chapter%203_Demography.pdf Literacy and educational level According to Census India in the year 2001, the Scheduled Tribe (ST) population in Manipur recorded 65.9 per cent literacy, which is above the national average for STs (47.1%). Of the thirteen major STs, the AnƒÅls recorded the fourth highest literacy rate of 73.9% while Hmar recorded the highest literacy of 79.8 per cent, followed by Paite (79%), Any Mizo tribes (74%) and Tangkhul (72.7%). Social life In social practices, many of them are unique. One conspicuous trait is the division of tribe's clans into two distinct groups, viz., 'Mosum' and 'Murchal'. Such as marriage can occur between the members of these two blocks, if any, intra- marriage prevails, it leads to ostracism of the concerned couple. The economy of AnƒÅls is primarily based on crude agriculture. The AnƒÅls' political system, since time immemorial, is democratic in nature and practice. This could be evinced by the election of village authority: the chief and his associates are elected by either voice vote or raise hand. The AnƒÅl traditionally live in windowless wooden houses with thatched roofs, erected above ground level. The houses have two doors of different sizes and two rooms, a bedroom and a storeroom (). AnƒÅl men traditionally wear a lungi (similar to a dhoti) and a simple shirt, called a pakan lungum; they also strap on a basket () for carrying dao and other tools. Women wear undergarments, a skirt, blouse, and shawl, which cover them from their heads to their knees; they also carry a basket(Anal:Bowl). Both sexes can wear jewellery, including rings, necklaces, and bracelets, as well as special long earrings made from insect wings. Traditionally clothing is made by the women. AnƒÅl are traditionally monogamous, although cases of polygyny have been reported. In order to marry, an AnƒÅl man must pay a bride price (); after marriage, the wife moves to the husband's home. Divorce () is permitted among the AnƒÅl, although a fine may be incurred. The AnƒÅl are traditionally polytheistic, believing in a supreme creator named Asapavan, as well as a secondary deity named Wangparel and numerous spirits. The largest AnƒÅl rite is called Akam, which is divided into six stages (Judong, Bhuthawsing, Hni, Sapia, Akapidam, and Dathu) and takes six years to complete. During the Akam, the AnƒÅl sacrifice mithun and pigs and offer a feast to the community. Some AnƒÅl have converted to Christianity. Traditionally, AnƒÅl men work as carpenters, particularly the manufacture of bamboo furniture, and in basketry. Women traditionally specialized in weaving and spinning cotton, which is grown locally. Due to modernization and competition from factory-produced goods, many traditional methods have been abandoned. They are also farmers, harvesting rice, corn, soybeans, pumpkins, tomatoes, and gourds. The AnƒÅl have many traditional musical instruments, including the khuwang (drum), sanamba (three-stringed fiddle), dolkhuwang (gong), pengkhul (trumpet), tilli (flageolet), rasem (a pipe instrument), and diengdong (xylophone They are good dancers and their traditional dances include the kamdam, which is performed by young people for the akam festival, and the ludam, which celebrated victorious headhunting. The AnƒÅl are omnivores, eating fish, eggs, beef, pork, and other kinds of meat as well as fruits and vegetables. Although traditionally they do not drink milk, some families now drink it with tea. A form of rice beer, known as zupar or zuhrin, is also drunk.

It was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects and completed in 2011. It is named after Duncan Rice, a previous Principal of the university. The cube-shaped building can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is a seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass. The building has a floorspace of 15,500 square metres. It houses several of the University's historic collections, including more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts that have been collected over five centuries since the University's foundation. There is also public exhibition space. The library replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library. History The Queen Mother Library had been the university's main library since 1965. The university conducted a restricted international design competition for the new library in 2005. The Danish architectural firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen architects were successful. The project was the largest capital fundraising project ever undertaken by the university. Plans were unveiled to the public in 2007. Construction of the new library building started in August 2009. Caithness Stone Industries was awarded the contract to provide stone for the construction. A topping-out ceremony took place in October 2010. The building was completed in September 2011 and was initially known simply as the Aberdeen University New Library. On 21 September 2012, the building's name was changed to honour Duncan Rice, who had been Principal of the university 1990‚Äì2006, during the time that the project was conceived and the funds were raised. The library was then officially opened by the Queen on 24 September 2012. In the first year there had been 700,000 visitors. Design Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up The building sits on a base of Scottish stone. The ground floor is double-height with seven floors above. The building is clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass. In the interior void spaces are located centrally. Contrasting with the geometric exterior, the central atrium formed by the void spaces has an organic form, shifting in location across the levels. Across the levels above the ground there are 1,200 reading spaces. Above ground there are 13 km of shelving to hold 400,000 books. The building is rated as BREEAM Excellent. Features that help it achieve this include a system to harvest rainwater to use for flushing toilets, photovoltaic cells on the roof and programmed timers to control the use of fluorescent lighting. Outside the library, Evolutionary Loop 517, a 6.25-metre bronze sculpture by Nasser Azam, was unveiled on 27 May 2012. Other university libraries are located in Kings College (Divinity Library), the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books. Awards view of two sides of the library, late 2012 In 2012 the building was given the Aberdeen Civic Society Award. In 2013 it picked up an RIAS award and was also nominated for the 2013 RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award. It won a Royal Institute of British Architects National Award in 2013.

Over six decades he played in more than seventy international matches for Wales, more than any other player. He was bridge correspondent of the Daily Telegraph from 1992 until his death. His World Bridge Federation obituary described him as \\"the bridge-journalist‚Äôs journalist\\". According to the English Bridge Union's death notice: \\"Ever the dedicated journalist, he penned his own obituary to ensure that the media would have their copy in timely fashion.\\"  Life  He was born in Woking. He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he obtained a degree in Physics and Natural Sciences. On leaving university he joined GKN in Cardiff as an operational researcher. The company was nationalised as British Steel shortly after he joined it. In 1973 he was promoted to run a team in Glasgow designing computer systems. Four years later he decided it would be viable for him to switch to playing, writing about and teaching bridge full-time. This came as a surprise to British Steel, which had marked him out as a future senior manager. He was a golfer and tennis player, and a committed Christian. He never married. He died in Cardiff after a short and unexpected illness that proved to be pancreatic cancer.  Bridge  During his time at Peterhouse he became secretary of the Cambridge University Bridge Club, and he played in the 1964 match against Oxford. In 1965, a player in the trials for the Welsh bridge team was taken ill. Jourdain (by now living in Wales owing to his job with GKN) was called in as a substitute, and he and his partner won the trials. The selectors had undertaken that the winners would be given a match in the Camrose Trophy, the competition for the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. He therefore made his international debut in a match against Northern Ireland played in Belfast in early 1966, aged 23 and the youngest ever player for Wales. He subsequently became a regular on the Welsh team over a period of six decades. In 1976, now based in Glasgow, he won the Gold Cup, the most prestigious British domestic competition. He played two matches for Scotland the following year, helping the side to win the Camrose Trophy. The annual match between Scotland and Wales now has a trophy named after him. It was at this time that he gave up his career with British Steel, and returned to Cardiff to manage the city's bridge club as well as becoming bridge correspondent of the Western Mail. He also started producing the copy for the TV company Channel 4's teletext bridge section. In 1982 he was appointed editor of the International Bridge Press Association (IBPA)‚Äôs bulletin, a post he held for twenty years. The bulletin was the source of many of the hands featured in the world‚Äôs bridge columns, read by millions of players. In the same year he became understudy to G. C. H. Fox, then the Daily Telegraph's bridge correspondent, reporting from each subsequent World and European Championship. He was appointed bridge correspondent ten years later when Fox retired from the role (though Fox continued as bridge columnist). When in China he played bridge with Deng Xiaoping. He was subsequently commissioned to write the Chairman's obituary for the Telegraph. Over the years he wrote several stories that made the Telegraph's front page. In 1999 Tony Haworth was found guilty of cheating by the Welsh Bridge Union (WBU) and suspended for ten years. As well as Jourdain's story featuring on the paper's front page it was picked up by the world's media. In addition to writing the story, he was a key figure in Haworth's exposure, having spent months gathering evidence. His story about a computer coming fifth in a field of top bridge players in solving bridge problems also made the front page. \\"Today my words have been read by more people than saw Shakespeare when he was alive!\\" he told a friend. The friend allegedly replied: \\"Ah, but how many will remember your words two hundred years after you are dead?\\" He achieved a world scoop at the 2002 World Championships held in Montreal, when he was told that an unnamed player had refused to take a drugs test, which had been introduced because bridge was hoping to be accepted as a future Olympic sport. At the prize-giving banquet he spotted that a player, Disa Eythorsdottir, was missing when the American women's team went up to receive their medals. Putting two and two together, he found and spoke to the missing player, who told him that she had been stripped of her medal for refusing to take the drugs test, and asked him to make the matter public. Again the story made the Telegraph's front page. The story was widely reported around the world. The following year Eythorsdottir spotted Jourdain at a bridge event and came rushing over. ‚ÄúWhen I told you to make my treatment public,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI did not expect the whole world to know!‚Äù At that 2002 event he had the opportunity to play against Bill Gates. Also at the IBPA awards, announced at the Championships, he was named as the Bridge Personality of the Year. In 2003 he was elected the IBPA‚Äôs President. In 2010 he organised the Buffett Cup match between Europe and the USA that took place in Cardiff and preceded the Ryder Cup golf match, featuring \\"two of the finest bridge teams ever to compete in Britain\\"; the USA won. In 2014 he was a member of the Welsh team which won the gold medal in the Commonwealth Nations Bridge Championship. He was a past President and Honorary Life Member of the WBU. He played in the Welsh Open team at the 2016 European Championships only a month before his death. In all he played in seven World Championships and three European Championships. He was President of the British Bridge League in 1995-6 and Chairman of Bridge Great Britain in 2001. He was principal of the Cardiff School of Bridge, and taught more than a thousand people to play the game.

Van Asch had the two-story brick house built in 1854. Before he and his wife could move in, he rented the house to Central University of Iowa for its use. The college used it for two years. DeBooy built the 1¬Ω-story brick commercial room to the east in 1856. He bought the Van Asch's house in 1864 and joined the two buildings together with a hyphen. The DeBooys lived in the house. After they died in the early 20th century the entire complex housed apartments. The Strawtown Corporation bought it in 1974 and it now houses retail businesses. Dutch building techniques were utilized in the construction of both buildings. They include the use of beam anchors, which are similar to tie rods, a floor system where the flooring rests on top of the floor joists without the use of a subfloor, the window sash configuration, the use of hyphens to join together two separate buildings and increase floor space, and the mousetooth pattern brickwork.

Known for his plein air landscape paintings, Imber experimented with different influences, styles, and subject matter all his life. Early in his career, he was a figurative painter, but he later fully embraced landscapes and abstraction. The former director of the Danforth Museum called him one of the most important painters of his generation and placed him in the lineage of Boston Expressionists.  Painting  Imber found early success with figurative paintings that have since been described as ‚Äúhulking, volumetric figures with tiny strokes... a strange, striking blend of Romanesque art and blocky, cartoonish figures executed with brushy, fastidious mark-making akin to Van Gogh‚Äôs.‚Äù Rather than resting on the success of his figurative style, Imber challenged himself and tackled new material and new subject matter. His focus shifted to portraits, then to large, studio landscapes, then to figures in landscapes, then to plein air landscapes, and finally to landscapes on the edge of abstraction. Throughout these changes he maintained a unique style of gestural brush strokes and an intimate sense of knowing his subject that goes beyond observation. Reviewing a 2013 career survey of Imber's work, the art critic Sebastian Smee said, ‚ÄúLife, in Imber‚Äôs paintings, unfurls with wayward force, like a thick, flicked rope. It takes on vital cadences. It laughs at itself, too.\\"  Influences  Imber studied with Philip Guston at Boston University and he often cited Willem de Kooning as one of his influences. Others have noted that Marsden Hartley, Vincent Van Gogh, Paul C√©zanne, and Max Beckmann were among his influences.  Museums and Collections  Imber's paintings are held in numerous collections and museums around the U.S., including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Harvard's Fogg Art Museum, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the DeCordova Museum, the Farnsworth Museum, the Danforth Museum, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the Davis Museum at Wellesley, and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis. He was the subject of a 2014 retrospective at the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College in New York. Imber was also the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, including two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, a Massachusetts Artists fellowship, an AVA award, an Engelhard Foundation award, the National Academy Museum's Altman Award, Boston University's Distinguished Alumni Award, two grants from the Massachusetts State Arts Lottery, and a Ballinglen Arts Foundation fellowship. His work has been included in many publications including Paintings of Maine: A New Selection by Carl Little and Boston Modern: Figurative Expressionism As Alternative Modernism by Judith Bookbinder.  Biography   Education and Career  Imber was born in Baldwin, New York in 1950. He received his BFA from Cornell in 1972 and received his MFA from Boston University in 1977. Imber later taught at Harvard for 26 years and also taught for many years at the Rhode Island School of Design. He lived in Somerville, Massachusetts and Stonington, Maine. He was married to artist Jill Hoy.  ALS  In 2012, Imber was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. After losing the ability to use his dominant right hand, he taught himself to paint with his left hand. When the muscles in both arms began to fail, he began painting with a brush attached to one of the fingers of his left hand. He also experimented with painting using a brush attached to a metal brace on his forehead. Despite the physical limitations caused by ALS, he was a prolific painter until his death. Imber was the subject of the feature-length documentary titled Imber‚Äôs Left Hand, released in 2014, directed by Richard Kane.  Death  Imber died in Somerville, Massachusetts in 2014.

He was a member of the Garde-Kavallerie-Sch√ºtzen-Division, and was involved in the execution of Rosa Luxemburg. Sources disagree about whether or not he pulled the trigger. Early career Vogel served in World War I as a flying officer.AdR133792668Kurt Vogel After the war he was released as Oberleutnant decommissioned and entered subsequently into a Free Corps. This Freecorps is assumed to be the Guard Cavalry Rifle Division under Lieutenant General Heinrich von Hofmann, and which was active in Berlin. Execution of Rosa Luxemburg On 15 January 1919 Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were discovered in Berlin-Wilmersdorf and brought by members of the Guard Cavalry Rifle Division to their headquarter in the Eden Hotel. This was under the command of the First General staff officer, Captain Waldemar Pabst. Luxemburg and Liebknecht were interrogated and severely mistreated. After their removal from the Hotel Eden by members of the Division, Rosa Luxembourg was shot in the car; her body was found in the Landwehr Canal at the end of May 1919. For years, the transport leader Kurt Vogel was named as the gunman. In 1959, it was announced at a confession of Waldemar Pabst that after the removal of the abused communist leaders Hermann Souchon jumped on the car and shot Rosa Luxemburg with a pistol in the head. Process On 17 January 1919 Kriegsgerichtsrat Paul Jorns concerned himself at the field court martial of the Guards Cavalry Rifle Division with the executions of Luxembourg and Liebknecht. A criminal case against the alleged perpetrators became not initially in transition. Jorn released Kurt Vogel and Horst von Pflugk- Harttung. KPD members demanded since 16 February 1919 due to danger of collusion vainly an independent investigation by a non-military special court. Hoffmann and Jorn saw therefore themselves forced to add two members of the \\"Zentralrat der deutschen sozialistischen Republik\\" and the \\"Berliner Vollzugsrat\\". Jorn himself refused requests by the civilian members of the inquiry commission. On February 15 the front page of the Die Rote Fahne had the following headline: \\"The murder of Liebknecht and Luxembourg. The act and the perpetrators\\", written by Leo Jogiches. For this reason Oskar Rusch, Paul Wegmann and Hugo Struve stepped back from participating in the investigation. Hermann W√§ger did not step back. The civilian members of the commission noted that advocate Jorn did nothing to prevent obscuring the facts. In May 1919, some of the accused ‚Äì including Otto Wilhelm Runge and Lieutenant Kurt Vogel ‚Äì were tried by a military tribunal of their own division. The trial was held from 8 to 14 May 1919. Wilhelm Pieck became one of the most important witnesses to the incidents at the hotel, which preceded the executions. He and hotel employees had noticed the mistreatment of the executed and telephone conversations between officers and their superiors.Frederik Hetmann: Rosa L., Fischer, S. 271f. Vogel was sentenced to two years and four months in prison on 14 May 1919 because of the removal of a corpse, a false statement and other offenses. Runge received a two-year prison sentence, Souchon was fined. The involved officers Horst and Heinz von Pflugk-Harttung were acquitted. As supreme commander of the troops confirmed Gustav Noske the judgment personally with his signature. Escape On 17 November 1919 Wilhelm Canaris came, with the code name \\"Lieutenant Lindemann\\", to Moabit prison. He showed an order signed by Jorn to move prisoner Vogel. He boarded with Vogel a car and gave him an identification card issued by the passport office of the war department. Vogel went to the Netherlands. Aftermath Two years after the trial of Vogel, Runge, and other drivers of the Luxemburg-carriage, a soldier named Janschkow said during a new investigation, that the \\"third man\\" was Hermann Souchon. Souchon did not appear despite summons to this process. In 1934, a year after the coming of the Nazi regime, Adolf Hitler granted the executioners of Luxembourg and Liebknecht amnesty and even paid Otto Runge compensation and granted Vogel a tax break.

Scion of a family of Perushim, disciples of the Vilna Gaon who immigrated to Israel in the early 19th century, Rivlin spearheaded the establishment of the first Jewish neighborhoods outside the Old City walls. He helped found a total of 13 neighborhoods, beginning with Nahalat Shiv'a and Mea Shearim. His activities earned him the nickname Shtetlmacher (\\"Town-Maker\\"). He directed the Central Committee of Knesseth Israel, the supreme council of the Ashkenazi community in the Old Yishuv, for over 30 years. Early life and family Yosef Yitzhak Rivlin was born in Jerusalem in 1838, the scion of a distinguished family of Perushim descending from the students of the Vilna Gaon. His paternal ancestors hailed from Shklov, including his father, Rabbi Avraham Binyamin Rivlin, a Talmud Torah principal in Jerusalem; his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Rivlin, a Rosh Kollel in Reisin and Vilna who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1841 and served as maggid and leader of the Perushim community; and his great-grandfather, Rabbi Hillel Rivlin, a student of the Vilna Gaon who made aliyah with the Perushim in 1809 and was the first head of the Ashkenazi Perushim rabbinical court in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Shifra. Rivlin absorbed the ideological vision of his paternal ancestors, preached by the Vilna Gaon, that by strengthening the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel they could hasten the onset of the messianic redemption. At the time, the Jewish population of Jerusalem was confined to the Old City, where they were prey to poverty, overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and heavy taxes imposed by the Ottoman government. Rivlin developed a vision of expanding the Jewish settlement into neighborhoods outside the walls of Jerusalem, although that prospect carried with it exposure to attackers and wild animals that roamed beyond the protective walls of the Old City. Rivlin received his early education in cheder and attended the Etz Chaim yeshiva in the Old City as a youth. He married Sara Tzipa, the daughter of Rabbi Yehuda Leib Goldschmidt, in 1855. During their engagement, he sent her a message via her brother that he intended to found a new Jewish neighborhood outside the Old City walls and be the first to live there. The bride's family was appalled and wanted to break the match, and Rivlin's own family thought that a dybbuk had possessed him, but the bride agreed to Rivlin's plan. The newly-married Rivlin studied for half a day in the Etz Chaim kollel and worked as a writer for his relative, Rabbi Yosef Yoel Rivlin, who produced propaganda sheets on behalf of the Batei Machseh neighborhood and the Hurva Synagogue. He published his first Torah article at the age of 15 and went on to write prolifically about the importance of expanding the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel as a means of ushering in the redemption. Neighborhood builder In 1857, Rivlin founded the Bonei Yerushalayim (Builders of Jerusalem) company for the purpose of building neighborhoods outside the Old City walls. He enlisted signatories in the company from among his acquaintances, wealthy relatives in Shklov and Mohilev, and pro-Israel committees in Amsterdam and London, and also traveled to Russia and Europe with his colleagues, Rabbis Yoel Moshe Salomon and Michel Cohen, to promote the plan. The group collected 800 rubles toward the purchase of land for the neighborhood of Nahalat Shiv'a. Rivlin was also instrumental in securing an annulment of the Ottomon ban on construction outside the Old City walls, issued in 1844. Sent with Rabbi Benzion Lyon to Constantinople by the rabbis of Jerusalem, Rivlin and Lyon procured an annulment of the firman from the sultan's secretary, effective 1862. In 1869, Rivlin and six partners established the Jewish neighborhood of Nahalat Shiv'a. Rivlin was the first to build a house and to live in it at night to prove that the settlement was viable. He protected himself from attackers by constructing a high wall around his home and paying a Turkish soldier and, later, an Arab guard, to keep an eye on him. He insisted that his wife remain in the Old City, while another Jew boarded with him. Until more homeowners moved in two and a half years later, he returned to his wife only on Shabbat. In 1872 the neighborhood was sufficiently populated that Rivlin brought his wife to live with him. In 1873 he was one of the founders of Mea Shearim, whose name he coined. His modus operandi was to buy a house in each new neighborhood that he helped establish, live in it for a while, and then move to a new home in the next neighborhood that he founded. In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions and spoke in the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873. Rivlin is credited with the establishment of 13 Jewish neighborhoods in western and northwestern Jerusalem: Nahalat Shiv'a, Mea Shearim, Even Yisrael, Beit Ya‚Äôakov, Mishkenot Yisrael, Mazkeret Moshe, Ohel Moshe, Knesset Yisrael, Zikhron Tuvya, Shevet Ahim, Shaarei Zedek, Ezrat Yisrael, and Yemin Moshe. He also helped name these neighborhoods based on allusions to the doctrine of messianic redemption. Community leader In 1863, Rivlin was asked to head the Central Committee of Knesseth Israel, the supreme council of the Ashkenazi community in the Old Yishuv formed by Chief Rabbi Shmuel Salant, a position he held for more than 30 years until his death. The Central Committee represented the community before the Ottoman authorities on everything from day-to-day issues to critical events, such as a proposed expulsion of Jewish foreign nationals. In his capacity as a director, Rivlin also welcomed the first Hovevei Zion immigrants to the yishuv and lauded the Sephardi communities for their contribution to Jerusalem's development. After the death of his uncle, Yosef Yoel Rivlin, in an 1865 plague, Rivlin assumed the financial management of the Kollel Amsterdam distribution committee, which distributed funds received from Sir Moses Montefiore. Writing A prolific author, Rivlin wrote articles for the leading Hebrew newspapers in Palestine and abroad, urging the development of the yishuv as a means to hasten the messianic redemption, as preached by the Vilna Gaon. He also composed poems and gematrias, based on Kabbalah, expounding these ideas. A collection of his newspaper articles and essays was reprinted in the book Megillat Yosef (Scroll of Joseph) (1966). Personal life Yosef Rivlin Street, Nahalat Shiv'a, circa 1950 Rivlin and his first wife, Sara Tzipa, had their first child, a daughter, in the spring of 1873. That summer, Sara Tzipa was attacked in their Nahalat Shiv'a home by a dagger-wielding Arab; she fought him off and stabbed him to death, but succumbed to shock and died of a heart attack. Their baby daughter later died. In 1874, Rivlin remarried to Miriam, the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Fizetzer of Brisk. Together they had seven children: Freida Raizel, Rasha Bracha, Hillel, Shlomo Zalman, Avraham Binyamin, Yocheved Shifra, and Rivka Malka. Hillel Rivlin became the secretary of the Central Committee, and was also among the founders of the village of Neve Yaakov. Shlomo Zalman Rivlin, an accomplished Hazzan, headed the Shirat Yisrael Institute and was the author of Shirei Shlomo, hazzanut compositions. With his third wife, Minna, the daughter of Rabbi Zalman Brill Levi, Rivlin had one son, Moshe, who became a journalist for Der Morgen Journal in New York. Although he managed huge sums in the development and construction of new neighborhoods, and his critics accused him of profiting from his activities, Rivlin lived a life of penury. Though he moved from house to house, he often had to sell the first house before the next one was built. He left nothing to his children, not even a house, and was unable to pay the doctors who treated him during his final illness. Rivlin died in his home in the Ezrat Yisrael neighborhood on Shabbat, 5 September 1897, at the age of 59. Payment for his medical care, as well as funds to provide for his widow and children after his death, were provided by Baron Shimon Wolf Rothschild of Frankfurt. Yosef Rivlin Street in the Nahalat Shiv'a neighborhood is named after him.

Synopsis & Musical Numbers ACT ONE (PROLOGUE: ONCE (UPON A WHILE AGO) In a village by the sea ruled by a powerful King, Father and daughter live a hardscrabble life on the streets. By night, he attempts to calm his starving child by recounting the dream he had on the day she was born (LULLABY). By day, Father and Aheh beg door to door, struggling to remain optimistic in the face of adversity (HOW YOU LOOK AT IT). Elsewhere in the village, we meet Madame Bang Duk Omi - the ugly, conniving town wench (MADAME OMI). Madame Omi is a devious swindler of blind men, seducing her unlucky victims and stealing their rice (the equivalent of money in this faraway land). As the days go by, Aheh takes it upon herself to support her Father and sets off to find work (HOW YOU LOOK AT IT (Reprise). Early the next morning, in the Village, Aheh learns the story of the Magic Buddhist Monk who can grant miracles. When Father awakens to find Aheh gone, he goes off in search of her and meets Madame Omi. At first, Omi attempts to woo him, but soon realizes that he has nothing she needs, so she abandons him on the side of the road. Disoriented, Father stumbles into a nearby swamp and is rescued by the Magic Monk himself, who promises to restore Father‚Äôs eyesight for only three hundred bags of rice (if paid by the next full moon) ‚Äì conjuring several miraculous examples to prove it (MADAME OMI (Reprise)/THE DEAL/HOW YOU LOOK AT IT (Reprise 2). Secretly, Aheh becomes determined to save up enough rice so that her Father will be able to pay the Monk‚Äôs fee. Toiling ever harder, Aheh labors many long hours for several employers at a multitude of demanding jobs, all the while dreaming of the day her Father will have his eyesight (HOUSEKEEPING). Opportunity unexpectedly presents itself in the form of a group of superstitious Sailors who arrive in the village, willing to pay three hundred bags of rice in exchange for a virgin to sacrifice to the God of the Sea (YO, HO, HO!). Aheh sees this as her only chance and strikes a deal with them: her life, for the rice. Madame Omi overhears their exchange and plots to steal the rice for herself (MADAME OMI (Reprise 2). That night, unable to say goodbye (THE WAY I‚ÄôLL SAY GOODBYE), Aheh prepares to leave her Father behind, withholding the truth from him until the final moment when the Sailors return to take her away. They set sail at sunrise, sacrificing Aheh to the God of the Sea by throwing her overboard. Father is left alone and devastated with his three hundred bags of rice - and only the conniving Madame Omi to ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù him (ANY MINUTE NOW). ACT TWO Aheh drowns to the bottom of the ocean (DOWN). There, the God of the Sea is so incredibly moved by her sacrifice that he breathes life back into her and offers her a second chance, foretelling her destiny to meet the King. Colorful Sea Creatures prepare Aheh for her journey home (THE MAKEOVER) and send her back to the surface in a lotus blossom (HOME TO YOU). Servants discover the lotus blossom floating on the ocean and bring it to the attention of the King. When he touches the blossom, its petals open to reveal Aheh inside, and he falls in love with her at first sight (AWKWARD). In the Hall of Ancestors, the King leads Aheh on a tour of his and lineage, while Aheh helps him to realize his own greatness HOW YOU LOOK AT IT (Reprise 3). Back in the village, Madame Omi forces opium on Father to help his pain.‚Äù In his mind, a chorus of Spurned Blind Men portends disaster, warning Father to beware of Madame Omi - who proceeds to steal his rice and vanish off into the night (MADAME OMI (Reprise 3). On the eve of the full moon, Madame Omi goes to the Monk‚Äôs temple on the mountain, paying him with Father‚Äôs stolen rice to transform her from hideous wench into a beautiful Princess (WHO‚ÄôS AS LUCKY AS ME?). Meanwhile, betrayed and alone, Father searches the Village for Madame Omi, haunted by regret (LOST). Although grateful for her brand new life, Aheh misses her Father. The King proclaims that he will hold a feast for all the blind men in the land, in the hopes that he can somehow reunite them (NO MATTER WHAT). Word of the feast spreads quickly, as blind men from all around make their way to the palace (FEAST). On the final day of the celebration, Father arrives and Aheh rushes into his arms. Their joyous reunion results in a true miracle: Father magically regains his sight. Simultaneously, Madame Omi is punished with blindness, cursed to never admire her beautiful new exterior (FINALE). At long last, Father finally sees his Sunfish. Anything is possible (EPILOGUE: ONCE (UPON A WHILE AGO) (Reprise).

In 1378, the town council of Le Puy imposed an indirect tax on consumption at a flat rate in order to subsidise the war with England. According to a letter written after the revolt, when the tax was announced the people cried, \\"O blessed Virgin Mary help us! How shall we live, how shall we be able to feed our children, since we cannot support the heavy taxes established to our own prejudice through the influence of the rich to reduce their own taxes?\\" The revolt spread west as people objected to heavy taxes to pay for the king's war. In September 1381, in response to unfair assessments for direct taxes, the workers of B√©ziers rebelled. A crowd stormed the town hall and lit the tower on fire, burning several councillors alive and forcing others to jump to their deaths. The Duke of Berry intervened quickly at B√©ziers, ordering forty- one rebels executed by hanging and four more beheaded in the town square as an example. The Tuchins were eventually suppressed by the Duke of Berry in 1384.

In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in many states by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by independent dealers. The electric car manufacturer Tesla maintains that to properly explain to their customers the advantages their cars have over traditional vehicles with an internal combustion engine, they cannot rely on third-party dealerships to handle their sales.  Corporate strategy  Tesla has a 60% degree of vertical integration in 2016 according to Goldman Sachs. The integration includes its own sales channels and proprietary charging infrastructure, among others. The high degree is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically focus on engine manufacturing and vehicle assembly, outsourcing 80% of components to suppliers while letting franchises serve as sales points. Some of Tesla's stated goals are to increase the number and variety of electric vehicles (EVs) available to mainstream consumers by selling its own vehicles in company-owned showrooms and online. Tesla states that owning stores \\"creates an information loop from our customers straight into manufacturing and vehicle design\\". Tesla attempts to not make a profit on servicing cars. Sales model , Tesla operates more than 130 stores and galleries in the United States, and has stores and galleries in 34 other countries. It owns the stores and sells directly to customers via the internet and in non-US stores.Number of Tesla StoresList Tesla has a low budget for marketing, and uses a referral program and word of mouth to attract buyers. US dealerships and automotive dealership disputes Tesla gallery in Austin, Texas. , there are stores and galleries‚Äîusually located in shopping malls‚Äîin 29 US states and Washington DC. Customers can buy vehicles from stores, as well as from the Tesla website. The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealership protection laws which prevent discussing price, financing, and test drives, as well as other restrictions. Tesla has set up mobile-shipping-container \\"stores\\" and 6 Airstream travel trailers each pulled by a Model X, reaching areas not served by brick-and-mortar shops. Tesla's strategy of direct customer sales and owning stores and service centers is different from the standard dealership model in the US vehicle marketplace. Tesla is the only manufacturer that currently sells cars directly to customers; all other automakers use independently owned dealerships although some automakers provide online configuration and financing. 48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers, and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed numerous lawsuits against Tesla, to prevent the company from selling cars. North Carolina and New Hampshire sided with Tesla, while Virginia and Texas sided with dealers. Jurisdictions outside the United States do not have such laws protecting car dealerships. The laws against direct sales arose historically in the United States starting in the 1930s, as automobile manufacturers started using independently franchised dealerships to offload the tasks of retail selling and servicing vehicles. The laws have been actively defended into the 21st century and extended to online in-state sales. Such regulations protect dealerships against a manufacturer opening its own dealerships and competing against resellers, which could be seen as an abuse of the manufacturer-franchise relationship. Critics view the laws as thwarting legitimate competitive pressure that benefits consumers, and some have described them as \\"protectionism\\", and \\"crony capitalism\\".Crane, Daniel A. \\"Tesla, Dealer Franchise Laws, and the Politics of Crony Capitalism\\" page 577-579.

Investigations by Consumer Reports and the Sierra Club found that independent dealers often could not answer questions about electric cars, did not provide information about government rebates, did not showcase the cars prominently, or let the batteries run out. States with total direct sales bans New Mexico (also bans service centers) 2006 New Mexico Statutes, Section 57-16-5-V prohibits manufacturers like Tesla to be licensed as a dealer, directly or indirectly performing warranty or other services.

Admin. Code ¬ß 215.261). These laws make it illegal to buy a car from Tesla in person, at a Tesla Gallery. Thus, all Texas orders are taken via the internet or over the phone. Texas residents can still easily buy a car from Tesla, but the purchase is handled as an out-of-state transaction and must be completed before the vehicle ships to Texas. Tesla recently added the ability to include tax, title, license, and registration in the sale price of the car so the purchaser doesn't have to pay that separately once they receive the vehicle. In 2015, Tesla lobbied the Texas Legislature to modify the law to allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers, and specifically allow Tesla employees to discuss \\"financing, leasing, or purchasing options\\" at the firm's existing galleries in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Texas considered legislation in 2015 to allow Tesla to operate in the state but legislation was not passed. , most of the GOP delegates support direct sales while Governor Abbott prefers the current system. According to Texans for Public Justice, Tesla spent $1.3m on lobbyists while dealerships spent $1m. Connecticut Connecticut does not allow manufacturer direct sales, but does allow direct leasing.

Upon learning of Tesla's attempt to obtain a second dealership in the state, the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association filed a lawsuit in March 2016 against both Tesla and the DMV to prevent the licensing of the second dealership. In September 2016, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (VDMV) recommended ending Tesla direct sales, as at least 11 dealerships were interested in selling Tesla vehicles. The VDMV later allowed Tesla to open another shop (Richmond), as Tesla has no dealerships to compete against; the 11 interested dealerships would not be able to compete on undiscounted prices, as Tesla has the same price online and in shops.Formal Evidentiary Hearing: Tesla Motors, Inc., File No. 2016-001 - Request for a Hearing Pursuant to Va.

Tesla responded by saying that the proposal \\"seeks to impose stringent licensing rules that would, among other things, require all new motor vehicles to be sold through middlemen and block Tesla's direct sales model\\", and that \\"[Governor Christie's] Administration has decided to go outside the legislative process by expediting a rule proposal that would completely change the law in New Jersey.\\" The law was passed, and \\"Tesla will no longer [be able to] sell electric cars in New Jersey, effective April 1\\".

Most shoppers found it to be a positive experience, although 35 dealerships recommended petrol cars instead, and 13 discouraged EVs. The most knowledgeable dealerships were Chevrolet, and the least were Toyota. In 2016, two shopper surveys showed contrasting shopping experiences between Tesla and traditional dealerships. One performed by the environmental organization Sierra Club found that in 14% of traditional dealerships, their electric cars were not charged to test drive, and 33% did not discuss the $7,500 Federal tax credits. Another study by industry analyst Pied Piper using mystery shoppers found that Tesla sales stores (not galleries) differed among each other on sales techniques, and many stores were reluctant to engage in closing a sale. Customers generally view car shopping as a challenging experience. In May 2019, Sierra Club revisited dealerships, and found that 74% did not offer electric vehicles. Those that did, were mostly in states with requirements for zero-emission vehicles. A 2019 study indicates that only 10% of Americans have significant knowledge of EVs.

The Van Marens had this two- story brick building constructed for their family home in 1877. Both were first generation immigrants from the Netherlands. Henry was a wagon and carriage-maker. They bought the property their home stands on under Johanna's name, and it remained in her name until she died in 1912 and it passed to Henry. In 1928 the house was converted for use as a filling station. John operated the station. They lived in the second-floor apartment. The yellow and red paint scheme are the Diamond Oil Company's colors. The canopy, added in 1928, originally had a gable roof with half-timbering in the gable end. It was altered to its present appearance in 1956. The gas pumps were located between the columns. In 1955 the filling station became a D-X station. Cordelia Vander Linden sold the property in 1967. The building's conversion into a filling station is what makes it historically significant. It has subsequently housed a travel agency, realtor office, and potter's studio.

In the 1960s, she had an active leadership role in the Society for Individual Rights, an organization that promoted equal rights for gays and lesbians. In 1966, she opened and ran Maud's, a year prior to the San Francisco‚Äôs Summer of Love; it stayed open for 23 years, at that time the longest continuously running lesbian-owned lesbian bar in the country. She opened a second bar, Amelia‚Äôs, in 1978 in the city‚Äôs Mission district, with both venues serving as makeshift community centers for lesbians who had very few accepting socializing options. In the early 1980s, she was a co-founder of the international Gay Olympics, later called Gay Games, she helped to create the Federation of Gay Games and served on the board of directors. In 1994, she received the Dr. Tom Waddell Award for her contribution to Gay Athletics. Streicher died of cancer later that year, and was survived by her partner, Mary Sager. The Rikki Streicher Field, an athletic field and recreation center in San Francisco's Castro District, was named after her. Early life Streicher was born in 1922. She served in the military and lived in Los Angeles in the 1940s, where she spent time in the gay bars of that city. She also frequented the gay bars of North Beach in San Francisco. Butch-Femme roles were very fixed at that time. Streicher then identified as butch, and was photographed in 1945 in a widely published image, sitting in Oakland's Claremont Resort with other lesbians, wearing a suit and tie.Nan Alamilla Boyd, Horacio N. Roque Ramirez, Bodies of Evidence, The Practice of Queer Oral History, Oxford University Press, Feb 26, 2012, p. 7  San Francisco and national activities  Society for Individual Rights Streicher had an active leadership role in the Society for Individual Rights (SIR), an organization of gay men and lesbians created in San Francisco in 1964 that promoted equal rights for homosexuals, political empowerment, and community building through fundraisers, dances, and classes.JoAnne Myers, The A to Z of the Lesbian Liberation Movement: Still the Rage, Scarecrow Press, August 20, 2009, p. 232 By 1966, SIR had established the first public gay community center in the United States, and become the largest homophile organization in the country.Brent L. Pickett, The A to Z of Homosexuality, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 174 Maud's In 1966, Streicher opened Maud's, originally called \\"Maud's Study\\", or \\"The Study\\", a lesbian bar on Cole St. in the Haight- Ashbury district of San Francisco. The following year, the Haight-Ashbury would become the epicenter of the hippie movement during the 1967 Summer of Love. Maud's, said one historian, served to \\"bridge the gap between San Francisco's lesbian community and its hippie generation.‚ÄùNan Alamilla Boyd, Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965, \\"A Queer Ladder of Social Mobility,\\" University of California Press, May 23, 2003 Because women were not allowed to be employed as bartenders in San Francisco until 1971, Streicher had to either tend bar herself or hire male bartenders.(https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124061664179455005] The bar quickly became a popular gathering place for San Francisco lesbians and bisexual women. One notable customer of Maud's was singer Janis Joplin.Tom Steele, ‚ÄúJanis Joplin‚Äù Out Magazine, August, 2005, p. 28 Activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were also early patrons of Maud's. Maud's remained opened for twenty-three years, becoming at that time the longest continuously running lesbian-owned lesbian bar in the country. In the book Wide Open Town, Nan Amilla Boyd describes Maud's as a \\" lesbian bar, clubhouse and community center\\". She highlights the fight of bar owners like Streicher during the 1950s and 1960s to \\"secure public space for queer people and says many lesbians 'depended on bar life, the central artery of queer life' for their activities.' Nan Alamilla Boyd, Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965, \\"A Queer Ladder of Social Mobility,\\" University of California Press, May 23, 2003 - The bar and its closing in 1989 were documented in Paris Poirier's internationally distributed film Last Call at Maud's. The film weaves the broader history of lesbian bars in the United States into customers' reminisces about old times. In it, Streicher speculated that increased acceptance of lesbianism in public spaces and a turn towards sobriety brought on by the 1980s AIDS crisis may have been contributing factors to Maud's closing.Kemply, Washington Post Amelia's During Pride Week, the Elbo Room replaced their sign with the sign of Amelia's, the former lesbian dance club on 647 Valencia Street, owned by Rikki Streicher from 1978 to 1991. In 1978, at the height of the disco era, Streicher opened Amelia's, a more spacious bar and dance club at 647 Valencia Street in San Francisco's Mission District, named after Amelia Earhardt. The Mission district, and particularly Valencia Street, became a gathering place for lesbians from the 1970s through the early 1990s, and was home to several organizations and businesses that catered to women, including The Women's Building, a non-profit organization; Old Wives Tales, a bookstore; Osento, a woman-only bathhouse; and the Artemis Society, a lesbian club which later became the Artemis Cafe. Amelia's was open until 1991, when Streicher sold it and it became the Elbo Room bar (the Elbo Room closed in 2018). Its closure signaled a change in how lesbians met and congregated in San Francisco. As Rob Morse of the San Francisco Examiner wrote about Amelia's, \\"More lesbians than ever live in San Francisco, but...the last lesbian bar in The City, Amelia's, will close.\\"Morse, Rob (November 12, 1991). \\"As San Francisco goes, so what?\\" San Francisco Examiner. pg. 3. \\"It's a victim of the lesbian community becoming more diverse...the 30-and-over lesbian crowd just isn't going out to bars as much anymore. The ones who do tend to go to mainstream bars and clubs. There is an absence of a lesbian community in the presence of a million lesbians...Today it's 'I, me, mine,'...Well, tempus fugit. On Saturday night there will be a goodbye party called 'Last Call at Amelia's.'\\" \\"It's a victim of the lesbian community becoming more diverse,\\" Streicher said, \\"the 30-and- over lesbian crowd just isn't going out to bars as much anymore. The ones who do tend to go to mainstream bars and clubs.\\" There was no lesbian bar again in San Francisco until the opening of the Lexington Club in 1996 (\\"The Lex\\" closed in 2015 as a result of the city's increasing gentrification). An obituary in The Advocate, published two months after Streicher's death, erroneously reported that Amelia's was called \\"Amanda's\\". via Google Books Every June during Pride Week, the Elbo Room replaced its sign with Amelia's to honor the bar and its lesbian clientele. Gay Olympics Streicher was a passionate promoter of gay and lesbian softball teams and co-founder of the Gay Olympics, later named Gay Games, which started in San Francisco. She helped to create the Federation of Gay Games and served on the board of directors. \\"Sports are the great social equalizer,\\" she said. \\"It is perhaps the only time that it does not matter who you are but how you play the game.\\" Jayne Caudwell , Sport, Sexualities and Queer/Theory Routledge, Jan 24, 2007, p. 93 At the fourth annual Gay Games in New York City in 1994, attended by 55,000 people, she received the Dr. Tom Waddell Award for her contribution to Gay Athletics.https://gaygames.org/wp/about-the-fgg/honorsawards/tom-waddell- award/ She is also listed in the hall of fame for the San Francisco Gay Softball League. Death and legacy Streicher died of cancer at age 68 on August 21, 1994, and was survived by her partner, Mary Sager. Upon her death, the mayor of San Francisco lowered the city flags to half-mast.Eric Marcus, Out in All Directions: A Treasury of Gay and Lesbian America, Grand Central Publishing, Sep 26, 2009 The Rikki Streicher Field, an athletic field and recreation center in San Francisco's Castro District, was named after her. Scholars of LGBT history have speculated that the lesbian bars of Streicher's era, which served an important purpose at that time, have closed as the result of gentrification, greater acceptance of lesbians in mainstream society and the popularity of online dating and social media. One writer looking back on the era noted that Streicher and her lesbian bars were instrumental in creating a protective space where lesbian women could come of age and help others do the same: References External links * Bay Area Lesbian Archives American women in business Lesbian businesswomen Lesbian sportswomen American people of German descent People from San Francisco LGBT businesspeople from the United States LGBT sportspeople from the United States ","title":"Rikki Streicher"},{"id":"51214723","text":"Nikolai Badriyevich Giorgobiani (; born 16 July 1997) is a Russian football player.

Ti√£o became a celebrity in Brazil, when in 1988, the comedians who ran newspapers Casseta Popular and Planeta Di√°rio (who would later join forces as Casseta & Planeta), jokingly created his extra official candidature for mayor as a protest in defence of null voting. At the time, voting was written on papers instead of registered using voting machines.

It is located in the Guilin region on the south-western fringes of the Dushan Mountain (D√∫ ShƒÅn Áã¨Â±±) in the autonomous region Guangxi and is considered to be one of the most important cave sites of the Neolithic in China as it is one of the many independent centers for the introduction of animal domestication and pottery. The cave was discovered in 1969 and archaeological excavations began in 1973. Dating revealed that the cave was occupied between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago, the oldest layer reaching as far back as 12,000 years ago. This natural cave was used as a dwelling place, whether it was only a seasonal habitat is not yet clear. The main cave has an area of approximately and faces southwest, adjacent to the Li River with neighboring woods for hunting, lakes for fishing and plains for collecting wild vegetables. Excavations have so far yielded over 30 human corpses, 110 kinds of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, over 1,000 pieces of polished and pierced stone and bone ware, animal teeth, mussel shells and over 10,000 pieces of pottery. Many fireplaces and waste pits were also discovered. In the back of the cave stone material is piled up. In older sediments semi-finished stone tools were abundant. Pierced stone tools and polished stone tools were unearthed from more recent layers. Bone artifacts included fishing spears (Yubiao ), arrowheads (z√∫ ) needles (zhƒìn ) and hairpins (jƒ´ ). The cave yielded some of the country's oldest pieces of pottery as the appearance of pottery in the area is believed to be related to freshwater snail eating. \\"Freshwater snails were one of their staple foods, judging by the quantities of snail shells found in various strata\\". The oldest local pottery is according to Chinese archaeologists dated to 12,000 years BP. The ceramics of more recent strata were determined to belong to the \\"String pattern-Guan-vessel-type\\" (). Pottery fragment from the site For some time the cave must also have served as a primitive tomb as bones of about 30 humans were discovered. No burial pits and funeral tools have been found. The bodies were buried mainly in a squatting position. The cave was finally abandoned after being inhabited for 5,000 years when a warm and humid period started around 7,000 years ago and the cave, only one meter above the surrounding plain, was often flooded.

They had previously made motor cycles, but began producing battery-electric road vehicles (BERV) in the mid 1930s. They were best known for their three-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicles, although they also produced conventional four-wheeled milk floats, and later manufactured industrial trucks. The company went into liquidation in the early 1960s, although the marque was used by two other companies until at least 1972. History Diamond Motors Ltd were based in Wolverhampton, and made motor cycles. Another Wolverhampton-based manufacturer of motorcycles, AJS filed for voluntary liquidation. AJS also made sidecars, and Walter Vincent Ford, the managing director of Diamond Motors, was approached with a view to buying the sidecar business from AJS. They paid ¬£475, and this price included the Graiseley trademark. They continued to make Graiseley sidecars for a number of former AJS customers, but after a downturn in 1933, ceased to make their own motorcycles. The company moved to new premises on Upper Villiers Street, Wolverhampton, in 1935, and began producing pedestrian controlled milk trucks, which were marketed with the Graiseley marque. They soon found that they could sell into other industries, and the vehicles were used in hospitals, factories and warehouses. In January 1937, Diamond Motors produced their first battery-electric road vehicle, a four-wheeled van with the cab in front of the front wheels, suitable for a payload of 8-10 cwt. The frame, which was made from channel with tube and channel cross members, had a lower section for the cab floor, which was just above the ground, to provide easy access for a roundsman. The vehicle was fitted with a motor manufactured by the Electric Power Engineering Co., and powered from a 60-volt battery. Standard 162 Amp-hour batteries gave a top speed of and a range of around , but a larger range was available by fitting 216 Amp-hour batteries. A press statement announced that this was the first in a series of vehicles which would be produced by the company, and further details of other models would be announced soon afterwards. A diagram of the Graiseley 3-wheeled pedestrian controlled battery-electric chassis dating from around 1938. The diagram was part of the application for patent no. 504604. Commercial Motor carried a review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with commercial operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a motor, and was designed to travel at , with a range of on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front wheel forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal drum clutch was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried. In 1945, Batley education committee bought a Graiseley for the delivery of cooked foods, particularly soup, pastries and puddings, to schools. The three-wheeled PCV was powered by a motor and a 24-volt battery. The motor drove the front wheel through a reduction gearbox and chain. A tubular column at the front of the vehicle allowed it to be steered, and pushing it downwards applied the brakes. A separate hand-brake was also fitted, and the single front wheel was mounted so that it could be turned through a wide angle, giving exceptional manoeuvrability. Between 1948 and 1952, the company sold a large number of Graiseley PCVs to United Dairies. In 1953 they demonstrated a stillage truck at the Factory Equipment Exhibition in London. It had a motor, and two speeds. The platform, which was above ground level, could be raised to . They also showed battery electric road vehicles at an exhibition organised by the South Eastern Electricity Board and the Electric Vehicle Association. In 1954 they added another stillage truck, the XL1, to their range, showcasing it at the Mechanical Handling Exhibition at Olympia. They showcased their GP20 pedestrial controlled pallet truck at the same exhibition two years later. Manufacture of the vehicles ceased at Wolverhampton around 1960, when Diamond Motors were liquidated. Acquisition Graiseley were listed in Commercial Motor's directory of vehicle manufacturers in 1960, but in 1969, when two Graiseley trucks were exhibited at the Materials Handling Exhibition, held in the Kelvin Hall, Glasgow, the manufacturer was called Lister Graiseley. By 1971, Graiseley vehicles were manufactured by Gough Industrial Trucks Ltd of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. They were listed as producing pedestrian operated refuse trucks, hospital service vehicles, and industrial trucks. Preservation There are at least two Graiseley vehicles still in existence. The first is a 1951/52 Model 90 which was supplied to United Dairies in London and carried the registration number XMP 457. In the early 1960s, when United Dairies were scrapping PCVs in favour of ride-on milk floats, this one was overhauled and repainted, to be transferred to a cheese manufactory at Swepstone, Leicestershire run by Wilts United Dairies. It was used for internal transport within the facility until its closure in 1975. The works manager, Walter Grewcock, bought it and parked it in his garden, where it rested until 2001, when his son donated it to The Transport Museum, Wythall. It was moved to the museum in January 2002, and was put on display in June 2006 after a thorough restoration. The second is a PCV float which is on display at the Atwell-Wilson Motor Museum, Calne, Wiltshire. It was owned by Calne Dairies and carries the registration number OPP 886. The registration number indicates that is was first registered between July 1951 and July 1952 in Buckinghamshire.

The series of life-size portraits was painted between 1641 and 1658.G√°llego, Juli√°n; Gudiol, Jos√© (1987). Zurbar√°n. London: Alpine Fine Arts Collection, Ltd. pp. 353‚Äì354. . Twelve of the thirteen paintings are in Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, England, and one is in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. The series traveled to the Americas for the first time in 2016, to be displayed at the Meadows Museum in Dallas, Texas, from 17 September 2017 until 7 January 2018, and then in New York City at the Frick Collection from 31 January until 22 April 2018. Paintings The depiction of Jacob and his sons in epic portraits in unusual for the era. More commonly, artists, including Ribera and Vel√°zquez, included these men in narrative painting of Biblical episodes. According to art historian Jeannine Baticle, a series of Jacob and his sons survives in the possession of the Orden Tercera de San Francisco in Lima, Peru, which she describes as a \\"fairly close replica\\" of the Auckland Zurbar√°n series. An additional series, \\"a more distant and awkward imitation\\" by an imitator, is in the possession of the Academia de Bellas Artes in Puebla, Mexico. History It is not known how the paintings reached England, although some speculate that they may have been captured by English pirates while traveling from the painter's studio in Seville to a buyer in a Spanish colony in the Americas. The series is first recorded in 1722 as part of the estate of one William Chapman. It was later owned by London Banker James Mendez, whose heirs sold twelve of the thirteen to Richard Trevor, Bishop of Durham in 1757. Bishop Trevor, a political liberal and a backer of the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753, acquired the paintings, and redesigned and reconstructed the Long Dining Room at Auckland Palace, as a public statement of his support for Jewish naturalization rights. Although the Bill was quickly repealed, the paintings still hang in the Long Dining at Auckland. The portrait of one of Jacob's sons, Benjamin, was sold separately to the Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven; it hangs in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. Bishop Trevor commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy painting of \\"Benjamin\\". It hangs, with Jacob and the other eleven sons, in the Castle's Long Dining Room, which Bishop Trevor rebuilt for the purpose of displaying the pictures. 21st century In 2001 the Church Commissioners voted to sell the paintings, a decision that was revoked in 2011 following a donation of ¬£15 million by investment manager and philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer; new arrangements placed the paintings, along with the castle, under the Auckland Castle Trust, making them available to the public after centuries during which they hung in a private home where they could be seen only by invited guests or by special arrangement with the Bishop's staff.Jonathan Garnier Ruffer bio at Debrett's People of Today www.ft.com Gallery Jacob (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgJacob Reuben (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgReuben Simeon (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgSimeon Levi (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgLevi Judah (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgJudah Dan (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgDan Naphtali (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgNaphtali Gad (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgGad Asher (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgAsher Issachar (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgIssachar Zebulun (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgZebulun Joseph (Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgJoseph Benjamin (after Francisco de Zurbar√°n).jpgBenjamin References External links Paintings by Francisco de Zurbar√°n Painting series ","title":"Jacob and his twelve sons"},{"id":"51215121","text":"Sharon Christian (1950 ‚Äì July 6, 2015; also known by her married name, Sharon Holmes) was a Canadian artist known for her paintings and sculptures, many of which document intimate encounters with nature. Christian developed a unique style \\"beyond realism\\" through which she advanced a number of themes including the tension between urban and natural environments, and the relationships between contemporary art (including music), historical traditions, and individual experience. Christian documented the changing landscape and demographics of Western Canada. Early life Christian was born in Alberta and most active in Western Canada: in Calgary and West Vancouver. She studied at the University of Calgary and the Alberta College of Art. Career Christian was elected into the Canadian Society for Painters in Water Colour in 1980, and showed regularly as a signature member in CSPWC shows. Three of Christian's pieces, acquired in 1977, 1984, and 1990, are included in the Alberta Foundation for the Arts: Summer Haze and A Time of Festivity (under her married name, Sharon Holmes), and Hitching up Barney and Big Boy. Christian came to attention in the 1980s, with reviews by the art historian Brooks Joyner in the Calgary Herald and by Carol Fleming in the journal Arts West. Joyner wrote: \\"Holmes‚Äô paintings deal with rural artifacts as they are overcome by nature. She feels the earth reclaims her own, the elements and the seasons gather and enfold these discards, making them beautiful as they take on a patina of green, russet and gold.‚Äô The art movement New Sincerity, dating to the early 1980s, was similarly concerned with breaking away from post- modern irony and cynicism.

The cult's leader, who has several names but is typically called Michel, is claimed to have abused his followers. The film uses footage Allen shot during his capacity as the group's videographer and new footage of interviews with former members and of the group in Hawaii. The film premiered on January 25, 2016 at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and saw a limited theatrical release in May 2016. It was picked up for broadcast by CNN and aired on September 1, 2016. It was selected for competition at the Sundance Film Festival.  Background  When Will Allen, then 22, was forced to leave home in 1985 after his mother learned he was gay, his sister invited him to join a local alternative community and meditation group in West Hollywood, California she had been attending for nine months. The group, led by Michel Rostand, eventually grew to one hundred members and began calling itself Buddhafield. Michel, born Jaime Gomez, was the son of a wealthy Venezuelan rancher; Michel had traveled to Hollywood in search of stardom. Michel landed a nonspeaking role in 1968's Rosemary's Baby, purportedly danced with Oakland Ballet, and apparently participated in adult films. A film school graduate, Allen became Michel's documentarian and, as it is often described, propaganda minister. The group relocated to Austin, Texas in 1992 and then to Oahu, Hawaii. Allen left the group in 2007, after 22 years. In 2016, eighty-five to over 100 followers remained with Michel in Hawaii.  Production  After leaving the group in 2007, Allen suffered a crisis and felt directionless. He attended the Sundance Film Festival, where he viewed films including Keep the Lights On. He felt he found a new community, and \\"thankful to see someone take their own life and put it up on-screen,\\" he sought to do the same with his experiences in Buddhafield. He created Holy Hell over four years. Allen left much of his footage with the group and had only 35 hours of edited footage of Buddhafield. He used this footage to create the documentary. Cinematographer Polly Morgan shot new footage of Michel and his followers in Hawaii by hiding in bushes, which she described as the greatest challenge in shooting the documentary. For this, she preferred small, inexpensive, and lightweight cameras that would be non-obstructive during filming, and she noted she used a 70-200mm zoom lens for long lens photography while hiding in the bushes. The production also filmed new interviews with former members of the cult.  Release  Holy Hell premiered at the Temple Theatre on January 25, 2016 during the Sundance Film Festival. The film later saw limited theatrical release on May 27, 2016. It was picked up for broadcast by CNN and aired on September 1, 2016.  Critical reception  The film was selected for competition at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and 2016 Nashville Film Festival. Music used in the documentary The documentary features two popular songs: a cover of \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" by Blue Swede and \\"Chasing Cars\\" by Snow Patrol. \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" plays at the beginning as footage is shown of members of the cult outdoors reaching for the sun in a euphoric and trance-like state as the song's refrain \\"I'm hooked on a feeling, I'm high on believing\\" plays on. \\"Chasing Cars\\" plays on toward the end of the documentary as ex-members of the cult are seen dancing in a field and while crying.\\"DARK SIDE OF THE POWER OF BELIEF IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN ‚ÄúHOLY HELL‚Äù\\" Retrieved September 5, 2016.\\"Review: Riveting And Fascinating Cult Documentary ‚ÄòHoly Hell‚Äô\\" Retrieved September 5, 2016.

The radar is named as the Star of the Sea (Hai- Zhi-Xing, Êµ∑‰πãÊòü) by its developer and it is one of the two competitors for PLAN‚Äôs SAPARS (Shipborne Active Phased Array Radar System) project/program. Due to its secrecy and lack of information, Type 346 radar has been frequently but erroneously confused with a Chinese fire control radar Type 348, and mistakenly identified as Type 348 by many sources. Furthermore, it is also frequently confused with and misidentified as Sea Lion series C-band phased array radars developed by another design house. Several models in the Type 346 series have been developed. When Star of the Sea was selected as the winner of SAPARS and accepted into Chinese service, it received the Chinese naval designation for the entire radar system as H/LJG-346 or Type 346 for short. The NATO reporting name for Type 346 radar is Dragon Eye. Development history The development of Type 346 radar is marred with fierce competition between the two contenders, the 14th Research Institute in Nanjing, also known as Nanjing Institute of Electronic Technology (Âçó‰∫¨ÁîµÂ≠êÊäÄÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of China Electronics Technology Group (CETG), or 14th Institute for short, and the 23rd Research Institute of the 2nd Research Academy of CASIC, or 23rd Institute for short. When the program begun in the late 1980s in the era where military spending is drastically reduced, the program was extremely lucrative in that not only winner would be rewarded 210 million ¬• developmental fund, but another additional 20 million ¬• for infrastructure investment. As a result, the bid between the two had expanded beyond the normal technical competition, but ended up in political struggle that involved the top brass of the Chinese leadership, which caused years of delay and almost killed the program. Initial phase The eventual winner, the 14th Institute, was experienced in developing phased array radar, and the final radar equipped Chinese destroyers is based on experience gained in the two previous phased array radars. Near the end of Iran‚ÄìIraq War, both countries asked China to develop a large early warning phased array radar within two to three years respectively for each country. 14th Institute was assigned to complete the task, and mobilized all the available resources at the time to complete the program, with the general engineer of the 14th Institute Mr. Zhang Guang-Yi (Âº†ÂÖâ‰πâ, the general designer of the first Chinese phased array ballistic missile early warning radar Type 7010) was assigned as the program manager. Ms. Wang Jun (ÁéãÂÜõ) and Mr. Zhang Ya-Peng (Âº†‰∫öÊúã) were assigned as the general designer and the deputy general designer of the L-band Type 893. Meanwhile, Mr. Li Zhi-Ming (ÊùéÊ≤ªÈì≠) and Mr. Diao Chen-Xi (ÂàÅÊô®Êõ¶) were assigned as the general designer and the deputy general designer of the P-band Type 894. However, as both designs were completed and production was just about to be commenced, orders for both radars were cancelled in 1989 due to the end of Iran-Iraq War. The cancellation of foreign orders did not spell the end of the program because domestic Chinese need had filled in the void. In November 1989, two 14th Institute staff, Mr. Sun Xian-Zhang (Â≠ôÂÆ™Á´†), the general designer of Type 1461 phased array radar, and Mr. Cai Ben-Yao (Ëî°Êú¨ËÄÄ) attended a conference on the radar for Type 052B destroyer in Sanya hosted by the Equipment Department of PLAN. Preliminary proposal by 14th Institute was to adopt a S-band APAR, which was approved. Due to age and illness, Mr. Sun Xian-Zhang retired after securing 14th Institute as a contender of the naval radar program, and others were assigned to take over, with Ms. Wang Jun as the general designer, and Mr. Diao Chen-Xi as the deputy general designer. In the early summer of 1991, the then head of Equipment Department of PLAN, rear admiral He Pengfei (Ë¥∫ÈπèÈ£û, son of late Field Marshal He Long) met with the team of 14th Institute at 3rd Directorate of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department in Beijing. Admiral He informed the team that the range of Chinese radars onboard PLAN ship was only several dozen kilometers while radar ranges of radars onboard Japanese and Taiwanese warships was two hundred to three hundred kilometers. In the event of war, PLAN ships would be sunk before they could detect enemy ships, so it would be imperative for Chinese radar developers to develop a phased array radar to boost the combat capability of PLAN. To meet this requirement of PLAN that would eventually become PLAN's SAPARS (Shipborne Active Phased Array Radar System) project/program, the 14th institute presented the development and research results since November 1989, and Mr. Zhang Guang-Yi informed PLAN that based on the size limitation of the radar antenna (4 meter √ó 4 meter) onboard Type 052B destroyer, a S-band APAR would have a range in excess of 300 km, 50% higher than the original PLAN requirement of 200 km. The 14th Institute was not the first contender of APAR, instead, 23rd Institute was. The original PLAN requirement of the radar range was only two hundred kilometers, and this was based on the design provided by the 23rd Institute, which was a C-band APAR. When 14th Institute joined the bid, its research had revealed that a C-band APAR could not meet the two hundred kilometer range requirement. After two rounds of evaluation held at Fragrant Hills, PLAN favored the 14th Institute and asked the latter to provide a sample within three to five years. The then deputy director of the 14th Institute Mr. Bao Yang-Hao (ÂåÖÂÖªÊµ©) and the then deputy general engineer of the 14th Institute Mr. Hua Hai-Gen (ÂçéÊµ∑Ê†π) reassigned the personnel in October 1991 to form the project team. In March 1992, the prototype of the S-band APAR was designated as Type 115. The original design adopted a layout similar to that of AN/APQ-53 radar of MIM-104 Patriot, with a main S-band array with a total of 3456 transceivers and a small C-band array to control HQ-9 SAM including such as TVM, ARH and SARH. The design was tentatively approved by PLAN for the initial two hundred kilometer range requirement, but after further discussion, the 14th Institute was tasked to upgrade the design to extend the maximum range to three hundred kilometers by the PLAN evaluation team headed by rear admiral Zhao Deng-Ping (ËµµÁôªÂπ≥), the son-in-law of late Senior General Chen Geng. Design upgrade The requirement for Type 115 radar was to operate with the elevation form 0¬∞ to 90¬∞, scanning sector of ¬± 60¬∞ when the ship was rolling at ¬± 20¬∞. The 14th Institute formed a team to complete the prototype with members including Wang Jun as the general designer, Diao Chen-Xi as the deputy general designer, Duan Qing-Ren (ÊÆµÂ∫Ü‰ªÅ) as the chief reliability engineer, Chen Hong-Yuan (ÈôàÊ¥™ÂÖÉ) as the chief structural engineer, Li Heng-Zhao (Êùé‰∫®Êò≠) as the chief manufacture engineer, Chen Zhen- Cheng (ÈôàÊåØÊàê) as the transceiver design engineer, and Chen Hong (ÈôàÁ∫¢) as the general designer of the antenna feeders. Experts from 724th Institute, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Nanjing University of Science and Technology were invited to evaluate, and based on their input, design was modified accordingly. The resulting modification resulted in the increase of transceivers from the original 3456 per face to 4768 per face with increased range. In early June 1992, a team of 14th Institute went to Fragrant Hills for the third time to report the progress, and after two days of presentation, PLAN representatives at the conference informed the team on June 10, 1992 that they would recommend to their superior to select 14th Institute as the contractor of SAPARS. The following month, another team from the 14th Institute subsequently visited the 701st Institute, the design bureau of Type 052B destroyer, and met with the general designer of Type 052 destroyer (and later Type 052C destroyer) Mr. Yuan Du-Lei (Ë¢ÅÊï¶Âûí, succeed Mr. Pan Jing-Fu [ÊΩòÈïúËäô] as Mr. Pan retired) and the radar system engineer Ms. Xi Xiu-Juan (Â•öÁßÄÂ®ü) to discuss system integration issues. However, the competitor of 14th Institute, the 23rd Institute, accused the 14th Institute would not be able to produce the solid state transceivers in time to meet the PLAN requirement, and being the first of its kind developed in China, PLAN also worried about the potential failure, and informed 14th Institute to develop the solid state transceivers first, or else it would receive any funding for further development. Although the 14th Institute had previously successfully developed solid state L-band transceivers, the new S-band with shorter wavelength presented greater challenge in that the new transceiver must be more compact and more resistant to interference. The 14th Institute formed a project team to develop the new transceiver, with the following members: designer of the circulator is Zhang Fu-Qiong (Âº†Á¶èÁêº), assisted by Mo Jia-Ming (Ëé´ÂÆ∂Èì≠). Guo Yan- Ling (ÈÉ≠Ëâ≥Áé≤) was put in charge of structural, weight & ECM, assisted by Liang Heng-Xin (Ê¢ÅÊÅíÂøÉ) and Huang Xin-Fu (ÈªÑÂÖ¥ÂØå). Niu Bao-Jun (ÁâõÂÆùÂêõ) was in charge of antenna, assisted by Sun Mao-You (Â≠ôËåÇÂèã). Chen Zhen-Cheng as the transmitter module designer, and Yu Hong-Biao (‰∫éÊ¥™Ê†á) as the receiver module designer, assisted by Gu Zhong-Ru (È°æ‰ª≤Ê±ù). Ma Heng-Tai (È©¨ÊÅíÊ≥∞) as the phase shifting module designer, with Shi Mei-Ling (ÊñΩÁæéÁé≤) handles the control portion. Ding You-Shi (‰∏ÅÂèãÁü≥) was put in charge of microelectronics. The design team begun its hectic workload/schedule in September 1992. Due to the technological bottlenecks China faced in the early 1990s, it was impossible to provide the power source for every single transceiver of the APAR. Instead, the design team took an approach similar to that of British MESAR and Israeli EL/M-2075 APARs by group four transceivers into a transmitting/receiving (T/R) module with 100W peak power, and each T/R module was powered by its own power source. Each T/R module was sized twenty centimeter in width, five centimeter in thickness and forty-five centimeter in length. By April 1993, the team finally successfully developed the required T/R module, which eventually won 2nd place Science and Technology Advancement Award given by the Ministry of Electronic Industry of China in 1994. Early evaluation & redesign The successful development of T/R module would normally signal the progress to the next stage of the development, and the 14th Institute mistakenly believed that PLAN would grant the developmental funds for further development. However, this was not meant to be because politics came into play. To fight for the huge developmental fund and the associated fund for infrastructure development, the other competitor of SAPARS, the 23rd Institute collected potential shortfalls of S-band radar and thru political maneuver, successfully obtained the support from then Chinese premier Li Peng, who was once the head aerospace ministry, the predecessor of CASIC and parent company of the 23rd Institute. Under the political pressure, another round of evaluation by 10 academicians of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) were held in May 1994, and academicians included radars specialist Chen Yun-Fang (ÈôàËä≥ÂÖÅ), Mao Er-Ke (ÊØõ‰∫åÂèØ), Bao Zheng (‰øùÈìÆ), Wang Xiao-Mo (ÁéãÂ∞èË∞ü), and Wang Yue (ÁéãË∂ä). Also included was destroyer designer Pan Jing-Fu (ÊΩòÈïúËäô) and missile specialist Xu Chang-Lin (ÂæêÈïøÊûó). The S-band APAR design with a maximum range of three hundred seventy-five kilometer range of the 14th Institute was clearly technically superior than the C-band APAR design of the 23rd Institute, which only has a maximum range of a hundred twenty kilometers, just approximately a third of range requirement while the S-band APAR design exceeded the original three hundred kilometer range requirement by 25%. However, the academicians‚Äô votes were not unanimous. Academician Bao Zheng, Wang Xiao-Mo, Xu Chang-Lin, Pan Jing-Fu favored the S-band design, but Academician Mao Er-Ke and Chen Yun-Fang favored the C-band design, because Aerospace Ministry ordered its employee Chen Yun-Fang to vote for the C-band design and promised a reward after his vote. Aerospace Ministry also helped Mao Er-Ke in obtaining his academician title and he voted for C-band design in return. Academician Wang Yue was the general designer of a competing design offered by 206th Institute competing against 14th Institutes earlier for Type 373 counter-battery radar, which the 14th Institute won with the design by the deputy general engineer of the 14th Institute Wang Dechun (ÁéãÂæ∑Á∫Ø) at the time so Wang Yue voted abstention. Due to the voting outcome by academicians were not unanimous, the general designer of 052B/C destroyers Mr. Yuan Dun-Lei could not make the final decision, and PLAN once again delayed its decision to require further studies of both design. In addition to the outcome of first evaluation by CAS academicians, there was another hurdle: 23rd Institute, the developer of HHQ-9, changed the parameters and requirements of HHQ-9, so system integration of APAR and the SAM system would thus encountered additional obstacles. Two of the major changes are the weakening of HHQ-9 tracking signal and the tracking range of HHQ-9 respectively. For the signal tracking, the signal is greatly reduced ostensively to reduce the probability of being intercepted by enemy. For the tracking range increase, it was ostensively due to the range of HHQ-9 has being increased by several dozen kilometers, so tracking range must be increased accordingly. Though these two changes appeared to be legitimate, the changes were made after the parameters of HHQ-9 were already set when the bid first started, and the change of the original requirement were viewed by both the 14th Institute and PLAN evaluation team as a willfully generated obstacle to prevent 14th Institute from winning due to the political interference from the very top level of the Chinese government. Unreasonable as it was, 14th Institute was forced to once again revise its design to meet the new requirement that was more stringent. If not, its competitor 23rd Institute would have a chance to field its design. The proposal of the 23rd Institute appeared to be a compromise, with the S-band APAR of the 14th Institute as search and track radar, and its own C-band APAR for missile control. This twin radar concept of the 23rd Institute would increase the weight of the superstructure tremendously, a problem 23rd Institute recommended to be left for the general designer of the destroyer to solve. Obviously this could not be achieved in the short frame of time, and in order to meet the original schedule of delivery PLAN desperately needed, decision was made to import Russian MR-710 Fregat (meaning frigatebird) radar (NATO reporting name: Top Plate) for installation onboard Type 052B destroyers first, and APAR would have to wait until later for Type 052C destroyers. Knowing the twin-radar design was not feasible at all, the 14th Institute design team was determined to win. The original Star of the Sea design consisted of two active arrays: an octagon S-band array with diameter of four meters for search and track, and a much smaller C-band active array with diameter of 60 centimeters for missile control. With an area approximately 0.3 square meter, the small C-band array could not effectively control the HHQ-9 SAM with the increased range and reduced tracking signal. A larger C-band array was needed. The 14th Institute design team abolished the small C-band array, and adopted two larger 0.2 meter by four meter rectangular arrays, and in terms of area, each C-band array is more than two and half time of the original small array with diameter of 0.6 meter. The redesigned APAR fully met the latest requirement of HHQ-9. After two more rounds of discussion between PLAN and the two competitors held in March 1994 and August 1994 respectively, the redesigned Star of the Sea was finalized and submitted to Department of Equipment of PLAN in October 1994. However, there was no response for two months after the submittal because 23rd Institute was exerting political maneuvers through its mother company CASIC in an attempt to influence the then Chinese premier Li Peng to make its decision that would favor its C-band design. In response, the 14th Institute had to resort some political maneuver of its own for help by directly writing to Admiral Liu Huaqing and then Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin, who was the former head of the Electronic Ministry, the predecessor of CETG. Finally in April 1995, PLAN notified the 14th Institute by telephone that another round of evaluation would be conducted in the following month. Final evaluation & further redesign Another round of evaluation on SAPARS competitors lasted three days from May 4 thru May 6, 1995. This time, the CAS academicians selected were kept secret to prevent anyone from be bribed or politically pressure/influence. It was after this evaluation the 14th Institute was basically selected as the winner, with the exception of some additional technical details to be ironed out, which was successfully handled in the two subsequent conferences with PLAN held in August and October 1995 respectively. On November 7, 1995, 14th Institute was declared as the winner of the SAPARS competition and radar was given the PLAN designation H/LJG-346 or Type 346 for short, along with the 280 million ¬• developmental fund, which was a third increase from the original 210 million ¬• originally planned. Due to the advancement in the Chinese microelectronics industry, the design of the T/R module was drastically improved, with the length of each module reduce from forty-five centimeter to forty centimeter, and with the utilization of newly developed material, the weight of each module was also greatly reduced. Based on this progress, Star of the Sea APAR went through yet another redesign in March 1996 by increasing transceivers in each face from 4768 to more than five thousands. As a result, the maximum range was increased a further seven percent to more than four hundred kilometers. Additional transceivers in each face of the antenna also meant more power, which helped to reduce the disproportionally high allocation of power (up to thirty percent) for SAM handling. The additional power would enable to further expand the multi-functionality of the radar. As Type 346 development continued, 14th Institute team went another personnel change. Due to the urgent need of integrating Russian MR-710 radar to Type 052B destroyer, the original general designer Wan Jun was reassigned as the general engineer of this program, and later on, deputy general designer Diao Chen-Xi immigrated to Canada in July 1996. Zhou Wan-Xing (Âë®‰∏áÂπ∏) was appointed as the new general designer of Type 346. Half a decade later, in late December 2001, sea trials for the pre- production unit begun in northern China. In April 2002, development suffered a setback in that the radar suddenly stopped working during a trial. After two days of simulation, the problem was identified and resolved. In 2003, the 14th Institute development team spent half a year to resolve the sea clutter problem. In June 2004, final trials for certification begun and successfully concluded in the winter of the same year, with the APAR officially accepted into service one and half a decade later after it first begun. Chinese media only claims it took a decade to develop the APAR, starting in mid-1995 when the 14th Institute was finally selected as the official developer of the SAPARS, but in reality, the program really begun in approximately half a decade earlier in November 1989 when both competitors begun to work on their own respective designs for the bid. Design features Being the first naval APAR developed in China for a prolonged period of fifteen years, the designs of the Star of the Sea radar have experienced several major revisions and the prototype differs significantly from the production version. The very first prototype of the series Type 115 layout similar to that of AN/APQ-53 radar of MIM-104 Patriot that includes two arrays: the main array is the four meter diameter octagon S-band array with a total of 3456 transceivers for searching and tracking, and a small 60 centimeters diameter C-band array with an approximate area of 0.3 square meter to control HHQ-9 SAM via TVM/SARH/ARH. The Space Target Surveillance Phased Array Demonstrator is a derivative of Type 115 with the C-band array deleted because it was intended for tracking objects in space after the enlargement for the planned production version. As the control requirement of HHQ-9 became more stringent, the design of Type 115 proved to be inadequate and the production versions adopted a different array layout instead. The production version of Star of the Sea radar have a new S-band array with more than five thousand transceivers in each face, with increased range in excess of four hundred kilometers. This main S-band array is sandwiched between two rows of C-band arrays, each with size of 0.2 meter by four meter. The two C-band arrays are used to control HHQ-9 SAMs. The first production version of Star of the Sea is Type 346 on Type 052C destroyers and it utilizes air cooling system, which is replaced by liquid cooling system in its successor Type 346A onboard Type 052D destroyers. Type 346 inherits the design feature of the prototype of grouping four transceivers into a 100W peak power T/R module with its own power source. The efficacy of the Type 346 as deployed on the Type 052D destroyer against contemporary tactical low- observable (\\"stealth\\") aircraft is uncertain. Stealth aircraft are optimized against higher-frequency radar bands (C, X, and Ku), but features like the tail-fin may be susceptible to lower S- or L-band frequencies. However, the large resolution cells of S- or L-band radar may not be able to generate missile guidance track at tactically significant distances; refining the resolution be networking multiple low-frequency radars may help address this. Variants Four variants of Type 346 series have been revealed (as of 2016): *Type 115: Prototype of Type 346 series with a large S-band array and a small C-band array in a layout similar to AN/APQ-53 radar of MIM-104 Patriot. *Space target surveillance phased array demonstrator: a small light weight technology demonstrator with 128 T/R modules for a planned large APAR with 30 meter diameter array intended as the successor of the retired Type 7010 ballistic early warning radar. This model lacks the C-band array for fire control because it is a searching/tracking-only radar. It is not clear if the program has progressed beyond the prototype stage. *Type 346: First naval version with a large S-band array sandwiched between two rows of C-band arrays, utilizing air cooling system and identifiable by the curved surface of the cover of the radar array. Installed onboard Type 052C destroyers. *Type 346A: Development of Type 346 with increased number of T/R module and increased range, utilizing liquid cooling system and identifiable by the flat surface of the cover of the radar array. Installed onboard Type 052D destroyer and Type 002 aircraft carrier. *Type 346B: Development of Type 346A intended for larger warship. Installed onboard Type 055 destroyers.

Three people were killed and one person was injured. Afterwards, the gunman fled the scene. Ninety minutes after the shooting, a suspect, identified as 19-year-old Allen Christopher Ivanov, was arrested near Chehalis. On August 2, he was charged with aggravated murder, attempted murder, and assault; and he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges on August 22. On December 19, 2016, Ivanov pleaded guilty to the killings. On January 12, 2017, Ivanov was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The shooting led to calls for gun control in Washington state.  Shooting  Before the shooting, a house party was being held in Mukilteo. About fifteen to twenty university and high school students, most of them graduates, were in attendance. The gunman arrived at the party at around 10:00 p.m. and observed the party unarmed. After some time, he retrieved his rifle, crept around the side of the house, and concealed himself along a wall near the living room. He was discovered by Jacob Long, who he shot and killed just after midnight. Jake was hit 3 times in the back after saying \\"no, no, no\\". He collapsed and died next to the pathway on the ground. Ivanov continued firing outside, wounding Will Kramer but Will was able to escape by crawling away. Attention turned towards Jordan Ebner who was also shot outside. Ivanov then walked in through patio doors to where Anna Bui was sitting at a kitchen table. He shot her multiple times point blank with some shots hitting her face. Afterwards, the gunman went upstairs to a balcony on the master bedroom, and began firing down onto two men, grazing the leg of the young man, whose parents owned the house. The two men escaped. During the shooting, some survivors hid and contacted their relatives. A total of three people were killed and one other person was injured. Right after the shooting, the suspect fled the house after realizing he had run out of ammunition. Local detectives tracked him down by pinging his cellphone and contacting the Washington State Patrol for assistance. Ninety minutes later, he was arrested without incident by state troopers on an interstate near Chehalis, over away from the crime scene. An AR-15-type rifle and two magazines were recovered from his vehicle.  Perpetrator and victims   Perpetrator  Allen Christopher Ivanov, a 19-year-old software engineer and student at the University of Washington Bothell, was identified as the suspect in the shooting. Days before the shooting, he made troubling posts on his Twitter account and also posted Instagram photos of a rifle and three bullets. He was reportedly familiar to those who attended the party. According to a LinkedIn profile, Ivanov attended Kamiak High School from 2011 to 2015, and was the founder of a company that described itself as \\"an open source laser tag system\\". About a week before the shooting, Ivanov purchased the rifle he used, and then purchased a second magazine on the day prior. According to court documents, right before committing the shooting, Ivanov read the rifle's manual. He also sent text messages to his friends, including one in Tennessee, alluding to his plans to commit a mass shooting a couple of days beforehand, calling himself a \\"future shooter\\". Police say he was motivated by the recent breakup between him and one of the victims, and his anger that his ex- girlfriend seemed to be moving along in her life.  Victims  The victims were identified as: *Anna Bui, 19, a University of Washington Bothell student from Everett, who was also reportedly Ivanov's ex-girlfriend. Alt URL *Jordan Ebner, 19, of Lake Stevens. *Jake Long, 19, of Everett. *Will Kramer, 18, a University of Washington student from Mukilteo who was seriously injured and taken to Harborview Medical Center for treatment. He was released from the hospital on August 15.  Legal proceedings  After his arrest, police said Ivanov confessed to committing the shooting, but initially added that it was an accident, and that he had been confused that night and therefore not thinking straight. He was held in Snohomish County Jail on suspicion of one count of aggravated first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree murder, and one count of attempted first-degree murder. During a court appearance on August 1, Ivanov's lawyer questioned the ease of his client to legally purchase an AR-15 with a high-capacity magazine while he is still not legally able to drink alcohol. Ivanov was not granted bail. On the next day, he was charged with three counts of aggravated first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and one charge of first-degree assault. On August 22, he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. His next court appearance was scheduled on December 19. On that day, Ivanov pleaded guilty to the killings, reportedly before prosecutors had made a decision on whether or not to pursue a death sentence against him. On January 12, 2017, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Ivanov is currently imprisoned in the Washington State Penitentiary.https://www.doc.wa.gov/information/inmate-search/default.aspx  Reactions  Mayor Jennifer Gregerson said that the Mukilteo community was \\"shaken to its core\\". Governor Jay Inslee sent his condolences to the victims' families and the survivors, praised the actions of law enforcement, and declared his support for Mukilteo during the investigation. The University of Washington also released a statement in reaction to the shooting. A total of 200 people attended a vigil at Kamiak High School on the day after the shooting. Another vigil was held at a local church, which was attended by 800 people, including Governor Inslee, who made a statement mentioning gun violence in the country. The flags at Mukilteo City Hall were lowered to half- mast. On August 26, people familiar with the victims gathered to organize a benefit concert for their families. Following the shooting, an alliance, titled Mukilteo Strong Alliance, was formed by Mukilteo residents. Its plans were to create a permanent memorial in honor of the victims, as well as finding ways for the community to heal and move forward. Its first meeting was held on September 20 and attended by family and friends of the victims, non- profit organizations, and counselors. On September 7, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson cited the shooting when he called on the Washington State Legislature to pass a state law barring the sales of assault weapons like the one used in the shooting, restricting magazines carrying over ten rounds, and requiring persons buying ammunition to undergo a background check, saying such a measure \\"will save lives\\". The parents of injured victim Will Kramer, who are supporters of a Washington-based gun control advocacy group, urged people to remember the victims of gun violence and for lawmakers to support Ferguson's proposal. The proposal received opposition from the National Rifle Association.

His work was influenced by the writings and friendship of Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley before he moved to San Francisco in the mid-60s where he co-founded Poets Theater with Jim Wilson, edited the small press magazine Bricoleur, and produced radio programs for KPFA in Berkeley from 1967-71. Reviews and accolades Poet Michael McClure has referred to Gitin as \\"an obsessed, serious artist who has never lost his light heart and deep passion, and who has been among those of us who have cared since the early sixties\\" and said that \\"the surface and tensile qualities of the poems are gorgeous . . . the refinement of a master\\". The American Library Association calls Gitin an original and says \\" he focuses on detail and precise motion of moments\\" and \\"looks beyond what is at hand, either within his own sensibility or reflected in time\\". The Small Press Review says that Gitin is \\"a master of plugging us into how objects actually relate, on both the micro-scales and the larger integrities that make up 'the world'\\". Cid Corman wrote to David Gitin \\"I'm partial to such quietness - where words are allowed to say what the poet has felt in startling upon them. Each word a flame in the bonfire around which night gathers us in the end.\\" A.R. Ammons said \\"You (Gitin) touch a sort of Zen infinitude.\\" And Carl Rakosi said, \\"Mr. Gitin understands what is poetically worth observing...the minimum for giving one a lift...and what would be too much.\\" George Oppen said, \\"assembled 'against the wall' [the poems] spell out, and frequently with brilliant precision, 'what has happened.'Stanford: http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft7v19n8w4/entire_text/ \\"Spare, lyric, and haunting - these poems offer the starkest of silhouettes, the obscurest of shadows.

The bridge was built in 1934, its trusses manufactured by the American Bridge Company at its plant in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. Although the Warren pony truss was a common bridge type in Vermont into the 1920s, changing manufacturing techniques and standardization of bridge types by the state meant that its use was in decline in the state when this bridge was built. It replaced a wooden bridge at the same location, and the truss form was probably selected due to the impracticality of designs for this location that required the supporting elements to be beneath the bridge deck. Some of the labor for the bridge's construction may have been given by townspeople in lieu of property tax payments.

The successors of the neolithic cultures of the island were able to maintain their distinctive traditions even into Roman times, despite the successive interventions of Etruscans, Carthaginians or Phoenicians, and Greeks. A long period of Roman rule was followed by renewed conflict for control of the island by the Vandals, Byzantines and Saracens.  Geography and etymology  In Roman times the sea surrounding Corsica on the north and west was called the Mare Ligusticum, that to the east was the Mare Tyrrhenum and the strait separating the island from Sardinia to the south was the Fretum Gallicum. The location of the island between the Italian mainland to the east, the Gallic mainland to the north, and Sardinia to the south, made Corsica an important strategic point for control of the western Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the island was a significant hub of Mediterranean trade. Corsica was described by TheophrastusHistoria plantarum 5.8 as thickly wooded and mountainous. Only the flat, coastal area was suitable for agriculture - especially the space around Aleria on the east coast - the island mainly produced timber and raw materials like copper, iron ore, silver, lead, pitch, wax, and honey. Excepting these products, the island was considered pretty poor, the climate was considered unhealthy and malarial, especially in summer, and generally rough and uncomfortable.Bechert: Die Provinzen des r√∂mischen Reiches, pp. 61f. The island was known in Ancient Greek as Kyrnos (ŒöœçœÅŒΩŒøœÇ) and in Latin as Cyrnus or Corsica. Kyrnos may be derived from a local, Corsican toponym. Scholarship is divided on an origin from a pre-Roman Corsican language word, kors-, meaning 'treetop' according to Eustathius, or rather *krs- (head). The Romans would have added the suffix -ica to this term, while the Greeks added -nos. Another possibility is that the name derives from the Phoenician term Korsai, meaning 'wooded'.Gerhard Radke, \\"Corsica,\\" Der Kleine Pauly, Vol. 1 (1964), col. 1324.  Early settlement  Area of Corsica as a result of the lower sea level at the time of the island's settlement from Elba to the north. Palaggiu - also known as the Campu dei Morti (cemetery). Chronology of the Corsican megaliths. Settlement of Corsica is attested as far back as the 8th millennium BC. The original inhabitants of Corsica were hunter-gatherers from :Liguria, who walked to the island over a land bridge created by the modern islands of Elba and Capraia. Around 6000 BC, they were replaced by the Neolithic Cardium pottery culture. As a result of the W√ºrm glaciation the sea level was about 100 metres lower and the island extended closer to the mainland. Until around 5000 BC, it was connected to Sardinia. In the south of the island, a multiphase megalith culture (Filitosa) developed around 3000 BC. Contacts with Sardinia, Etruria, and Liguria are archaeologically attested in the Neolithic period. Terrina, near Aleria is the key site for the Chalcolithic in Corsica. At this time (around 1600 BC), the Torrean civilization developed on the island, leaving behind numerous dolmens, menhirs, and statue menhirs. As in the inner Iberian peninsula, the Balearic islands, Sardinia, and Malta, the megalith culture continued to dominate the island at this time, even as the rest of Europe was already leaving the stone age.Richard Pittioni, Propyl√§en Weltgeschichte, Vol. 1, p. 275. In the Bronze Age, fixed settlements appear on Corsica, as well as round stone towers, known as torri. The main cultural contacts were with Sardinia and the Italian mainland. Despite these contacts, the development of the island in the Iron Age did not lead to urbanisation. The first settlements developed on the island only in the 9th century BC (Capula, Cuccuruzzu, Modria, and Araguina-Sennola at Bonifacio). According to Diodorus, the inhabitants of island mostly lived as pastoralists. The interior of the island was able to maintain its independence more or less until Roman times.Kulturgeschichte der Antike. Vol. 2: Rom, Berlin 1982.  Greeks, Etruscans and Carthaginians (565-260 BC)  Large-scale urbanisation began only with the settlement of Carthaginians around 565 BC. Herodotus lists the Corsicans among the soldiers of the Carthaginians.Histories 7.165. Around 545 BC, Greeks from PhocaeaThey were also attributed with the foundation of Massillia, Emporion, Nikaia, Athenopolis and Antipolis. founded a city called Alalia (modern Aleria), having fled there following the siege of their home city by the Persians under Harpagus. Even before this, Greeks had probably settled on the island in trading communities, perhaps even colonies, which the Etruscans did not appreciate, so near to their own territories. The Phocaeans were not just traders, but pirates; they disrupted the trade and degraded the economic power of the Etruscans and Carthaginians in southern Gaul, Sardinia and Etruria as a result of their raids, going so far as to attack the Italian mainland. As a result, both of the major powers in the western Mediterranean, the Carthaginians, and the Etruscans under the leadership of Caere, saw the Phocaeans as a threat to their hegemony and went to war against them. In 530 BC, the Phoenicians led their allies in a rapid attack.See Der Neue Pauly. ‚Äì in earlier literature, it is always described as a battle between Greeks and Carthaginians/Etruscans. 540 BC (Wolfgang Schuller, Griechische Geschichte, p. 14) and 535 BC (Propyl√§en Weltgeschichte. Vol. 3, S. 678.) are both given as the year of the battle. Different accounts are given of the outcome of battle. Jochen Bleicken (Propyl√§en Weltgeschichte. vol. 4, p. 45.) speaks of a devastating victory of a Carthaginian-Etruscan coalition, but others report that the Greeks barely scraped a victory but their city was so badly damaged that they had to abandon it (Hermann Bengtson, R√∂mische Geschichte. M√ºnchen 1973, p. 17.). Alfred Heuss (Propyl√§en Weltgeschichte. Vol 3, p. 201) speaks of 'an unclear result.' Their victory in the Battle of Alalia meant that the Greeks had to abandon their city and re-settle in the Campanian city of Elea, founded around 540 BC. Sardinia was incorporated firmly into the Carthaginian sphere and Corsica went to the Etruscans. The Greek colonisation of the western Mediterranean ground to a complete halt with the defeat. Diodorus states that the native inhabitants of Corsica had to give the Etruscans tribute of pitch, wax, and honey.Diodoros 5.13.4 & 11.88.5. At the beginning of the 6th century BC, Alalia had become an Etruscan settlement. Velthus Spurinna probably sent a military expedition there under the leadership of the Tarquinians. At the beginning of the 4th century, it was attacked by Greeks for the last time, commanded by the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse.Alfred Heuss, Propyl√§en Weltgeschichte. Vol. 3, p. 387. For a short time, troops were stationed at the southern end of the island, possibly at Porto Vecchio.Bengtson: R√∂mische Geschichte, p. 39. The Romans were also interested in Corsica even at this early stage. A first attempt to found a Roman colony on the island in 425 BC was a failure.Theophrastus: Historia Plantarum. 5.8.2 and an inscription of a 'Claudius' (Klautie) on an Attic kylix of around 425 BC found in a grave at Casabiada. In 296 BC, the island was used by the Romans as a place of exile for Galerius Torquatus.Theophilos I. FGrH.  Roman Republic (259 - 27 BC)  Corsica in Roman times. Praesidium was the seat of the governors, but Aleria was the largest and most important city. The Roman conquest of Corsica began in 259 BC, when Lucius Cornelius Scipio captured Aleria (Greek 'Alalia') and several Corsican tribes, in the course of the First Punic War. The Roman invasion of the island marked the expansion of the war beyond Sicily to the entire western Mediterranean. In the subsequent peace treaty in 241 BC between the Romans and the defeated Carthaginians, there was no indication that Corsica or Sardinia would pass into the Roman sphere of influence. But, since the Carthaginians were occupied with the Mercenary War, they had no ability to defend them, even when the unrest spread to the nominally Carthaginian island of Sardinia. In the end, the Romans retained both islands. It is not entirely clear whether this control began in 241 BC, but it is certain that the consul for 238/7, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, expanded their dominion over both Corsica and Sardinia, at least in theory. Both islands were treated as a single military region and were administered by a military government. A rebellion in 231 BC was defeated by Gaius Papirius Maso, for which he received the first triumph in monte Albano.Valerius Maximus 3.6.5 ‚Äì since the Senate refused him his triumph, he celebrated one more or less independently on Mons Albanus. In 227 BC, the two islands became the province of Sardinia et Corsica. Control of the two islands functioned as a kind of buffer zone, protecting the Italian mainland from attacks from the west. Sardinia et Corsica was one of the first two provinces, along with Sicilia, to be founded by the Romans, signifying the final stage in Rome's transformation from a city state to a territorial empire. Unlike with their acquisitions in Italy, the Romans did not bring Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily into their alliance system. Instead, they established a governor, with civil and military responsibilities and the rank of praetor. For the management of the two new provinces, two new praetorships were created, which had not existed previously and the system for the expansion of the empire was established. Originally, this was a military administration for when there was conflict on the island only, but the administration simultaneously gained control of civil government as well and became a permanent fixture. The administration of the province was based in the Sardinian city of Cagliari and the first governor was Marcus Valerius Laevinus. The establishment of the province was contrary to the wishes of the local inhabitants, who had maintained their independence up to this time from both Greeks and Carthaginians.Bechert: Die Provinzen des r√∂mischen Reiches, p. 61. In the following decades, there were multiple rebellions and the conquest of the interior of the island claimed much Roman time and energy. The first colonia, Colonia Mariana, was founded by Gaius Marius around 104 BC and further coloniae followed in the course of the 1st century BC. Marius founded his colonia in the northeast of the island, in the land of the Vanacini tribe. Between December 82 and 1 January 80 BC, Sulla also settled colonists on the island, at Aleria, which he named Colonia Veneria Alaria. Denarius of Sextus Pompeius, minted on the occasion of his victory over Octavian's fleet in 37 BC at Messina. On the obverse is the lighthouse of Messina and on the reverse is the mosntrous Scylla. During the Civil War, the island initially belonged to the sphere of Pompey, but was subsequently taken by Julius Caesar. Between 40 and 38 BC, Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey, and his legate Menas occupied the island and terrorised Sardinia, Sicily and even the Italian mainland with a great pirate fleet. Along with the three Triumvirs, Sextus Pompey was one of the four most significant contenders in the warfare after Julius Caesar's death. His fleet largely consisted of thousands of slaves and he also held many strongholds on Corsica. With it, he seriously threatened the Roman grain supply, such that Octavian had to make peace with Sextus Pompey since it was not possible to beat him at the time. In the Pact of Misenum (39 BC), Sextus Pompey was assigned the three islands and Achaia, in return for ending the blockade of the mainland and remaining neutral in the conflict between Octavian and Marc Antony. But Octavian was not satisfied with the area assigned to him and initiated a betrayal which insured that Corsica and Sardinia came into his hands. The conflict erupted anew in 38 BC and Pompey again blockaded the Italian mainland, leading to famine. Later in the same year, Octavian gathered a fleet so powerful that he was able to defeat Sextus Pompey and became ruler of the area again. Corsica remained a private possession of Octavian until the reorganisation of the provinces in 27 BC. The Romans built only one known street on the island, which is located on the east coast and ran from Piantarella in the south, through the headquarters (Praesidium), to Aleria and Mariana.  Roman Empire (27 BC - AD 300)  In Augustus' provincial reforms, Sardinia et Corsica became a senatorial province. The province was administered by a proconsul with the rank of a praetor. In AD 6, a separate senatorial province of Corsica was established, since Augustus had appropriated the island of Sardinia, where a large garrison was kept under arms, as one of his personal provinces. Even after the return of Sardinia to the Senate in AD 67, the two islands remained separate provinces. Aleria had been destroyed by Julius Caesar and was refounded by Augustus between 36 and 27 BC as Colonia Veneria Iulia Pacensis Restituta Tertianorum Aleria. After Corsica became a separate province, this city was the seat of the legatus Augusti. Aleria was also an important naval base. At the city's height, it had a population of around 20,000 people. Remnants of the Roman settlement include the remains of an amphitheatre. Seneca as part of a double herm (first half of the 3rd century AD) Seneca was probably the best-known Roman to spend time on the island as an exile, which he did between AD 41 and 49. At the instigation of Messalina, after conflicting with Caligula and Claudius, he was exiled to the island and remained there for eight years. Only under Nero was he allowed to return to Rome.Bengtson: R√∂mische Geschichte, p. 253. In AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, the island was held by Otho. The procurator of Corsica was Decumus Pacarius, an opponent of Otho, who attempted to take the island, its fleet, and the local notables over to Vitellius. When he encountered resistance, he attempted to crush it by executing Claudius Pyrrichus, the trierarch of the liburnae and the equis Quintus Certus. As a result, the Corsicans swore an oath of allegiance to Vitellius, very unwillingly. But when Decumus Pacarius began recruiting soldiers, there was a rebellion, which cost him his life. This conflict had no impact on the wider Civil War. Neither Otho, nor Vitellius, nor Vespasian responded to Decumus Pacarius' initial revolt or to his murder.Tacitus, Histories 2,16. For the next two hundred years, basically no events are recorded on the island. It was apparently a peaceful and prosperous time. From AD 73, the island was probably administered by imperial officials. and 8024. Under Trajan (98-117) the province was transferred to Senatorial administration once more. Under Commodus (176-192) or possibly Septimius Severus (193-211), Corsica became an imperial province once more, and was administered by a Procurator Augusti et Praefectus and . Plenty of remains from the Roman period can be seen on the island even today. For example, there are remains of bath-houses at Pietrapola, Guagno-les-Bains and Urbalacone.  Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages (AD 300 - 650)  In the reform of the provinces by Diocletian at the beginning of Late Antiquity, Corsica's status was left unchanged. It was administered by a praeses and was assigned to the diocese of Italia Suburbicaria. As elsewhere in the Roman empire, tax pressure increased markedly in this period. As in many other parts of the empire, Corsica was subject to invasions and large-scale migrations, which led to the central government of the Western Roman Empire giving up the island. In 410, the Visigoths conquered the island. In 455TheLexikon des Mittelalters says 455, Moses Finley in Ancient Sicily says 445, and Jochen Martin in Spatantike und V√∂lkerwanderung: \\"after 455.\\" the Vandals under king Geiseric, used the island as a base for annual raids on the Italian mainland. Corsica was governed by Vandal officials, rather than Romans and was used by the Vandal kingdom, like the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, as a buffer zone, to protect Vandal North Africa from attacks from the north. In 500, the Ostrogoths conquered the island. In 536, Eastern Roman troops of Emperor Justinian, under the command of Cyril, a subordinate of Belisarius, regained the island, as well as Sardinia and the Balearics, in the course of a many year long operation in the western Mediterranean, whose ultimate goal was the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals. There is no trace of imperial building work in Corsica, of the sort which took place elsewhere. In 575, the Lombards landed on the island and they established several strategically important coastal sites. The interior of the island, however, remained in Eastern Roman hands Pope Gregory I dictates the Gregorian chant, which was said to have entered him from the Holy Spirit, to a scribe (Antiphonary of Hartker von St. Gallen c.1000). The tax pressure and the various invasions deeply harmed the island. One bond which held Corsica together was the Church, which was deeply embedded on the island. So it is not surprising that a new chapter in the history of the island was opened by the church. Pope Gregory I reclaimed the island during his pontificate (590-604), as a missionary area. In accordance with his command, the populace were further indoctrinated, the church organisation of the island was revised, and canon law was introduced. The long-vacant bishop's seat was permanently re-established and an administrative structure introduced, which even had some impact in the island's interior. Where the decaying Byzantine government intensified social conflict, the church proved a stabilising element and the bishops became the true leaders of the populace.On the role of the church, see Lexikon des Mittelalters. In the early 7th century, the island faced a new problem with the Saracens, who ravaged the coasts of the island frequently. The Lombards also returned to the island, to fight against the Saracens. The conflict with the Saracens, which also drew in other significant powers that often laid claim to Corsica or a part thereof, dominated the fortunes of the island for several centuries. This period is almost unrecorded, except in the Chronicles of Giovanni della Grossa (1388-1464), which were written much later and are heavily infused with legends.  Historiography  Source material and research on the island are both sparse and as a result there have been few scholarly publications. This results both from the relative insignificance of Corsica in antiquity and from the disinterest of the French academy in the island. Compared with the neighbouring island of Sardinia, which has received significant attention from Italian scholars, research on ancient Corsica is still in its infancy. In the 19th century, the General-inspector Prosper M√©rim√©e visited Corsica to record the historical monuments on the island. In 1840, he published his findings as Notes d'un voyage en Corse. Intensive research of the early history of Corsica began in the 20th century with Roger Grosjean.Wolfgang Kathe: Korsika, Reise Know-How Verlag Peter Rump, A sign of the neglect of the island is that the 1965 Lexikon der Alten Welt contained no article on Corsica, despite having articles for the other large Mediterranean islands - Crete, Sicily, Cyprus and Sardinia.

In the year of 1909 Mooloor S Padmanabha Panicker Who was a member of 'Sreemoolam Prajasabha' had established the Elavumthitta market in the 2 acres (8,100 m2) of land near the Elavumthitta Junction. He named the market as \\"Sreemoolam Rajagopalavilasam\\".[1] Mooloor Panicker The name of Elavumthitta is synonymous with Mooloor S Padmanabha Panicker. For People outside Elavumthitta, Mooloor was just only a great poet of his time. He was more than that, he fought with the so-called elite groups of writers of his time. These writers thought and behaved arrogantly as if they were the sole custodians of literature. Initially to discourage Mooloor they mocked at his literary works and questioned his right to do such exercise; openly quoting the cast he belonged. That was enough to raise the sleeping lion ‚Äì the literary genius in Mooloor. Armed with his mighty pen and charged with the divine blessings of Sree Narayana Guru, he fought alone- it can be compared only with the legendary Abhimanyu the warrior of Mahabharat, who was trapped and slain by the veteran warriors. Here it was different, though he was cornered and attacked by the conservative veterans of letters; Mooloor could indeed come out of every fight victorious, and in the end, his rivalries made peace with him. The poetic mind could, not only write beautiful poems of his time; being a visionary, he saw that Elavumthitta is lagging behind in every social need of that time. Be it in education, or in infrastructures, like roads or in marketing facilities for the agricultural produce- the place was famous for- needed immediate attention. His proximity with the rulers of Travancore made the tough task one by one into reality. In 1914 he was nominated to 'Sreemulam Prajasabha' by the Maharaja of Travancore. Fourteen years he was in that position and made dramatic changes in the society. His plea in the assembly for social justice to everyone in the society irrespective of one's caste and creed was heard throughout Kerala. When there was taboo for members belonging to certain castes walking on public roads or entering temples, Mooloor made schools to educate them, made temples for them to worship, and made public roads for everyone's use. He was the main architect for shaping the Elavumthitta market. Most of the important roads in Kozhechery Taluk were made under his leadership. He founded more than 20 educational institutions in Elavumthitta and other parts of Kerala. He expired in 1931 at the age of 62 leaving behind a great void, difficult to fill by another one. In 1989 Govt. of Kerala built a memorial at the place he lived in his last days, barely 3 km away from the Elavumthitta market junction. The memorial and its serene surrounding remind one, what a great soul was lived there once. The place is a pilgrim centre for many literary luminaries. In every year on the vijayadasmiday hundreds of parents bring their children to get initiated into the world of letters here. Locally the ritual is called 'Ezhuthiniruth'. The objective of the memorial is to familiarize the present generation with the rich social as well as literary contribution of the poet and keep his memory alive. A few years ago in an interview for the police department, one board member asked an aspiring candidate -- \\"Well gentleman, your bio-data says you are a native of Elavumthitta. I understand Mooloor the great poet was from there. Now tell us something about him\\". It is sad that our young man had to admit his ignorance. The young man should know that a man named Mooloor S Padmanabha Panicker was instrumental in making Elavumthitta with the facilities he enjoys now. Let our youngsters grow with the memories of the great people like Mooloor. Nostalgia Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it. Before adolescence, memory is more interested in the future than the past, and so my recollections of the town were not yet idealized by nostalgia. I remember it as it was: a good place to live where everybody knew everybody else‚Ä¶ Gabriel Garcia Marquez ( From the pages of his autobiography ‚Äì Living to Tell the Tale) Aswathy The most important annual festival for the people of Elavumthitta is the Celebration of Aswathy in the Malayalam month of meenam. No doubt Onam is the biggest festival of every Keralite, but this Asawathy celebration is exclusively for the People of Elavumthitta. Every child in Elavumthitta will be waiting for this occasion; the tips he gets now and then- let the sum may be a meager one ‚Äì is kept as his secret treasure; reserved for this great day. He has to buy many items. The seasonal crops of cashew is of great help; cashew picked up from here and there is sold and the amount may be a pittance in today's standard, but the thrill of spending it in the aswathy fair is something one will remember till his death. There is a worshiping place in the corner of market; the place is called Malanada. The deity of Malanada is the god of hills. The annual celebration is to appease the Malanada deity. The colorful and important item of the celebration is the pageantry display. Images of oxen of more than life size and multicolored are made and displayed in single or in pairs mounted on wooden platforms and drawn along the road by hundreds of over enthusiastic rural population is a sight to be seen to believe its electrifying effect on the crowd lined on both sides of the road. The loud and reverberating sound of the percussion musical instruments drowns the shouting of the crowds. The setting sun plays its myriad colors on the scenario; everyone in the crowd pushing forward a little to have a good look. A child perching on the shoulder of his father is weeping over his ruptured balloon. These are all familiar sight one can see in the middle of any rural festival. In another place, typical wares of such occasions are spread on the floor of makeshift sheds and are in great demand. Young girls are making bargaining over colorful glass bangles. Children are pestering their parents for the multicolored balloons. Then some are lucky they got toy bugles; impatient to put it on test children started blowing it and experimenting it in various combinations of tunes to the annoyance of elders. Nobody noticed it; the sun is disappeared and the darkness crept in. Traders brought out their giant kerosene lamps and lit. The orange colored flames of the kerosene lamps leaping upward as if trying to lick the festive atmosphere; making surreal shades of people jostling around. People coming from distant places are in a hurry to go back. Children are reluctant to comply with the elders and ignoring their protests they, being physically dragged out of the fair, weeps all the way back home. The rural alleyways otherwise lonely and dark on normal days are, today with crowds of people with burning torches made out of dry coconut leaves; either going to the fair or making the homeward journey. Battery operated flashlight torches were very rare and then and only a few fashionable people were having it. Night long variety folk arts culminating into fireworks are the attraction of the fair. Fireworks were the major attraction; to witness this many sleep in the fair ground and at the sound of the first cracker they get up. Next day the less fortunate who were confined in their home get up in the early morning, hearing the news of someone is stabbed and hospitalized or somebody is seriously beaten. Following weeks will be busy for the rural populations in debating over and over on these topics. Rural festivals were not only the venue for exhibiting rural arts; it was also a venue for settling the yearlong pending issues of bitter feud among different groups. Cattle market Elavumthitta market popularly known as Elavumthitta Chandha(‡¥á‡¥≤‡¥µ‡µÅ‡¥Ç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü ‡¥ö‡¥®‡µç‡¥§) celebrated its 100th year in September 2009. There is an important landmark in the middle of Elavumthitta- a huge banyan tree. How old the tree is, nobody knows, eight hundred years or more that is anybody's guess. Some say it is more than that. One thing is certain, that it gave shelter to generations of weary travelers, it witnessed the political changes of Kerala, listening fiery speeches of politicians who make makeshift stage on its platform now and then; unaffected by either political speeches or religious sermons; stand there majestically giving shelter to birds on its long branches with thick green foliage and feeding its seasonal fruits to the needy birds. The market was very famous for the cattle trading. Traders from faraway places like Thiruvananthapuram used to come here for either selling or buying cattle. The ninth day of every Malayalam month was the market day exclusively for cattle trading. People from faraway places come to the market, a day or two in advance to secure a vantage spot to exhibit their cattle. In those days Space in the market was very little, roads were very narrow, owners of vacant land adjoining the market allowed the traders to occupy the land free or by paying a small fee. Some smart local guys drive stakes for tying the cattle and rent it for money. Suddenly the tea shops otherwise dull throughout the month will wake up and keep open their shop day and night. Some shopkeepers hire petromax for this special night business. The whole place will become noisy with the loud shouting and bargaining of agents and middle men, the pitiful frightened crying of animals especially the mournful Call of lambs. It was difficult to pass along the narrow road in the market day, swash! You will be jumping in fright; you got a whip of a cow with its tail plastered with dung and urine. The whole area is covered with dung and urine of cattle. The stink will be lingering in the air till the next market day. Now the cattle market is held twice in a month, 9th and 22nd of every Malayalam month. There is similar cattle market now in many places and the importance of the Elavumthitta cattle market is not like the earlier days. Weekly market Every Wednesday and Saturday is market day for people of Elavumthitta. In olden days the economy of Elavumthitta was closely related with agriculture produce. There was no rubber plantation then. People cultivated mainly paddy in wet land; dry land was used for growing Coconut palm, cashew trees, Tapioca, Pepper, gram, horse gram, green gram, red gram, filler millet, pineapple, mango, Plantain, bitter gourd, snake gourd, ash pumpkin, Pumpkin, lady's finger, chilies, drumstick, yam . The foothills had plenty of watershed fertile land; anything sown gave a rich return. Poor man's staple food was Tapioca and sea fish. The weekly market was not only for selling and buying, it was a meeting ground and a venue for the local people to exchange pleasantries. Market day was a reference point for the local people in their conversation. Schedule of important assignments were changed or shifted or postponed taking the market day into account. The market was also a venue for the young to develop familiarity with opposite sex and that in course of time develops into intimacy and then culminated in marriage. Fish and tapioca was the staple food for the common man. Fish market had an important place in the market... Fish vendors bring fish from faraway places of coastal areas. The fish was brought in huge baskets on by cycles in its carrier and sure enough it required dexterity and stamina peddling miles and miles on rough roads. The market will have its full sitting around 11:00 am and continue till late afternoon. Market day was appreciated by taking into account the cost of fish available on that day. People on the way to the market ask persons returning from the market - \\"How is the fish today\\"? Weighing of fish was not heard in those days. Sardines fish was very popular. Sometimes sardines were so cheap, one can have even fifty sardines for 4 Annas, equivalent of today's 25 paisa. Coconut Palms were plenty in Elavumthitta. Some family's annual income was solely on coconuts. Plucking coconuts 3 to 4 times in a year and selling to the merchants not only was a common practice in those days, it was a necessity. It is said that in those days almost one million coconuts were traded in a market day. Three to four truckloads of coconut husk-a raw material for making coir- used to be sent to other parts of Kerala where coir trading was active. Presently rubber is the main cash crop. Anyone with little land will have few rubber trees; three to four rubber Sheets will be enough to meet his immediate cash requirements for the market day. Seasonal crops like cashew and pepper had a ready market. Merchants sitting in a row with hand balance and cloth bags for weighing merchandise were a common sight in those days. Clay pots were displayed in the market. Bamboo made baskets, large size mats for drying paddy, ladle made out of coconut shells, why you name a thing it will be available in the weekly market. Yes indeed it was an open market, every item was kept in the open ground Sivagiri Pilgrimage The first Sivagiri Pilgrimage or Sivagiri Teerthadanam in 1932 was started from Elavumthitta. The first pilgrims-P.K.Divakara Panicker, P.K.Kesavan, P.V.Raghavan, M.K.Raghavan, and S.Sankunni-were all from Elavumthitta. 600px Mooloor S. PadmanƒÅbha Panicker Mooloor S. PadmanƒÅbha Panicker (Sarasa kavi Mooloor) was one of the great poets and a prominent social reform activist from Travancore. He was born at Panayannaarkavu, close to the town of Mannar in Central Travancore in 1869 (Malayalam year Kumbhom 27, 1044 ). He named his residence in Elavumthitta as 'Kerala Varma Soudham' as a mark of respect towards Kerala Varma Valiyakoyi Thampuran who was his close friend. Mooloor Smarakom In the year 1989 the State Government proclaimed 'Kerala Varma Soudham' (residence of Mooloor) as 'Sarasa Kavi Mooloor Smarakam'. Now this monument is preserved by the State Department of Culture. The objective of the Mooloor Smarakam is to familiarise the present generation with the rich social as well as literary contributions of the poet and to keep his memory alive. File:MooloorSmarakam2.jpgMooloor Smarakam File:Sarasakavi_mooloor.jpgMooloor S.Padmanabha Panickar Ezhuthiniruthu Mooloor Smarakam is now famous for \\"Ezhuthiniruthu\\" (The occasion on which children are initiated into the world of letters). On the day of Vijayadasami children are initiated into the world of letters at Mooloor Smarakam. Prominent personalities will be present on this auspicious day. Memories ....memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life at all... Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing...  Luis Bu√±uel Thumpamon‚ÄìThekkemala Road ELAVUMTHITTA GETS GOVT TRANSPORT BUS IN 1957 AT GUN POINT. There was a time when people of Elavumthitta solely depending on the soles of their heels to travel out of Elavumthitta. Be it for getting medical aid or attending schools or college one has to travel miles and miles ‚Äì kilometers were not heard in those days ‚Äì why even in the recent past rural elders refer distance as \\"nazhika.\\" One \\"nzhika\\" is roughly one mile. There were cases; students walked in the morning all the way to Thiruvalla a place 30 km away to attend college and then walking back 30 km. in the evening on their homeward journey. Sure enough it was a tough task. There were hurdles in connecting Elavumthitta with other places by public transport system. Motorable roads were not there. The road from Ambalakadavu Jn. in Thumpamon to Elavumthitta was very narrow. In 1950's it was only a cart track. Similarly one has to walk all the way to Thekkemala Jn. near Kozhencherry to sight a bus. Then in 1953-54 two bridges were made near Punnakkad on Thekkemala Elavumthitta road. Two more bridges/ culverts were made south of Elavumthitta near Ramanchira in 1945‚Äì53. The construction of the bridge and the road over heavy filling in the paddy field near Ramanchira was undertaken by contractor Mr.M.G George of Mannil, Nellanikunnu. Then in 1954 one Private bus service started from Kallisseri to Omalloor. The bus service was known\\"DAILY EXPRESS\\" . The bus with its long front to accommodate the engine and turning its dynamo with a handle to start the bus reminded the first world war scenario. Now the stage is set to pressurize the newly elected democratic Govt. of Kerala for public transport bus. Kambisseril Sankaran Vaidyan,(elder brother of kambisseril Karunakaran) the then president of Mezhuveli panchayat, used his personal influence to the Transport Minister M.N Govindan Nair. The Bus route was sanctioned with a condition that road must be made motorable. Govt.officials surveyed the route, starting from Ambalakadavu to Thekkemala and suggested to straighten the sharp bends and widen the road at several locations. This must be done by the local public at their cost. Sri.Sankaran vaidiyan, the panchayat president, organized volunteers for this task. The owner of the land near a stretch at Ramanchira won't relent widening the road. He feared that people might force into his property and widen the road. Armed with a court stay order he sought police protection. People were adamant, one fine morning hundreds of people armed with pickaxe, shovel, and crowbar and baskets were there in the disputed site, and started uprooting trees. Owner of the land sent his messenger to the Pandalam police station requesting the police to intervene and prevent the forced encroachment in his land. The Sub Inspector reached the site in no time. Seeing the Inspector people were scattered; news gone to Sankaran Vaidyan. He rushed to the spot, and faced the Inspector- The Inspector was adamant, he drew his revolver and pointing it to Sankaran Vaidiyan ordered him to move away. Sankaran Vaidyan called the people and asked them to continue with their works. Awaiting the call people with a loud cry started their works more vigorously. Sounds of percussion instruments like \\"Chenda\\", which was a must in those days for such occasions drowned the voice of law. It was Sankaran vaidyan's day; vaidyan offered a cigarette to the sullen Inspector, and also helped him lighting it . Thus in 1953-54 the long cherished dream of people of Elavumthitta became fulfilled- they got \\"transport bus\\"!. It is sad that many daring heroes of those days who shaped the destiny of Elavumthitta are no more with us but the memory will never die. T K Kunjumman Road In 1948, CSI church member of Nellanikunnu, Adv.V.K Varghese who was also the MLA of Pathanamthitta constituency brought the matter to the notice of PWD authorities that a motorable road from Elavumthitta to Omalloor was an urgent need of the time. Later Thekkethil Sri. Kunjumman took the leadership, and not only in widening the road: his charismatic leadership brought bus service to this place. He was also the Panchayat President of Chenneerkkara for several terms. In 1950's when Govt of Kerala started establishing Primary Health Centre in different localities, he made frequent visits to Thiruvananthapuram and got one sanctioned for Elavumthitta area. Sri. Kuzhimannil K.C Kurien was kind enough to donate the land for the Nellanikkunu Primary Health Centre. In the earlier days, most of the people of Elavumthitta, being agricultural farmers had to keep plenty of cattle. One veterinary hospital was a dire need for the locality. From the 2nd five-year plan onwards, govt. was keen in giving attention to such social requirements. Under the leadership of Kunjumman Sir, the CSI Church members and the public impressed the authorities and succeeded in getting a veterinary hospital for Elavumthitta. From the year 1960 people started getting veterinary services. Then a good Samaritan Vadakkedethu Sri. V.T Chaco donated the land for building the Veterinary Hospital. In 1960 veterinary Hospital started its activities in its own building. In recognition of Thekkethil Mr. Kunjumman's selfless service, the Govt. of Kerala named Elavumthitta ‚Äì Omalloor road as \\"TK KUNJUMMAN ROAD\\". Arts and Sports  Azad arts and sports club  People of Elavumthitta had no entertainment in earlier days other than the \\"ASWATHI MAHOLSVAM\\" celebrated once in a year. Cinema halls were ‚Äì you go in any direction- 10 to 20 km away. Convenient bus service to reach the cinema hall in time for the show or to come back from the show were not available then. Still some tough adventurists used to trek all the way to Pathanamthitta, Pandalam, Kozhencherry, or Chengannur wherever the popular pictures were shown, and stealthily come back avoiding getting caught by the elders, in the early hours of the night after watching the movie. Surely the adventurism if found invited the ire of elders and scornful look of neighbors. Those were the days everyone had a right to admonish the young, be it a neighbor or a stranger, the action gets ready approval of the parents. The impact of KPAC drama, successfully spreading revolutionary ideas among common people for social changes, were closely watched by educated and progressive minded youths of Elavumthitta. At the stroke of 5 o'clock in the evening of 26 January 1957 Republic Day, when rest of the country was celebrating the occasion; Elavumthitta celebrated it in a unique way ‚Äì They formed a club and named it as AZAD ARTS AND SPORTS CLUB, glorifying to the world the name of the freedom fighter Maulana Abulkalam Azad. The name was suggested by Sri. C. Chandra Dattan. MA. There was a meeting held in SNDP hall of Nediyakala, barely one and a half km away from Elavumthitta market. Besides Mr. Chandra Dattan, members present in the meeting were; Mr.V.R Gopinathan Nair, Mr. C. A Gangadharan, T. K. Sadanandan, P. K. Gangadharan, A. D. Kuttappanachari and Mr. Satyapalan. It was decided that the club will be based in Elavumthitta and the aim and objective of the club will have to promote arts and sports in Elavumthitta. Mr. C. Chandra Dattan as president, Mr. V. R. Gopinathan Nair Secretary, and Mr. A. D. Kutappanachari as Vice president the club started its activities. The popularity of the club was such that everyone in Elavumthitta became the member of the club. Many famous and performing artists of Kerala of those days joined with our Azad Club artists and staged several shows. Sri. Ayroor Sadasivan and Kottayam Joy were a few to name. Under the leadership of Azad Club, classes for teaching classical music, tabala, and harmoniam were conducted. Azad club had its own gifted members like Mooloor Bala chandran, V.R Gopinathan Nair, Salim Kambisseril etc. to take the fame of Azad club throughout Kerala. Now It might be surprising to many that Azad had its own troupe of ballet. Azad's professional drama troupe staged their drama in several parts of Kerala; why even the remote area like Kumali was not spared. Every month a new drama was the motto of Azad club members. Azad was also very active in the area of Radio Drama. Almost 15 nos. of radio drama were Performed by the Azad artists. Mr.V.R Gopinathan Nair and Mr. Salim Kambisseril were the drama writers and performing artists. Besides them Mr.P.K Sahadevan, E.N Gangadharan, E.R Rajan, C.A Gangadharan and P.N Ramachandran were the permanent performing artists of Azad club. Dancer C.R Das, U .N Sreedharan Kutty, Peter, John Philip, Johnson, Joy, and Makeup man Mr. Mathai were an integral part of Azad Club. The club had its own Curtain set, Artist Kesavan was the designer of it. Mr. K Madhavan and Kambisseril Sankaran Vaidyan etc. Were the prominent Patrons of Azad Club. The club has its office room in its own three-roomed building situated in Elavumthitta, very close, a stone throw away distance from our legendary Banyan tree. Many of those stalwarts who made this club are no more with us but the club building stands in solitary isolation as a testimony to a glorious past.

Reading and sharing free thoughts were looked upon as habits of irresponsible youths. Most of the elders were very unhappy on seeing their young ones \\"idle away\\" their time in reading. We cannot blame the elders, unlike today, the time was hard then; one has to work day and night to make both ends meet. Watching around, One will be surprised; everything has to be made; roads, schools, hospitals, houses, you name a thing necessary for human society; that has to be made. One may really wonder if the world was created only a couple of weeks ago! Many rural areas were without even elementary schools. Newspaper was a luxury. Malayalam weekly magazines were in great demand; people bought the weekly magazine of their choice sharing the cost by contributing each one few paisa or a little more as the individual could afford. The cost of a most popular Malayalam weekly of that time was only two annas, equivalent of today's twelve paisa per issue. There were no radio or cinema halls in easy reach. It is not that radio was not invented then; there was no money to buy one. Most of the rural people were depending on their meagre agriculture produce for sustaining. Cash crunch was very evident in the day-to-day lifestyle of people. For many, even a shirt was a luxury. It was a custom to extend wedding invitation at least 15 days in advance so that one will have ample time to borrow a shirt from his friends; give it a good wash then get it dry, press and keep it ready for that grand occasion. In such circumstances, buying books or newspapers were not in the reach of a common man. But the youths were restless; revolutionary ideas and free thoughts were spreading very fast. Atheists were looked upon as most modern by the young and most wicked by the old. In this confusion, books were a solace to the young helping to drown their worries and weaving dreams and pandering in to their own imaginative romantic world. In this backdrop, wishes of many like-minded persons of Muttathukonam crystallized into forming a library. Yet an external push was required to take off the dream project. It came at last in the shape of news that govt. was considering of sanctioning one rural library in the vicinity of Elavumthitta. Many places near Elavumthitta‚Äîrivals of Muttathukonam in all healthy competitions, if come to know, will snatch it. First come first was the ‚Äòrule of the game‚Äô then; let us see who will get away with the library. One afternoon people of Muttathukonam woke up from their siesta, hearing the continuous bell toll from the S N D P building. People rushed in fearing a calamity. They were told that an emergency meeting was to be held. In the closed-door meeting it was decided that within a day or two one govt. official is visiting Muttathukonam to take stock of the library activities. People were briefed in a hushed tone that library room with a shelf, a bench and desk and if possible a wooden chair and a table must be arranged at least for that occasion. Then someone posed a question: difficult question indeed, what about the books! There was pin drop silence for a while. Then Mr. T.M Varghese of Thundiyathu got up- \\"I will arrange books if someone can give me a helping hand\\" Most of the people gathered there were not sure how to react; they know one thing, if T M Varghese commits a thing it will be done. Then and there Mr. Kunjukunju of Mylamootil offered his help. Sri. Kunjukunju Thandar of Thaninilkkunnathil agreed to arrange a space in the corner of SNDP building for the Library. Now for the majority of the members present in the meeting, the feasibility of the library has come within the sighting distance. Someone offered a wooden bench, another said he has got a three-legged table, another said he can fix the fourth leg and let us make the proceeding short; by the end of the meeting, every item required for starting a modest - mind it please not modern but modest - library was offered by one or the other from the audience. People of Muttathukonam fondly remember the selfless service of Tundiyathu TM Varugheese, Mylamootil Kunjukunju and Thaninilkkunnathil Kunjukunju Thandar in establishing a library in Muttathukonam. They visited every house in Muttathukonam and nearby area and collected old books for the Library. Some books had no cover - ‚ÄúThat is OK we will make the cover‚Äù They collected books like that and painstakingly made the library. The inspector ‚Äúcame, saw, and satisfied‚Äù: and thus Muttathukonam got JANATHA LIBRARY AND READING ROOM. Hat's off to the trio; they are no more with us. Library gets radio 1960 ‚ÄìLibraries in affluent areas were having radios of their own. How can Muttathukonam lag behind? A radio will cost minimum Rs. 500/- in those days. That was a huge amount for the local people then. Several meetings were called but it didn't yield any result. Then someone suggested ‚Äìwhy not we make a lottery to raise fund for buying radio. A fine idea! Everyone agreed to that proposal. So in the history of the Muttathukonam, yes the first lottery was held. Cost of ticket was 4 anna ‚Äì one-fourth of a rupee that is today's 25 paisa. The first prize was an alarm clock, a rare item then and a big attraction for a common man. Only a few affluent families had alarm clocks in their homes in those days. Volunteers were pressed into action. On empty stomach, and parched throat dozens of youngsters were swarmed in to nook and corner of Muttathukonam with the lottery tickets. Where ever two people met, the talk will ultimately lead into lottery. And needless to say everyone had a secret wish that he was going to get the clock. It is heard that one grandmother who never saw a clock in her life told her grandchildren- ‚ÄúIn case we get it where are we going to keep it; no place is safe here; you naughty ones are definitely going to tear it off‚Äù. The poor lady thought it is something made out of paper! At last the day came for the lottery. Names were written on small slips of paper, rolled to hide names and put them in a basket. One child was asked to pick up a slip. One lucky person got the prize and it put a full stop to all speculations and excitements of the past few months of who will win dilemma; though disappointment and disbelief was evident on everybody's faces except the winner's. When the gathering heard that the money collected through the proceeding was only little short of the cost for a radio, everyone clapped. Almanac was consulted, a good day was selected, and Mr. Dharmapala Panicker of Nediyakalayil was entrusted to buy the radio from Pathanamthitta the nearest town. A week later one Murphy Radio- a valve set with magic eye - was bought. One notice on the wall directly above the radio warned that no one except the person authorized was allowed to touch or operate it. Young and old looked forward for the evening for hearing film songs of Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam from Ceylon radio. There were crowds around the radio during election time for the news. Needless to say, the library and its radio acted as a catalyst to set off cultural changes in Muttathukonam. * Sariga Grandhasala, Plamthottam, Elavumthitta * Bapuji Grandhasala, Mezhuveli North * Mezhuveli Panchayat Samskarika Kendram Grandhasala,Parayankara, Ullanoor * Gandhiji Smaraka Grandhasala, Ullanoor West * Progressive Grandhasala, Alakkod, Mezhuveli Educational institutions *Sreebuddha College of Engineering for Women *Salvation Army L P school, Thumpamon North - This is the first School of Elavumthitta, established in the year 1903.

The school is located 1 km away from Elavumthitta market on the wayside of Ramanchira road. *S N Giri S N D P H S S Chenneerkkara - It is believed that Adhishankaran visited Chenneerkara in AD 758‚Äì820 period. It is also believed that during his visit to this place he met Shaktibhadran, the author of the famous Sanscrit drama ‚ÄúAachariya Choodamani‚Äù. There is a belief that the name of Chenneerkara is derived from the domain of Shakti bhadran's ‚ÄúChenneerkara swarupam‚Äù. The year 1953 is very important for the people of Chenneerkara. It was in 1953 that S N Giri S N D P School ‚Äì initially that was the name given to this school ‚Äì was established. The site selected was close to the Siva temple managed by Branch No.89 of SNDP Union. Sri.P K Kamalasanan of Pottanjilikkunnel was the founder member and the first manager of the School. People of Chennerkara fondly remember his efforts in establishing this School against all odds. Kerala Kaumudi Editor late Sri. K Sukumaran's help in overcoming hurdles in the beginning days is praiseworthy. After 45 years from the humble beginning, the School was raised to the status of HSS in 1998. By that time the perseverance of several dedicated and hardworking managers such as P M Madhavan, K K Bhaskaran, V K Sreedharan, T S Purushothaman, Kunju Panicker, N K Vasu, N Chandra Panicker, V K Narayanan, T N Gopinathan, N D Suresh Kumar and P N Thankappan's noble contributions elevated this School to envious position among the other schools of the district. Student as far as from Muttathukonam and Elavumthitta used to study in this School in 1960's.Total student strength is about 1000. Nearly 46 teachers and 7 supporting staff are managing this School. The school can be proud of educating people of this area for the last three decades *S N D P H S S, Muttathukonam North - In 1948 people of Muttathukonam joined with the SNDP Union's branch. No. 80 and established one Lower Primary School. Sri. Neelakantan Thandar of Lakshmimangalam, Kinaruvilayil was the founder Manager of the school. Irrespective of caste and creed, everyone in Muttathukonam contributed their mite for the growth of this School. Those days were very hard; most of the people were living in a hand to mouth situation. Each one who had coconut trees willingly earmarked a tree in their compound in the name of school fund and gave the right of coconuts of that tree towards the school fund. People, who had no money and nothing to offer, did voluntary free labour for the construction of the school. The enthusiasm and hard labour of people combined with efficient and dedicated selfless efforts of leadership raised this Lower Primary School to Upper Primary School in 1956. Mr. P C Samuel of Pulinthitta, Elavumthitta was the first Head Master of the Upper Primary School. Sri. R Shankar the then education minister of Kerala laid the foundation stone for the High School. Thus the High School becomes a reality in 1962. In the year 2000‚Äì01 the school was upgraded into Higher Secondary School and Sri. P N Chandran was the first principal. Students of nearby places like Elavumthitta, Ayathil, Chettiyam, Prakkanam, and Nellanikunnu are the main beneficiaries of this Institution. Nearly 1000 students are getting their education in this School. There are about 50 teachers and 8 supporting staff working in this School. The school is equipped with a computer lab, Science lab and is in the forefront in imparting education in this rural area where most of the people are low income category and is depending only on agriculture for their livelihood. The school is very proud that, in 1980s, the school was the continuous champion in women's volleyball. The best part of the school is; most of the buildings are single-storied with tiled roof and classrooms are well ventilated. The students in their leisure time can move around the spacious compound encircled by the school buildings and breathe fresh air. *CMS high School, Kuzhikkala *Padmanabhodayam H S S, Mezhuveli *Gangadhara Vilasam L P School, Mezhuveli *Teachers Training Institute, Mezhuveli *Govt.

Elevumthitta was fortunate in having the presence of this mystic saint on several occasions as he had close relationship with Mooloor Padmanabha Panicker. Guru, as he was known to his devotees, was a frequent visitor in Mooloor's house in Elavumthitta. Guru being a great visionary realised that without proper education people won't come out of their age-old inhibitions and irrational beliefs. He found that a society divided by caste and religion will never progress. Probably Guru was the first in proclaiming to the world ‚ÄúOne caste, one religion, and one god for all‚Äù. Guru asked his people to make prayer halls where one would feel- ‚ÄúWITHOUT DIFFERENCE IN CASTE OR RANCOUR OR OF RELIGIONS THIS IS A NOBLE PLACE WHERE ALL LIVE IN BROTHERHOOD‚Äù To propagate and teach Guru's philosophy, many such prayer halls were built throughout Kerala. These prayer halls were known as Guru Mandirams. Names of such Guru Mandirams in Elavumthitta area are listed below in alphabetical order - *Ayathil in the Compound of Present Mooloor Smarakam. It is more than fifty years old. The Gurumandiram was constructed by Sri.P K Divakara Panicker, Son of Sarasakavi Mooloor Padmanabha Panicker with the money he raised by selling a portion of his property. *Ayathil Jn.- Opened on 27 August 1977 and inaugurated by Sri.K K Viswanathan the then Governor of Gujarat. *Ampalathumpattu - Opened in 1980 and is managed by Poura Samathy (citizen forum) of that area. *Elavumthitta - Opened and inaugurated by Adv. K Gopinathan on 26 March 1982. *Cheneerkara - Opened in 1985. *Muttathukonam - Opened on 26 December 1978. Installation proceedings were conducted by Sri. Gopalan Thantri, father of famous singers Jaya-Vijayan brothers. One memorable incident ‚Äì a dance programme was scheduled on 28th the final day of the celebration. R C Kaimal & party the famous dance group of Kerala in those days were commissioned by the organisers paying a princely amount. The dance troupe arrived well in time and people were expectantly waiting to watch the much talked performance, but nature had its own plans. Suddenly at 3:00 pm the sky was overcast with threatening dark clouds and it started raining heavily followed by strong wind. The stage was uprooted and blown away to the adjoining field. However, the dance troupe was magnanimous; they overstayed a day and the show was staged on the next day. *Mayikunnu (Panil Area) - *Mezhuveli - *Nediyakala Jn. ‚Äì The foundation was laid by Sri V M Madhavan on a Sunday 10 October 1948 (Malayalam year 25-03 1124) on Mahanavami day. It took 9 years for completion and was unveiled to the public by Nitiya Chaithaniya Yati the well known philosopher and follower of Guru's ideologies on 8 September 1957 (Malayalam year 23-01-1133). It was a Sunday and above all on Sree Narayana Guru Jayanthi day. The idol of Guru was sculptured by the famous artist A K Achari. It is said that this is the second Gurumandiram opened in Kerala, the first one was built in Thalasseri. *Pullamala - opened on 14-04-1988.

The aim of the offensive was to cut the last rebel supply line into Aleppo city. The offensive Northern Army advances and capture of the Mallah Farms Map of the offensive The offensive on 25 June, was preceded by heavy Russian air-strikes. Heavy ground bombardment was also involved before the ground offensive was launched. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said the amount of firepower used was \\"unprecedented,\\" with local sources describing the fighting in the area as \\"World War III\\". Overall, heavy mortars, rocket launchers, airstrikes and tank fire were used. The Army attempted to advance in the northwestern part of the city, as well as in the Mallah farmlands to the north, near the Castello Road, the rebels' last supply route into Aleppo. Initially, the Army managed to capture several positions in the northwestern al-Zahra and al-Khalidiyah districts of Aleppo. By the next morning, over a 5-hour period, the Russian Air Force had conducted over 60 air-strikes against rebel positions. On 26 June, the military made advances into the Mallah Farms, and by 28 June, they had captured half of the farmlands, including the Al- Asamat and Arab Salum areas. The advances brought the Castello Road within firing range of the military's artillery. Concurrently with the government's advances, the Russian Air Forces continued conducting heavy air-strikes, with just 30 strikes on the morning of 27 June, above the Handarat Mountains and Anadan Plains. Still, despite the advances, the Army was unable to advance by nightfall into the western and southern farms of Malaah, despite repeated attempts over the previous day. On 28 June, the military advanced in al- Khalidiyah towards the industrial zone of al-Layramoun and Bani Zeid. On 29 June, an initial rebel counter-attack at Mallah was repelled. Still, later in the day, the rebels used two suicide car bombers, forcing the military to withdraw from all areas they had captured at Mallah. It was initially reported government forces had retreated to regroup for a new assault. However, subsequently it was stated it was a tactical retreat so to lure rebel forces into a trap and inflict maximum casualties. Following this, on 30 June, government forces managed to retake all positions they had lost the previous day. Between 2 and 3 July, the Army advanced in the southern farms of Mallah, coming within two kilometers of cutting the Castelo Road. On 3 July, a Russian cruise missile reportedly destroyed a rebel TOW storage base in western Aleppo. The same day, the military captured the Shbeib factory and several nearby blocks in the al-Layramoun district of Aleppo. The following day, a rebel counter-attack, which included a suicide bomber, was repelled. At the same time, the Army captured more positions in the southern part of Mallah, bringing 65‚Äì75 percent of the farms area under its control. A new rebel counter-attack in Mallah was also repelled. After midnight on 7 July, amid heavy airstrikes, pro-government forces captured the southern part of Mallah and came within one kilometer of the Castello Road. They captured a mosque complex and a hill which overlook the Castello Road, thus enabling them to bring the road under artillery fire-control. This effectively cut off the only supply route to the rebel-held part of Aleppo. The rebels sent in reinforcements in an attempt to retake the area; however, an assault against the hill was repelled. On 8 July, the Kurdish YPG launched an assault of their own from the Kurdish-held northern part of Aleppo city against the rebel-held Youth Housing Complex, located alongside the Castello Road. Meanwhile, the military made more advances in the Mallah area, coming within 250 meters of the Castello Road. Elsewhere in Aleppo city, rebel shelling of government-held areas killed 23‚Äì34 civilians and wounded 140‚Äì200. Rebel counter-attacks repelled, southern Army advances On 9 July, the rebels launched a counter- attack against government positions near the Castello Road, which was led by two suicide car-bombers. Initially, the rebels recaptured some areas near the Castello Road,ŸÇÿµŸÅ ÿπŸÜŸäŸÅ ŸàŸÖÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿØŸÑ Ÿàÿ∫ÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ£ÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ° ÿ®ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿ≠ŸÑÿ® Ÿàÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿßÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸäŸÅÿ© ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸàÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ŸàŸÇÿ±ÿ® ÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸäŸÑŸà but subsequently lost them again, as the military managed to repel the attack. During the assault, the rebels were also confronted with mines placed by the military. Meanwhile, the Army advanced in the al-Layramoun and al-Khalidiyah districts. Later that night, heavy Russian air-strikes hit rebel forces along the road to the Mallah Farms, as the rebels were regrouping for a second attempt to reopen the Castello Road. A third suicide car-bomb was also used. By the following day, the rebel counter-attack at Mallah had been halted. Overall, 29‚Äì75 rebels were killed in the failed counter-attack, reportedly also including seven commanders. Early on 10 July, government forces reportedly advanced in Bani Zeid. Furthermore, rebels claimed to have killed Haj Sameer Ali Awada, one of the most prominent Hezbollah commanders in Syria, during clashes in the northern Aleppo countryside. Hezbollah denied this, maintaining that he had died of illness in a Lebanese hospital. Following the failed attempt to reopen the Castello Road, there were reports of a crisis between the Army of Conquest and Fatah Halab due to disagreements over Aleppo. Jaysh al-Fateh reportedly wanted to stop the fighting at Mallah altogether and were trying to organize Fatah Halab, but little if anyone inside Aleppo wanted to accept orders from Idlib commanders, and therefore Jaysh al-Fateh's was losing patience as Aleppo commanders were preferring to lose men, ammunition and materials for what they saw as a lost battle. Jaysh al-Fateh wanted to begin an offensive south of Aleppo rather than at Mallah with a serious strategy, but Fatah Halab reportedly wouldn't agree to this. On 11 July, the rebels made an attempt to relieve pressure on the Mallah front by attacking Aleppo's city center. The assault started with the detonation of a tunnel bomb that killed 19 soldiers. After the tunnel blast, a group of 7 rebel fighters emerged behind Army lines from another tunnel on a suicide mission to inflict maximum casualties. Initially, the rebels managed to capture 10 buildings before they were pushed back and the attack was ultimately repelled. Meanwhile, government troops made more advances towards the al-Layramoun roundabout, as they captured the Sadkop Gas Factory. Pro-government Palestinian militiamen were also reported to had captured several areas at the Handarat Camp. On 12 July, the rebels made a diversionary attack on the Al-Breij front, in the northeast of Aleppo, and than conducted their main assault against Mallah again. Initially, they made some gains, including capturing a strategic hill. However, they were once again pushed back by heavy artillery fire and air-strikes by the next day. Meanwhile, the military made more progress in the Bani Zeid district. Following the second failed rebel counter-attack against the Castello Road, the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group, which had not participated in the offensive, criticized rebel forces who were attempting to retake the Mallah Farms by stating it was \\"military suicide. It only yields defeat and collapsed morale\\". Ahrar al-Sham was itself criticized by other rebel groups for not participating in the fighting. By the evening of 13 July, the military secured the whole al-Khalidiyah district and most of the al-Layramoun industrial area, after capturing the last several rebel-held buildings in al-Khalidiyah, as well as al-Layramoun's gas factory, market and glass factory. Three days later, the Army made a new advance, supported by Russian air-strikes, in the al-Layramoun district, while the rebels retook some positions in Bani Zeid. Army cuts Castello Road and captures al-Layramoun and Bani Zeid On 17 July, the Army and Hezbollah reached the Castello Road, capturing parts of it and completely cutting it after taking control of Castello Hill. With this advance, the rebel-held part of Aleppo city was fully besieged and the al- Layramoun roundabout came under artillery fire-control. Government forces than proceeded to set up sandbag barriers on the road. Meanwhile, the military made more advances in the Bani Zeid and al-Layramoun areas, capturing most of the factories. Later in the day, a rebel counter-attack managed to retake some territory in the area of the Castello Road, but the road still remained cut. A rebel commander stated they do not have any tunnel or strategic stockpile to feed 300,000 people in the besieged areas. By 18 July, the rebel counter- attack on the Castello highway was repelled. On 19 July, a government push against the Handarat Camp was underway, with fighting taking place around it,US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria: monitor and the Army managed to advance in the area. The same day, al-Zenki Movement fighters recorded themselves beheading a Palestinian child named Abdallah Issa who was aged between 10 and 13. They claimed he had been fighting for the Syrian government in Aleppo with Liwa al-Quds. Liwa al-Quds denied this and claimed the child was a Palestinian refugee. The murder took place north of Aleppo in Handarat, in an unofficial Palestinian refugee camp named Ein El Tal. Following the beheading, the U.S State Department declared that if the video was genuine, they would stop sending Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki any military aid. On 20 July, a new rebel counter-attack against the Castello Road was repelled. Three days later, the Army expanded its control in the al-Layramoun industrial area by capturing the Textile Factory and several nearby buildings. The same day, a tunnel bomb killed 38 pro-government fighters in a building used by government forces. Thuwwar al-Sham claimed responsibility. On 25 July, government forces made major advances in the al-Layramoun district, as they were about to break through Fatah Halab's main line of defense in the area. During the day, they took control of 12 industrial buildings and two malls. In course of the clashes, Khattab Abou Ahmad, leader of the rebel Abu Amara Battalion, was killed. Meanwhile, the 16th Division's leadership resigned after the rebel group had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting at al-Layramoun; al- Masdar News considered this as a sign that the 16th Division was collapsing. Later that evening, as the Syrian Army advanced in al-Layramoun, the Tiger Forces captured two sites in and near the Castillo Complex, threatening to cut off the rebels remaining at Bani Zeid and al-Layramoun. On 26 July, government forces captured all of the al-Layramoun District after heavy fighting for the last rebel stronghold there, the Bus Station. After also seizing the Al- Castillo Amusement Park and imposing fire control over Bani Zeid, the remaining rebel forces in Aleppo City were left almost completely besieged. At the same time, the Tiger Forces began clearing the last farms under Fatah Halab's control near Haritan in northwest Aleppo. The fighting was accompanied by extremely intense airstrikes on the opposition forces, which resulted in the death of Yassin Najjar, commander of the rebel Abu Amara Brigades. On 27 July, rebel forces attacked the Kurdish-held areas of Aleppo, although their attack was repelled. The Kurds then proceeded to advance into the nearby rebel-held Bani Zeid Youth Housing neighborhood and captured the whole complex. Later that day, the Army officially declared it had cut off all rebel supply routes into Aleppo. On 28 July, the military captured the Bani Zeid district, as well as the rebel-held parts of the Ashrafiyah district. The rebels withdrew from Bani Zeid before the main Army assault so to avoid heavy losses. The Army then continued to push its assault towards the Dahret Abdrubbah area. The following night, the Syrian Army and Liwa al-Quds attacked the Shaher District in the eastern sector of Handarat Refugee Camp, capturing a number of buildings and killing a large number of al-Zenki fighters, including a commander. Liwa al-Quds claimed that the attack served as revenge for Abdallah Issa, the child who had been beheaded by the rebel group. At this point, Syrian President Bashar Assad offered a general amnesty to militants who surrender to the government authorities in the next three months. Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that President Putin ordered a large-scale humanitarian operation outside Aleppo ‚Äùto help civilians who were taken hostage by terrorists as well as fighters who wanted to lay down the arms.‚Äù Shoigu also mentioned that three humanitarian corridors as well as food and first aid points will be offered outside the city. The rebels prevented residents from fleeing through humanitarian corridors, with only a few residents being able to leave encircled opposition-held districts. On 30 July, the Kurdish YPG captured the Shuqayyif Youth Housing area, next to the Castello Road. Meanwhile, several rebels from the 16th Division surrendered to the Syrian Army near the districts of Bani Zeid and Old Aleppo.

It served in the heavy fighting around Smolensk in July, then later in the defensive operations around Kalinin. It then saw extensive service in the severe fighting around Rzhev, before being moved south in the winter of 1942-43. In the following winter the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of Nikopol, receiving that place name as an honorific. After battling through Ukraine, Romania, Hungary and Austria, the 243rd completed a very complex combat path by ending the war in Manchuria and earning a second honorific.  Formation  The 243rd Rifle Division began forming within days of the start of the German invasion on June 26, 1941, at Yaroslavl, in the Moscow Military District,Walter S. Dunn, Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p 75 based on a cadre of 1,500 officers and men of the NKVD Internal Troops. The remaining soldiers and officers came from the reserves. Although the initial order for its formation came from the NKVD, when it left for the front in early July it was completely under Red Army administration. Its order of battle was as follows: * 906th Rifle Regiment * 910th Rifle Regiment * 912th Rifle Regiment * 775th Artillery Regiment * 303rd Antitank BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed from June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p 41 * 413th Sapper Battalion * 665th Signal Battalion * 324th Reconnaissance Company On July 13 the division was assigned to 30th Army in Western Front, but was soon shifted to 29th Army, where it remained through the balance of 1941.Jack Radey & Charles C. Sharp, The Defense of Moscow 1941, Pen & Sword Military, Barnsley, UK, 2012, p 17  Combat service  The 243rd was almost immediately committed to heavy fighting along the Western Dvina River north of Smolensk. On August 28 the division was defending, backed by one battery of corps artillery. Two days later, with German XXXX Motorized Corps rampaging through 22nd Army's positions near Toropets, the division was ordered north to assist the neighboring army. By September 2 it had reached and was digging in to its new positions, 10 ‚Äì 18 km north of Zapadnaya Dvina. In a general assault by Western Front on September 4-5, the 243rd was able to make some westward gains, including the village of Shatry and three hills, but by the second day, along with its army, the division was no longer capable of attacking due to high losses.David M. Glantz, Barbarosa Derailed, vol. 2, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2012, pp 47, 145-48, 246, 280, 289-90 In the wake of the Soviet defeat in Operation Typhoon, Army Group Center was trying to exploit eastwards, but was being held up by lack of supplies, ongoing resistance by the tattered Red Army, and the autumn rains. XXXXI Motorized Corps was ordered to capture Kalinin, and from October 8 to 14 ground its way forward to take the city. In response, on October 17 Kalinin Front was established under command of Col. Gen. I.S. Konev, with the 243rd, along with its army, reassigned to this front; at this time the division was under the command of Col. Ya.G. Tsarkov. On that same day, his division was ordered, as part of the Right Group of the front, to cross the Volga at Staritsa and attack the supply lines of the German corps about 27 km south of the city. This was unsuccessful, but did serve to distract German attention from more serious threats. The 29th Army commander, Lt. Gen. I.I. Maslennikov, then disregarded his orders and moved his forces north on the west bank of the river, attempting to reach the enemy closer to the city. By October 20 Maslennikov's army was entering the battle north of Kalinin, along the Torzhok road, and the 243rd helped form the southern prong encircling the 900th Lehr Brigade. By the end of the day, XXXXI Corps conceded that no further advance toward Torzhok was currently possible, and that its forces would have to withdraw to Kalinin; this turned out to be the first Soviet soil to be permanently liberated during the war. On this date the 243rd was reported as being in \\"quite satisfactory condition\\" with a total fighting strength of about 60%.Radey & Sharp, pp 17, 32, 52-54, 71-72, 78, 82, 106, 124, 128-29 During the winter of 1941-42 the division remained in Kalinin Front, in either the 29th or 30th Army. The 243rd was in 30th Army during the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation. In August it liberated the village of Kopytikh, and in savage fighting repulsed 14 enemy counterattacks, and went on the attack itself eight times.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, p. 86 Later that month it was transferred to Western Front along with the rest of 30th Army.Sharp, p. 41 The 243rd was reassigned to 20th Army, still in Western Front, in December, in the last gasps of Operation Mars, to help make one last desperate attempt to break the German positions and capture Sychyovka. On December 11 the relatively- fresh 243rd, backed by the 5th Tank Corps, which had been held in reserve, made an attack en masse alongside several other divisions, but together they made scanty gains of 500 - 1,000 metres at significant cost, and failed to capture a single German-held fortified village. Three days later, the offensive was shut down for good.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp 253, 256, 264 In the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 748 men killed and 1,954 wounded, and 4 missing-in-action, for a total of 2,706 casualties.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p 90  Shift to the South  After the Rzhev battles, the 243rd went into the reserves of Western Front, then into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding. In a somewhat unusual move, the division was then railed southward in January, 1943, to join 3rd Guards Army in Southwestern Front, taking part in the later stages of Operation Little Saturn in 18th Rifle Corps.Glantz, After Stalingrad, p 162 It remained in 3rd Guards until June. When the summer offensive began in July it was in 33rd Rifle Corps and moved with its corps successively to 1st Guards Army, 8th Guards Army, and 6th Army, all in Southwestern Front. From October, 1943 to February, 1944 the 243rd was back in 3rd Guards Army, now in 4th Ukrainian Front.Sharp, p 41 On February 8 the men and women of the division played a leading role in the liberation of Nikopol, and received the name of that city as an honorific. In late February the 243rd was once again reassigned, back to 6th Army, which was now in 3rd Ukrainian Front. It the following months it participated in the liberation of right-bank Ukraine, pushing towards Odessa, but then being halted along the Dniestr River. On April 22, Col. M.S. Tkachev took command of the division; at this time it was assigned to 66th Rifle Corps. On April 25 the 243rd was in second echelon of a corps assault on the German strongpoint at Leontevo, which was helping to confine Soviet forces in their bridgehead over the Dniestr south of Tiraspol. This effort, which continued until the 28th, was unsuccessful.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp 152-55 On May 4, 6th Army was disbanded by the front commander, Gen. R.I. Malinovsky, and the 243rd was reassigned to 34th Guards Rifle Corps (which at this time contained no Guards divisions), in 5th Shock Army. This corps was then shifted to the north of Grigoriopol, being in position by May 10. The front's orders called for an ambitious operation in mid-May to eliminate a German bridgehead on the east bank of the Dniestr, then to cross the river and help encircle the enemy forces facing 8th Guards Army farther south. 34th Guards Corps had 23rd Tank Corps in support, and the 243rd was in first echelon. After a 30-minute artillery preparation on May 14, the assault smashed the defenses of the battle group of 17th Infantry Division holding the line, and within hours had cleared the long salient of German troops. However, the position proved to be a trap. While the attackers could now fire into the rear of the enemy forces facing 8th Guards Army, those forces were still strong enough to continue constricting that army's bridgehead. Meanwhile, the troops in the salient were supposed to continue their attack across the river, so they could not dig in, while they were taking fire from three sides. Within days it was clear that the position was untenable, and German counterattacks across the river had cut off the \\"bottle\\", forcing the remaining men to break out to their own lines. The 203rd Rifle Division, fighting alongside the 243rd, reported its highest casualties of any operation of the war; this was likely true for the 243rd as well.Glantz, Red Storm, pp 286-88, 304-14  Balkan Campaign  At the start of the Second Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in July, the division had been brought back up to strength, still in 5th Shock Army, which was now in 2nd Ukrainian Front. Shortly after the start of the offensive, it was reassigned to 53rd Army, where it served while fighting through Romania into Hungary. In early 1945 it was shifted to 7th Guards Army north of Budapest, and then joined the 50th Rifle Corps in support of the 1st Guards Cavalry-Mechanized Group dashing across Austria in the last weeks of the war in Europe.Sharp, p 41  Manchurian Campaign  As soon as Germany surrendered, the 243rd was sent east by rail, once again in 53rd Army, to the Transbaikal Front in Mongolia, in preparation for war with the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria. When the August campaign ended, the division was given credit for its performance by receiving the name of the Khingan mountain range as its second honorific, making the final full title of its men and women \\"243rd Rifle, Nikopol- Khingan, Order of the Red Banner Division\\".Sharp, pp 41-42 (Russian: 243-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ù–∏–∫–æ–ø–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ-–•–∏–Ω–≥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è).

It has no named tributaries, but does flow through a lake known as Potter Lake. A bridge on the National Register of Historic Places crosses Bell Creek as well. The creek's watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Bell Creek begins in a very small unnamed pond to the west of Kennedy Hill. It flows south for a short distance, passing through a larger unnamed pond before entering Potter Lake, where it receives two unnamed tributaries from the left. The creek then flows south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile, entering a wetland and an unnamed lake, where it receives an unnamed tributary from the right. It then flows south for several tenths of a mile before turning south- southwest. After about a mile, the creek receives an unnamed tributary from the right and later turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile. It then turns south-southwest again for a few miles, receiving another unnamed tributary from the right before crossing Pennsylvania Route 92 and reaching its confluence with Tunkhannock Creek. Bell Creek is approximately long. The creek joins Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Bell Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is above sea level. The surficial geology alongside Bell Creek at its mouth consists of alluvial fan. Further upstream, there is alluvium and a patch of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The surficial geology of the surrounding valley in the lower reaches mainly includes bedrock and a till known as Wisconsinan Till. Further upstream, the surficial geology along the creek includes some alluvium, but mostly Wisconsinan Till. There are also a few patches of wetlands and lakes. The valley of Bell Creek in its upper reaches includes a \\"beaded valley\\" that was little affected by glacial erosion but considerably affected by glacial deposition, to the point that large amounts of glacial till partly or fully block off individual valleys. Watershed and biology The watershed of Bell Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Lenoxville. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Thompson. The creek also passes through the quadrangle of Harford. The mouth of the creek is located within of South Gibson. A lake known as Potter Lake is situated on Bell Creek. It is a large, mainly open- water bog-like habitat, although dams created by beavers and humans have raised the water levels, drowning much of the bog vegetation. The lake is listed on the Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory. Williams Field Services Company, LLC. was once issued a permit to built, maintain, and operate a natural gas pipeline and timber bridges crossing Bell Creek and one or more of its unnamed tributaries. History Bell Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169146. Bell Creek is so named due to a Captain Bell being one of the early settlers in the area. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 92 over Bell Creek was constructed in Gibson Township in 1951 and is long. A stone corbel arch bridge in South Gibson crosses Bell Creek, carrying State Route 2067. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 1988.

He joined a French light cavalry regiment in 1792 and served in the same regiment for 22 years, becoming its lieutenant colonel in 1806. He fought in the Peninsular War in 1810‚Äì1811 and in the latter year became colonel of the regiment. He fought in the 1812 French invasion of Russia, the 1813 German Campaign and the 1814 French Campaign. In 1814 he led a cavalry regiment at F√®re-Champenoise and Paris. He changed his allegiance to the Netherlands in 1815 and was appointed major general. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1826. He switched allegiance to the Kingdom of Belgium in 1831 and received the Order of Leopold in 1837. French Revolution On 14 January 1771, Ghigny was born in Brussels of parents √âtienne Ghigny and Maria Segers. In 1792 he joined the French 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment, becoming a second lieutenant on 5 September 1792, a first lieutenant on 28 July 1795 and a captain on 1 October 1795. The battle honors of the 12th Chasseurs include the battles of Valmy and Jemappes in 1792, the Battle of Neerwinden in 1793, the battles of Charleroi (Lambusart) and Fleurus in 1794, the Crossing of the Rhine in 1795, the battles of Amberg and Limburg in 1796 and the Battle of Neuwied in 1797. There is no specific mention of Ghigny in these actions, only that the regiment was recognized. During the Wars of the French Revolution Ghigny fought with the Army of the North, Army of Sambre-et-Meuse and Army of the Rhine. At Valmy, the 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval were in Arthur Dillon's advance guard of the Army of the North. At Jemappes the regiment formed part of Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville's Right Wing advance guard. It also fought at Aldenhoven in 1793. On 4 May 1794, the regiment was in Jacques Fromentin's division, part of Jacques Desjardin's Right Wing of the Army of the North. As part of the French strategy for the spring of 1794, Desjardins' Right Wing joined with Louis Charbonnier's Army of the Ardennes to form the 60,000-man right prong of a two-prong stroke against the Coalition. Between 11 May and 3 June this force crossed the Sambre River three times and was driven back each time. The three events were the battles of Grandreng on 13 May, Erquelinnes on 24 May and Gosselies on 3 June. After the latter defeat, Jean- Baptiste Jourdan brought reinforcements from the Army of the Moselle and took command of the combined force which henceforth became known as Army of Sambre- et-Meuse. On 16 June the French were beaten again at Charleroi. The Battle of Fleurus was fought on 26 June. Though it was not immediately realized, the subsequent Coalition retreat meant that Fleurus was the decisive battle of the Flanders Campaign. In the 1795 campaign, the 12th Chasseurs were part of Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly's 9,861-strong division. The following year, the regiment was in Jean Etienne Championnet's division, whose rear guard was led by Louis Klein at Amberg on 24 August 1796. The division also fought at the Battle of W√ºrzburg on 3 September and Limburg on 16 September. In 1799 the 12th Chasseurs were engaged near St. Luzisteig Pass in Switzerland. In 1800, the regiment fought at the battles of Stockach and Messkirch. The 12th Chasseurs were part of √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's division of Claude Lecourbe's Right Wing in the army of Jean Victor Marie Moreau. In mid-campaign the regiment was quickly transferred to Italy where it fought at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June. In this action, the 12th Chasseurs belonged to Bernard Duvignau's brigade when that general fled the field. The regiment was later sent to protect the army's southern flank. Empire Ghigny was promoted to major on 29 October 1803 and named a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 15 June 1804. The 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval fought at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 and at the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806. In the latter action the regiment was brigaded with the 1st and 2nd Chasseurs √† Cheval in the III Corps under Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout. Ghigny was appointed lieutenant colonel on 23 October 1806. The battle honors of the 12th Chasseurs also include the battles of Czarnowo and Golymin in 1806 and the Battle of Heilsberg in 1807. Louis Montbrun At the start of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, the 1st, 2nd and 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval were in Charles Claude Jacquinot's brigade in Louis-Pierre Montbrun's Light Cavalry Division in Davout's III Corps. The 12th Chasseurs counted 773 cavalrymen. Jacquinot's brigade was detached from Davout and added to a provisional corps led by Marshal Jean Lannes. On 20 April 1809, the force under Lannes drove the Austrian left wing back in the Battle of Abensberg. In 1809, the battle honors of the regiment include the battles of Eckmuhl, Ratisbon and Wagram. At Wagram the 12th Chasseurs were part of Pierre Claude Pajol's brigade in III Corps. On 6 July a massive cavalry fight took place on the right flank. After Montbrun's division was pressed back, Pajol's brigade charged into the melee to stop the Austrians. Finally, Emmanuel Grouchy's dragoon division routed the Austrian horsemen, allowing Davout's infantry to resume its advance. Ghigny fought in the Peninsular War in Spain during 1810‚Äì1811. At the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro on 3‚Äì5 May 1811, the 12th Chasseurs were in Pierre Watier's cavalry brigade with a strength of nine officers and 172 troopers. Having driven Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na's French army out of Portugal, the British army under Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington began the Blockade of Almeida. Before advancing to the relief of Almeida, Mass√©na's army absorbed large numbers of infantry replacements into its depleted ranks, but the cavalry and artillery were very weak due to heavy losses of horses in Portugal. Marshal Jean- Baptiste Bessi√®res reinforced Mass√©na with 30 artillery gun teams and two weak cavalry brigades, including Watier's, that counted 1,700 horsemen at most. On 5 May Watier's brigade was committed to the cavalry action against the British 7th Division, but the British made an orderly retreat with only two battalions being roughly handled. Ghigny was promoted to colonel of the 12th Chasseurs on 11 October 1811. Horace Sebastiani Ghigny led the 12th Chasseurs Regiment in the 1812 French invasion of Russia. He was wounded on 8 August in a successful clash between a 6,500-man Franco-Austrian force and the Russians. On 7 September, his regiment participated in the Battle of Borodino as part of Horace Sebastiani's 2nd Light Cavalry Division, part of the II Cavalry Corps. Ghigny was wounded again on 18 October in the Battle of Tarutino (Vinkovo). The regiment's war record also included the Battle of Krasnoi on 14‚Äì18 November. In 1813 Ghigny led his regiment during the German Campaign. At the Battle of Katzbach on 26 August, the 12th Chasseurs were still in the 2nd Light Cavalry Division, which was led by Nicolas-Fran√ßois Roussel d'Hurbal, and the II Cavalry Corps, now under Sebastiani. The regiment was engaged at the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October as part of the 7th Light Cavalry Brigade in Roussel d'Hurbal's division. In 1813, Ghigny was awarded the Officer's Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur and named a Baron of the Empire in 1813. For his service during the retreat from Germany, received the Commander's Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1814. During the Campaign in Northeast France, Ghigny appeared at Arcis-sur-Aube on 27 February 1814 leading a cavalry march regiment. Together with Roussel d'Hurbal's cavalry division and part of Pierre Fran√ßois Joseph Boyer's 9th Infantry Division, Ghigny's regiment was attached to the command of Marshal Michel Ney. March regiments were used to move soldiers of different units from the depots to the fighting front because they minimized desertion. They were not intended as permanent formations and were infrequently used in combat. A 17 March order of battle showed that Ghigny's 320-man march regiment was attached to Roussel d'Hurbal's 6th Heavy Cavalry Division in Marshal √âdouard Mortier, duc de Tr√©vise's Imperial Guard corps. At the Battle of Fere-Champenoise on 25 March, Roussel d'Hurbal and Ghigny were commanded by Augustin Daniel Belliard in Mortier's corps. After the Allied cavalry attacked Marshal Auguste de Marmont's force early in the morning, Mortier marched to join his colleague. Ghigny was posted facing east on the far left flank to watch a body of 1,000 Russian Cossacks. When the Russian cavalry threatened to turn the left flank, Ghigny was pulled back behind a stream, facing northeast. As more and more Allied cavalry appeared, the French marshals began to withdraw. Early in the afternoon the French right flank cavalry drove off a major attack, but the left flank cavalry suffered a setback. At 2:00 pm while the French troops were crossing a streambed, a powerful rainstorm struck, blinding them and wetting their gunpowder. The Allied cavalry charged, drove off the French cavalry and got among the infantry, breaking some squares and capturing most of the artillery. The marshals eventually rallied their troops, thanks to the fortuitous arrival of another march regiment, but French losses were heavy. In the Battle of Paris on 30 March the Allied armies deployed about 100,000 troops after subtracting 30,000 men in a covering force. Against the Allies, Marmont and Mortier could only field 19,961 infantry and 5,565 cavalry plus 12,000 skittish National Guards. Belliard's cavalry guarded the left flank. While the two marshals were heavily engaged, an Allied army corps under Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron approached Belliard's positions. After a French cavalry charge was repulsed, Langeron ordered his artillery to bombard Belliard's troopers. The badly outmatched French cavalry, including Ghigny's and two other march regiments rapidly retreated up the Montmartre Heights. The nearby National Guards abandoned their positions and fled. A cease fire agreement soon ended the fighting. Later in 1814 Ghigny received the Order of Saint Louis from King Louis XVIII of France. Dutch and Belgian service In 1815 Ghigny joined the Dutch army and was promoted major general on 21 April. At the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June he led the 2nd Cavalry Brigade in Jean Antoine de Collaert's Dutch-Belgian Cavalry Division. The brigade was made up of the 4th (Dutch) Light Dragoon and the 8th (Belgian) Hussar Regiments. After the 1st Brigade of Pierre Fran√ßois Joseph Durutte's French division was broken by British dragoons, Ghigny's brigade advanced downhill from the ridge. Durutte's routed brigade fled behind an infantry square from the VI Corps which Ghigny's horsemen charged without success. British officers branded the Dutch-Belgian cavalry as cowards based on an incident later recalled by Henry Paget, Earl of Uxbridge. In fact, casualties were heavy. At Waterloo, the 4th Light Dragoons lost 54 killed, 143 wounded and 52 missing while the 8th Hussars lost 11 killed, 151 wounded and 122 missing. The 4th Regiment started the day with 647 cavalrymen and the 8th had 439. Ghigny was awarded the Military William Order 3rd Class on 8 July 1815. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 26 October 1826. During the Belgian Revolution he was in command at Ghent, which he declared in a state of siege. Soon after, he was placed on the inactive list and he received an honorable discharge from the Dutch Army on 31 December 1830. Ghigny entered Belgian service as a lieutenant general on 15 February 1831. He received the Belgian Order of Leopold on 9 July 1837 for meritorious service. He died on either 1 December or 30 November 1844. A sepia print from the 1800s shows Ghigny in a dark military coat with epaulettes and a single row of buttons on the front. He is thin in appearance with large eyes, a small mouth, a small toothbrush moustache and a full head of hair.

The bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Representatives John Kline (R-Minnesota) and George Miller (D-California). Overview According to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), \\"In Kline-Miller, Congress established a new process for multiemployer pension plans to propose a temporary or permanent reduction of pension benefits if the plan is projected to run out of money.\\" According to the U.S. Treasury Department, \\"Kline-Miller requires the Treasury Department, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and the Department of Labor, to review a multiemployer pension plan‚Äôs application to reduce benefits and determine whether it meets the requirements set by Congress.\\" Kline-Miller applies to multiemployer pension plans, which are set up through collective bargaining agreements involving labor unions and more than one unrelated employer, typically in a single industry. Under Kline-Miller, a multiemployer plan whose trustees determine that the plan is in \\"critical and declining status\\", which means that it is projected to run out of money in less than 15 years (20 years in some circumstances), may seek to reduce benefits to try to keep the plan solvent. Within limits prescribed by Kline-Miller, the trustees‚Äîwho include representatives of workers and management but rarely retiree representatives‚Äîdesign the benefit reduction proposal. The reductions may be permanent or temporary. The size of the reductions and how the reductions are spread among participants, is subject to the trustees' discretion within the law's limits. The benefits of retirees who are older than 80 on the reduction date and those receiving disability pensions may not be reduced. Retirees between the ages of 75 and 79 are subject to smaller reductions than younger retirees. Trustees are required to reduce the benefits of participants who worked for employers that went out of business or withdrew from the plan for other reasons before they reduce other participants' benefits. No participant's benefit may be reduced below 110% of the amount that PBGC guarantees. Trustees may choose to reduce retirees' benefits more than workers' benefits, they may choose not to reduce survivors' benefits, or they may reduce all eligible participants' benefits equally. Before the trustees may cut any participant's benefit, the trustees must notify all participants about the benefit reduction proposal, including a benefit estimate that shows the participant's reduced benefit. The trustees must apply to the Treasury Department for approval of the reduction proposal, and they must demonstrate that the proposed reductions are sufficient to prevent future insolvency. Participants, including workers and retirees, vote on whether to accept the proposed reductions and a majority vote against the proposal would block it (although the Treasury Department, the Labor Department, and the PBGC can override their vote if they project that without the proposed reductions, PBGC will suffer future losses of $1 billion or more). If the Treasury Department and the participants approve the benefit reduction proposal, it takes effect. Retirees, survivors, and workers are not permitted to sue about their reduced benefits. Pension plans subject to Kline-Miller As of February 2016, the trustees of more than 60 multiemployer pension plans covering a total of more than 900,000 participants had notified the Labor Department that the plans were in \\"critical and declining status\\". The largest was the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \\"Central States Pension Fund\\"), which had more than 400,000 participants and was projected to become insolvent in 2025.

History In 1837, coal was found after a heavy rain at Clover Hill Plantation, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, possibly by a slave. After mining began, mules carried the coal four miles to Epps Falls on the Appomattox River to be loaded onto boats on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System. In 1841, the Clover Hill Railroad was created to haul coal from the Clover Hill Pits, to the Osborne Landing Docks and later Bermuda Hundred dock to be transported by barge over the ocean to the Northern States. In 1848 the Clover Hill Railroad had hauled 56,000 tons of coal for export and 22,000 tons for use in Richmond and Petersburg. The Clover Hill Pitts had several mining sites, the Brighthope Pit, the Halls pit and Racoon Pit. The company spread outside of Virginia. In 1876, Bituminous Coal from the Clover Hill Railroad Company was advertised in the Coal and Coal Trade Journal from a sales Office in New York. In 1877 the Brighthope Railway replaced the Clover Hill Railroad. In 1883, 83 employees worked for the Brighthope Mining Company. The mines were declining when the Brighthope Railway was founded. In 1890, the Norfolk and Western Railway brought in coal from a new coal mine in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Pocahontas Coalfield which could provide coal more cheaply and ship the coal on a larger standard gauge, class one railroad. This brought and end to the success of the Clover Hill Pits. Miners Slave owners leased their African slaves to be miners in the Clover Hill Pits. Slave owners would collect pay for the mining work as part of the lease agreements. Because the slave owner would suffer financial loss at the death of the slave, they purchased insurance policies that would pay the value of the slave to the owner in case of accidental death in the dangerous mines. The mining company also hired whites and hired Free people of color. Mining town Reformed Baptist Church of Richmond, Est. 1825 Many of the miners lived in town named Winterpock. Winterpock, had over 1000 residents in 1870, but as mining dwindled the community of miners became smaller. All that exists of the town today is the Reformed Baptist Church of Richmond established in 1825 and a store that was opened in 1926 to sell gasoline and food for automobile travelers after the railroad was converted into roads. Accidents The mining work was dangerous. In 1867, an explosion closed mine pits temporarily and a cholera epidemic slowed work. Methane explosions killed 17 and then 69 miners in 1859 and 1873 respectively. Nunnally Brothers Killed ‚ÄúTwo brothers instantly killed. Information was received here last night of an accident which occurred at Clover Hill pits on Thursday night, resulting in the instant killing of two brothers named Nunnally.

In 2011, Pang won a bronze in the men's 1500m freestyle to become the only other Singaporean to win a medal at the FINA Swimming World Cup. In 2015, he picked up his first individual Southeast Asian Games medal, clinching silver in the 400m individual medley. Personal life Pang is the youngest son of Agnes Ng and Pang Boon Teng. He has two sisters who swam competitively until they were 16 years old when they decided to focus on their studies instead. Pang started swimming from the age of four upon doctor's recommendation due to his asthma. He began competitive swimming at six years old. In 2014, he received an Outstanding Sports Achievement Award for swimming from the Singapore Sports School. He is currently a Sports Science and Management student at the Nanyang Technological University and will graduate in 2018. Career At the 2009 SEA Games in Laos, Pang, then 17 years old, saw his medal dreams crushed cruelly not once, but twice, when he finished fourth in the men's 200m and 400m individual medleys. He did not give up. Two years later, he was back at the 2011 SEA Games at Jakabaring Aquatics Centre in Palembang, determined to win a medal in his sole event, the 400m freestyle, but finished fifth. That could be said to be his lowest point in his swimming career. He had a near suicidal experience when he climbed up to the highest floor of his apartment building at the Games Village but his teammate and best friend Russell Ong stepped in just as he was about to take his last leap. Pang admitted that his demons ‚Äì depression ‚Äì never really went away, until he won gold with the men's 4x200m freestyle team at the Myanmar SEA Games in 2013. Despite the disappointment of missing out on the final cut for the 2016 Rio Olympics although he had clocked Olympic 'B' times in the 400m individual medley and freestyle, Pang is now set on winning honours at the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia, and plans to swim full- time after his graduation in 2018 as he targets an Olympic berth at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

History   Jack White‚Äôs hole  The pub‚Äôs name is a reference to Jack White, an Irish pirate that lived at the turn of the 18th century, reputed to be a first class smuggler. Jack White arranged shipment of Wicklow wool to be sent abroad to France in exchange for brandy, wine and French luxury goods. He operated in a place so called ‚ÄòJack‚Äôs Hole‚Äô, where now Jack White‚Äôs Inn is located, in Brittas Bay. After a falling out occurred over a particularly rich cargo of clandestine goods, Jack White was tried by some of his regular clients -high class gentlemen- and sentenced to death. There is a reputed copy of an arrest warrant on the wall of Jack White‚Äôs Inn.  Tom Nevin‚Äôs murder  In 1996, Jack White‚Äôs Inn was the scene of one of the most famous Irish murders. On the 16th of March of that year Tom Nevin, co-owner of the pub, was shot dead while counting the takings of the Bank Holiday Weekend. In a supposed botched robbery attempt, he was killed by a single shotgun blast. Catherine Nevin, Tom Nevin‚Äôs wife and also owner of the pub, was suspected of having hired three men to murder her husband. She was tried by a jury of six men and six women, and found guilty on 11 April 2000, after five days of deliberation, ‚Äúa record in Irish legal history\\". She was convicted for the murder and for soliciting three men (William McClean, Gerry Heapes and John Jones) to contract kill her husband. She maintained her innocence and had appealed on several occasions, without succeeding.  Revival  The restaurant and pub remained closed for some time before the murder of Tom Nevin. In January 1998, Catherine Nevin sold the pub. In 2003, Tadhg and Clare Kennedy -the current owners- purchased the property and recovered the pub's attendance.

He designed many well-known heritage buildings in both Darwin and Alice Springs. He is known for designing innovative, climate-appropriate buildings. Early life Burnett was born in Pao T'eo, Shansi Province of China, on 16 June 1889. The son of missionaries (his father from the Isle of Wight, England, his mother from Cardigan, Wales),Birth records from British Consulate in Tiensin plus China Inland Mission records he spent part of his youth at the China Inland Mission School in Chefoo. At 15 years of age, he began work with the architectural firm Smedly and Denham in Shanghai. He went on to work in Singapore, Japan and China. Some of this buildings are thought to be influenced by the colonial architecture of Malaysia and Singapore. He married Florence Mary Draper- Bentley in Shanghai on 8 December 1914.British Consulate records Shanghai After separating in 1934, Burnett moved to Australia. His wife and two children moved to Scotland. He was known to say that he was \\"the happiest of married men as his dear wife lived 12,000 miles away\\". Work in the Northern Territory Burnett House at Myilly Point In July 1937 Burnett was appointed Architect Grade One in the Works and Services Branch of the Department of the Interior. He commenced work in the newly created Darwin office. His role was to design a series of tropical houses for senior public servants and military personnel. He produced several different designs which had similar features. They predominantly were elevated, with steeply pitched roofs. The bedrooms were grouped around or adjacent to the central living area. Asbestos louvres and screened walls allowed for airflow throughout the house. Of his remaining houses, the heritage-listed Burnett House in Myilly Point in Darwin is his best known. In February 1942, Darwin was bombed by the Japanese and Burnett was evacuated to Alice Springs. He designed a number of houses for the Central Australian climate, including the Riverside Hotel (now the Todd Tavern). Many of his residential buildings now make up the Hartley Street heritage precinct in Alice Springs. These include number 75, 80, 81, 82, 84 and 86 Hartley Street and 81 Bath Street. Burnett often performed in the role of Magistrate and Coroner in Alice Springs. He was known to have had an unconventional approach to the law. On one instance when he was overseeing a case of two youths arrested for fighting, it became apparent that neither party knew who had begun the fight, nor who had won it. Burnett ordered the fight recommence under the supervision of a local policeman and adjourned the case. They were then fined five Shillings and told that it would be cheaper to confine their fighting to the youth club from now on. Later life Burnett spent the later part of his life sketching the clientele in public bars throughout Alice Springs. He was known for his signature dress, which included knee-high woollen socks with tartan tabs from Scotland. He did not take kindly to comments about his socks.

The compaction mechanism runs on a battery, which is charged by the solar panel. Fully charged, the battery reserve lasts for approximately 3-4 weeks depending on the compaction frequency and usage patterns. Solar-powered waste compactors are typically connected to a remote software platform through wireless 2G/3G networks. The platform enables waste collection managers to access real-time data analytics and route optimization. Solar-powered compactors are primarily used in high foot traffic areas such as town centers, shopping malls, amusement parks, beaches, transit stations and sports stadiums.  Advantages  Some of the benefits of using solar-powered waste compactors include: * Reduced frequency of waste collections * Cleaner and more hygienic public spaces * Historical waste collection data analytics * Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions * Savings in operational waste collection costs  References   See also  * BigBelly * Ecube Labs  External links  * Anta Swiss AG * BigBelly Solar * ECOnX * Ecube Labs * BritishBins SolaPacta Waste management Smart devices ","title":"Solar-powered waste compacting bin"},{"id":"51216983","text":"Getchell is an unincorporated community in Snohomish County, in the U.S. state of Washington.

He is buried in Ocean View Burial Park, Burnaby, British Columbia. With Sydney Williams, Captain Phil Thompson, R. Parkinson (a surveyor), and a Mr Knox of Duncan, he was in the second party to climb Grouse Mountain, on October 12, 1894. On that trip they shot a blue grouse, giving the mountain its name. That party was the first to climb Dam Mountain: from the top of this mountain they could see the old waterworks dam on the Capilano River, hence the name. They then proceeded onto, and were the first to ascend Goat Mountain, where they shot two goats on the summit: \\"one of which was secured while the other took a tumble over the cliffs above Crown Pass after being wounded.\\" He later named Mt Fromme.

Different disability groups compete in this class, including people with spinal cord injuries. Events that may be on the program for F54 competitors include the discus throw, shot put and javelin.  Definition  International Paralympic Committee defined this classification on their website in July 2016, \\"Athletes have full power and movements in their arms, but no power in their abdominal muscles and typically no sitting balance. An athlete with partial to full trunk control but with upper limbs that fit the F53 profile is appropriately placed in this class.\\" The Spectator Guide for the Rio Paralympics defines the class as, \\"wheelchair athletes (effects of polio, spinal cord injuries and amputations)\\"  Spinal cord injuries  People with spinal cord injuries compete in this class, including F4 sportspeople. = F4 = Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F4 class. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level T1 - T7. In the past, this class was known as 1C Incomplete, 2 Complete, or Upper 3 Complete. F4 sportspeople may have good sitting balance and some impairment in their dominant hand. Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have no sitting balance. [...] Usually hold onto part of the chair while throwing. Complete Class 2 and upper Class 3 Athletes have normal upper limbs. They can hold the throwing implement normally. They have no functional trunk movements.Incomplete 1C Athletes who have trunk movements, with hand function like F3.\\" People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 85% compared to people without a disability.  Performance and rules  Athletes in this class used secure frames for throwing events. The frame can be only one of two shapes: A rectangle or square. The sides must be at least long. The seat needs to be lower at the back or level, and it cannot be taller than . This height includes any cushioning or padding. Throwers can have footplates on their frames, but the footplate can only be used for stability. It cannot be used to push off from. Rests can be used on the frame but they need to be present only for safety reasons and to aide in athlete stability. They need to be manufactured from rigid materials that do not move. These materials may include steel or aluminum. The backrest can have cushioning but it cannot be thicker than . It cannot have any movable parts. The frame can also have a holding bar. The holding bar needs to be round or square, and needs to be a single straight piece. Athletes are not required to use a holding bar during their throw, and they can hold on to any part of the frame during their throw. Throwing frames should be inspected prior to the event. This should be done either in the call room or in the competition area. In general, people in this class should be allocated around 2 minutes to set up their chair. Athletes need to throw from a seated position. They cannot throw from an inclined or other position. Doing so could increase the contribution of their legs and benefit their performance. Their legs must be in contact with the seat during the throw. If an athlete throws from a non- seated position, this is counted as a foul. People in this class cannot put tape on their hands. All straps used to hold the athlete to the frame must be non-elastic. While in the process of throwing, an athlete cannot touch a tie- down for the frame. Because of visibility issues for officials, athletes cannot wear lose clothing and they can ask athletes to tuck in clothing if they feel there is any issue with visibility. In throwing events at the Paralympic Games and World Championships, athletes get three trial throws. After that, the top 8 throwers get an additional three throws. For other events, organizers generally have the option to use that formula to give all throwers six consecutive throws. The total number of warm-up throws is at the discretion of the meet director.  Events  Events that may be on the program for F54 competitors include the discus throw, shot put and javelin.

Although usually described as a tenor, he had an extraordinarily wide vocal range spanning bass to tenor. He was known not only for the quality of his singing but for his skill as an actor. Borosini created numerous leading roles in the operas of Francesco Bartolomeo Conti and Johann Joseph Fux at the imperial court in Vienna and was the first great Italian tenor to appear in London.Grout, Donald and Williams, Hermine Weigel (2003). A Short History of Opera, 4th edition, p. 234. Columbia University Press. Macy, Laura Williams (ed.) (2008). The Grove Book of Opera Singers, p. 54. Oxford University Press. Borosini was born in Modena and was schooled in singing by his father, Antonio Borosini, a tenor and composer active in Venice and Modena who later became a singer at the imperial court in Vienna. Francesco is thought to have made his debut in 1709 in Venice singing in Antonio Lotti's Il vincitor generoso. Like his father, he was appointed as a singer to the Viennese imperial court and performed there from 1711 until 1731 with intermittent sojourns to Italy and London where he worked closely with Handel. He created the role of Bajazet in Handel's Tamerlano, one of several which the composer wrote or rewrote expressly for Borosini's voice. Borosini was married to the soprano Rosa Borosini who often appeared with him in operas and oratorios in Vienna. Rosa retired from singing in 1740 and died in Vienna in 1761.

Her work touches upon themes of Aymara survival and Latinx culture, LGBT and its Aymara femme heritage, science fiction, references to Christian faith and ontology, and frequent utilization of samples and arrangements from varying sources. Elysia Crampton in concert at OBEY Convention X (2017)  Career  Elysia Crampton began making music under the name E+E (\\"And & And\\" in Spanish) in the early ‚Äô00s. E+E consisted of several performers and contributing writers, editors, and DJ mixes made with a keyboard, acapellas, and a sampler. In 2015 Crampton ceased using the E+E alias and released her first studio album, American Drift, under her real name. The album took three years to make and was made as a way to describe her unique experience of finding a home in Virginia in the aforementioned years. The album was released on August 7, 2015, and was met with critical success. The music review website Pitchfork gave the album an 8.1 out of 10 and said, in praise: > The Virginia producer Elysia Crampton's debut album is only four songs long, > but it represents a monumental undertaking. She has described it as an > exploration of Virginia's history as well as a meditation on brownness, on > being Latina, and as a kind of geology. Her epiphanies feel hard-won, and > they shine all the more brightly for it. Crampton released her second album, Elysia Crampton Presents: Demon City, on July 22, 2016. It was a collaboration with friends/peers including Houston producer Rabit, Danish producer Why Be, London producer Lexxi, and Alabama producer Chino Amobi. Music review Web site Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album a 4.5 out of 5, while Pitchfork said: \\"Demon City, Virginia producer Elysia Crampton's follow-up to her sumptuous debut American Drift, is a wonder of concision and represents another massive leap forward in her growth,\\" of the album. Crampton's physical output to date has consisted solely of project studio or home studio recordings, with her first two LP's The Light That You Gave Me To See You (2012) and American Drift (2015), as well as EP's Bound Adam 2011 and Moth/Lake (2015) all being recorded in her Ford Ranger truck.  Musical style  Crampton's music is notable for drawing from an eclectic and wide variety of influences, including cumbia, and Andean music like huayno and tarqueada, as well as American genres like crunk, metal, ambient, R&B; and minimalism. However, her eclecticism is owed to her understanding and incorporation of Aymara ontology in her music, specifically the concepts of taypi and ch'ixi. As a way of summing up her intent to a style, she has used the tags prog and folk to describe her music. During the time of the making of Elysia's album American Drift, she was living in rural Virginia and being inspired by the expansive local geographical features around the area, described as \\"wild Southern surroundings\\", in the area, one of which was the Shenandoah Mountain. She previously made journeys around it, with one inspiring track two of American Drift, 'Petrichrist'. Elysia is heavily inspired by varying forms of cultural music and the interesting sound design that often accompanies them, although her upbringing and roots in music that have influenced her show their presence. In an interview, she remarked that \\"the older I get, the uglier I want my music to feel, to be\\". > Through music, the post-colonial divide between Peru and Bolivia was bridged > for me, and I was allowed to glimpse an ancient, illusive moment of my > heritage that barred nationalistic dividings. The mixture of electronic and > acoustic sounds, especially in huayno, provided inspiration that has stuck > to this day. The incorporation of these textures into my own voice never had > to be deliberately sought out; these ancestral/familial narratives, > languages, tones, colors‚Ä¶ moved with me as I musically came of age. Crampton also cited many individuals as influences for her 2015 album American Drift, including Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz (a noted Cuban-American queer theorist), black pianist Margaret Bonds, Jeffrey Jerome Cohen (a writer and professor in Medieval studies) and queer performance artist, photographer and close friend Boychild. Crampton has said that her 2016 album, Elysia Crampton Presents: Demon City, was written in the style of a musical epic poem. She said that the album was inspired by Aymaran revolutionary Bartolina Sisa, who is often remembered in indigenous history. The album is a companion piece to Crampton's theatrical production & DJ set, Dissolution of the Sovereign: A Timeslide into the Future, written and performed as both a 'visual & performative essay', a sci-fi style play, and an ontological coda to Sisa's story with a narrative revolving around her severed limbs. An album of Native American classical and folk, \\"Quirquincho Medicine\\", was released under Crampton's native name, Chuquimamani-Condori, on Bandcamp on July 25, 2019.  Personal life  Crampton took piano and keyboard lessons as a child, but later started taking music seriously after her teenage years, around 2007 to 2008. She was born and grew up in the desert outside Barstow, California. Crampton lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving between the United States, Mexico, and Bolivia for most of her life. After finishing up her first studio album, American Drift, Elysia returned to Pacajes, Bolivia, to care for her grandmother Flora.

The parish's patroness is Saint Anne.  History   The Grupo  In the year 1908 started the Grupo of their annual feast. The first Ermita measured 6m x 10m, was built on the land of Silverio Merluza. At present, it is owned by Dolores Villasenor VDA. De Guevarra, in the care of Nena Bendico. It is on the right side of the old road, built near the former elementary school. The school (Malicboy Elementary School) was made a Japanese garrison. According to the people of Crossing, adjacent to the former hermitage was built a tomb for the people killed by Japanese soldiers including three nuns in white. The Grupo, led by Pio Dimalaluan and Enrique Glorioso agreed to seek the help of Lino Castro, who is from the town proper, Pagbilao and owner of the farm cultivated by Pio. Lino was the one who would invite a priest to say mass for their fiesta. Father and daughter Lino and Ana then arranged that the fiesta mass on their farm be held on Ana's birthday which is July 26. On that day Ana Castro brought the picture of her patron saint; St. Anne. From then on, Ana brought the picture every year until she had it enshrined in the ermita under the care of Pio. The Grupo is an organization of males in Malicboy. ‚Ä¢Grupo ng Crossing ‚Äì Enrique Glorioso, Boris Tiay and Felicisimo Tiay ‚Ä¢Grupo ng Sapinit ‚Äì Pio Dimalaluan, Cipriano Ayala, Catalino ‚ÄúTog-ok‚Äù Catausan, and Miguel Merjudio Lorenzo Salazar, a guy from Tuguegarao, Cagayan, left Malicboy on start the WWII, carrying the image of Sta. Ana.  1926  A strong storm hit the village in 1926 and destroyed the Ermita.  World War II  In 1937, before World War II, the elected Barrio Captain: Vicente Batilo, together with his constituents, built a new ermita on top of a hill owned by Severina Luna (mother of the Ayala clan) to make it nearer to the community. The land is now owned by the Lukang family. People started building new houses around the then newly constructed train station. A contest in the barrio was conducted, and was used as fund raising to build the Hermitage. One of the candidates was Mrs. Carmen Abrigo. There are no other images in the new Ermita but the Holy cross. Consequently, the Hermitage was adorned by flowers made of paper, there was always a reminder: \\"ito ay \\"Simbahan\\", Hindi sayawan\\"(this is \\"Church\\", not a place for dancing). Fr. Francisco Ayala, priest from Pagbilao, presided over the masses held there. He was assignment in Macalelon, but returned to Pagbilao because of the war. During these times, Ana hired an artist from Lucban, Lucilo Empamano, who decorated the ermita every year during the fiesta, to adorn the Hermitage. He made an image of patroness by dressing a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, before it was called Mediatrix of All Graces, in a red cloth. ‚ÄúSi Lucilo Empamano ay taga Lucban, walang asawa, at medyo malambot kung kumilos, siya ay isang pintor.‚Äù -Interview with Vicente & Natalia Ayala (February 20, 2007) The image of Sta. Ana was clothed by Ana Castro every feast. It is clothed in a White cloth with a Blue cape. (according to Carmen Abprigo). Because of the WWII, the vicinity of the Ermita was used as a Cemetery. 13-17 are known to be buried here currently, yet, only 6 were named. They are: Arcelita Ayala, Amando (Andoy) Florantes, Jesus de Espiritu Santo, Simfro Batilo, Eleonor Catausan and Rodencio Catausan. Until such time that the structure was destroyed by termites, Malicboy had no permanent church. For quite a long time, the yearly mass celebrations was held under a temporary bamboo frame erected wherever they could arrange for space.  Angel Glorioso and the New Ermita  Another Ermita was built in land of Marquez (Sitio Magsaysay). Fr. Diogracias Medrano precided the masses held there. But it was again damaged only after a year. Later, on a lot inherited by Angel Glorioso from his father Enrique, a new wooden ermita with tin roof was built. This area used to be situated behind the houses and a warehouse owned by a Chinese businessman. In 1948, in Lipa, Batangas, the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced as the Mediatrix of All Graces.  Single St. Anne Image  The couple Angel and Canding (Catapat) went on to have the ermita built. The structure was made sturdy with wooden walls. In April of that year, a stranger had his car broke down near the railroad crossing which is near the couple's house. The occupants are from Pampanga and were selling Christ the King images. The strangers stayed in the couple's house for the night. By next day, an order was placed for an image of St. Anne based on the picture left behind by Ana Castro-Martinez. In May of that year, the new image was delivered. The image did not have an infant Mary yet because the picture on which it was based from could be representing the time that St. Anne is still single. With the image of St. Anne, the people were inspired to improve the ermita. Many contributed wooden planks for the walls. Dr. Rafael Borja donated the lacking wooden planks to have the walls completed in time for the fiesta of 1952.  The First Parish Church  In 1952, the first parish church of Sta. Ana was built, through the command of Bishop Alfredo Ma. Obviar, D.D, the first Bishop of Lucena, the scope of 5 Barangays: Binahaan, Ilaya and Ibabang Polo, & Silangan and Kanlurang Malicboy. From then on, the parish improved with a convent built in 1959. Also, the lot was elevated to avoid getting flooded. the first Parish Church in 1952  The Request  A few months after the fiesta of 1957, with advise from Rev. Fr. Vicente Urlanda, the people requested from Most Rev. Bishop Alfredo Ma. Obviar for St. Anne Church to have their own priest. The first religious procession was held led by the parochial vicar of Pagbilao, Fr. Severino Salvania, who organized a mass and baptism. The Glorioso couple soon donated their lot to the future parish priest, Fr. Vicente Urlanda, Curate of Pagbilao, presented to bishop Obviar, the petition of the people for a regular priest.  Bigger, Sturdier  On 2 July 1960, the corner stone was laid for the new parish church. As years passed, the construction was continuing and the parish was able to acquire adjacent lots with generous help from parishioners. A bigger and sturdier church, furnished with a marble altar, was built.  July 25, 1983  The church was completed and blessed on 25 July 1983.

The religious was also known for her generous donations to the poor of the Abruzzo region despite being in the cloister. The confirmation of the late religious' 'cultus' (or popular devotion and following) - in 1841 - allowed for Pope Gregory XVI to approve for her beatification. Life Mattia Ciccarelli was born in 1481 in Luco dei Marsi as the last of six children to Domenico de Pericolo and Maria de Pericolo. An image of the Pieta was kept in the Luco home. Her call to the religious life solidified during her childhood and she decided to enter the religious life as a nun. In 1492 she was placed under the spiritual direction of the Franciscan priest Vincenzo dell'Aquila and took his advice on joining the Order of Saint Augustine. Ciccarelli entered the convent of Santa Lucia in Aquileia in June 1505 and assumed both the habit the religious name of \\"Cristina\\". She served as the abbess several times and was noted for being a prophetic figure (who would receive ecstasies) and one who received visions on occasion. She became noted for her humble outlook as well as for her tender care of the poor. On one occasion - on the Feast of Corpus Christi - she was seen to have levitated and the image of the Eucharist as a host appeared and radiated from her upper chest. Another occasion - on Good Friday - saw her receive the stigmata and the pains that Jesus felt until Holy Saturday when the pain subsided. Her spiritual guide was Father Girolamo da Tussio. Ciccarelli also fostered a devotion to Mark the Evangelist and this led to an instance when, according to Ciccarelli, Martin of Tours appeared to her and asked why she had a devotion to the latter saint rather than to him - this prompted her to foster a devotion to him as well. On one particular occasion a man accustomed to cursing blasphemed Anthony of Padua and she told him to be careful for if he continued to blaspheme she saw a black devil behind him set to choke him for such offences. The man - riding a donkey - did it again and was thrown to the ground where he fractured his skull and broke his neck which led to his death. Ciccarelli died in 1543 after battling illness and was interred in the convent of Santa Lucia to the right side of the main altar. The suppression of Santa Lucia on 12 October 1908 saw her remains interred in the convent of Sant'Amico. The first biographical account of her life came in 1595 after the nobleman Giampietro Interverj from l'Aquila decided to chronicle her life while the Belgian Augustinian scholar Cornelius Curtius printed another in the Latin language in Cologne. Beatification The confirmation of Ciccarelli's longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) allowed for Pope Gregory XVI - on 15 January 1841 - to approve her beatification.

His restaurant in Shimla, Peliti's, was very popular and finds mention in numerous writings of the period including those by Rudyard Kipling. A collection of his photographs documenting British Indian life was published in Turin in 1994. He received a bronze medal from the French government in 1889 which entitled him to the title of Chevalier.Section II. Chocolats, Confiserie Medailles de bronze. in Journal Officiel De La Republique Francaise 30 September 1889. No. 264. p. 4810  Biography  Peliti's restaurant in Calcutta, Pelity was born in Carignano. Descended from a family of surveyors from Valganna, Peliti studied sculpture under Vincenzo Vela at the Accademia Albertina in Turin. He graduated in 1865 and joined the Third Italian War of Independence as a cavalier in the 1st Nizza regiment. Here he met some confectioners and pastry makers and learned theirs skills. Richard Bourke, V Earl of Mayo, Viceroy of British India in 1869 searched for a chef in Paris and held a competition which was won by Peliti. Peliti then moved to India and settled in Calcutta. In 1872, his employer Lord Mayo was assassinated and Peliti established O'Neill & Peliti, a bakery at No. 41 Bentinck Street. The partnership broke up and Peliti moved to 18/1 Chowringhee road in 1875. In 1881 he opened a restaurant at Esplanade East which became popular among British high society and in the same year he also extended his operations in Shimla, the summer capital of British India. The cafe which was next to the Combermere bridge in Shimla had a terrace overlooking the valley and was very popular. He built a home in Mashobra called Villa Carignano (after the place of his birth) where he stayed. He was much sought after caterer. He catered for a lunch hosted by the Prince of Wales in Burma in 1891. Peliti also took to the hotel industry by establishing Peliti's Grand Hotel in Shimla at Bentinck castle. In 1884 he started a company that canned food for export. In 1883‚Äì1884 he won a medal at the Calcutta International Exhibition for confectionery; another medal in 1889 at the Universal Exhibition in Paris, and in 1895 Calcutta. In 1898 he received three gold medals at the National Exhibition of Turin including one for his photography. Peliti also trained a few other Italian confectioners such as Angelo Firpo from Genoa who set up another restaurant in Calcutta. Felice Cornaglia, another associate took over the business in Bombay. He married Judith Molloy, the daughter of an Irish British-Indian government official. In 1902 he started a new office in Calcutta and then handed over management to his sons Edoardo and Federico. He then moved back to Carignano in Italy where he died in 1914. A road in Carignano is named after him.  In literature  Peliti's Grand Hotel at Shimla was destroyed in a fire in 1922. Peliti's restaurants were the centre of social activity both at Shimla and at Calcutta. The restaurant and cafe at Shimla was very popular with Shimla high society and Rudyard Kipling mentions Peliti's restaurant in several of his works. In his poem Divided Destinies (1885) he compares the life of a beggar with his (a Shimla resident's) and his beggar's claim to virtue is that he does not flirt with the wives of others at Peliti's. A poem to Peliti published in Punch magazine (1919) notes the flavour of the place. The restaurant at Calcutta was also a meeting place for some scholarly societies like the Calcutta Historical Society and the Institution of Electrical Engineers.  Photography  Peliti trained in photography under Felice Bardelli (1849‚Äì1910) and set up a photography lab at his villa in Mashobra. He took an interest in documenting the picturesque, ethnic and exotic subjects. He associated himself with the Photographic Society of Bombay and with other pioneering photographers including Felice Beato, Bourne & Shepherd, Lala Deen Dayal and others. He also documented his pastry creations and catering events. Notes  References  * Hobbs, Harry (1938) Talkeetalkeewallahs and Others. Calcutta. * Miraglia, Marina (editor) 1995.

He took refuge in The Hague in 1709 for matters of religion. He abandoned the profession of bookseller around 1713. From 1713 to 1723, he was proofreader at Fritsch and B√∂hm in Rotterdam, then editor at the Journal litt√©raire from 1713 to 1737; booksellers catalogs editor; review editor; author of the Dictionnaire historique ou M√©moires critiques et litt√©raires, edited by J.

At the end of his life, he was attached to Daniel Monnier, a librarian in The HagueBNF Notice n¬∫ FRBNF12017619 catalogue.bnf.fr  Biography  He studied in Paris with much success and was then placed by a bookseller to learn the trade. Fascinated from childhood by books, he acquired in a short time all the necessary knowledge and was admitted in 1698 in the guild of booksellers. He opened rue Saint-Jacques, under the banner Ph√©nix, a store that soon became the meeting place for bibliophiles of the capital. Eager of literary anecdotes, he would forward them to Jacques Bernard, who then wrote in Holland the Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres, and he formed at the same time for his personal use, collections which were very useful to him. Marchand went to Holland in 1711 to more freely profess the reformed religion he had embraced. He settled in Amsterdam and continued for some time the bookselling business; but, disgusted with the lack of good faith of most of his colleagues, he gave up entirely to indulge only in studying. The editions he successively published of various books became rare made him advantageously known, and he found himself looked after by all scholars of Europe who shared his tastes. The habit of a frugal life had fortified his naturally robust health, and he rarely left his office, but he was receiving all those who came to benefit his knowledge and communicated with them with pleasure. He succeeded, amid these peaceful occupations, at an advanced age, and died June 14, 1756. He bequeathed in his will, the fruit of his savings to the company of the poor of The Hague, and his rich library to the Leiden University.  Publications  Marchand took part in the ingenious satire of the Chef d'≈ìuvre d'un inconnuSee Saint- Hyacinthe. He provided notes on the Satire M√©nipp√©e and was one of the main writers of the Journal litt√©raire (The Hague),The Hague, vol. in-12. one of the best periodical books in Holland. He also left: * The Catalogues des biblioth√®ques d'Em. Bigot, 1706 ; by Jean Giraud and Joachim Faultrier, 1709, in-8¬∞. This catalog is rare and sought after by curious because Marchand prefaced it with his Nouveau syst√®me bibliographique (Epitome systematis bibliographici). All books were divided into three main classes: philosophy, theology and history. Marchand's system did not prevail thoughIt is advisable to look at the Dictionnaire bibliologique by Gabriel Peignot, where the analysis of the best-known various systems of bibliography can be found. but we owe him significant improvements in catalography such as the arrangement of books in order of topics, without distinction of size, the exact indication of titles in different languages, that of the anonymous authors, publishers, printers, etc. ; * L'Histoire critique de l'Anti-Cotton, satire composed by C√©sar de Plaix, lawyer.

This book follows the Dictionnaires by Pierre Bayle and Chauffepi√©. The author left the manuscript but he instructed Jean Nicolas Allamand Samuel, his friend and executor, to review and publish it. To meet his confidence, Allamand spent four years putting in order Marchand's notes, most of them written on scraps of paper in a disorganized manner.

This book contains many interesting facts and curious anecdotes; but, there are also a lot of meticulous; the style is weak and incorrect; there are many serious errors and misprints; Finally, we can blame the author's passion with which he criticized the abuses of the Roman religion.

Young trees have a long trunk with no branches. Large leaves grow directly from the top of the trunk giving them an appearance similar to tree ferns, particularly immature Schizolobium parahyba. When mature, J. copaia grows to and is normally branch free for more than 50% of its height. The top consists of a \\"vase-shaped crown\\" of branches and leaves.

Townsend Ludington and Charles T. Ludington), (January 16, 1896 ‚Äì January 19, 1968), was a businessman and socialite of Philadelphia. He was an aviation pioneer who helped establish an every-hour-on-the-hour air service between New York and Washington.  Early life  MIT 1922 Yearbook ‚Äì \\"Technique\\" C T Ludington (bottom row, far right) Ludington was the first child of Charles Henry Ludington and Ethel Mildred (Saltus) Ludington. He was born in New York City on January 16, 1896. His parents were married in Brooklyn, New York, in April 1895. He had two brothers; Wright S. Ludington who was born in New York City in 1900, and Nicholas who was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1904. Ludington went to public schools in New York City while a young boy. He was sent to Adirondack School of northeastern New York state for private secondary education for grades 7 through 10 and Haverford School to finish high school. After he graduated from high school, he went to Yale University and graduated from there in 1919. He went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) part-time and received a degree in 1922. He was the secretary of the Aeronautical Engineering Society at MIT. He considered himself an aerodynamicist.  Mid-life and career  NASM, Ludington used it for aerial demonstrations. Ludington learned how to fly an airplane while a teenager. With his brother Nicholas, he was co-owner of the Philadelphia Flying Service, a pilot training school established in 1922. They organized the Ludington Exhibition Company in the same year as a distributorship. Early in 1923 Ludington imported two custom built Farman Sport airplanes made for W. Wallace Kellett in France. Robert Hewitt was employed to pilot them at various demonstrations throughout the nation. They were used at the St. Louis and Dayton national air races. The Ludingtons and Kellett were the American distributors for the aircraft. The price of the plane was too expensive and few sold, forcing them out of this business. The only one known to exist is the restored one at Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. This plane suffered much damage in 1928 and its airworthiness certificate was revoked. It was warehoused for years. An aviation historian ultimately restored it and regained flight certification. Ludington personally identified the aircraft as one he owned. Ludington was one of the pioneers in the early 1920s that helped develop National Air Transport. He partnered as their vice president until it merged with United Aircraft and Transport Corporation later. Ludington and several other local businessmen instigated Camden Central Airport, in Camden, N.J., on 140 acres of land he owned. Construction of the airport began in early 1929. It was formally dedicated and opened in September with the raising of the American flag by his five-year-old daughter Ethel. There were 10,000 people that attended the official opening celebrations. Ludington also offered a line of boats under the Ludington Boats Corporation between 1929 and 1931. Outboard racer Jake Dunnell did the design work. Five series were offered, the Sportship Senior, Sportship, Lightning, Rocket, and Flash. Several boat races were won with Ludington hydroplane series of boats. Ludington and his brother in 1930, with two other airline executives, were pioneers in the aviation industry by starting an hourly air service for passengers only using this specially designed plane. The executive specialists were Eugene Luther Vidal and Paul F. Collins, who originally had the idea for such an airline. Between the four of them they managed to run Ludington Airline without government mail revenues and made a profit for two years. For a short time Amelia Earhart was hired as vice-president and in charge of publicity. In 1933 the Ludington Line put in a bid (0.25 cents per mile) against Eastern Air Transport (0.89 cents per mile) for an airmail contract and lost its lower bid to the higher bid of Eastern, newspaper reporter Fulton Lewis began to look into the upset. The event began the investigation known as the Air Mail scandal. The Ludington Line was sold to Eastern Air Transport, later known as Eastern Airlines. The proceeds were used to purchase the Hoover airport which was later sold at a profit. In early 1941, as rumors of the United States entering the war were being discussed, a conversation at the Old Lyme Beach Club in Old Lyme, Connecticut was about to offer Ludington his next project. James A Gould, president and treasurer of the Pratt-Read & Company piano builder in Deep River, Connecticut, was talking with Roger Griswold and CT Ludington about using the wood working skills of Pratt-Read to contribute to the war effort. Knowing that aircraft production had been increased, the conversation turned to training aircraft and a training glider came up. James Gould became interested in the training glider idea and the Gould Aeronautical Division of Pratt-Read was created. A team of glider enthusiasts and builders, along with the engineering skills of Griswold and Ludington, were assembled to begin on a project that would lead to the experimental Pratt-Read PR-G1 glider. The success of this glider would lead to a Navy contract for training gliders known as the LNE-1. Ludington and Griswold had formed Ludington-Griswold, Inc. in Saybrook, Connecticut, where a new building was erected for their research. They had left employment from the Gould Aeronautical Division after the Navy picked up the contract for the LNE-1 glider and production begun. Pratt-Read had won a contract from Materiel Division, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture the Army Air Forces Waco CG-4A combat glider. The Ludington-Griswold company shifted their development work to improvements to the CG-4A. Roger Griswold developed a more aerodynamic nose section to replace the boxy and poorly protected cockpit section of the CG-4A with his own design known as the \\"Griswold Nose.\\" This was fitted to a Pratt-Read glider and flown to Wright Field for evaluation and testing. The nose section was found to be more aerodynamic, used a tow rope attachment centered at the front of the nose (unlike the top of the nose attachment found on the CG-4A), and incorporate better protection for the pilots. Wright Field felt that adding the Griswold Nose to the present CG-4A glider would slow down production at a time when glider production was a priority. However, Materiel Division asked Ludington-Griswold to produce a simplified version of the pilot protection assembly and produce it as a bolt on kit to the front of the CG-4A nose section. This led to the development, testing, and production of the \\"Ludington-Griswold Crash Protection Device\\" which was manufactured in time to be installed on a number of the CG-4A gliders used in the Normandy D-Day invasion. Subsequent overseas gliders were also fitted with the device which many glider pilots credited in saving injuries and lives. Later life Following the end of the war, Ludington-Griswold entered into a contract with Wright Field, now known as the Air Materiel Command. The Ballistics Aerodynamic Research Project (BARP) was a project to determine drag and stability of transonic missiles of various shapes and designs. The testing process and scaled down missile shapes can be found in an article written in Mechanics Illustrated, December 1947. With completion of the contract, no other military contracts were issued. Ludington-Griswold also went into developing a line of toys with the stamped aluminum Super Sonicraft, LG-515, flying delta wing designed by Henry Struck as being a best seller. Like many small companies created during the war effort, the Ludington-Griswold company would eventually go out of business in 1949. Ludington in later life had homes in Philadelphia and Old Lyme, Connecticut. He died at the age of 72 on January 19, 1968.  Family  Ludington married Constance Guyot Cameron of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, on June 27, 1922. Their first child was Ethel Saltus, born at Ardmore on May 21, 1923. Their second child was Anne Finley, born at Ardmore on September 26, 1925. Their third child was Constance Cameron, born September 1, 1931. Charles Townsend Ludington, Jr., was their fourth child, born on January 31, 1935.  Associations  Ludington was a founder and first president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association He was also founder and associate director of the aviation wing of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He was a technical advisor from time to time for National Air Transport, Keystone Aircraft, Fairchild Aviation, North American Aviation, Jacobs Aviation Engine Company, Kellett Autogiro Corporation, and Curtiss Flying Service. He was also connected with lighting that helped bring about night flying capabilities for the regular carriage of air mail. Ludington was in charge of the Quartermaster School at the Naval Air Station in San Diego during World War I. He also had different capacities at the Packard Aviation Motor Plant in the early 1920s. In the mid-1920s he served as governor of the National Aeronautic Association and as a director in the Aero Club of Pennsylvania. He was a member of a Department of Commerce Aviation Committee that helped establish relationships between commercial aviation and the government. Ludington was connected in one way or another with Merion Cricket Club, Racquet Club of Washington, Yale University Club, Aero Club of Pennsylvania, Santa Barbara Yacht Club, Bayside Yacht Club, Delaware River Yacht Club, Philadelphia Yacht Club, and Old Lyme Beach Club. He was also a member of the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church.  Works  Ludington wrote \\"Smoke Streams: Visualized Air Flow\\", which was used for several years as a basic textbook on aero-dynamics. The book material was in partnership with his friend, and aircraft engineer, Roger Griswold II. Griswold constructed the \\"Griswold Smoke Tunnel\\" in his garage. It was a two-dimensional-flow tunnel having a large window for visualizing air flow. It was believed to be the largest of its kind in the United States at the time. A diagram, as well as explanation of the tunnel, is included in the book. Experiments were done on assorted models as well as wing profile sections. Ludington made films as well as stills of these experiments with many of the pictures used in his book.

It was unique as it was the first airline that carried passengers only and was not supported by government revenue from airmail service contracts that all other airlines depended on. It was the first successful airline that had flights every hour on the hour as a regularly scheduled service.  History  Charles Townsend Ludington and his brother were wealthy socialites in the 1920s. In 1929 they were contacted by two former executives of Transcontinental Air Transport with an idea to start a short distance airline service and wished the Ludingtons to finance it. In 1930 the four of them started the New York-Philadelphia-Washington Airways company. Its home base was Camden Central Airport, New Jersey, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. It became known as Ludington Airlines, under Ludington Lines Incorporated in 1933, mainly because it did not directly touch New York City, Philadelphia, or Washington D.C. When the company was originally formed in 1930, Amelia Earhart was one of its vice presidents, in charge of traffic management and public relations. Ludington Lines was the first airline that had flights every hour on the hour, a completely new idea for the aviation industry.New York Times, Tues., January 25, 1966, Page 41 \\"Nicholas S. Ludington, 61, Dies; Philadelphian Founded Airline\\" Their brochures advertised \\"Plane Service, like Train Service\\" as their mode of operation. The theory was that the people they catered to, business people that traveled the busiest transportation corridor in the United States of New York‚ÄìPhiladelphia‚ÄìWashington, that were used to railroad time schedules, would then take a plane instead. Ludington Airline was the nearest thing to railroad timetables there was in the way of air passenger service. They sometimes sold their $23 round-trip airline tickets through railway depot terminals (e.g. Pennsylvania Railroad at Manhattan). This overall business plan concept proved to be a correct philosophy, as it was the first airline in the history of aviation that succeeded with this timetable schedule idea. Stinson SM-6000 airliner in flight Ludington Airlines was of interest and watched by the airline industry from its beginnings, as no airline attempted running its business without the revenue earned from air mail. It used seven Stinson tri- motor 6000 model aircraft in its fleet, each carrying up to ten passengers. Its modus operandi consisted of six parts: 1) cheap equipment, 2) timely schedule, 3) short trips, 4) a good general economy, 5) reasonable fares, and 6) aircraft filled on average to at least 60% capacity. In addition, the planes flew with only one pilot, cruised using cheaper automobile gas, and taxied using only one engine instead of all three. The airline in its first year of operation of only passenger service made a profit of over $8,000 without any government revenue subsidies. Ludington Airline in its first year made 8,300 trips and carried 66,000 passengers with an overall average load filled to 66% capacity. In two years time it flew over 3.4 million miles and carried 133,000 passengers. This was a record for any airline at the time. The airline expanded and had subsidiary companies. It provided service between Washington, D.C. and New York City with stops in Philadelphia, Norfolk, Virginia, Nashville and Knoxville, Tennessee. There was a 1931 study done of Ludington Airline's operation by the director of Germany's Luft Hansa and based on that an hourly airline service was put into place between Cologne and Frankfurt, Germany.  Demise  Ludington and his brother invested over $1,000,000 into the company. They never sold any stock to the public and thought they could sustain losses for five years. In 1933 Ludington Lines went bankrupt, partly because they failed to secure a Post Office airmail contract that they bid on for 25 cents per mile. Ludington Lines executive vice president claimed that had they obtained this contract, that their profits would have been triple what they were in their first year of operation. The Post Office airmail contract, controlled by Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown, went to their rival company Eastern Air Transport (EAT) for 89 cents a mile ‚Äì over three times what Ludington bid. Ludington Airline was sold for a quarter of the Ludington's investment to EAT under questionable terms that were influenced by Brown. This inflated airmail contract and takeover of Ludington Airline by EAT started an investigation that became known as the Air Mail scandal.

Doubts arose because of scatter in the data and the small amplitude, but the discovery was confirmed by 1949. Its Algol-type light curve exhibits the O'Connell effect, meaning that there is a magnitude difference between subsequent maxima. The temperature of the secondary star has been estimated at about 10,600 K and its mass at . The spectral type of the secondary star is estimated to be in the B8 to A0 range.

Major themes in her work were Arabs, transition camps, children and women at eye-level. She expressed an egalitarian, socialist view via realism in her painting and drawing.  Biography  Ruth Schloss was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to Ludwig and Dian Schloss, as the second of three daughters of bourgeois assimilationist Jewish family well-integrated into German culture. As the Nazis came into power in 1933, her family immigrated to Israel in 1937, and settled in Kfar Shmaryahu, then an agricultural settlement. Schloss studied at the Department of Schloss graphic design at \\"Bezalel\\" from 1938 to 1942 alongside Friedel Stern and Joseph Hirsch. She was a realistic painter who focused on disadvantaged people in the society and social matters as an egalitarian. Her realism was thus an ‚Äúinevitable realism,‚Äù motivated by an inner necessity: the need to observe reality as it is. Her painting repeatedly addressed the door pulled from its frame, employing drawing's unique ability to stop time and prolong the image's persistence in the retina, she repeatedly committed to paper - in a matter-of- fact, non-evasive manner devoid of mystery ‚Äì man's tendency to generate chaos, suffering and pain. Throughout her life, Schloss remained minimalist. Painting about human fate was the main subject of her artworks. Her natural inclination was to describe the darker aspect of human existence.  1940s  In this period she mainly depicted landscapes of kibbutz and wretched women living hard life, children in huger, older people, refugees. = Life in the Kibbutz = After completing her art studies, Schloss joined a training group at Kibbutz Merhavia in 1942, and after two years moved to Karkur region, the nucleus established Kibbutz Lehavot Habashan in the Upper Galilee. Through this time, she fell in love with the surroundings and drew landscapes. They are simple and direct with fresh, lucid lines. These paintings were selected as the main works of her first exhibition in 1949. In early 1945, Schloss started to draw illustrations in the children's magazine Mishmar Leyeladim, and designed the logo of Al Hamishmar, the paper's new name in 1948. In 1948, upon the founding of Mapam (United Workers‚Äô Party), she designed her party's emblem, which became a well-known icon. She kept working as an illustrator for Mishmar Leyeladim until 1949.Information Center for Israeli Art: Ruth Schloss \\"Mor the Monkey\\" project yielded financial profits and this income was used for a study trip to Paris for two years. She was succeeded as illustrator however, she had inner conflicts of her identity as witnessed painter toward neglected class in Israeli society. = First Exhibition at Mikra-Studio Gallery, 1949 = She presented forty drawings on paper in her first solo exhibition, representing a selection of the themes of kibbutz landscape, its lifestyle. Schloss confidently proposed her direction through simplicity without using colors in her drawings.  1950s  Between 1949 and 1951, she studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris. She began working in oils, with which she continued throughout the 1960s. The exhibition ‚ÄúBack from Paris‚Äù opened in November 1951 at Mikra-Studio Gallery . In 1951 she married Benjamin Cohen, who served as chairman of the national leadership of Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party in Tel Aviv. He was a theoretician and a man of principle, highly esteemed by its leaders who became a professor of history at Tel Aviv University. In 1953, following the Mordechai Oren affair and the publication of Moshe Sneh 's followers from Kibbutz Artzi, she and her husband left the kibbutz and moved to the agricultural farm, Kfar Shmaryahu, where she lived until her death. At a certain point in Israeli history, segments of the socialist movement felt that Israel should become part of the Communist bloc, rather than seek the support of the western world. Because the Schloss couple support of Moshe Sneh's left-wing party, they had to leave the kibbutz. She depicted ordinary women without hiding or making up anything. The poet Natan Zach wrote about her works in 1955: ‚ÄúHer motto remains that which has been all these years: life as it is, without bluffing.\\" Schloss's ‚ÄúPiet√†‚Äù (1953) became a universal cry expressing the pain of mothers on either side of the divide. In the late 1950s, she was the mother of two daughters. When she drew her daughters, unlike the universal babies she depicted, naked and with clenched fists, the painting of her children employed babyish sweetness to the full.She also painted children in the transition camp and Jaffa in the 1950s and 1960s.  1960s-1980s  Schloss painted at a studio in Jaffa from 1962 till 1983. In this time, she turned her interest to people around her more than kibbutz ‚Äì the children, mothers, and poor workers, the alleys and houses. She opened the space to the street and its dwellings, built interactions around it, and was nurtured by the presence of the outside in her work.  1960s  Schloss painted an Arab woman, Nabva, and images of old people. In the late 1960s, she began to paint in acrylic and never went back to oils. In 1965 Schloss devoted a series ‚ÄúArea 9 (1965)‚Äù to the demolition of Arab houses and expropriation of land, carrying a socio-political messages. The series was exhibited at Beit Zvi, Ramat Gan, in 1966. In 1968, Schloss and Gansser-Markus presented ‚ÄúDrawing of War‚Äù in Zurich gallery. She expressed the war as an ultimate expression of destruction and ruin, regardless of victors and vanquished.  1970s  In late 1970s Schloss began printing selected photographs directly on the canvas, reworking them in acrylic. She printed her work at Har-El Printers in Jaffa. This technique was mainly adopted in two large series: Anne Frank (1979-1980) and Borders (1982). Through this technique she placed the figure of elder Frank next to that of the famous young Frank, and released it at the exhibition at Beit Ariela Cultural Center, Tel Aviv, in 1981. The series touched upon the Holocaust.  1980s  She dedicated a large series Borders, one of the most powerful image linked to the series is the figure of Yemenite woman raising her hand. She was the first to raise the Black Panthers demonstration to the level of a social icon.In the 1980s and again in 2000, the Intifada uprisings led Schloss to render representational and symbolic works that could be interpreted as critical of Israel's political and military actions.  1990s ‚Äì 2000s  Schloss exhibited in private galleries and small museums. The main museums, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Israel Museum, included her works only in group exhibitions, and only in 1991 was her retrospective exhibited at the Herzliya Museum. In the 2000s, Schloss turned to the animal kingdom and Bedouins in the south. A huge rhinoceros, birds of prey, and other \\"bad animals,\\" as Cohen Evron, daughter of Ruth, calls them and \\"I connected this to the Nazis,\\" said Schloss. In 2006, a large retrospective exhibition of her work was presented at the Museum of Art in Ein Harod, curated by Tali Tamir.

She is a vengeful ghost-like entity that attacks people in the dark, and can teleport.  Fictional character biography  Diana is a mysterious figure that attacks people only in the dark. It is revealed she was once a teenager committed to a mental hospital, suffering from a serious skin condition that prevented her from being exposed to any light. She befriends teenaged Sophie, who is hospitalized for depression. They take a picture together outside where she is covered in shadow by an umbrella. Doctors began performing experiments on Diana, but inadvertently killed her by exposing her to intense surgical-suite spotlights, instantly reducing her body to ashes. Diana then turns into a demonic, malevolent creature that can act only in the darkness. The creature latches onto Sophie, and kills anyone who tries to help or be with her. She interferes with Sophie's intentions of trying to get better, and frightens Sophie's young daughter Rebecca by taking her drawing of her family and inserting herself into it as a stick figure while rubbing out her father. Rebecca‚Äôs father is killed by her, though his family assume he abandoned them and Rebecca moves out as soon as she is old enough. Some years later, Diana appears at Sophie's second husband Paul's work place and kills him. She then haunts Sophie and Paul‚Äôs child, Martin, to the point that he is unable to get sleep anymore. When Martin is staying at Rebecca's, Diana goes there and haunts them, scratching onto the floor the same name and stick figure she added to Rebecca's childhood drawing. Diana continues to influence Sophie, who suggests a stay-in movie night with Martin, including Diana as \\"the three of us\\", in an attempt to proactively introduce her son to her demon friend. When Sophie tries to take her pills, Diana knocks them aside. Diana tries to pull Martin under the bed, but Rebecca stops her. She locks Rebecca and Martin in the basement, and attacks Rebecca's boyfriend Bret, who is able to flee by activating his car headlights. She ignores Sophie's pleas to not hurt her kids, and continues to attack in the dark, killing two police officers. She reveals to Rebecca her killing of her father years before. However, as Diana is about to kill Rebecca, Sophie arrives and states that Diana only exists because Sophie has allowed her to exist. Sophie then shoots herself in the head, and Diana disappears.  Development   Conception  Sandberg said that his goal was to keep Diana's appearance in the film as a silhouette. When asked about how challenging it was to keep Diana in the dark he said \\"Very challenging because I didn‚Äôt want to cheat. I had to storyboard all of it just to make sure that she was truly a silhouette. At first I was working with a storyboard artist. He would draw her with a rim light on her and I was like, ‚ÄúNo, we can‚Äôt shoot it like that because that‚Äôs cheating.‚Äù So I had to do my own storyboards and really figure out how we could always keep her as a true silhouette. When she grabs Bret, I had to think about, ‚ÄúIf he uses his flashlight like this to bang on the handle, if she grabs him when he‚Äôs up here, then the flashlight is pointed backwards creating a silhouette so that she can actually grab him.‚Äù It was really hard to figure out exactly how to get her on film.\\" Diana was originally supposed to be more of a demonic presence but James Wan suggested that she have a human background so she could have a relationship to Sophie and add to the connection to the family.  Casting  In an interview, when asked about the casting of Diana, David said \\"...I figured she would be pretty still but once I met Alicia, we met Alicia just to have her as a stunt person for whoever would play Diana. But when I met Alicia and she showed me what she could do, because she‚Äôs a dancer and she has full control over her body, it was like, 'Oh, this is really awesome. So let‚Äôs have Alicia play Diana the whole time and we can really turn her into this ferocious, animalistic creature almost.'‚Äù  References   External links  * Film characters introduced in 2013 Female horror film villains Fictional ghosts Fictional mass murderers Fictional half-demons Fictional characters with disfigurements Fictional monsters ","title":"Diana Walter"},{"id":"51218156","text":"Margaret Mary Sheil is an Australian academic and the Vice Chancellor and President of Queensland University of Technology.

Born in a poor peasant family, Gorbachyov joined the Red Army after the end of the Russian Civil War. He became an officer in the NKVD Border Troops and commanded a border detachment in 1941. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Gorbachyov became the commander of the newly formed 250th Rifle Division, which included many personnel of the Border Troops. Gorbachyov led the division during the Battle of Smolensk and died of wounds received in a counterattack.  Early life  Gorbachyov was born in Strechanovo, Tyuninsky volost, Roslavlsky Uyezd, Smolensk Governorate, to an impoverished peasant family. He worked as a farm labourer. His family moved to Kamensk in Ukraine after the 1905 Revolution for economic reasons and Gorbachyov graduated from a gymnasium school there. His father became a factory worker in Kamensk, joining the Bolsheviks and participating in the Russian Revolution. Gorbachyov worked as a teacher in rural schools in the villages of Shepetovo and Kharinovo in Oryol Governorate from January 1921, and in October 1922 became a clerk in the military department of the Tyunininsky volost executive committee.  Interwar  Gorbachyov joined the Red Army on 30 December 1923, becoming a Red Army man and serving as a squad leader in the 80th Rifle Regiment of the 27th Rifle Division. He was sent to study at the 26th Ivanovo-Voznesensk Infantry School in September 1924, where he was starshina of his company. Upon graduation two years later, Gorbachyov was appointed assistant chief of a border outpost of the 37th Batumi Border Detachment of the OGPU Border Troops. From March 1927 he served with the 41st Nakhchivan Border Detachment as an assistant commissioner, then as assistant commandant for secret operations units in February 1931, and in February 1932 became commander of a border sector. During this period, Gorbachyov participated in the suppression of anti-Soviet bandits in Shakhtakhty and Karabaglyar raions of Nakhichevan between January and March 1930. In June 1934, Gorbachyov became a student at the Frunze Military Academy, from which he graduated in September 1937. In October 1937, he became chief of staff of the 2nd Railroad Brigade NKVD in the Transbaikal Military District at Chita, serving as acting commander of the brigade between 1 January and 21 July 1938. Receiving a promotion to major on 27 September of that year, he became commander of the 54th Border Detachment in Nerchinskozavodsk on 20 October 1938. On 14 February 1941, Gorbachyov was awarded the Order of the Red Star on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Border Troops. The commander of NKVD forces in the Transbaikal district assessed him as a \\"mature and serious commander\\" who was firm, decisive, and disciplined.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, several new rifle divisions were formed under the command of officers from the NKVD Border Troops. Gorbachyov was among those officers and on 27 June was appointed commander of the 250th Rifle Division, which began formation in Vladimir soon after. The officers were drawn from the NKVD Border Troops, while the enlisted men were called-up reservists. The 250th was relocated to the Rzhev area on 15 July, the same day that Gorbachyov was promoted to major general. From there the division marched through Olenino to positions south of Belyi. The division was assigned to the 30th Army and entered the Battle of Smolensk on 22 July, counterattacking towards Dukhovshchina to stop the German advance. Two days later, Gorbachyov and the division commissar visited elements of the 250th at Demyakhi. As Gorbachyov left the staff car that they arrived in at the entrance to the village and went to personally inspect the defenses, he was mortally wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery shell. Gorbachyov died of his wounds in a field hospital on the next day, and was buried in Olenino.  Personal life  Gorbachyov married and had a daughter, Galina, and two sons, Pyotr and Vladimir.

He is known for his work in satellite navigation and precise orbit determination. He worked on various missions while at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as navigation support for the Apollo program in the late 1960s while at Johnson Space Center.  Early life and education  George Born was born on November 10, 1939 in a farm house in Westhoff, Texas. Son of Henry Born and Lydia Olga, he was the eighth of nine children. After age four, he was raised on various farms in Jackson County, Texas. In 1957, Born graduated as valedictorian of his class from Industrial High School in Vanderbilt, Texas. His freshman year of college, he attended Texas Lutheran College in Seguin. He then transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, where he completed his bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering in 1962. After working for Ling-Temco-Vought Corporation in Dallas, he returned to University of Texas where he completed his doctorate in aerospace engineering in 1968 under the guidance of professor Byron Tapley, with whom he would later write a book on satellite navigation and orbit determination.  NASA career  After completing his doctorate, Born spent two years as an aerospace technologist at the Manned Spacecraft Center at Johnson Space Center in Houston working on the Apollo program designing lunar orbits and providing navigation support. In 1970, he left JSC to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. At JPL he worked on the Mariner 9 project as part of the Celestial Mechanics Team and contributed to the gravity field estimation of Mars and overall navigation efforts of the first spacecraft to ever orbit another planet. He was also part of the Viking program which landed two spacecraft on the surface of Mars and presented interesting navigational challenges. While working on both Mariner 9 and Viking, Born was part of the optical navigation teams led by Tom Duxbury at JPL. He was the Technical Group Supervisor of the orbit determination group for the Viking Mars orbiters where the team used images of Phobos and Deimos for approach navigation in an operational setting. This was a first in interplanetary navigation. During these missions, the Viking 1 orbiter flew within 80 km of the surface of Phobos and the team was able to determine its mass and density, while the Viking 2 orbiter flew by Deimos within 26 km on October 17, 1977. The results of the Phobos Experiment Team, led by Robert Tolson of the Langley Research Center, were published in Science, 6 January 1978, vol 199. Born also worked on orbit determination for Seasat where he served as Geophysical Evaluation Manager for the project. He was in charge of the efforts to demonstrate that the instrument package containing a radar altimeter, windfield scatterometer, synthetic aperture radar, scanning multichannel microwave radiometer, and a visual and infrared radiometer, met all specification for measuring geophysical parameters over the ocean. These included sea surface topography, sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, and ocean surface imaging. This spacecraft flew the first suite of ocean-observing microwave sensors and required orbit determination solution uncertainties below 1 meter in satellite position. The spacecraft failed three months after launch but had returned a huge amount of data on global ocean winds, waves, currents and surface temperature. During this time, he also served as supervisor of the Precision Orbit Determination Group which was responsible for navigating Earth and interplanetary missions. Born was instrumental in the design and implementation of the TOPEX/Poseidon oceanographic mission. This joint project between NASA and the French space agency CNES required the most precise orbit determination solutions to date and provided centimeter-level uncertainty in sea level measurements. TOPEX/Poseidon changed our understanding of the oceans and graphically depicted El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a as well as giving us data which allowed mapping of the global currents and circulation patterns for the first time. Walter Munk, one of the world‚Äôs foremost oceanographers, would call this mission ‚Äúthe most successful ocean experiment of all time.‚Äùhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/oceancommission/meetings/apr18_19_02/munk_statement.pdf Born would also be involved in the development of the Jason-1 and Jason-2 spacecraft, the successors to TOPEX/Poseidon. During this time, Born was bestowed with several NASA awards and medals for his technical and managerial contributions. He left JPL in 1983 to focus on academic research.  Academic career and research  In 1983, Born returned to the University of Texas at Austin as a senior research scientist at the Center for Space Research where he was engaged in teaching and research. In 1985, he accepted a position as professor of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. While at University of Colorado, he founded the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR), the first research center established in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Its research program emphasizes astrodynamics, space mission design and satellite navigation, GPS technology development and applications, meteorology, oceanography, geodesy, and terrestrial vegetation studies with in situ and remote sensing data. CCAR became internationally known for its contributions to spacecraft guidance, control, navigation, as well as remote sensing of the oceans and atmosphere with radar and lidar. He served as director of the research center for 28 years. He taught graduate courses in statistical orbit determination, orbital mechanics, and interplanetary mission design. During his academic career he would form close and lasting relationships with many of his graduate students. Throughout these years of academic service, he served as Ph.D. advisor to over 40 students. Born had continued working on the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in August 1992 and continued monitoring the Earth‚Äôs oceans for thirteen years. Many of his graduate students‚Äô dissertations were based on analysis of data from this mission. Born continued working within the aerospace industry as a consultant for institutions and companies, including JPL, Naval Research Laboratory, General Electric, Kaman Sciences Corporation, Langley Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University and Ball Aerospace. In 2015, Born was named Distinguished Professor at the University of Colorado. He continued working until a few days before his death.  Published work  Born authored well over a hundred peer- reviewed papers as well as a textbook on statistical orbit determination. He served as guest editor for numerous special journal issues devoted to scientific and engineering results from the many missions he worked on, including TOPEX/Poseidon, Seasat and Jason-1. Additionally, Born was associate editor of the Journal of Marine Geodesy and astrodynamics editor of the Journal of the Astronautical Sciences. Some of Born's work include: * Schutz, Bob, Byron Tapley, and George H. Born. Statistical orbit determination. Academic Press, 2004. * Jones, Brandon A. and George H. Born.

Papers presented at symposium honoring Byron Tapley, Austin, TX, Feb 1, 2008.  Personal life  In July 1963, Born married Joy Evelyn Judd. They had one son and divorced in 1991. On March 21, 1992, he married Carol Ann Leslie. He was always grateful to Carol for her support and encouragement for all of his graduate students. Born was an avid skier, one of his favorite things about living in Colorado. He was also a big fan of the CU Buffs and had season tickets for the CU football team since 1985. In 2008, Born was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare and non-reversible lung disease . He died in Boulder, Colorado on January 21, 2016 from decaying lung conditions and congestive heart failure. He was 76. Named in his honor, the George H.

Life of people in Bharmour centers around the temple complex- Chaurasi, named so because of 84 shrines built in the periphery of Chaurasi Temple. Chaurasi is the Hindi word for number eighty four. The beautiful valabhi-Shikhara style architecture of Manimahesh occupies the center of the complex. Chaurasi Temple Complex was built approximately in 7th century, although repairs of many temples have been carried out in later period. There are 84 big and small temples in Chaurasi temple complex. Chaurasi is a spacious level ground in center of Bharmour where the galaxy of temples mostly in the form of 84 Shivlingas exists. The Chaurasi Temple Complex offers a delightful, clean and a scenic view. Another temple built in the same style is that of Lord Vishnu cast in his Narsimha avatar. The Chaurasi temple was built by Raja Sahil Verman of Bharmour, in honor of the 84 Siddhas or yogis who had come from Kurukshetra and had meditated there, while they were passing Bharmour on their way to Manimahesh Lake. They blessed the King with ten sons and a daughter, Champavati, as he had no heir. It is said that the pilgrimage to Manimahesh Lake is incomplete without paying obeisance in these temples due to the Dharmeshvar Mahadev (Dharamraj) Temple as one of the most revered by Hindus, and bathing in the Bharmani Mata temple pool of Goddess Brahmani, 4 km from Bharmour, Himachal Pradesh.

At the age of 12 she started volunteering at ILAN, an Israeli NGO for children with physical disabilities. During her volunteering she became a personal tutor of the late Kobi Kfir ‚Äì a three-year-old child with cerebral palsy. Through this acquaintance and friendship with Kfir she was exposed to the world of special education.  Krembo Wings  In 2002, at the age of 16 she joined the \\"Lead\\" (leadership development program) and inspired by the relationship with Kfir she decided to establish a youth movement in Israel ‚Äì K‚Äônafaim Shel Krembo (Krembo Wings). This is Israel's first and only movement for youth both with and without special needs, where they can work together. These children meet weekly at 66 branches with more than 5,700 children and youths nationwide. Altschuler presided as CEO and chairman until 2009 and later as president until her retirement in 2014. The movement has won numerous awards over the years, including the \\"Presidential award\\" by Shimon Peres in 2009 and the \\"Yigal Alon\\" award in 2010 and was also elected to light an honorary torch in Israel's 60th anniversary at Mount Herzl.  Zikaron Basalon  Altschuler founded Zikaron Basalon ‚Äì (Memories@Home) project in 2010. This initiative enables private individuals an alternative way of commemorating the Holocaust memorial day through independent meetings to the community in their own living room. In this intimate gatherings the participants are hosting Holocaust survivor's and listening to his/her stories then reconnecting to the memory of the Holocaust and examine themselves in society today through meaningful open conversations. In 2018 more than 750,000 people participated in Zikaron Basalon events in more than 150 cities in Israel and 50 countries abroad. The project also enabled the memory of the Holocaust accessible to sectors that were traditionally excluded from participating, such as inmates, women in prostitution, youths at risk, the mentally disabled, hearing impaired and refugees' community.

His areas of research include vulnerabilities in computer systems, bug bounties, the security of e-payment payment services and privacy protection. Mejri is known for uncovering new zero-day vulnerabilities and making them transparent to the public.  Life  Kunz Mejri grew up in the city of Kassel in Hessen. From 2003 to 2005 he was at the Fachoberschule Kassel in the field of business informatics. In 2005, at the Cebit in Hannover, he published for the first time a report about a Secure Sockets Layer zero-day vulnerability in the Mozilla Firefox Browser Engine with the company F-Secure. Mejri has been head of research at the Vulnerability Lab since 2008 and became managing director of Evolution Security GmbH in Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he in 2014.  Research   Evolution Security  Kunz Mejri started Evolution Security in 2010 with the developer Pim Campers from the Netherlands. The company is known for manual security checks and the detection of back doors in operating systems, hardware or software. In 2014, the company changed its legal form and officially became a limited liability company with its registered office in the Technology Centre in Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he.  Vulnerability Laboratory  In 2005 Kunz Mejri opened the first laboratory as a portal for researchers to record bug bounty vulnerabilities.[1] The public vulnerability laboratory has over 1,000 active researchers from around the world and lists over 2,000 specially reported vulnerabilities with technical details. In addition, the laboratory has documents, videos and analyses from the field of IT security relating to security vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Laboratory is the first internationally registered vulnerability portal for independent IT security researchers.  Securityanalysis of Skype (VoIP)  In 2011 Kunz Mejri published one of the first reports on vulnerabilities in Skype-software and architecture at the Hack in the Box conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The release took place in cooperation with Skype. In the presentation, Kunz Mejri explained his own found vulnerabilities to other researchers.  Airport- Security M√ºnchen, K√∂ln/Bonn & D√ºsseldorf  In 2012, Kunz Mejri reported several critical security gaps in the infrastructure of German airports. The vulnerabilities allowed the SQL database entries of the airports D√ºsseldorf, Cologne/Bonn and Munich to be read out. This also affected related airlines such as Lufthansa and Air Berlin. After the publication of two security vulnerabilities in the airport service pages, the digital security architecture of the affected companies changed permanently.Dusseldorf airport closes security holes  Microsoft- & Skype-Account-System  In 2012, Kunz Mejri released four critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft via Skype that allowed access to any Hotmail - Live - Xbox - Skype account without permission. His analysis with security article flowed into the production of the new account systems and improved the infrastructure of Microsoft's logins sustainably.Skype Zero-Day Vulnerability Allowed Hackers to Change the Password of Any AccountHotmail Hacking for 20 US dollars In February 2013, Mejri reported a critical vulnerability in the validation of Microsoft's official Sharepoint Cloud Web-application. At the beginning of September 2013, Symantec Security Company and SANS Institute investigated the newly detected vulnerability in Sharepoint.CVE ID 2013 -3179 Microsoft In the same year, Mejri submitted 16 confirmed vulnerabilities in Office 365 cloud software to the Microsoft Security Response Center. By the end of 2013, all reported vulnerabilities were closed by Microsoft's development and security department. At the end of July 2017, Mejri in cooperation with the Microsoft Security Response Center released a critical vulnerability in Skype. A buffer overflow during the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) clipboard transmission allowed the vulnerability to be exploited remotely by attackers. Skype Windows software versions 7.2,7.35 & 7.36 were affected.http://www.zdnet.com/article/zero-day-skype-flaw-causes-crashes- remote-code-execution/  Barracuda-Networks-Infrastructure  In 2013, Kunz Mejri also published more than 40 vulnerabilities in the Barracuda Networks firewall and other products.Security Bulletin - BNSEC-00703 Message Archiver Vulnerability. All security gaps were reliably closed by the manufacturer during the course of the year. The submitted documents were processed by the company's development team and Dave Farrow for future processes. From 2013 to 2014, Kunz Mejri thus had a lasting impact on the security of the Barracuda Network product series.  Apple iOS Passcode  In 2014, Kunz Mejri released for the first time a new vulnerability in iOS V6 that allowed to bypass the passcode security feature. The vulnerability was found in the emergency call feature and allowed access to the device without entering a pin. Shortly thereafter, in the same year, Mejri developed an exploit that put V6.x iOS devices into a so-called \\"black screen mode\\", allowing access to the internal memory. After the vulnerability was released, the number of emergency calls increased by 17% due to the abusive exploitation of the vulnerability in the international arena. The vulnerability was closed by Apple one month after the release.http://news.softpedia.com/news/Experts-Identify-Two- iOS-6-1-Password-Lock-Bypass-Vulnerabilities-Video-330189.shtml In 2015, Mejri then presented in a public video how to bypass the latest Sim-Lock of an iOS-V7.x device to use it without permission. Approximately 14 days after the release of the vulnerability, the Apple Product Security Team also fixed it with a new release. https://www.grahamcluley.com/bypass-passcode-lock-screen- ios-8-9/ In March 2016, Mejri released another vulnerability in Apple's Siri. Siri allowed to overcome the device lock without permission, without passcode or fingerprint. On the same day, Apple released a hotfix that redirected Siri's API calls to temporarily close the security issue. From August to September 2016, Mejri reported and released 4 different vulnerabilities in the area of rights extension for iPads & iPhones with iOS V9.x. -and-later / 116624 / passcode bypass bugs Trouble iOS 9.1 and later In November 2016, Mejri released several critical vulnerabilities in iOS V10.1.1. The first vulnerability reported in November 2016 was the ability to send messages from blocked iPad/iPhone devices. Due to an error in connection with the voice-over function, local attackers were able to permanently bypass the passcode security function in order to access sensitive device data. The second vulnerability, released in December 2016, allowed attackers to bypass the anti-theft feature on iOS devices. The vulnerability could be exploited by a locally caused buffer overflow in conjunction with an application crash. https://www.computerworld.com/article/3041302/security/4-new-ways-to-bypass- passcode-lock-screen-on-iphones-ipads-running-ios-9.html https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/12/02/new-ios-lockscreen-bypass-renders- activation-lock-useless/  NASA-Mission Orion  On December 4,2014, Kunz Mejri published a vulnerability in the boarding passport application of the Orion - mission of the American space agency NASA. The vulnerability was reported to the US Department of Defense CERT team on November 25,2014. The boarding pass information of the application was later written with electron beam lithography on a silicone microchip prototype, which was launched aboard the space shuttle on December 4. One of the researcher's test exploit payloads was not deleted by NASA and transferred to the isolated microchip. After the launch of the rocket, Mejris Exploit Payload spent four hours and 24 minutes in two elliptical orbits around the Earth with an apogee (high point) of 5800 kilometres. NASA's investigation with an eleven-man team confirmed that one of the payloads stored in the boarding pass was accidentally written on the silicone microchip. But since the microchip was isolated, there was no danger for the technology or the spacecraft itself. NASA provided Mejri with a specially prepared image for a few days, with a joke entry of Mejri in the NASA No Fly list.  PayPal Inc & J.P. Morgan  From 2011 to 2016 Kunz Mejri was working on improving security in PayPal, J.P. Morgan and eBay Inc. from 2011 to 2016. By 2016, Kunz Mejri has published over 120 vulnerabilities in the PayPal web infrastructure. He was the first German to successfully participate in the official Bug Bounty Program of PayPal. In 2013, the security researcher reported several SQL injection vulnerabilities in PayPal's BillSafe service provider. In 2014, Kunz Mejri found a vulnerability in the mobile API from the PayPal iOS app that allowed him to access any PayPal account.Flaw in PayPal Authentication Process Allows Access to Blocked Accounts  Wincor Nixdorf ‚Äì Sparkassen Bank ATM & SB Terminals  In 2015, Kunz Mejri published a security vulnerability as a reportage in self-service terminals and ATMs of Wincor Nixdorf. The ATMs were used by the Sparkasse throughout Germany. With the help of a key combination, Mejri was able to make an update console of the administrator visible, which gave insight into sensitive data. Wincor Nixdorf has permanently remedied the vulnerability. The security update was introduced and tested by the Sparkasse as a pilot program in Hesse. After the first audit, the security update was introduced throughout Germany to prevent attacks against the ATMs in question.Savings, Security, and ATM: The hacker with the current map - Handelsblatt.comCommand line access: Vulnerability in ATMs of the Sparkasse Bank  BMW ConnectedDrive  In January 2016, Kunz Mejri published two vulnerabilities in the BMW ConnectedDrive applications for mobile phones. Apps for Apple's iOS and Google's Android were affected. The first vulnerability allows the browser to read cookie information when logging in and resetting user passwords. The vulnerability allowed to bypass the login function by manipulating the \`Token\` parameter. The second reported vulnerability was classified as critical by BMW and allowed attackers unauthorized access to the info-tainment system of affected BMW vehicles. http://www.securityweek.com/zero-day-flaw-affects-bmws- connecteddrive-web-portal The vulnerability could be exploited by a faulty security check of the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) in the service portal. In September, both vulnerabilities were remedied by the BMW security department as part of a security audit.  Wickr Inc  In January 2017, for the first time in the official Bug Bounty programme, the company Wickr (Embedded Immediate Intelligence Service) awarded Kunz Mejri a higher prize for research in the field of IT security. As Wickr Inc. was unable to answer his initial research findings with vulnerabilities from 2014, some of the information he provided was published in 2016. Wickr Inc Vice President of Engineering Christopher Howell responded with an internal audit. Following the audit, Howell rewarded the security researcher for identifying and documenting vulnerabilities. From 2014 to 2016, Kunz Mejri's research results influenced the internal development processes of the Wickr Inc software application.  Travia  In 2014, a large part of Kunz Mejri's history as a computer hacker of the German scene was published in a Hollywood film titled Who Am I ‚Äì Kein System ist sicher. The main character \\"Benjamin\\" was played by Tom Schilling, known in Germany as an actor. In 2015, the film won six awards, including the International Film Award as \\"Best International Film\\" and the Bambi Award. The film Who Am I was taken over by Sony Entertainment (Warner Studios) in mid 2015 with all rights and will be released again internationally in a US remake in 2016. The film was released as exam component for the 10th grade of the Goetheschule for final work. https://www.goethe.de/resources/files/pdf131/whoami- didaktisierungb1b2goetheinstitutfrankreich.pdf In May 2017, Kunz Mejri was invited by the German Armed Forces Command Cyber & Information Space (CIR) to the official 3rd Cyber Awareness Event at the Training Centre of the German Armed Forces in Mannheim as key speaker. In September 2017 Kunz Mejri followed with the first German presentation as key speaker on vulnerability research, system security, security development and bug bounty programs at the Internet Security Conference in Beijing China. His presentation was broadcast locally in China and internationally by WorldNewsToday on TV. In September 2018, Kunz Mejri was interviewed by the ZDF Tageschau on TV on the subject of \\"Hospitals in the sights of hackers\\" as part of a public Internet podcast broadcast by Hessischer Rundfunk (HR).https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/kliniken- hacker-101.html In June 2019, ZDF (Planet E & ZDF Wiso) and 3Sat publicly broadcast a documentary with Kunz Mejri on the topics \\"Blackout - Attack on our electricity grid\\" and \\"Cyber attack on the electricity grid\\" on TV. https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/planet-e/planet-e-blackout---angriff-auf- unser-stromnetz-100.html https://www.3sat.de/gesellschaft/makro/wirtschaftsdokumentation-cyberangriff- aufs-stromnetz-100.html  External links  * Cross Site Scripting ‚Äì Dokumentation, Analyse & Techniken (PDF-Datei) * Computerviren ‚Äì Arten, Verfahren, Technik & Geschichte (PDF-Datei) * Mobile Application Security ‚Äì Main Issues & Vulnerabilities (PDF-Datei)  References  Computer scientists Living people 1983 births ","title":"Benjamin Kunz Mejri"},{"id":"51218355","text":"Liana bridge of Poubara, south of Franceville (Gabon) A liana bridge is a suspended bridge made of liana vines.

Accession to the throne Kissi Kaba Keita was the son of Suleimani Leno, son of Fadaka. He adopted a Mandinka name to prove his legitimacy to the throne as a supposed relative of Sundiata Keita. Intrigues around the throne brought Kissi Kaba in direct conflict with his cousin Asana Leno, son of S√©p√© of Korodou. His success led to his coronation with the support of his adoptive father Soulemani Savan√©. Hence, he extended his control to the border with Soulemani Savan√©. During his reign, he rallied the Kurankos of Morige, and the Leles of Yombiro. When pressed into battle, he would assemble an army led by divisions according to their origin: The Kurankos under Kourani-Sori Mara, the warriors from the Faramayan, his place of origin, under himself and divisions from Buye and Nbelto. His general was Dawo Leno, and under him were Masa, Uri Mano from Bendu and Bampo Tenkiano from Nende Lane. With this army, he had mainly attempted to conquer Bendu, Fermesadou and Tenkin. Resistance to French conquest When the French arrived in 1892, he had to let the relatively autonomous chiefs of the respective areas defend themselves. Due to the French's technological superiority, Kissi Kaba resorted mainly to guerilla tactics: His warriors would wait for French troops while hidden close to rivers or in forests and would attack the French by surprise with the main goal of kidnapping or killing the French officers. Furthermore, they would cut down all liana bridges to slow down the French advance. However, by 1893, Kissi Kaba realized that his resistance would fail and subjected himself to them. As such, they recognized him as chief of the northern Kissi territory. However, he his relationship with the French gradually worsened, which first led to the French appointing his rivals in a number of his chiefdoms, until he was finally executed in Siguiri. Return of his ashes to Kissidougou In 1978, the ashes of Kissi Kaba were finally brought back to Kissidougou from Siguiri where had been shot by the French colonial power. While known as a kissi (son of Suleimani Leno, son of Fadaka), Kissi Kaba had claimed kinship to Sundiata Keita, the emperor of Mali.Idrissa Camara, guineeconakry.info, 25.01.2006 During the ceremony of his ashes' return, this relationship was retold by some griots: According to those reports, Kissi Kaba was descended from Mansa Dankaran Touman, the first son of faama Nar√© Maghann Konat√©. Dankaran Touman was the older brother of Sundiata Keita.

Subject coverage includes police and policing, crime and crime prevention, criminology, criminal justice, forensic science, leadership, general management, training, educational theory, social science and psychology. History The library was established as part of the National Police College in Ryton-on-Dunsmore in June 1948, originally created to serve senior ranks. This followed the recommendation in the Dixon Report (1930): \\"the object of which should be to develop so far as possible each officer‚Äôs capacity for individual application to the problems of his profession and his fitness for higher responsibility.\\" In 1945, The Police Journal: A Review for the Police Forces of the Empire also suggested the need for a National Police Library. The library was renamed Police Staff College Library and relocated to the Police Staff College, Bramshill in 1960. The library was situated in the Long Gallery on the first floor of Bramshill House. In 1998, the library was renamed National Police Library to reflect the change in outlook; widening access to services to police officers and police staff across all forces across the UK. The library later become part of the National Policing Improvement Agency and in 2013, it transferred to the newly established College of Policing. Following the sale of the Bramshill House in 2014, the National Police Library temporarily relocated to the College's Sunningdale Park site in March 2015.

She specialised in the treatment of tuberculosis with Professor M√©nard and under the direction of Professor Guinon in childhood medicine. In 1916 she defended her thesis, Chronic cervical lymphadenopathies in children with hereditary syphilis. In 1919, she completed the medical exams at the Hospitals of Nantes, thus becoming the first female in France and could thereby do research in better scientific conditions, influence decisions and have students. (BnF: 353206072) In the 1920s, she participated in the first World Congress of Women Phthisiologists in New York. She was then appointed to serve tuberculosis sufferers, did an internship in Paris with √âdouard Rist, who introduced the therapeutic pneumothorax technique, a technique that would be used in the treatment of tuberculosis until the 1950s. She introduced this procedure to , now the central University Hospital in the city. As such, she participated in tuberculosis control in the department. Her medical publications led to her being named in 1924, the corresponding member of the , and she chaired the Nantes Central Office of Social Hygiene just as she organised the anti-tuberculosis dispensary of La Baule.Jean Lebrec, Joseph Mal√®gue, romancier et penseur, p. 100-101. Meeting Joseph Mal√®gue As a member of the Catholic circle of academics from Nantes, she met the writer Joseph Mal√®gue whom she married on 28 August 1923 at the church of Notre-Dame de Bon-Port. The couple moved into 15 Rue Ars√®ne-Leloup. Jean Lebrec considers Pouzin as the midwife of the first novel of Mal√®gue, '. Mal√®gue's biographer has collected several testimonies from friends of the couple and also cites the essay of Dr. Delaunay Joseph Mal√®gue, from Yvonne Mal√®gue, Estuaires, Bordeaux, 1947 (not paginated). According to Dr. Delaunay, Yvonne Pouzin recognised in Mal√®gue \\"exceptional value\\" but perhaps also \\"weakness\\", had assumed and issued her husband \\"of an inert part of himself.\\" Delaunay ends on a question about the first novel by Mal√®gue, Augustin ou le Ma√Ætre est l√†: \\"Had he put this volume Augustin so demanding of his players, without another will, strong love and faith, might come to support his, remove obstacles, overcoming doubts, negotiate the project execution stage?

(pronounced RAUH) is a privately held greenhouse manufacturing and restoration company based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded in 1932, Rough Brothers designs, manufactures, and installs greenhouse structures and systems for commercial purposes, research and teaching, retail garden centers, and conservatories. Rough Brothers was acquired by Gibraltar Industries, a manufactured goods corporation, in June 2015 and has two sister companies, RBI Solar and RBI Structures. The company currently has facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio, Temecula, California, Washington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China. Company history 1932-1949 Rough Brothers was founded by two brothers, Earl M. Rough and Robert T. Rough, from Indiana in 1932. From the creation of their company until the onset of World War II the brothers repaired and maintained greenhouses in the Indianapolis, IN area. In 1946, the Roughs decided to form a company that would provide additional greenhouse services for commercial growers, including turn-key construction and a full line of building materials and equipment. With this expansion of services, brothers Worth Rough and George Rough were brought into the team, along with family friend Carl Trinkle. Their first commercial greenhouse projects were developed in the Midwest and later throughout the United States. 1950-1980 In the 1950s, Worth Rough left the company to operate his own greenhouse business in California, and George Rough left to become a farmer. Robert Rough died in 1969. Earl Rough, one of the original founders, retired from presidency in 1970 but continued to advise the company's management. His son Cliff became the sales manager. Carl Trinkle remained as the supervisor of Rough Brothers installation crews and took an active role in sales. When the original Rough Brothers was purchased in 1977, the company had set its focus on the commercial grower market: growers of bedding plants, cut flowers, and vegetables for sale to homeowners or independent garden centers. Under the new leadership of president Albert (Al) Reilly and vice president Bruce H. Rowe, Rough Brothers redirected its focus to conservatories, research facilities, and the restoration of existing greenhouse structures. With these changes, the company expanded its production space and increased its team of in-house designers and engineers. 1981-2000 In 1988, Rough Brothers acquired Lord & Burnham, a noted American boiler and greenhouse manufacturer who until that point had constructed 90% of conservatories in the US. This acquisition included their drawings, conservatory details, and equipment. Three years later, Rough Brothers vice president Bruce Rowe left the company, and president Al Reilly bought Rowe's share in the business. With the boom of large national retailers in the greenhouse industry in the 1990s, Rough Brothers decided to create specialized teams to address the specific needs of each market segment, including institutional (research and education markets), conservatory (conservatory construction and restoration), commercial (growers and independent retailers), and mass retail (garden centers). Growth within the mass retail sector allowed Rough Brothers to expand their manufacturing shop, including a specialized steel fabrication shop, a fabric shop for signage, and larger shipping and staging areas. Expansions to their Cincinnati, Ohio corporate office facilitated the creation of a specialized mass retail team focused specifically on Home Depot, Lowes, and other retailers. This team of project managers, construction managers, designers, and engineers handles the project bidding, construction, maintenance, and warranties. In 1995, Rough Brothers was named the Greater Cincinnati Small Business of the Year. 2002-present Richard Reilly, Al Reilly's son, became president of Rough Brothers in 2002. Two other greenhouse companies, XS Smith, Inc. and Golden Pacific Structures, were acquired by Rough brothers in 2013, again increasing the resources available to the company. As part of this acquisition, Rough Brothers utilizes the XS Smith production facility in North Carolina as another manufacturing facility. In 2015, Rough Brothers was acquired by Gibraltar Industries, a manufactured goods corporation based in Hamburg, New York. Greenhouse Construction The first Rough Brothers greenhouses were constructed with wood frames. As greenhouse and manufacturing technology advanced, the company began building with steel and aluminum, and became an early adopter of polyethylene and fiberglass insulating materials. After World War II, Rough Brothers also began manufacturing products to their own design and specifications. They sold the portable Steam-Flo Soil Sterilizer and utilized heat-conserving devices like air-inflated double wall plastic and fiberglass paneling. Rough Brothers also adopted and refined a poly arch system of greenhouse construction. The company's Snap-Lock insert for poly insulating systems has been tested and recommended by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Today, Rough Brothers has four divisions: institutional (research and education markets), conservatory (conservatory construction and restoration), commercial (growers and independent retailers), and mass retail (garden centers). Major Projects US Botanic Garden The US Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C., a 100-year- old greenhouse located on the grounds of the United States Capital Building closed in 1997 for renovation. In 1999, Rough Brothers became a subcontractor on the $30 million restoration. Under its $7.75 million contract, Rough Brothers replaced nearly 2 acres of aluminum glazing on the conservatory and replaced hundreds of thousands of glass panes with laminated shatterproof glass. Cincinnati Zoo Conservatory Rough Brothers constructed the Harold C. Schott Education Center conservatory at the Cincinnati Zoo. The 31,000 square foot facility accommodates the Cincinnati Zoo's educational programming and includes a 350-seat auditorium, ten classrooms, a distance learning studio, and a 5,000 square foot ‚ÄúDiscovery Forest‚Äù greenhouse of plants and animals. Roger Williams Park Botanical Center The Roger Williams Park Botanical Center opened to the public on March 2, 2007. The botanical center includes a nearly 6,000 square foot conservatory housing plant displays, another 6,000 square feet of greenhouse garden space, and education center. Lauritzen Gardens Conservatory The Lauritzen Gardens Conservatory in Omaha, Nebraska was a $31.5 million project covering 20,000 square feet. The conservatory contains three sections, a 10,000 square foot tropical house, a 5,300 square foot temperate house, and a 2,000 square foot gallery for floral displays and events.

An edict (951 C.E.) calls it Kaviyoor; another record (1551 C.E.)during the period of Brahmin supremacy, refers it to as in Sanskritised form 'Kapiyoor'. Since Jainism reached Kerala through Karnataka, the Jains, after settling in what is now Kaviyoor and carving a cave out of a huge rock for stay and prayers, might have named the place Kaviyoor (Kavi=Cave, in old Kannada & Oor=Place). The claim that Kavi is Cave in old Kannada has not been examined by scholars. Some believe Kapiyoor became Kaviyoor over a period of time;(Kapi=Monkey, Oor=Place).Thus kapiyoor means place for monkeys. They attribute the name to the presence of the Lord Hanuman. Etymology The argument against Kapiyoor is that the author who wrote this word using either Ezhuthani (pointed writing instrument made of iron, ‡¥é‡¥¥‡µÅ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥£‡¥ø) or any etching instrument might have accidentally put a small round or curve at the beginning of the letter '‡¥µ'. When the curve at the beginning is smaller, '‡¥µ' becomes '‡¥™ '. This minor mistake from an ancient author is no reason to conclude that the place might have been named Kapiyoor (‡¥ï‡¥™‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç). Even now, literate people make the same mistake. Unfortunately, the word 'kapi' was even entered on the dhwaja sthambhom (flag mast) of Mahadeva temple ‚Äì the Sanskrit verses written on it refer to 'plavagapuram' (Palvagam=monkey in Sanskrit), a synonym for 'Kapiyoor'. At least one old record in vattezuth (old script used before modern vedic Malayalam script formulated by Aryan settlers) refers to the village as 'Kaviyoo' ‚Äì the author missed out the last letter. Historians are of the opinion that 'Kaviyoor' means overflow land, because the Manimala river flooded every year and surpass to the vast punja (rice field). Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism The village is listed in Brahmin history as one of the 64 Brahmin villages (32 in Kerala and 32 in South Karnataka) established by Vishnu-incarnate Parashuram. These settlements were on the banks of rivers. Kaviyoor has remained fertile thanks to river Manimala that flows south of the village. The original inhabitants were Dravidians who embraced Jainism and later Buddhism due to the missionary work of the powerful Maurian emperors throughout India, China and southeast Asia. The Vedic seer, Shankarachayra defeated Buddhists monks in debates throughout India, which forced them and their followers to embrace Hinduism by 8th Century, C.E. In Kerala, the people then stuck to Vedic Aryanism, because the Dravidian Chera king Kulashekara Azhwar was a staunch follower of it. The word 'Palli' denotes Buddhist school/hermitage. (The area behind N.S.S. High School is still called 'Pallipuram'. The N.S.S. High School was established around 1924, over the traditional cemetery of stonesmiths/masons). There are two other places called Pazhampalli and Mundiyappally which border the Panchayath of Kunnanthanam, indicating a Buddhist past. After the spread of Vedic Hinduism post-800 C.E, the prayer centres of Jains/Buddhists might have been converted to temples. There is no proof or even hints as to what happened in Kaviyoor from 800 C.E. to 1750, C.E. However, the strong Brahmin presence of Kaviyoor is an important feature of this period. Early history It was a part of Nanruzhai Nadu which had its capital in what is now Thrikkodithanam, 9 km west of Kaviyoor that covered Thiruvalla and Changanassery of central Travancore. Definitely, in the 12th century, C.E, as Nanruzhai Nadu fell apart, Kaviyoor became part of the kingdom of Thekkumkoor rajas who were believed to have ruled from five centres, the nearest being Puzhavathu, Changanacherry. Was it ever part of Vilakkili (‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥ø) Namboothiris who ruled Thiruvalla? Thekkumkoor Rajas had apparently allowed Brahmins to rule the 'graamam' under his suzerainty. Kaviyoor was a prominent Brahmin village and they were considered superior to the Brahmins of Thiruvalla, another Brahmin village of repute. (Kaviyoor Brahmins never married Thiruvalla Brahmins till about 50‚Äì75 years ago). Vilakkili Namboothiris were the main priests of Kaviyoor at some point of time, esp. 1400‚Äì1600, C.E. That all the Namboothiris of Kaviyoor were close to both Thekkumkoor and Vilakkili is evident from the fact Marthanda Varma, the king of Travancore, barred them from taking part in Murajapam, the annual prayer ritual at Sree Padmanabha Temple, Trivandrum. The village Brahmins are all Yajurvedis. Many Brahmins in Kottarakkara, Kalanjoor, Paipad, Vaypoor, Keezhvaypoor, Thrikkodithanam, Puthoor, Kavungumprayar, Kulathoor etc. are known as 'Kaviyoor Graamam' Brahmins.Thrikkaviyoor by P. Unnikrishnan Nair Pathillam Pottis Most of land was owned by the temple which ensured the welfare of the Brahmins. There is a reliable version that Naithelloor, a Brahmin family, had the upper hand in administration during pre-Travancore days. Their descendants still live in the village. It is one of the thirteen Brahmin families that owned the Kaviyoor Temple once upon a time. Earlier the system of management by Pathillathu Brahmins (‡¥™‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç ‡¥™‡µã‡¥±‡µç‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥∞‡µç) existed in Kaviyoor in which the whole village (‡¥¨‡µç‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥π‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥£‡¥ó‡µç‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥Æ‡¥Ç)was owned by the main temple and in turn the temple was managed by Brahmin families, with each bramin family getting one tenth of the income of the temple. The families and their rights (share, in bracket) are as shown below: 1. Kaviyoor Illam (1), 2.Kizhakkineth Illam (1), 3. Vengassery Illam (1), 4. Kaduthanam Illam (1/3), 5. Nedungala Illam (1/3), 6. Attupuram Illam (1/3), 7. Naithelloor Illam (1), 8. Padinjare Thengumpally Illam (1), 9. Kizhakke Thengumpally Illam (1), 10. Kachira Vadasseri Illam (1), 11. Moothedath Vadasseri Illam (1), 12. Chaathyaattu (Chaathikaattu) Vadasseri Illam (1).http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/kaviyoor-graamam.htm by Thiruvalla P. Unnikrishnan Nair. The shares add up to ten, spread among 13 families. The prominent ones among them were Naithelloor and Moothedath Vadassei. The latter owned the mount where Shiva temple was built. The former ended up as the de facto rulers of the village. Many of these illams do not exist now. What is significant is that there is an illam called 'Kaviyoor'. Was their name given to the village or did they take the name of the village? Naithelloor Namboothiris are migrants from Kodungallor. They brought with them the Nair family of Nilakkal and Marar family of Parakkattu. The annual pilgrimage of this Namboothiri to Kodungalloor and the establishment of Njaliyil temple are mentioned ibidem. People interested in Kerala history should note that there was a 'Kaduthanam' (‡¥ï‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥®‡¥Ç) Illam in Thrikkodithanam too. Some blocks of land there still bear the same name. Did Thri-kaduthanam become Thri- kodithanam (alright, there is this thiru-khadika-sthaanam theory)? In Perunna too an illam called Kaduthanam existed. The assets of some of the Brahmins without any legal heirs were merged with other Brahmin families. Some left for other areas. Only a few Brahmin families remain in Kaviyoor now. Deshams The ancient Kaviyoor Graamam comprised five deshams, viz, Padinjattumcherry, Anjilithanam, Kunnanthanam, Iraviperoor and Murani (Mallappally West). Parts of Muthoor East also fell within Kaviyoor. The temple procession (Ooruvalathth, ‡¥ä‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥≤‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µç) still goes to these areas ‚Äì except to Mallappally west (Murani) which is done only symbolically. Thirunelli Temple Near Thrikkalkudi Para, there was a temple, dedicated to an unknown deity. Some say this used to be known as Thirunelli (‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥®‡µÜ‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥ø) probably encompassed by a fort. There is no mark left of these institutions now. However, these theories have since been discounted by historians. There was no fort either. What actually existed there was not a temple, but fane - a tribal shrine dedicated to some tribal deity, predating even Jain and Buddhist occupation. As the shrine fell in ruins, the idol was shifted to Kuriyan Kavu temple, where it is kept as 'upadevta', (lower deity). The deity is now merely called 'Moorthy'. The reasons for naming the area 'Kottoor' is yet to be studied. Thrikkannapuram Temple There is not even a trace of the structure where this small Krishna temple stood at Padinjattumcherry, near the Mahadeva Temple. Some idols of nagdevathas are the only reminder of the temple that was probably owned by a Brahmin family. This family might have stayed close to the temple. As the family shifted to other place or ended up not having any legal heirs after the last of them died, the structure gradually collapsed and the beautiful idol of Krishna was shifted to Kazhanoor Illam where it is preserved in a small shrine. The site was passed on to others and ultimately a small church of Mar Thoma sect of Christians was built there. There was an attempt by some people to remove the Naga idols which failed due to the resistance of locals led by the Namboothiri of Kazhanoor Illam. Kaviyoor became part of Travancore when King Marthanda Varma gobbled up all the territories up to Udayanapuram (20 km south of Cochin) in 1752‚Äì53.  Cave temple  An ancient rock cut temple is located there, carved on a huge rock and the carved rooms and sculptures aore well preserved. The Kaviyoor Thrikkakkudi (‡¥§‡µÉ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥ø. see the correct name below) Cave Temple, also known as the Rock Cut Cave Temple, is of historical importance and is preserved as a monument by the Archaeological Department. The temple was taken over by the Travancore Devaswom Board on 20 December 1967(See:http://www.archaeology.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=56&Itemid;=77). Cave Temple, Kaviyoor,2008 The temple has a verandah with a sculpture of Lord Ganapathi carved into the wall and inner sanctum containing a tall shivalinga, all carved out a one huge rock. It bears close resemblance to the Pallava style of architecture. The engravings here are among the earliest specimens of stone sculptures in Kerala. Enshrined in a square cave is the main deity of the shrine, Lord Shiva, represented in the ' Shivalinga' which is about three feet high and carved out of rock. The shrine also has idols of Ganapathy, Maharshi and Dwarapalakas. It was constructed during the rule of the Pallava dynasty who reigned over South India from 608 to 850 AD. The rock, housing the cave, is actually called Thri-kal-kudi Paara. (Thri/Thiru= Divine, Kal=Stone/Rock, Kudi=home/settlement, Paara=Rock/Boulder. Mal. ‡¥§‡µÉ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥≤‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥ø ). Literally, this means cave settlement. The land surrounding the rock also was called 'Kal-kudi' (‡¥ï‡¥≤‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥ø). Still, there is a nearby piece of land by name 'Kakkudiyil', a corrupt form for 'Kalkudiyil' (‡¥ï‡¥≤‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç ). More corrupt forms (like Thrikkaakkudi, Thrikkokudi etc.) are doing rounds as newer generations of people, defying rhyme and reason, use words, ignoring their etymological significance. Kaviyoor Mahadeva Temple History: Kaviyoor Mahadevar Temple which has a unique style of architecture and is one of the oldest temples in Kerala. Also known as Thrikkaviyoor Mahadeva Temple, it is one of the prominent temples in Kerala. Medieval period most of the land property was came at the disposal of the temple, due to tax free status of temple. People donate or sold the land to temple to escape from land taxation, and continued to cultivate the land on lease. Temple stands on a small hillock and is built in the gable style architecture peculiar to Kerala. It is believed to have been constructed in the early years of the 10th century and the 'Kaviyoor Shasanas' of 950/951 C.E. has references to the gifts that were offered to this temple. The 'Darusilpas' (wood sculpture) seen around the temple belong to the 17th century. The temple festival is held in December‚ÄìJanuary of every year. Hanumth Jayanthi, the birth anniversary of Lord Hanuman is also celebrated along with the temple festival. Artwork: The \\"DAARUSILPAS\\"(wood sculpture) seen around the temple belong to the 17th century when the temple was rebuilt/renovated. The wood carvings on the outer wall of the Sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum), inner roof of Balickalpura and Namaskara Mandapam are excellent. The Temple itself is a beautiful specimen of Kerala style architecture. Main deity: Lord Mahadeva & Parvathi. The main idol is not Shiva, but 'Sambashiva' (‡¥∏‡¥æ‡¥Ç‡¥¨‡¥∂‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥®‡µç = ‡¥∏ + ‡¥Ö‡¥Ç‡¥¨ + ‡¥∂‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥®‡µç = ‡¥Ö‡¥Ç‡¥¨‡¥æ‡¥∏‡¥Æ‡µá‡¥§‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥Ø ‡¥∂‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥®‡µç), that is, Shiva with consort Amba (Parvathi)-as is evident form the 'mooladhyanam', the main invocational mantra. Even the locals are not aware of this fact. Instead of 'Mahadeva Temple', it should be called 'Sambashiva' or Uma-Maheshwara Temple. The addition of Parvathi, christened as Srimoola Rajeshwari, on the western side of srikovil was done by Kaviyoor Pachu Moothath (1845‚Äì1917) and relations who had the rights to 'kazhakam' of all shrines (nadas) within the temple, though this was objected to by the then Thanthri (chief priest) of the temple, saying there could not be two 'Parvathis'. However Moothath being the then royal physician for the king Sree Moolam Thirunaal and also the first principal of Ayurveda College, Trivandrum, used his connections to overrule the thanthri. Upadevas Hanuman: The Hanuman shrine in the north-west corner of Srikovil is very famous. The idol is believed to have been installed by sage Vilvamangalam Swami. The Lord is believed to sit on the Ilanji tree (Mimusops elengi) and the rostrum below just outside the sanctum sanctorum. The tree has been swallowed by a Banyan tree, despite being informed to the Devasom Board that the Banyan tree should be removed. Once an Ilanji perished new one would sprout at the same place, so there used to be no planting of new trees in the past. The raised dais-like structure, the Ilanjithara (‡¥á‡¥≤‡¥û‡µç‡¥û‡¥ø‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥±) around the tree used to be the podium for conducting arts and cultural programs. The unwanted Banyan tree is a threat to the temple complex. Its roots have already penetrated the wall of the nearby pond; part of the pond wall has collapsed. The roots can easily reach the very foundation of this illustrious temple and its Dhwaja sthambhom (the flag mast) soon! Alas! The whole temple is going to be a victim of lack of knowledge of local history and culture and lack of proper management of the Travancore Devaswom Board. Dakshinamoorthy: This is the southern shrine of the sanctum sanctorum. Dakshinamoorthy, the lord of knowledge or the Supreme Teacher, is a form of Shiva. There are daily poojas here. Lord Dakshinamoorthy is believed to sit under a banyan tree in the Himalayas facing south, teaching the wisdom of Vedas to the divine people. Hence the idols of this god is always installed facing south. Nagadevathas: The Ilanjithara houses deities of Nagas (serpent gods). This was a later addition ‚Äì as people, pressured by modern ways of living, found it difficult to maintain Naga shrines in their homes, the idols were transferred to the temple. The main pooja here is on the Ayilaym day in Kanni (Sept‚ÄìOct). Sri Krishna Temple, Kaviyoor The Sreekrishna Temple: Now reduced to a minor shrine, to the west of the Shiva temple, this temple, on the shore of a reservoir, existed much before the Mahadeva temple. Its location is unique in that the mound over which the Shiva temple was built hides this shrine from the rising sun. Since the temple is below the level of the main temple it is also called Keezhthrikkovil (‡¥ï‡µÄ‡¥¥‡µç ‡¥§‡µÉ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µã‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç). The whole complex, though small, is a photographer's delight and has appeared in books on Indian temples. An independent temple, tantra-wise, it is regarded as a part of Shiva temple by the Devaswom Board for convenience of administration. The poojas are performed by a Brahmin family ‚Äì Kuzhiyaanoor Illam ‚Äì brought to Kaviyoor centuries ago exclusively for this temple from Kozhikode during the fiefdom of Pathillathu Brahmins. Yakshi: The shrine is outside the temple, near Keezhchirakkal Illam, which owned it long ago. The 'Yakshi' was brought to Kaviyoor from Kodunthura, Pathanamthitta by an elder Moothath of the Illam when he married a girl from Kodunthura. The shrine was later handed over to Kaviyoor temple authorities. The concept of 'Yakshi' coalesced into Hinduism from Jainism. The Yakhi is believed to bless spinsters who pray for timely marriage (‡¥Æ‡¥Ç‡¥ó‡¥≤‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥™‡µç‡¥∞‡¥¶‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥®‡¥ø).Special day: Aavani Onam (‡¥Ü‡¥µ‡¥£‡¥ø ‡¥ì‡¥£‡¥Ç ).

An old temple formerly owned by Naithallur Illam (immigrants from Kodungalloor; see 'History'), it is now managed by the public. The goddess was originally enshrined in the illam, but was shifted to the present site later. The locals believe that once upon a time the head of the illam used to go on an annual pilgrimage to Kodungallor and when he became too old to travel the goddess offered to settle in his illam. The shrine was shifted as the goddess apparently became more powerful to be housed in a family shrine. In the month of Makaram (January)'Ashwathy' festival is conducted. The festival's name comes from \\"Aswathy\\", the first of the 27 birth stars in Malayalam astrology. Eye-catching Thaalapoli (‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µä‡¥≤‡¥ø), a procession of young women carrying lamps/wicks and grain in well-adorned trays for appeasing the deity is an important annual function.

There is no mark left of these institutions now. Who ruled from this fort is a mystery. There was a belief that it had got something to do with the Ezhumatoor kings. It was also linked to Dalit community. Because of the fort (‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü), the area was christened 'Kottoor'.am Other temples and shrines The other small temples in the village are dedicated to Ayyappa (Padinjattumcherry), Subrahmanya (Kottoor), Kuruthikamankavu temple-dedicated to Bhadrakali and Ayyappa sitting face to face in two separate shrines (This is a rare type in Kerala), Thiruvamanpuram (north of the main temple). These were owned by Brahmin families and are now run with public cooperation.

In 2015 the location was changed to Velence. The name itself is an example of the feeling of isolation of Hungary. It can be seen as a metaphor for the 'island' of Hungary within a sea of non-Finno-Ugric languages. The festival is not to be confused with the 'normal' Hungarian Sziget festival.  Organisation  Although the festival is organised by a nationalist and irredential movement, it does not solely feature nationalist bands. 'Normal' Hungarian (rock)bands are booked for the festival as well, and cultural demonstrations are part of the program. In 2001 Toroczkai started the festival as a summer camp for his youth movement. At that point the name was still 'Grand National Youth Meeting'. The next year, this name would be changed to Magyar Sziget. Reinforcing the national identity amongst participants was one of the goals of the festival, and thus the inspiration for the new name. Although the festival started off as a week-long event, it has since been shortened to just two days in more recent years. Magyar Sziget changes every year, but the Hungarian bands and cultural activities that support Hungarian heritage remain the main focus. In recent years the festival was downsized, but alternative festivals have been organised as well.

With a history dating to the late 18th century, the farm was for two centuries managed by generations of the same family, and was a noted early exporter of merino sheep to South Africa. Most of the farmstead buildings were built before 1850. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Witherill Farm is located in central western Shoreham, and is roughly bisected by Witherill Road, a town road extending westward from Vermont Route 74. The farmstead consists of four buildings, two on either side of the road. To the north stands what was originally a small blacksmith shop, a 1-1/2 story gabled wood- frame structure that recently served as a garage, but has seen a variety of uses over time. East of it stands the main farmhouse, an 1857 Greek Revival structure two stories in height and three bays wide, with a wraparound single- story porch. Across the street stand two barns: a c. 1820 sheep barn, and an 1809 apple packing barn. Both have rubblestone foundations and timber framing, with clapboard walls. At the time of the property's National Register operation, most of the farm's were in agricultural use as an apple orchard. with The farm's history dates to 1785, when Ebenezer Turrill purchased the land from one of Shoreham's original proprietors. His first house, built in 1790, stood about from the present farmhouse, which was built in 1857. The farm has been worked by successive generations of Turrill's descendants. Originally a diversified farm producing a variety of products, it was specialized into merino sheep farming in the late 19th century, with its sheep being among early exports to South America and South Africa, its operators making several trips to the latter area to further this trade. The Witherills were among the first in the area to produce apples for commercial distribution, acting as founding members of a local cooperative established for the purpose. As of 1993, the farm continued to be worked by the Witherills.

Balikumbat is the Sub Divisional Headquarter of Balikumbat Sub Division and located about 20.9 km from Ndop town. The Balikumbat people became so renowned in Cameroon and the world at large inspired by their late ‚Äúsuper natural‚Äù leader Fon Doh Gahgwanyin III (1977 ‚Äì 2012)  History  The death of the powerful Bali Chamba leader Gawulubi (Translated as ruler of the waters) in 1830 after the battle of Kumyidla or Kolm at Bafu-Fundong led to a serious succession Crises orchestrated by the fact that he never designated any successor at death, which provoked a rivalry between his first son Samsuh and second son Galanga. The power struggle latter attracted the junior princes and a princess; this led to a total split of the roving empire of Gawulubi. Galabe who was his fourth Son, one of the strongest soldiers, bookkeeper or treasurer of his father was the first to leave with his large supporters to create his Balikumbat chiefdom. Second in quitting was his eldest brother Samsu with his own faction to establish Bali Ghansin with the fewest supporters. In the third place of leaving the collapsed empire alliance was Princess Nyonga the eldest child with a good number of followers due to her popularity to found Bali Nyonga chiefdom for her son Nyongpasi who later became Fon Nyonga. The last of breakaway was Galanga and his faction to create Bali-gham (Bali nearer Bagham) reasons why they are known as ‚ÄúNepgayidbi‚Äù meaning those who stayed behind at the palace of Gawulubi. Balikumbat Fondom was founded by the fourth son of Gawulubi, a strong soldier with a lot of celebrity, father's finance manager who refused to succumb to any of his two elder brothers if enthroned. From 1830 ‚Äì 1920 royal succession was among cousins that is, if a Fon passed on, his cousin took over. Reasons why they were short lived. In 1920 following the death of Ga Nyamyin II, and with the intervention of British Administrative soldiers from up-station Bamenda, who had just taken over from the Germans after World War I, Galabe III was enthroned taking over directly from the immediate father. This marked the end of succession by cousins. The British, Balikumbat king makers and the entire population made a pact for direct hereditary. All attempts to unseat the enthroned revolutionary young Fon by Doh Mundem (a cousin of the deceased) who had been practicing Fonship when his cousin was still in power made with stiff resistance from the population and more security for the new Fon so much so that he (Doh Mundem) died almost as an outcast. Useful to mention here that Galabe III enjoyed a lot of support from the mother's kings men Bamunka. Reasons for some Bamunka traditional and cultural practices in Balikumbat up till date. Balikumbat ‚ÄúNepkolubi‚Äù that is ‚Äúpeople of the hilltop‚Äù, was the first group under ‚ÄúNdaghan‚Äù leadership to leave Bafu ‚Äì Fondong of late Gawulubi at about 1830. Galabe a powerful retainer called ‚ÄúGibguela‚Äù served as treasurer for the entire roving empire or alliance which gave him a lot of influence and in subordination to any other prince. This led to the gathering of supporters into a kingdom of his own. The military lodge or ‚ÄúManjongs‚Äù that he used to command as a valiant soldier and astute manager was converted to constitute a kingdom. Balikumbat group was mixed up with the following clans, ‚ÄúKagneba‚Äù (from which ‚Äúlela‚Äù originates) ‚ÄúDjabneba, Nyumneba, Pedneba, Ghadineba and Tikadneba. As migration progressed remnants of the following after raids joined the group, Bagneba, Golaneba, Balaneba, Tineba and small contingents from Bagham. The Balikumbat migration from Bafu-Fondong could be classified in three stages. (1) Bafu-Fondong to Santa neighborhood. Their brief stay for several months at Santa neighborhood made them to catch their breath and revive their spirits after the defeat at the battle of Kolm. The army was reorganized and greater ambitions were developed for an unknown destination. The second stage of the migration took up with a series of raids and subjugation. The vigorous and effective group carried out raids on the following; Bambili in the reign of Awemo I, Bambui and arrived at Wapu below the table land occupied by Bamunkumbit which they were soon going to gain. The plateau attracted Galabe so much that, he saw it as his dream home and immediately developed strategies to conquer the occupant and settle there. The third stage was the wresting of the plateau from the Bamunkumbit owners. This operation needed wit and intelligence as it did not involve any fighting. It looked mysterious but it was out of ingenuity. They simply crept up the hill in the heart of the night and quietly set up their tents on the village green courtyard of the palace. Early in the following morning, the Bamunkkumbit people were astounded by this apparition and could not believe in what they were going through. As they looked on in bewilderment, the Balikumbats fired a few arrows into the sky. Thinking themselves incapable of fighting with these mysterious men whom they thought could appear and disappear; they fled down the table land. So Galabe gladly and gratefully inherited the plateau, their mainstay up till date. This settlement by 1830 gave them their name in ‚ÄúMungaaka‚Äù Balikumbat which meant ‚ÄúHill top Bali‚Äù and in ‚ÄúMubako‚Äù ‚ÄúNepkolubi‚Äù as mentioned earlier. This led to the building of tight security around the hill to prevent any aggression by the descendant Fulani groups who came close to the foot of the plateau. The journey through Ndowely, Ndalu and Wapu to the Bamunkunbit Plateau concluded the migration story.
