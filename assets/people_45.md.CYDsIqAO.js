Cyanostar as the central unit of a dendrimer  Synthesis  The cyanostar structure is synthesized in a one-pot process among five equivalents of a benzaldehyde bearing a meta-cyanomethyl substituent. A series of Knoevenagel condensation reactions catalyzed by various bases stitches them together to make the C5-symmetric structure.  Anion binding  Cyanostar binds anions through hydrogen bonding from the C‚ÄìH hydrogen bonds, as the hydrogen has a slight positive charge. It is the first binder to make use of cyanostilbene's electropositive CH groups. The hydrogen bonds create an electropositive region in the center of the macrocycle, creating a binding pocket. Cyanostar strongly binds anions that usually can only be bound weakly. The increased binding arises from the formation of a 2:1 complex, with two cyanostars sandwiching the anion on each side. An extended version of this structural pattern is a 4:3 alternating stack of cyanostar molecules complexing a hydrogen-bonded chain of dihydrogen phosphate units.  Rotaxanes  Two cyanostars can be threaded onto a phosphate diester structure, forming a rotaxane. Because they have a high affinity for the central phosphate group only when it is in its anionic form, there is a substantial and reversible structural change in response to acid‚Äìbase changes in solution.

He achieved prominence in high society by rubbing shoulders with Stefano Zannowich, Count of St. Germain, Chevalier d'Eon, Alessandro Cagliostro, Andr√©-Robert Andr√©a de Nerciat and Giacomo Casanova with whom he had two duels. Biography He was born in Petrovac, near the coastal town of Budva municipality, in Montenegro, at the time under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Venice in 1725. Unlike his Montenegrin predecessors, Tomo Medin preferred to study the laws and letters instead of joining a foreign military, a common practice among the young at the time. After a decade of unregulated life (1746-1756), he found shelter in the court of Maria Teresa in Vienna, where he remained until 1765, when the empress elected him captain of justice in Mantua, where he remained until 1768. But the passion of gambling beckoned him again, and perhaps because of his bad habit of gambling and making debts, he had to leave his post, abandoning himself to a stray, frantic and shameful life in Germany and Italy. Giacomo Casanova writes that Tomo Medin (who Casanova calls Count Tommaso Medini) died in London in 1788 in prison, incarcerated for failing to pay his debts.Biographers view it as slander because in the criminal archives of London there is absolutely no trace of him. Casanova himself admits in his memoirs that Count Medini and Zannovich were career gamblers like himself. https://books.google.ca/books?id=3Id5DwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT120&dq;=zanowich&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjks6WVwYvmAhUSW60KHSm_AFEQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q;=zanowich&f;=falseFurthermore, the \\"Medini\\" Casanova mentions in his memoirs was, in fact, an extremely talented man of letters. In fact, Frances Burney, who was in Vienna in September 1772, that is, while Medin was in Germany, after having spoken of him with Metastasio, wrote: \\"Metastasio seems very passionate about the writings of Count Medini; whose poetic compositions are, as far as he claims, superior to those of any other living writer \\". It seems like a mockery: but really valuable are the Italian translations made by Medin of Voltaire's Henriade in 1774 and that of The Abduction of Proserpina by Claudian, which saw the light only after the death of the author. Also, Medin wrote: \\"Per il felicissimo giorno di nome di sua Altezza Serenissima l'Elittrice di Baviera Principessa reale di Polonia\\" (Monaco, 1773). Medin died in London in 1788.

It was established in 1977 by the Bloodroot Collective with radical and lesbian feminist principles.  History = Bloodroot Collective = Selma Miriam (then Selma Bunks), Samn Stockwell, Betsey Beavan, Noel Furie (then Noel Giordano), and Pat Shea met through the Westport chapter of the National Organization for Women and consciousness raising groups in the 1970s. In 1975, Miriam, Stockwell, Shea, and Beavan operated a cooperative exchange group out of Miriam's house, eventually forming the Bloodroot Collective in 1977. Stockwell left and Furie joined the collective soon after it was formed. In 2010, Furie and Miriam donated their personal papers and Bloodroot's organizational papers to the Yale University Library.  Operations  Bloodroot is located in a residential area, which, according to Miriam, has helped the rent stay affordable. This lack of foot traffic has caused the restaurant to rely heavily on word of mouth and other forms of advertising to sustain it. Bloodroot serves seasonal vegan and vegetarian food. Miriam states that their purpose is not to serve health food, but \\"really delicious ethnic food that tastes like comfort food.\\" Furie describes the food as a \\"wonderful ethnic exchange,\\" because they serve dishes from all over the world. The restaurant operates by self-service. Customers place their order and pay, find a place to sit, and are called to the counter to pick up their meal when it's ready. When finished, customers bus their own dishes. The restaurant had women-only nights to allow lesbians a safe place to meet. = Philosophy = Bloodroot was founded because the collective members wanted \\"a women's center and a way of living that would be self supporting and not dependent on grants and fundraising,\\" and \\"honest, satisfying work.\\" Maria McGrath describes the business as \\"a lesbian hang-out; a center of feminist activism and culture; a training ground for female cooks and businesswomen; and an exemplar of re-conceived capitalism based on egalitarian producer and consumer interactions.\\" = Events = Bloodroot has sponsored readings by feminist authors such as Barbara Smith, Mary Daly, Susanna J. Sturgis, and Beth Brant. In the1990s, the women of Bloodroot ran several workshops for the W.I.T.C.H. Feminist Lecture Series like \\"The Personal and the Political\\" and \\"Food for Body and Spirit.\\" Furie and Miriam participated in Slow Food Connecticut's Heirloom Tasting Feast in 2004, 2006, and 2008.  Reception  Vegetarian Times writer Jim Mason described the restaurant as \\"a gourmet vegetarian restaurant for real\\" with an \\"every-changing menu of dishes from its collective kitchen.\\" In 1985, Hartford Courant's Northeast Magazine restaurant reviewers, Jane and Michael Stern, rated Bloodroot as 2/3 stars, noting that the soups are \\"especially outstanding\\" and that the atmosphere \\"reminds... [them] of a beatnik coffeehouse.\\" Frank Cohen describes the restaurant as \\"attractive, homey, upbeat, quirky, and full of interesting knickknacks and ideological postings.\\" In 1997, food critic Bill Daley reviewed Bloodroot in Northeast Magazine; he gave the restaurant 3/4 stars, saying it \\"offers sturdy, homey fare that transcends ideology. Foodies of all stripes can rejoice.\\" Daley also picked Bloodroot as the best vegetarian restaurant in his 2000 Special Restaurant Guide. Connecticut Magazine's yearly experts' picks for the top vegan/vegetarian restaurants in the state has featured Bloodroot from 2015 to 2019.See = In popular culture = Bloodroot, Furie, and Miriam were the subject of the Douglas Tirola's 2019 documentary Bloodroot.

Models was exhibited at the fourth Salon des Ind√©pendants in spring of 1888. This painting, the third of Seurat's six major works, is a response to critics who criticized Seurat's technique for being cold and unable to represent life. Thus, the artist offers a nude, the same model, in three different poses. In the left background is part of Seurat's 1884 to 1886 painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. There is a second version of this work, smaller in size, more in accord with the divisionism technique that Seurat had invented, and favoured by Seurat specialists. This version is on the cover of the catalogue for the 1991 Seurat exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting once belonged to the merchant Heinz Berggruen and is now part of the collection of the Paul Allen estate. In 1947, at the sale of the collection of F√©lix F√©n√©on, an early advocate and promoter of Seurat, France acquired studies for the painting that now reside in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. The English art critic Waldermar Januszczak believes this painting breaks the fourth wall, offering a glimpse into the poser who are the original source of the women depicted in A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte. He further juxtaposes this to Peter Paul Rubens' The Judgement of Paris by showing the reality behind a beautiful setting.

The Neoclassical main building was built for Charles August Selby in 1796-98 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. It is located on a small hilltop in a parkland setting with views of Pr√¶st√∏ Inlet. The home farm is located a few kilometres to the southwest of the main building. The estate is owned by Michael Immanuel Jebsen, the eldest son of Hong Kong-based businessman Hans Michael Jebsen. History=Early history= Otto Krabbe B√¶kkeskov was originally one of several small manors in the vicinity of the village of Akselhoved. It was owned by Joachim Beck in the late 16th century and was then passed on to his daughter Vibeke Beck Galde. The estate became crown land when a later owner, Christoffer Galde, died unmarried in 1631. His closest relative, a sister, had already given up her heritage to the crown many years earlier and the estate was therefore included in Vordingborg Fief. The crown sold B√¶kkeskov to Merete Grubbe after just two years. She later sold it to Christoffer Godskesen Lindenov. He left the estate to his daughter. Anne Elisabeth Christoffersdatter Lindenov, who had become a widow two years earlier. She sold it to Otto Krabbe in 1791. He was already the owner of Holmegaard. Sken Skinkel acquired B√¶kkeskov in 1693. In 1729, it was purchased by Knud Ahasverus Becker. He was the son of a ferryman from Hvalpsund but had become inspector of Vall√∏ after marrying the daughter of court tailor Brummondt. In 1718, he was appointed as deputy district judge of Lolland and Falster. He was known for his brutal treatment of the farmers on his estate. In August 1738, he was assaulted and killed after correcting and beating one of the farmers. 11 farmers were later sentenced to death. =The von Munthe af Morgenstierne family= Bredo von Munthe af Morgenstierne Bredo Munthe purchased B√¶kkeskov in 1741. He placed the land from some of the tenant farms directly under the manor, modernized the management of the estate and improved the fam buildings. He was ennobled ny letters patent under the name von Munthe af Morgenstierne in 1755. He died on the estate on 13 January 1757. His widow Anna Dorothea von Munthe af Morgenstjerne n√©e Smith passed B√¶kkeskov on to their eldest son Otto Christopher von Munthe af Morgenstierne in 1759. He shut down the small village of B√¶kkeskov and instead incorporated all its land directly under the manor. He sold the estate in 1795, =1795-1843: Changing owners= The new owner was the English-born merchant Charles August Selby. He had founded the merchant house Selby & Co. in Copenhagen in 1777. He retired on the estate. He changed the operations with inspiration from England, introducing stable feeding, cattle fattening and the cultivation of beetroot, cabbage and potatoes. Charles August Selby solgte B√¶kkeskov in 1805. He died at G√ºldenstein in Holsten in 1823, =1843-1923: The Vind family= The main building in the late 19th century Christian Andreas Vind Christian Vind acquired B√¶kkeskov in 1844. His widow kept the estate after his death in 1869. It was later taken over by their son Emil Vind who spent most of his time abroad as Danish envoy in St. Petersburg and Berlin. He had no children and B√¶kkeskov was therefore endowed to his nephew Ove Vind. He initially acquired more land but had to sell all the tenant farms in 1920 as a result of the land reforms of 1919. =Later history= More of the land was sold to the government in 1923 and converted into smallholdings. Peter Hermann Zobel purchased B√¶kkeskov in 1996. He retired as CEO of the insurance company Codan in 1999. Architecture The main building is designed in the Neoclassical style. It consists of two storeys over a high cellar and has a rectangular floor plan. The central part of the southern facade features four Ionic pilasters.

They have genomes that act as complementary strands from which messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized by the viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). During replication of the viral genome, RdRp synthesizes a positive-sense antigenome that it uses as a template to create genomic negative-sense RNA. Negative-strand RNA viruses also share a number of other characteristics: most contain a viral envelope that surrounds the capsid, which encases the viral genome, -ssRNA virus genomes are usually linear, and it is common for their genome to be segmented. Negative-strand RNA viruses constitute the phylum Negarnaviricota, in the kingdom Orthornavirae and realm Riboviria. They are descended from a common ancestor that was a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, and they are considered to be a sister clade of reoviruses, which are dsRNA viruses. Within the phylum, there are two major branches that form two subphyla: Haploviricotina, whose members are mostly non-segmented and which encode an RdRp that synthesizes caps on mRNA, and Polyploviricotina, whose members are segmented and which encode an RdRp that snatches caps from host mRNAs. A total of six classes in the phylum are recognized. Negative-strand RNA viruses are closely associated with arthropods and can be informally divided between those that are reliant on arthropods for transmission and those that are descended from arthropod viruses but can now replicate in vertebrates without the aid of arthropods. Prominent arthropod-borne -ssRNA viruses include the Rift Valley fever virus and the tomato spotted wilt virus. Notable vertebrate -ssRNA viruses include the Ebola virus, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, the Lassa fever virus, and the rabies virus. Etymology Negarnaviricota takes the first part of its name from Latin nega, meaning negative, the middle part rna refers to RNA, and the final part, -viricota, is the suffix used for virus phyla. The subphylum Haploviricotina takes the first part of its name, Haplo, from Ancient Greek ·ºÅœÄŒªœåœÇ, meaning simple, and -viricotina is the suffix used for virus subphyla. The subphylum Polyploviricotina follows the same pattern, Polyplo being taken from Ancient Greek œÄŒøŒªœçœÄŒªŒøŒ∫ŒøœÇ, meaning complex. Characteristics=Genome= Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virion and Mononegavirales genomes All viruses in Negarnaviricota are negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses. They have genomes made of RNA, which are single instead of double-stranded. Their genomes are negative sense, meaning that messenger RNA (mRNA) can be synthesized directly from the genome by the viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called RNA replicase, which is encoded by all -ssRNA viruses. Excluding viruses in the genus Tenuivirus and some in the family Chuviridae, all -ssRNA viruses have linear rather than circular genomes, and the genomes may be segmented or non-segmented. All -ssRNA genomes contain terminal inverted repeats, which are palindromic nucleotide sequences at each end of the genome. =Replication and transcription= Influenza virus replication cycle Replication of -ssRNA genomes is executed by RdRp, which initiates replication by binding to a leader sequence on the 3'-end (usually pronounced \\"three prime end\\") of the genome. RdRp then uses the negative sense genome as a template to synthesize a positive-sense antigenome. When replicating the antigenome, RdRp first binds to the trailer sequence on the 3'-end of the antigenome. Thereafter, RdRp ignores all transcription signals on the antigenome and synthesizes a copy of the genome while using the antigenome as a template. Replication is executed while the genome is inside the nucleocapsid, and RdRp unveils the capsid and translocates along the genome during replication. As new nucleotide sequences are synthesized by RdRp, capsid proteins are assembled and encapsidate the newly replicate viral RNA. Transcribing mRNA from the genome follows the same directional pattern as producing the antigenome. At the leader sequence, RdRp synthesizes a 5-'end (usually pronounced \\"five prime end\\") triphosphate-leader RNA and either, in the case of the subphylum Haploviricotina, caps the 5'-end or, in the case of the subphylum Polyploviricotina, snatches a cap from a host mRNA and attaches it to the viral mRNA so that the mRNA can be translated by the host cell's ribosomes. After capping the mRNA, RdRp initiates transcription at a start codon and later terminates transcription upon reaching a stop codon. At the end of transcription, RdRp synthesizes a polyadynelated tail (polyA tail) consisting of hundreds of adenines in the mRNA's 3-end, which may be done by stuttering on a sequence of uracils. After the polyA tail is constructed, the mRNA is released by RdRp. In genomes that encode more than one transcribable portion, RdRp can continue scanning to the next start codon to continue with transcription. Some -ssRNA viruses are ambisense, meaning that both the negative genomic strand and positive antigenome separately encode different proteins. In order to transcribe ambisense viruses, two rounds of transcription are performed: first, mRNA is produced directly from the genome; second, mRNA is created from the antigenome. All ambisense viruses contain a hairpin loop structure to stop transcription after the protein's mRNA has been transcribed. =Morphology= Peribunyavirus structure (left); transmission electron micrograph of California encephalitis virus (right) Negative-strand RNA viruses contain a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of the genome and an RdRp attached to each segment of the genome surrounded by a capsid. The capsid is composed of proteins whose folded structure contains five alpha-helices in the N-terminal lobe (5-H motif) and three alpha-helices in the C-terminal lobe (3-H motif). Inside the capsid, the genome is sandwiched between these two motifs. Excluding the family Aspiviridae, -ssRNA viruses contain an outer viral envelope, a type of a lipid membrane that surrounds the capsid. The shape of the virus particle, called a virion, of -ssRNA viruses varies and may be filamentous, pleomorphic, spherical, or tubular. =Evolution= Genome segmentation is a prominent trait among many -ssRNA viruses, and -ssRNA viruses range from having genomes with one segment, typical for members of the order Mononegavirales, to genomes with ten segments, as is the case for Tilapia tilapinevirus. There is no clear trend over time that determines the number of segments, and genome segmentation among -ssRNA viruses appears to be a flexible trait since it has evolved independently on multiple occasions. Most members of the subphylum Haploviricotina are nonsegmented, whereas segmentation is universal in Polyploviricotina. Phylogenetics Phylogeny of -ssRNA viruses Phylogenetic analysis based on RdRp shows that -ssRNA viruses are descended from a common and ancestor and that they are likely a sister clade of reoviruses, which are dsRNA viruses. Within the phylum, there are two clear branches, assigned to two subphyla, based on whether RdRp synthesizes a cap on viral mRNA or snatches a cap from host mRNA and attaches that cap to viral mRNA. Within the phylum, -ssRNA viruses that infect arthropods appear to be basal and the ancestors of all other -ssRNA viruses. Arthropods frequently live together in large groups, which allows for viruses to be transmitted easily. Over time, this has led to arthropod -ssRNA viruses gaining a high level of diversity. While arthropods host large quantities of viruses, there is disagreement about the degree to which cross-species transmission of arthropod -ssRNA viruses occurs among arthropods. Plant and vertebrate -ssRNA viruses tend to be genetically related to arthropod-infected viruses. Furthermore, most -ssRNA viruses outside of arthropods are found in species that interact with arthropods. Arthropods therefore serve as both key hosts and vectors of transmission of -ssRNA viruses. In terms of transmission, non- arthropod -ssRNA viruses can be distinguished between those that are reliant on arthropods for transmission and those that can circulate among vertebrates without the aid of arthropods. The latter group is likely to have originated from the former, adapting to vertebrate-only transmission. Classification Negarnaviricota belongs to the kingdom Orthornavirae, which encompasses all RNA viruses that encode RdRp, and the realm Riboviria, which includes Orthornavirae as well as all viruses that encode reverse transcriptase in the kingdom Pararnavirae. Negarnaviricota contains two subphyla, which contain a combined six classes, five of which are monotypic down to lower taxa: Phylogenetic tree of Negarnaviricota (top), genome of different members and major conserved proteins (bottom) * Subphylum: Haploviricotina, which contains -ssRNA viruses that encode an RdRp that synthesizes a cap structure on viral mRNA and which usually have nonsegmented genomes ** Class: Chunquiviricetes *** Order: Muvirales **** Family: Qinviridae ***** Genus: Yingvirus ** Class: Milneviricetes *** Order: Serpentovirales **** Family: Aspviridae ***** Genus: Ophiovirus ** Class: Monjiviricetes ** Class: Yunchangviricetes *** Order: Goujianvirales **** Family: Yueviridae ***** Genus: Yuyuevirus * Subphylum: Polyploviricotina, which contains -ssRNA viruses that encode an RdRp that takes a cap from host mRNA to use as the cap on viral mRNA and which have segmented genomes ** Class: Ellioviricetes *** Order: Bunyavirales ** Class: Insthoviricetes *** Order: Articulavirales Negative-strand RNA viruses are classified as Group V in the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses together based on their manner of mRNA production and which is often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. Therefore, Group V and Negarnaviricota are synonymous. Disease Negative-strand RNA viruses caused many widely known diseases. Many of these are transmitted by arthropods, including the Rift Valley fever virus and the tomato spotted wilt virus. Among vertebrates, bats and rodents are common vectors for many viruses, including the Ebola virus and the rabies virus, transmitted by bats and other vertebrates, and the Lassa fever virus and hantaviruses, transmitted by rodents. Influenza viruses are common among birds and mammals. Human-specific -ssRNA viruses include the measles virus and the mumps virus. History Many diseases caused by -ssRNA viruses have been known throughout history, including hantavirus infection, measles, and rabies. In modern history, some such as Ebola and influenza have caused deadly disease outbreaks. The vesicular stomatitis virus, first isolated in 1925 and one of the first animal viruses to be studied because it could be studied well in cell cultures, was identified as an -ssRNA virus, which was unique at the time because other RNA viruses that had been discovered were positive sense. In the early 21st century, the bovine disease rinderpest, caused by -ssRNA rinderpest virus, became the second disease to be eradicated, after smallpox, caused by a DNA virus. In the 21st century, viral metagenomics has become common to identify viruses in the environment. For -ssRNA viruses, this allowed for a large number of invertebrate, and especially arthropod, viruses to be identified, which helped to provide insight into the evolutionary history of -ssRNA viruses. Based on phylogenetic analysis of RdRp showing that -ssRNA viruses were descended from a common ancestor, Negarnaviricota and its two subphyla were established in 2018, and it was placed into the then newly established realm Riboviria.

It was designed by William Wardell and built during 1886. It is also known as the English Scottish & Australian Chartered Bank (former) - Amo Roma Restaurant and Vault Restaurant; the Institute of Marine Power Engineers; Five Bells; and Ox on the Rocks. The property is owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History = Hospital = In 1788, the site was first occupied by Europeans as the location of the first hospital in Australia. In 1816, the hospital was relocated to Macquarie Street, and the site passed into private use. Between 1816‚Äì1882, the hospital building on the site was used for residential and retail, notably boarding houses and small shops.AR038-039; AR045; AR057-058; AR061-069; AR073-074; AR078-079; AR084-085; AR126; AR129; AR131-132; AR149 Granted to William DavisAM015-016; AM020-023; AR068-069; AR111-112; AR122; AR143 in December 1836 as 14 3/4 perches. Houses on this allotment on 1834 survey. By 1883 the hospital building and later structures had been demolished. = English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank = The English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A;) purchased the subject site in 1883. Architect William Wardell was commissioned to design the building for the site. The branch opened in 1885. The building was two storey, with seven rooms, of sandstone facade with slate roofing, in Venetian Gothic Revival style. In 1900 the bubonic plague broke out and an area of land, which included the subject site, was resumed by the government. The ES&A; Bank re- acquired the building in 1909. During the 1920s the ES&A; company entered a period of spectacular growth. However, during the 1930s many branches were closed due to the financial squeeze of the Depression. The Rocks branch was closed in 1934. = Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers = In 1938 the ES&A; Bank sold the site to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers (AIMPE) with the site coming into control of the union's Sydney district committee. The building was occupied by AIMPE until 1971, when the union relocated its offices to Ultimo. = Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority = Ownership of the property was transferred to Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) in 1971. In the mid 1970s the environment surrounding the site underwent changes. The store buildings and fruiter behind the bank building were demolished to accommodate the construction of the State Archives building and the development of Nurses Walk, linking the various courts and lanes. Additions to the bank building included the Gothic styled porch and external timber stairway to the rear entry.  Restaurants  In 1974 the building was modified for use as a wine bar and restaurant; the office partitioning was removed to create open plan dining areas, and kitchens were installed. The building continues to function as a restaurant.  Description  A branch of the English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank (ES&A; Bank) was designed by William Wardell. The building is two storied, with seven rooms, of sandstone with slate roofing, in a Gothic style widely used by the ES&A; Bank and Wardell. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, the archaeological assessment condition was assessed as partly disturbed. The site is level with George Street. The level of ground in vicinity of Nurses Walk has been lowered, as indicated by neighbouring level of sandstone bedrock, however a substantial archaeological resource may exist beneath the building to inform of past land uses. An underfloor deposit may remain. = Modifications and dates = *1890s/1910sfurther brick outbuildings of three stories added to the back. *stores and workshops added to the rear of the property, and a craft metal workshop commenced business. *1938The AIMPE had alterations made to the building, with Llewellyn E.

Lloyd the contractor (plaque inside the building). *1976SCRA demolished all outbuildings. *1979upon completion of the State Archives building, the Surgeons Court was established by SCRA, and the new porch and connecting stair date from that time.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the former English Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A; Bank) and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The former ES&A; Bank at 135 George Street has cultural significance for its aesthetic, historic, social and research potential values. It shows evidence of the significant human activities of commerce, land tenure and leisure, and is associated with several significant historical events, phases and persons including; early colonial settlement, 1880s boom economy, the bank crash of 1893, the outbreak of bubonic plague of 1900, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Green Bans movement of the 1960s/70s, and noted architect William Wardell. The primary significance of 135 George Street stems from it being designed by prominent architect William Wilkinson Wardell. It is the only known surviving example of a stone Gothic Revival bank building designed by Wardell in NSW. It is one of only three known bank buildings (Adelaide, Melbourne & Sydney) designed by Wardell in this style, of which only two survive. The Adelaide building was demolished. The building is significant as it demonstrates Wardell's individual interpretation of the Gothic Revival style at a time when eclecticism and historicist approach to design was prominent. It contains sufficient evidence to reconstruct the spatial qualities of the original banking chamber. *High Significance Fabric: Roofs (front section of building); east (front facade) Pyrmont yellowblock sandstone walls and brass sheathed timber entrance door; north/south party walls; north & west facades- walls and windows. *Medium Significance Fabric: East facade-metal frame stained windows; north/south party walls-dry pressed brickwork above original coping. *Low Significance Fabric: Contributory - Lower part of west archway-painted brickwork; remaining external walls-timber frame double hung windows & four panel timber door (rear); west stair-timber gothic style stair. The Rocks branch of the English Scottish and Australian Bank was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site shows evidence of significant human activities in commerce (banking) and land tenure (historical sub-division patterns and processes), because it is associated with four significant historical events or phases (early British colonisation and settlement to the mid 1810s, the first hospital in Australia 1788‚Äì1816, the Bubonic Plague outbreak of 1900, the Green Ban movement of the 1960s and 70s), and because it is associated with three significant persons (Surgeon Jamison, Governor Macquarie and William Wardell). The site is historically representative at the Local level because it has attributed typical of the particular philosophies and activities of colonial era \\"town planning\\" in Sydney. The building has historic significance because it shows evidence of significant human activities in commerce and leisure, is associated with five significant historical events (Australian financial boom , bank crash of 1893, bubonic plague outbreak of 1900, Great Depression of 1930s, urban redevelopment of 1960s/70s) and one significant person (William Wardell), and shows continuity of a historical process (the continuing adaptation of a built form to diverse uses in response to a changing social environment). It is historically representative at the Regional level because it has the principal characteristics of an important class of items (mid-Victorian bank branches, especially ES&A; branches around Sydney) and is outstanding because of its harbourside setting and small size. It is historically rare at the State level because it is a scarce example of the Venetian Gothic style, particularly for secular buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site is associated with several significant figures including Surgeon Jamison, Governor Macquarie, the building itself was designed by prominent architect William Wardell. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is aesthetically distinctive for its Gothic Revival style, has landmark qualities for its bold yet decorative design and harbourside location, and exemplifies the particular tastes, styles and technologies of colonial Gothic Revivalism.It is representative at the State level for its attributes typical of the rare venetian Gothic style, and is outstanding because of the integrity of its setting, condition of the front fa√ßade and size as a nineteenth century bank branch. The building in its current form is also representative of a 1930s fitout. It is rare at a State level because of its demonstration of the designs and techniques of the Gothic Revival style, and is a scarce surviving example of the small-scale Gothic Revival, secular commercial work of William Wardell. At the time of its design a bank in the Gothic Revival style broke with the tradition of classical bank design. Structure and spaces that remain from Wardell's design are of high significance as they demonstrate the intent of his design. There is potential to reveal the two storey space and original ceiling of the banking chamber space.Tropman, 1997. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks area, to which the building contributes, is held in high esteem by The Rocks community (as reflected by the green bans) and has special cultural, social, aesthetic and education values to state and national groups as indicated by the large numbers of visitors to the area. The building is identified with by those familiar with Wardell's work (as indicated by its listing with the NSW National Trust, the Heritage Council of NSW and the Register of the National Estate). It is rare because it is a scarce example of a small scale, Venetian Gothic style secular building. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is an important reference site and is of research significance because of its potential contribution to reveal information and understanding (though potential limited) about early European cultural history and use of the site. The building has much potential to reveal details of Wardell's design such as materials, methods and spatial relationships by investigation of the interior. The facade, basic form and safe demonstrate to the public its former use as a rare Gothic Revival style bank. There is potential to reinstate the spatial qualities of the banking chamber by removal of the concrete floor over the chamber. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is assessed as aesthetically rare statewide. This item is assessed as scientifically rare statewide. This item is assessed as socially rare regionally. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically representative regionally. This item is assessed as socially representative locally.

It was designed by Spain & Cosh Architects and built in 1914. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In its pristine state the site had a sharply angled rock wall snaking through it which prevented its early development. In 1834 it formed part of a land grant to Robert Campbell. It was then sold in 1848 to William Reilly. In 1872 it was partially levelled and then used intermittently as a store for timber, coal, leather goods or marble (either in sheds or open air) along with a series of small stables. Around 1900 the rough rock face was straightened and the present stone wall supporting Gloucester Street (now Gloucester Walk) was built. In 1907 the land was compulsorily resumed from the Eady Estate under the NSW Government resumption of The Rocks. The site remained disused until 1912, when a marble yard operated, until the construction of the Mercantile Hotel in 1914. The Mercantile Rowing Club Hotel had been built in 1878 at the George Street end of Gloucester Street, from the present Mercantile Hotel, which was directly related to the Mercantile Rowing Club boathouse nearby. The Club had to vacate its boathouse site in 1910, and the club re-formed itself as the Mosman Rowers Club relocating to Mosman Bay. James Dwyer, the licensee of the Mercantile Rowing Club Hotel since 1898, surrendered the licence in 1914 and moved to the newly completed Mercantile Hotel. The building of this hotel was part of the expansionism of the major brewing firm, Tooth and Co., whose architects were the well known Sydney firm of Spain and Cosh. The Mercantile Hotel at 25 George Street has continued its use as a hotel to the present day, with little change to its external fabric but with some ground floor rearrangement of the public spaces, and some updating of the accommodation of the upper floors. The shop at 27 George Street was conceived from the outset as separate premises, used on the ground floor variously as a light refreshment room, a mixed business and cafe. From 1963-1989 Marine Specimens Pty Ltd ran a Shell Shop, providing a library and reading area on the first floor from 1968 and a meeting place for the Malacological Society. In 1989 No. 27 was incorporated into the lease of the Mercantile Hotel, and the renovation in 1989-90 allowed the upper floor rooms to provide additional bedrooms for the hotel, and further work connected to the ground floor rooms of the shop and hotel in 1993.  Description  The three storey building, a restrained example of Federation Free Style, is of brick wall construction with timber floors and a malthoid roof. The simplicity of the hotel's overall form, materials and detailing is relieved only by the restrained modelling of the cornice, a little decoration in the roof-deck's iron balustrade and at street level, by the richly coloured glazed ceramic tile dado. A three-storey shop (No 27), originally completely self contained, with its own shopfront, attached kitchen and rear yard, is at the south end. Internally, the building has undergone some quite significant unsympathetic alterations, notably in the Bar and associated Lounge, and the shop has been more recently linked through to the hotel. The Hotel is located on the wedge shaped block that marks the junction of George Street with Gloucester Walk, and the building is L shaped with the shop having a wider footprint and with small rear yards. At the north end, the three storeys are reduced to two, and a pair of large old fig trees, low stone retaining walls and curved steps leading down from the Walk to the north forecourt add to the pleasing aspect of this key frontage. = Modifications and dates = Significant medications to the site include: * 1950sSecond bathroom installed on both hotel floors. * 1978The overall width of the awning reduced. * Original walls at west end of entry removed, walls of Parlour, Storeroom, adjacent stair and \\"Jug Dept\\"/Bottle-shop to the east were demolished, the original timber panelled bar was rearranged, original windows in the west wall were bricked up and areas of pressed metal ceilings where walls had been removed rearranged, bathrooms on the residential floors subdivided and updated. * Through link at first floor level from first floor of shop to hotel, changing use to provide additional hotel accommodation, and other less significant alterations to enable this change.Somerville, 1999 * Through link at ground level, connecting \\"shop\\" to hotel, further reducing the distinction of the separate \\"shop\\".

Heritage listing  The Mercantile Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and aesthetic cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Mercantile Hotel has local historical significance as one of the more intact survivors of late-19th and early-20th century Rocks pubs, having operated continuously since its opening in 1914 and retaining much of its original character, fabric and functions. It is the first major building to occupy this site, with its dramatic stone-walled excavation line along the west boundary providing a vivid reminder of the original physical character of both site and The Rocks as a whole. The Hotel has associations with the early maritime and mercantile activity in The Rocks through its location close to key early wharves and warehouses, its provision of public house services to local workers and their families and its origins as replacement for the original Mercantile Rowing Club Hotel following that building's demolition in 1914. The Hotel is an example of the early 20th century work of the once leading Sydney architectural practice of Spain and Cosh, providing a typical and relatively intact example of the work of this respected if conservative firm, and their public hotel work in particular. It also has associations with Tooth & Co. Ltd, one of NSW's important early brewing companies, and more generally with the practice of tied hotels under which the licensee operated until 1976. It is also a component of an important historic streetscape, particularly notable in views from the north towards its exposed wedge-shaped end. The Hotel's fabric retains the potential to provide information on the operation, layout, facilities and fitout of early 20th century public hotels. Its structure and finishes provide information on early 20th century building techniques, including the use of steel framing, finishes and detailing of flat roofs. The Mercantile Hotel adds to the historic, aesthetic and social richness of The Rocks Conservation Area which is of both local and national heritage significance. Its location, character and continuity of service make it recognisable in the local area. Mercantile Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Mercantile Hotel operates continuously in its original function since its opening in 1914 and retains much of its original character and fabric. The Hotel as an establishment has significant associations with the early maritime and mercantile activity in The Rocks and the harbour rowing regattas, as it replaced the earlier Mercantile Rowing Club Hotel. The existing building is one of the more intact survivors of The Rocks' late 19th and early 20th century Pubs, associated with one of NSW's most important brewing companies, Tooth & Co Ltd, and with the practice of tied hotels. The stone-walled excavation on the western boundary is a physical reminder of the original character of the site and The Rocks. The building meets this criterion on State Level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is a fine and intact example of the work of the renown Sydney architectural firm, Spain and Cosh. The former shop has had a part in the early 20th century commercial activity of The Rocks and has a special place in a science related activity through its longstanding use as The Shell Shop and as a meeting place of the Malacological Society. The building meets this criterion on local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Aesthetically, the building is an interesting example of Federation Free Style architecture, with its competently handled forms and massing enriched by the decorative detailing of its tiled dado, etched glass to the main doors, awning supports and parapet balustrade. The Mercantile Hotel is a relatively intact example of the early 20th century hotel designed by the Spain and Cosh for Tooth's brewers. Both the exterior and the interior retain important components of fabric and layout, allowing interpretation of the original spatial configuration. This makes the building an example of its type, style and architectural period. It is also an important component of an important historic streetscape that features in key views of The Rocks, particularly from the north towards its exposed wedge-shaped end. The building meets this criterion on State Level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hotel is of importance to its regular clientele as their local pub. Its location, character and continuity of service make it a recognisable meeting point in the local area. It has earlier associations with locals and returning visitors through the Shell Shop which occupied part of the building for 30 years, and through the Malacological Society which met upstairs. The use as a venue for Irish music has sought to establish a wider and more specific identity. The building meets this criterion on local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Hotel's fabric and layout, though somewhat modified, have the potential to provide information on early 20th century public hotels, including facilities and fitout. Its structure and finishes provide information on early 20th century building techniques, albeit the archaeological potential of the site is generally low. The building meets this criterion on local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building is representative of a class of purpose-built hotel, specifically the hotels built for in association with the Tooth's brewers in the Federation period. This representativeness, combined with the unique, prominent location, is considered to be of the level to meet this criterion on local level.

It was built from 1843 to 1844. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This site was in the original grounds of Sydney's first hospital complex and later was enclosed by fencing to become a part of the Surgeon General's residence. In June 1828, the allotment was part of a land grant made to Captain John Piper. =Ownership by Frederick Unwin= The Orient Hotel site was classified in the general surveys of the town undertaken in the 1830s, ostensibly to formalise land boundaries and entitlements, as Lot 1 of City Section 85. By the time of the survey the allotment was in the ownership of the merchant Frederick Wright Unwin. Unwin had acquired the property from Mary Reibey in November 1828. Reibey's interest in the property lasted a matter of five months, over which time its value had increased from in June 1828 to on its sale in November. Reibey's intentions had been more long term however for she proposed to erect three houses along the George Street frontage. Owing to a problem with the land title (it not been issued and the extent of the George Street frontage was in dispute) Reibey evidently decided not to proceed further. Unwin retained ownership over the boom years of the 1830s, only selling when the inevitable crash came in the early 1840s with total debts mounting to . Unwin was a solicitor and had come to the colony in 1827. Over the 1820s and 1830s he invested heavily in property in both the town and country. The George Street property was one of his earliest investments. Unwin's purchase in 1828 was inclusive of a stone building in the course of construction. Then construction of this building had in fact commenced during Piper's ownership and was described as \\"a building of great extent and expense\\". It was reported in the Sydney Gazette in 1826 that Piper had engaged 30‚Äì40 mechanics (carpenters, stonemasons, etc.) in its construction. It seems unlikely that this building was on the Orient Hotel site, and the exact use of the site during Unwin's ownership is not known. It would seem the building on the site may have been required to be demolished for the widening of George Street for which Unwin was compensated . Prior to the sale of the property in 1841, Unwin subdivided the land to form a number of allotments of which Lots 1 and 2 are historically associated with the Orient Hotel site. =Ownership by James Chapman and family= The pair of allotments were bought by the carcass butcher James Chapman in February 1842 for . It was Chapman who erected, probably in 1842, a three-storey residence of ten rooms and a neighbouring single storey shop, which were the first stage of what evolved over the nineteenth century into the Orient Hotel. The residence was one of the most valuable on George Street North on its completion and fitted, according to the council assessor, with every convenience on its first entry in the rate book for Gipps Ward in 1845. Chapman by the 1840s had arguably some standing in the local community for he was a foundation councillor of the City Corporation (Council) in its first term of 1842-1845; he represented Gipps Ward that took in The Rocks. His business was evidently quite extensive in maintaining slaughter yards at Blackwattle Bay and was a large cattle buyer at Smithfield market. Over the mid 1840s Chapman had developed his land holding on George Street to benefit his business with the 1848 rate assessment noting the rear yard area with a brick stable and wooden shed. Chapman died in 1856 but for some years after his estate was contested by the property developer Andrew Hardie McCulloch. Henry Milford was subsequently appointed by the Supreme Court in June 1858 as trustee of Chapman' estate. Conversion to a licensed premises The Chapman family continued to own the property until his estate was settled in 1858. The shop at 87 George Street was retained by James' widow, Esther, but the family residence at 89 George Street was sold to James Kelly in April 1859; the purchase price was (inclusive of other neighbouring properties). By this time the building had been converted to licensed premises trading under the sign of the Marine Hotel since 1853 under the management of the following licensees: * 1853William Chapman * 1854Richard Chapman * 1856Samuel Miller * 1858James G. Chapman or Christopher Chapman The impetus for Chapman's move into the licensed hotel trade undoubtedly was associated with the discovery of gold and the wealth generated in the southern and western goldfields of NSW. In the gold rush decades of the 1850s and 1860s, businesses in the City readily met the demands for accommodation and other services and goods generated by the influx of gold seeking migrants. The association between The Rocks and the sea and seafarers is also clearly demonstrated in the name of the hotel. This association is also demonstrated in the establishment of the Sydney Sailors' Home in 1865 and the Bethel Chapel (Mariners' Church) in 1859, both fronting George Street and near the Orient Hotel. =Ownership by James Kelly= While James Kelly continued to own the hotel until 1876 the hotel was managed by a succession of publicans, inclusive of: * 1860Henry S. Green * 1859, 1861 - 1867William Jonathan Green * 1868Vacant * 1869 - 1871Catherine Brown * 1873Samuel Reeve * 1875-1876Mrs Delia Reeve =Ownership by Gustave Buckham= Kelly sold the hotel to Gustave Buckham in March 1876 for . Buckham then renamed it Buckham's Hotel. Buckham evidently arranged for alterations to the hotel increasing the number of rooms to 21 from the 10 under Kelly's ownership. As with the previous ownership, Buckham managed the hotel through a succession of publicans. This practice resulted in the frequent renaming of the hotel, evidently to entice trade on the good reputation of the publican. Over 1877-79 it was known as Buckham's, and then May's Family Hotel under publican James H. May until 1881, Pries' Family Hotel between 1882-1883, and Brown's Family Hotel under Peter Brown. These publicans had long standing associations with Sydney's hotel trade. John H. P. Pries for example had started in the trade at the now demolished Woolpack Inn in Haymarket. He then opened the Pries' Family Hotel and afterwards moved back to southern end of the town to manage the Golden Gate on Brickfield Hill. In 1885 the hotel was renamed the Orient under the new licensee Walter McCombie. The name change reflects the broader changes occurring in the wharf area relating to the development of Campbell's Wharf, which had been sold in 1876 to the Australasian Steam Navigation Company. (ASN Co.). The ASN Co. rebuilt the wharf and moved its operations from Darling Harbour and also it to international shipping companies. From 1877 the steamers of the Orient Steam Navigation Line berthed here, hence, evidently, the name of the hotel. The licensees after McCombie were: * 1886-1887John Hennessy * 1888-1893Peter Brown (the same Peter Brown as above) * 1894Arthur H. Lack * 1895D.

West * 1920-1921Michael Ryan =Ownership and use of 87 George Street= The residential nature of The Rocks area is demonstrated at the Orient Hotel site in the shop/store (now removed) at 87 George Street. The Chapmans retained this property until November 1861 when the trustee for the late James Chapman sold it to Thomas Andrew Drysdale of Melbourne for . Drysdale retained ownership until the resumption in 1900. Over this period the premises housed a diverse range of uses that in many instances used the rear yard area to undertake light manufacturing. The uses were inclusive of the following: * 1858James Chapman, butcher * 1861E.

Initially the commercial licensed operation continued under the management of the publicans listed above. Around 1920 Resch's Limited entered into a head-lease with the Housing Board over the property. Associated with the coming of Resch's was the completion in 1922 of major additions to the hotel. This work was undertaken for the Housing Board, William Henry Foggitt being its architect at the time. This was the first of a number of alterations undertaken over the following years in 1929, in 1940 and 1961. The role of the hotel in this era continued as both licensed premises and as a place of accommodation. In 1930 the head lease was acquired by Tooth and Co. and then in 1948 it was taken on by British Breweries Pty Ltd. Over this period and up to the 1970s the licensees were held by: * 1922-1934Frances Cooper * 1935-1942J. Rohan * 1942G. E. Edworthy * 1943-1945A. Walker * 1945(Mrs) A. N. Carey * 1945P. J.

Hutchings =Resumption by the NSW Government= While The Rocks was administered parsimoniously by the government, the potential of West Circular Quay for international shipping and for its administration headquarters was actively pursued. In the decades following the World War II the Maritime Services Board built a new international passenger terminal in 1961 and new administrative offices in the mid 1950s. Coincidental with the shipping terminal development was a change in the management of the Orient Hotel with the head-lease being taken on by Miller's Brewery Pty. Ltd. in 1960. Miller's were formerly British Breweries Ltd. with the new company being founded by Robert W. Miller around 1951. Over the 1950s and 1960s the brewery provided serious competition to Tooths and Tooheys who traditionally dominated the Sydney market. Their former brewery still stands atop Taverners Hill on the Parramatta Road at Petersham. Miller's ownership would seem to have had only a marginal impact on the building with only the bar area being altered in 1961. Since the mid 1970s the Orient Hotel has undergone numerous changes to enhance the popularity of the hotel to the broader public. The changes were overseen by the government authorities of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority(SCRA), Sydney Cove Authority (SCA) and its successor the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA). The SCRA was established by the Robert Askin-led Liberal Coalition government in 1968 and came into being in January 1970. Its origins date to the mid 1960s and the instigation of concept plans (the Wallace (1964) and Overall (1967) Schemes) for the redevelopment of The Rocks to provide high- rise office and residential blocks. The new Authority was given most of the state-owned property in The Rocks, with a charter to restore, renovate and redevelop the area. Public disquiet about the future direction of The Rocks under SCRA erupted in 1973 in organised community protests supported by the NSW Branch of the Builders Labourers' Federation. By 1975, SCRA's planning outlook had evolved to take into consideration cultural, social and historical values, but large scale developments continued. The Orient Hotel with its corner location and historic street presentation has contributed to the public's association of The Rocks with a unique historic neighbourhood. Around 1976, a company named Rocks Hotels Pty Ltd. took on the management of the hotel and in 1979 extensive alterations valued at $120,000 were completed to provide street facades approximating its nineteenth-century appearance and undertake alterations to the basement, ground and first floors. The architects were Colin Graham and Partners Pty Ltd. There were other changes over the 1980s as follows: * 1980Renewal of veranda and stairway * 1981Reconstruction of the street paving lightwells * 1983Removal of an internal wall * 1984Relocation of entry doors and alterations to the bar Another major change came in 1988, the bicentennial year, again for Rocks Hotels Pty Ltd. This work, valued at $1,500,000, was designed by architects Howard Tanner and Associates Pty Ltd.  Description  The hotel follows the typical late Colonial Georgian mould of corner siting, a curved corner facade with plain parapeted walls, smaller windows on the top floor than lower floors, and glazed in a twelve pane pattern. The building is constructed of stuccoed brick walls, timber floors, roof and joinery, it retained this form until 1920 when a three bayed western addition was built and in 1930 a single bay to the north was added together with awnings and wall tiling.Collingridge & Sheedy 1976 = Modifications and dates = * 1848: Addition of brick stable with two-roomed loft and open wooden shed; 1864-78 - external walls faced with cement render; * 1922: Major extensions (Argyle Street) over site of stable, shed, courtyard (minor changes to original premises); * 1930: Shop/sheds demolished; 1930s: Additions on George Street shop site; 1840s: Ground floor altered with enlarged bar, externally modified; * 1978: Extensive renovations, interior/exterior restored to original elevation as far as practical, doors/windows restored to original width; * 1981: Awning removed; * 1988: Internal alterations removed much original fabric.SCRA 1979: KL/01  Heritage listing  The Orient Hotel is a place of cultural significance at a state level for its historical importance, its scientific potential and its rarity. It is a place of cultural significance at a local level for its aesthetic qualities, social associations and its representative values. The Orient Hotel is one of the oldest surviving hotels in the city. It commenced operations as the Marine Hotel and has traded through to the present day. Originally built as a residence , the building was converted to licensed premises, a relatively common practice during the first half of the 19th century. It has since been modified and added to in response to changes in laws, social and commercial pressures, but retains its external form and Georgian character. The building also retains early fabric elements, which are rare and able to demonstrate Colonial construction. The building's remnant form and layout has high research potential in determining patterns of use as a residence and hotel in the Georgian period. The site may also have potential archaeological value as the location of the former convict hospital. The building is part of the Colonial context of commercial, residential and industrial infrastructure that developed around the wharf as an early port facility in Sydney. The surrounding context contains many Georgian and early Victorian buildings, forming an important early streetscape, of which the Orient Hotel is an intrinsic part as a prominent corner site. This Georgian character has been emphasised by reconstruction work that illustrates the conservation ethos of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. The Orient Hotel is a good example of a Colonial Georgian hotel that has later sympathetic layers of Federation Georgian detailing. It retains its visual relationship to and from surrounding historic properties. Significant views and vistas are maintained to and from George Street, Argyle Street and Circular Quay. Orient Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Orient Hotel is significant as one of the oldest surviving working licensed hotels in the city that continues to trade. The hotel commenced operations in 1851 as the Marine Hotel (later the Orient Hotel). The building demonstrates the conversion of a residence into licensed premises during the first half of the 19th century, a relatively common practice. The Orient Hotel has an historic association with the former docklands and is part of the context of development demonstrating early residential and commercial infrastructure patterns related to the port. The Orient Hotel provides evidence of the changing function of hotels from the mid-19th century to the present day. The alterations to the fabric of the building that have removed parlours, accommodation facilities, amongst other changes, demonstrate changing patterns of licensing laws and social attitudes. The hotel now provides community based activity based on the gentrification and tourist function of The Rocks area. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at State Level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Orient Hotel is significant for its associations with Mary Reiby and Frederick Wright Unwin who constructed the adjacent Unwin's Stores. It is also associated with James Chapman who built the original shop and residence on the site, and Tooth & Co. a major brewer and lessee of hotels throughout NSW in the 19th and early 20th century. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Orient Hotel is significant as a fine example of a Colonial Georgian hotel located on a prominent corner site. Although many of the original features have been lost the external form, scale and Georgian character remain intact. The building retains examples of Colonial craftsmanship that are now rare. It has been modified sympathetically, but much of the significant interior has been lost. It occupies an important townscape location situated between the Argyle Bond Stores, Cadman's Cottage and as part of the context of Georgian buildings in George Street. It is an important corner element within the historically significant streetscape of George and Argyle Streets which has now been presented as a Colonial streetscape and a popular tourist destination. The architectural form of the original 1840s building is an important surviving example of a once prevalent architectural expression on street corners in the area. The hotel is an example of the utilisation of prominent corner sites for hotel premises in The Rocks in the 19th century. The setting of the Orient Hotel within the historic landscape of The Rocks represents the practices of 19th-century hotel design in Australia retaining its Colonial character within a high-density precinct. It retains visual relationships to and from surrounding historic properties. Its prominent corner location retains significant views and vistas to and from George Street, Argyle Street and Circular Quay. The Orient Hotel is part of a collection of buildings in The Rocks that form part of a group of places of very high aesthetic value. It is part of a group that meets this criterion at State level. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at Local Level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Orient Hotel is significant as a major social venue in the area for over 150 years forming part of a network of hotels along George Street and the greater area of The Rocks. It has continuously provided a social and recreational venue since the 1850s and accommodation until 1976 reflecting the evolving social character of the area during the 19th and early 20th century. The Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority was created to restore a large portion of The Rocks development area under a series of guidelines designed to maintain and enhance the perceived 19th-century character of the area. The partial reconstruction of the hotel to an earlier known state during the 1970s reflects the Authority's scheme. The hotel represents the State Government's recognition of heritage significant places and heritage values. It represents the conservation practices of the time which sought to return historically significant buildings to their original condition and eradicate gradual and significant additions which were not contemporary with the building style intended, in this case late-Georgian. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Orient hotel has a layering of periods of construction and architectural styles that demonstrates past approaches to design and detailing. Its siting and setting also demonstrates 19th-century urban principles. The building layout of the hotel has the ability to demonstrate past commercial and hotel practices. Documentary evidence indicates archaeological potential on the property potentially providing insights into past occupation and use particularly associated with the Convict Hospital and later as a working yard for the residence and shop. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at State Level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Orient Hotel is significant as one of the rare early surviving hotels in the state still in operation from the 1850s. The building retains fabric elements from this period that now offer a rare insight into Colonial design, construction and stylistic features. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at State Level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Orient Hotel forms part of a network of early hotel in The Rocks/Millers Point area. The hotel represents a pattern of historic uses of commercial and hotel operations that was a key character/element of the district. The Orient Hotel meets this criterion at local level.

He promoted democratic decentralization, and supported the establishment of various non-governmental organizations. He chaired the Democracy Development Committee, which led to the drafting of the 1997 constitution, and successfully pushed for its adoption.

The numbers of children's book authors have shown a similar lack of diversity. Diversity is considered beneficial since it encourages children of diverse backgrounds to read and it teaches children of all backgrounds an accurate view of the world around them. In the mid-2010s, more attention was drawn to this problem from various quarters. In the several years following, diversity numbers seem to have improved: One survey showed that in 2017, a quarter of children's books were about minority protagonists, almost a 10% increase from 2016.  History of diversity in YA  One of the foundational elements of young adult literature is its representation of diverse ideas. Looking at The New York Times bestseller list for young adults in the late 2010s demonstrates the selling power of diverse narratives. This dedication to and emphasis on diversity is a fairly recent concept. = Pre-1980s era young adult = For a large portion of history, young adult fiction focused on cisgender, heterosexual, able- bodied characters and authors. In the 1920s and 1930s, \\"diverse\\" children's stories emphasized stereotypical characteristics of people of color. The 1940s sparked a change in the conversation surrounding black narratives. Those in black communities began demanding the publishing of books that actually depicted their lives. In 1965, Nancy Larrick published the article \\"The All- White World of Children's Publishing\\", which analyzed the literature and found that only 6.4% of the more than 5,000 books published for children between 1962‚Äì1964 featured children of color. A year later, the Council on Interracial Books for Children, which demanded that more books be published by people of color, was created. Diversity in the pre-1980s era was not limited only to racial diversity. In 1969, John Donovan published I'll Get There. It Better be Worth the Trip, which was the first young adult novel to feature a gay teen.APA: In 1979, Rosa Guy published Ruby, which became the first young adult novel featuring a lesbian woman of color. = 1980s to new millennium = The 1980s brought a greater awareness to the need for diverse youth literature. The population in the United States of America became much more diverse: the Hispanic population more than doubled and the population of races other than white or black increased exponentially. The publishing industry took notice of demographic changes and became more vocal about representation. In 1985, the Cooperative Children's Book Center (CCBC) began to track the percentage of books written by African American authors. That year, they reported that African Americans authored less than 1% of all children's books. In 1994, the organization began to track the number of Asian and Pacific Islander, Native and Latino authors as well. In their report, the CCBC found that, collectively, authors of color published about 9% of all books directed towards children and young adults. By the end of the millennium, that percentage dropped to 6.3%. = 2000s to present = The genre of young adult bloomed in the 2000s. In the late 1990s, only 3,000 young adult books were published annually. By 2010, that number increased to 30,000. While the number of diverse books has increased, the numbers are not reflective of the United States demographic breakdown. The statistics gathered by the CCBC and various other independent researchers show that the market does not reflect the diversity of the U.S. In 2013, less than 9% of best-selling novels featured characters with disabilities. In 2014 and 2015, found that 85% of all children's and young adult books feature white characters. This statistic has remained fairly stagnant since the 1960s. In 2017, a 20-year analysis of National Book Award winners between 1996‚Äì2015 found that only 5 of the novels were written by non-white authors. In 2014, spurred by an all-white, all-male discussion at the 2014 BookCon festival, young adult author Ellen Oh created the Twitter hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks to protest the lack of diversity in young adult and children's literature. This movement developed into the nonprofit organization We Need Diverse Books (WNDB). WNDB's goal is to increase the representation of diverse communities within the world of children's books. This movement changed the conversation surrounding diversity in YA and has influenced the number of diverse options on the market today. In 2017, a quarter of children's novels were about minority protagonists, almost a 10% increase from 2016. In the UK 90% of the best-selling YA titles from 2006 to 2016 featured white, able-bodied, cis-gendered, and heterosexual main characters The numbers of children's book authors have shown a similar lack of diversity in the USA . And in the UK fewer than 9% of children's books creators were people of colour. Between 2006-2016, eight percent of all young adult authors published in the UK were people of colour.  Importance of diversity  The mission of WNDB is to change the publishing industry so it features diverse characters and \\"reflects the lives\\" of young people. This is part of the reason why diversity and inclusivity is so important in YA. One of the largest arguments for diversity is that it encourages self-reflection among readers. This self-reflection creates a sense of comfort. People like to see themselves and identify with the stories they read. This is not possible when 85% of children's and young adult books feature white characters. By featuring multicultural characters experiencing real-life problems, readers can see that they are not alone. On the other hand, if diverse experiences are not visible, it further alienates disadvantaged minorities. When a reader identifies with a minority or disadvantaged population, seeing characters that resembles their experiences can be empowering. Diverse literature can also be a catalyst for acceptance. Portraying and reading about characters that are different from the reader helps to reduce stereotypes. These narratives alleviate the \\"otherness\\" and make the different seem less strange. Studies have found that reading about people from different cultures increases empathy. This is especially true in fantasy and science-fiction novels because readers are already immersed in a \\"different world\\". Being surrounded by diverse characters and cultures builds a \\"tolerance for and appreciation of\\" those cultures which helps to eliminate prejudice. With the increasingly diverse population and more diverse public schools, young adults constantly interact with people that are different than them.  #ownvoices  Walter Dean Myers speaks at the Powell Branch of the Kalamazoo Public Library, August 2013 The \\"#ownvoices\\" movement, which has spread beyond young adult, promotes books about diverse characters written by authors from the same diverse identity. It originated in September 2015 when author Corinne Duyvis created the Twitter hashtag #ownvoices. Duyvis is a young-adult author who specializes in science-fiction and fantasy; she is also the co-founder and senior editor of the website Disability in Kidlit. Proponents of this movement argue that it is not enough to just have diverse characters. There needs to be someone propelling these stories along within the community. It increases the authenticity and power of the story being told. There has been evidence in the past of minority voices being misrepresented, and stereotyped, so own voice authors can combat this In recent years, more authors of color are publishing novels, but the numbers do not indicate significant changes in the amount of \\"own voices\\" novels. This is not a new concept. In 1986, Walter Dean Myers published I Actually Thought We Would Revolutionize the Industry, an article in The New York Times detailing how few black narratives were determined by black authors. In 1998, Jacqueline Woodson published Who Can Tell My Story in the Horn Book Magazine posing the same questions. In the article, Woodson said, \\"I realized that no one but me can tell my story.\\"  White-washing of book covers  Ursula Le Guin signing a book in 2013 Publishing companies commonly distort the perception of diversity on book covers to conform to traditional standards based on the assumption that book covers with diverse character representations are less marketable than those with white, heterosexual, and able-bodied models, resulting in a white-washing effect. Typically either a white model represents a character of color or the character's image is distorted beyond complete recognition. Ursula Le Guin was a champion for dispelling the \\"white sells\\" phenomenon. At the 2004 BookExpo America convention, she specifically criticized this practice, saying, > \\"Please consider that 'what sells' or 'doesn't sell' can be a self- > fulfilling prophecy. If black kids, Hispanics, Indians both Eastern and > Western don't buy fantasy ‚Äì which they mostly don't ‚Äì could it be because > they never see themselves on the cover?\\" A high profile instance of white-washing in YA was Justine Larbalestier's 2009 novel Liar. In the novel, the protagonist is described as an African American, but the advance reading copy (ARC) featured a white cover model. The publisher remedied this after Larbalestier complained.

This timeline highlights significant developments in Queensland policing.  1860s  The uniform worn by Queensland police officers after separation in 1859 was a dark blue jacket and top with a forage cap, supplied by the New South Wales police. = 1864 = The Queensland Police Force was established by the Queensland Government on 1 January 1864 with strength of 287 officers serving a population of 61,467. David Thompson Seymour appointed as Acting Commissioner and later as Commissioner. Transport in the settled areas was mainly by foot and in the unsettled areas by horse. The hulk Margaret Eliza was purchased for ¬£3000. It was refitted and renamed the Proserpine. She was used as a floating water police office, prison, and later as a reformatory school. Correspondence with the Police Commissioner or between stations was by handwritten letter, moved by horse or Cobb and Co stagecoach, or by telegram. Finding that no written instructions had ever been issued for the guidance of the police, Commissioner Seymour issues \\"Rules for the General Government and Discipline of members of the Police Force of Queensland\\" based upon the Victorian police model. On 1 December, the Detective Office was created with Sub-Inspector George Elliott in charge. At December 1864, in the first year of operation of the Queensland Police Force, there were 27 ordinary police stations with 151 foot and mounted officers, and 16 native police camps of 136 European officers and indigenous troopers. Twenty of the 'ordinary police force' stations averaged four officers each, the bigger stations like Brisbane, Ipswich, Rockhampton and Maryborough had larger staff numbers. Native police camps averaged between 7 and 17 men, large camps like Rockhampton could have up to 27 men of both officers and troopers. = 1865 = Police Commissioner David Seymour described the lack of accommodation for police: \\"Many men are compelled to live in lodgings, and in the country districts constables live in public-houses some distance from the lock-up at times making them unavailable for sudden emergencies\\". Police Commissioner Seymour focussed on the crime of bushranging and took active measures to hasten the capture of these criminals through the purchase of fresh police horses and the construction of securely fenced paddocks at every police station. Water police were stationed on board the hulk Proserpine at the mouth of the Brisbane River. Revolvers were supplied to every police station and 50 breech-loading carbines were delivered to the Department. = 1866 = The Bread or Blood riot started, threatening the sacking of Government House in Brisbane. Hundreds of government officials were sworn in as special constables to assist police. The first uniform consisted of a Garibaldi jacket of dark blue, serge wool cloth, red facings, and shoulder knot; trousers of the same material, with red cord, and a high cap with French peak. = 1867 = Police at Petrie Terrace, 1867 On 6 November 1867 Constable Patrick William Cahill and Constable John Francis Power were poisoned and shot in the head at the MacKenzie River Crossing while escorting a consignment of bank notes and bullion from Rockhampton to Clermont. The first major test for the Detective Office was to solve their murders. Police Commissioner Seymour stated that \\"men at all stations are, when practicable, to be drilled once a week\\". = 1869 = The publication of \\"Rules for the General Government and Discipline of members of the Police Force of Queensland\\" was approved, printed and distributed. Each constable required one pair of handcuffs as part of his equipment allotment.  1870s  Navy blue helmets were introduced and proved to be a very hot choice of headwear; they were phased out in favour of white helmets in 1896. = 1870 = A police barracks was established in George Street, Brisbane, on the site of the old convict hospital. Changes to rank insignia were implemented which among other things meant that an acting sergeant would be called a senior constable. = 1872 = A general order was issued that the Chinese had as much right on the gold fields as Europeans, so long as they had a miners' permit. If a collision resulted in a riot which the police could not quell, they were to note the ring-leaders and apprehend them. = 1873 = Sub-Inspector Robert Johnstone, officer in charge of native police, accompanied explorer George Dalrymple on the north-east coast expedition to explore the coastal lands as far as Cooktown. A contingent of Queensland Police Trackers were sent to Victoria to help in the hunt for the Kelly Gang in 1879. The Trackers along with Queensland and Victorian police officers pose in Benalla Police Paddock. Back Row L-R: Senior Constable Tom King (Standing); Troopers Jimmy, Hero and Barney and Victorian Police Superintendent J. Sadlier. Front Row L-R: Queensland Sub-Inspector Stanhope O‚ÄôConnor, Troopers Johnny and Jack and Victoria Police Commissioner, Captain Frederick Charles Standish (hands in pockets) = 1875 = The bulk of the Queensland Police force moved from the Brisbane CBD to Victoria Barracks and occupies the army buildings on site. Three movable houses and twelve large frame-tents were built in Brisbane and shipped to the Palmer River gold-field. They were quickly erected by two constables and could house six officers. = 1876 = The Police Manual instructed constables on beat duty to \\"possess such knowledge of the inhabitants of each house as to enable them to recognise their persons; and thus prevent mistakes, and be enabled to render assistance, when called upon, to the inhabitants\\". \\"Instructions for the Guidance of the Police\\" were published and a system of competitive examination for promotion was introduced, intended to increase police efficiency. Constable Daniel Fitzgibbon and his wife relax on the verandah of the Laura Police residence, 1906 = 1877 = Laura Police Station opened in 1877 with Sub-Inspector 1/c Hervey Fitzgerald in charge. As at 2019, it was still a single officer station today and was staffed by a senior constable. = 1879 = Roma Street Police Barracks were built and provided accommodation for about forty-five men, room for an Officer-in-Charge and two cells. A contingent of trackers was sent to Victoria to assist in the hunt for the Kelly Gang.  1880s = 1880 = At Birdsville, locally-available cane grass was used on police station walls for its insulation properties and longevity. Native Police camp accommodation was constructed using a variety of materials, such as saplings, logs, bark, canvas and shingles. = 1881 = On 24 January Sub-Inspector George Dyas was found buried after being killed by being speared in the back by Aboriginals while he camped near the 40 Mile Waterhole near Normanton. On 24 September Sub- Inspector Henry Kaye died from being speared through the chest by Aboriginals at Woolgar gold fields ( north of Richmond). = 1882 = Sub-Inspector 1/c Alexander Douglas was sent to Herberton and with four troopers, two old gold diggers and five Chinese men; he blazed a trail from Herberton to Mourilyan. The party travelled without rations and in continuous rain for twenty days, living mainly on roots. Martini-Henry rifles were purchased to replace the Snider previously used. = 1883 = The Petrie Terrace Gaol area was taken over by the Queensland Police and became known as the Petrie Terrace Police Depot where prospective police officers were trained. On 24 January Cadet Sub- Inspector Mark Beresford died after being speared in the thigh and hit on the head by Aboriginals in the Selwyn Ranges to the south of Cloncurry. On 26 January Constable William Dwyer was struck on the head by a tomahawk and killed by an Aboriginal near Juandah Station via Taroom. = 1884 = Cap badges consisting of a separate district letter and number were issued and remained in use until 1906.

These marked the beginning of a period of tension in the two communities. The first riot took place over the blurred depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and his appearance in a public print by a Parsi newspaper, Chitra Gyan Darpan, in October 1851. A second riot place on May 1857,over a Parsi named Bejonji Sheriaiji Bharucha was accused of disrespecting a mosque by some Muslims. A third riot took place on 13 February 1874, over an article on the life of Muhammad in a book entitled Famous Prophets and Communities.  History = 1851 = The first Parsi‚ÄìMuslim riot began on 17 October 1851 and lasted for a month, after a copy of a Gujarati article depicted Muhammad. The article, published by Parsi newspaper Chitra Gyan Darpan, was posted on the wall of the Jama Masjid in Bombay. People leaving the mosque after Namaz (around 11 a.m.) saw it and were enraged, as Islam forbids the pictorial depiction of Muhammad. Due to the printer, an image of Muhammad was published with a blemish over one of his eyes, making him look blinded in that eye. Parsis were attacked by the mob on the streets and in their homes. Shops were looted, Zoroastrian fire temples were ransacked and jewellery was stolen. The kotwal tried stopping the riots but failed to do so. The police were unable to stop the violence. A curfew was declared and the army was posted in various parts of the city. One month later, a meeting was held on 24 November 1851 between members of both communities where Cursetji clarified that it was not the intention to hurt Muslim feelings by depicting their prophet. He explained that it was just a piece of information about Muhammad, like all other remarkable personalities that the newspaper was used to publishing. He mentioned that the controversial work was copied from Simon Ockley. To demonstrate goodwill and friendship and to show that the two communities can peacefully coexist, Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy and the Kazi of Bombay rode together, sharing the same carriage through Muslim and Parsi neighbourhoods. = 1857  1874 = On 15 June 1873, Rustomjee Hormusjee Jalbhoy published a book in Gujarati that contained biographies of eminent personalities, including Muhammad. The tension was already building up when an article from The Memorial quoted: Sir Frank Henry Souter, the Commissioner of Police at that time, knew about the tensions, but failed to escalate police presence. The mob, practically unopposed, started attacking Parsis in their homes and on the streets. The next day, riots again erupted at Khetwadi. The following day, some Parsis began throwing stones at a Muslim funeral procession heading towards a cemetery. Four Parsis and seven Muslims were admitted to Jamsetjee Hospital, where several other injured were also treated. Narayan Wassoodew and Dr. Blaney took the initiative to launch a Parsi and Muslim community \\"Reconciliation Movement\\". The Parsis demanded \\"sincere regret at the conduct of the lower classes of their co-religionists\\" from the Muslims, but the movement failed. This was due to the fact that the Muslims had failed to submit to the Parsi leaders an authenticated copy of the resolution, despite the Parsis' insistence on it. = 1885 = There was another riot between Parsis and Muslims on 26 November 1885 when a land to build Dargah was not granted by the authorities. As there were Parsi members in the Municipal Council, they were accused for not granting.

Built by a Mughal governor of Narnaul, the structure currently serves as a tourist attraction.  Description  The Jal Mahal was built in 1591 AD by Shah Quli Khan, a member of the nobility of the Mughal empire and the governor of Narnaul. Khan was a protegee of Bairam Khan, an important official in the Mughal court and one- time regent of the empire.Alexander Mikaberidze, (2011). Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World a Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio; p. 707. . He was also a successful military commander who served in the Mughal army under Akbar the Great. The campaigns of Akbar to conquer northern India made Khan wealthy, and the commander distinguished himself by wounding the Suri general Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat. In gratitude for Khan's service, Akbar granted him titles, wealth, and appointed him as the governor of Narnaul. In addition to being a competent military leader, Khan was a noted architectural patron. Upon being appointed governor, he began a series of construction projects in Narnaul; these projects, the first of which was a tomb (built 1574-75) for himself, are described as being of a \\"personal sort\\" and as being different from some of his projects elsewhere in India; furthermore, Khan's projects were noteworthy enough to be recorded in contemporary Mughal texts. 15 years after completing his tomb, Khan began to construct a new palace in Narnaul; this structure became what is now the Jal Mahal. Khan began by creating a square artificial lake (often described as a tank or reservoir) with an island in the center; this lake was intended to form a \\"second Kausar\\" (the Pond of Abundance in Muslim paradise) for the palace's occupants. Khan then ordered the construction of a fortified gateway on the northern edge of the lake. Following this, a causeway was built out into the center of the reservoir, where a foundation was laid and a palace built. The construction of the Jal Mahal, its gate, and the lake took 2-3 years. The palace itself was decorated in the style of other Mughal palaces and pavilions; the structure was adorned with art and carvings, including inscriptions that celebrated Khan's famous victory over Hemu. In terms of area, the compound encompasses 11 acres. In the centuries after its completion, the palace's pool gradually filled with earth. This debris was cleared in the late 20th century and the lake restored.

The hoard weighed 14 kilograms , contained \\"bent bars\\" as well as round coins \\"of a new type\\" as those discovered in the Kabul hoard. The hoard contained a tetradrachm minted in Athens circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, or possibly as early as 520 BCE, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots. The Athens coin is the earliest known example of its type to be found so far to the east.\\"A Truly International Currency\\", Triton XV, Lot: 1163, ATTICA, Athens, CNG Coins This hoard exists in the context of the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. It can also be related to another famous hoard in the region, the Kabul hoard. The hoard also contained short \\"punch-marked\\" bent bars, also found in the Kabul hoard, and attributed by Bopearachchi to the Paropamisadae. They are of Achaemenid weight standard, weighing either 1 Siglos (5.5g) or 2 Sigloi (11g), and measuring between 25 mm to 30 mm long. These are different from the punch-marked bent bars found in Taxila, which are significantly longer (35 and 55 mm). The hoard also contained round \\"punch- marked\\" coins, the punch mark consisting in a geometrical motif made of a central circle with line around. Virgin flans were also present in the hoard as well as silver ingots (about 400g each, corresponding to the manufacture by melting about 72 Achaemenid sigloi) used for the manufacture of coins. The composition of the ingots has been shown to be strictly identical to the composition of the local coinage (but different from the composition of standard royal Achaemenid sigloi). This shows that coins were being manufactured in Pushkalavati by the 5th century BCE, and that the metallurgical techniques involved in coin minting were readily available in the Indian Satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire at that time, well before the arrival of Alexander the Great.

The film tells the story of a single mother (Tammy Blanchard) and her young daughter (Onata Aprile) held hostage at an isolated farmhouse by two men (Guillermo D√≠az and Dwight Henry) sent by the grandson (David Spade) of an old family business rival to coerce them into giving up valuable water rights. The film premiered at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills, California on September 6, 2018, and was released both theatrically and on VOD on September 14, 2018.  Plot  Single mother Audrey (Tammy Blanchard) and her young daughter Cheyenne (Onata Aprile) attend the funeral of Audrey's grandfather. Struggling to make ends meet as a waitress, Audrey considers moving into her grandfather's old farmhouse if it is left to her in his will. Meanwhile, Bobby (David Spade), the principal of a powerful water company, unaware Audrey's grandfather has died, hires Rainy (Guillermo D√≠az) and Jawari (Dwight Henry) to intimidate him into signing over the valuable water rights to a large creek on his property. Bobby tries to assure his grandfather Calvin (Bruce Dern) that he is capable of running the family business, but Calvin degrades him. Sickly and nearing the end of his life, Calvin has lost interest in business affairs, instead spending his remaining moments reminiscing about his past struggles and pondering regrets. At the farmhouse, Rainy and Jawari confront Audrey and Cheyenne, who are merely visiting in anticipation of possible future ownership. Unsure what to do, Rainy and Jawari decide to hold them hostage until Bobby arrives with legal documents to transfer ownership of the water rights. While Jawari is an amiable local drug dealer, Rainy exhibits sadistic tendencies, incessantly provoking reactions from Audrey, Cheyenne, and even Jawari. At first Audrey goes along, hoping she and Cheyenne will eventually be set free. It soon becomes clear, however, that Rainy intends to escalate the situation. He forces Audrey to choose between herself and Cheyenne, but Audrey's protective instincts cause her to quickly offer herself in Cheyenne's place, a characteristic that increasingly aggravates Rainy. Audrey gets a brief reprieve when a door to door proselytizer named David (Frank Whaley) arrives and draws Rainy's fixation. Now with three hostages and the situation destabilizing, Audrey tries to delay in any way she can, whether by appealing to Jawari or divulging intimate details of her life to Rainy. Rainy continues to single out individuals and provoke them, eventually murdering Jawari to prevent his interference. With Audrey too quick to sacrifice herself for Cheyenne, Rainy attempts to force David to make a life or death decision, convinced his religious convictions are false and he would never sacrifice himself for strangers. Rainy is frustrated in this endeavor as well when David, moved by Audrey's selflessness, finds the inner strength to choose himself to be shot instead of Audrey or Cheyenne. When Cheyenne grabs Jawari's gun, Audrey is left with no alternative but to attack Rainy. In the ensuing struggle, David gets Jawari's gun. By the time Bobby arrives the entire situation is completely out of control. He attempts to resolve the circumstances only to have Audrey, perhaps pushed beyond her coping ability, violently retaliate. At the reading of the will, Audrey learns her grandfather's water rights have already gone into forfeiture, thus negating the entire purpose for the extortion plot and rendering all the violence following from it unnecessary. The film ends with a stunned Audrey lamenting, ‚ÄúAll they had to do was ask.‚Äù  Cast  * Tammy Blanchard as Audrey * Guillermo D√≠az as Rainy * David Spade as Bobby * Frank Whaley as David * Dwight Henry as Jawari * Onata Aprile as Cheyenne with Hope Pirkle as her double * Bruce Dern as Calvin * James Earl Jones as Mr. Pendleton * Steve Eastin as Marty * Niki Koss as Notta Chance  Production  The film was shot primarily in and around Corsicana, Texas, in May and June 2016 with some scenes shot in Los Angeles and New York.

Typical Output Noise Waveform from a Switching Regulator Fig 3 Typical Output Noise from a Linear Regulator Switching Noise Jitter (SNJ) is the aggregation of variability of noise events in the time-domain on the supply bias of an electronic system, in particular with a voltage regulated supply bias incorporated with closed-loop (feedback) control, for instance, SMPS. SNJ is measurable using real-time spectral histogram analysis and expressed as a rate of occurrence in percentage. The existence of SNJ was firstly demonstrated and termed by TransSiP Inc in 2016 and 2017 at the Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC),Https://www.apec- conf.org/about/history/2017-conference-photos/pageindex508/6 and reviewed with experts at Tektronix prior to be featured as a case study published by Tektronix. The discovery of SNJ was also featured in multiple articles published by Planet Analog magazine and EDN Network. Difficult to filter using conventional LC networks due to variability in both time and frequency domains, SNJ can introduce random errors in analog to digital conversion, affecting both data integrity and system performance in digital communications and location-based services (viz GPS, Satellite positioning)  Creation  In switching-mode power supplies (SMPS), noise present in the control loop circuitry of the supply causes dislocation in up-slope and down-slope timing of the saw-tooth ripple waveform. As a consequence, the ripple waveform exhibits jitter and noise carried on the ripple also jitters. When this type of supply bias is used to power a system operating in power-saving modes or pulsed applications as shown in Fig. 1 the current drain fluctuates in pulses. Typically a load enters a high power stage (e.g. RX/TX On) for tens of micro- to milli-seconds and is then switched to low power or standby mode for hundreds of milli- or tens of seconds. Inrush currents cause voltage fluctuations due to parasitics of both components and interconnections, creating random noise in addition to the ringing and harmonics normally present. The result is SNJ.  Associated issues  At present, many modern switching DC-DC converters offer dual-mode operation. At full load, the switching frequency is held constant and the voltage is modulated by varying pulse width (pulse-width modulation or PWM), thereby presenting a fixed frequency to the filter circuitry. When light loads are present, PWM efficiencies degrade, so the converter switches to modulation of pulse frequency, typically referred to as pulse-frequency mode (PFM) for increased efficiency. Nevertheless, the dual-mode approach has multiple disadvantages: it creates additional transient noise and momentary fluctuations in output voltage, as well as reduced energy efficiency due to the increased quiescent current required by complex mode-switching circuitry. To make things more difficult, the PFM mode creates a wide spectrum of noise as well as SNJ in the time domain at the output voltage that is difficult to filter. The SNJ signature ,therefore, becomes a dominating influence on the performance of noise-sensitive SoCs, circuit components and fidelity of weak signals after the ripple voltage has been suppressed. In addition, SNJ has a cumulative effect in the analog to digital conversion found in modern digital communications due to the existence of a variety of unwanted noise signals over time which will be digitized and stored in memory.  Time vs. frequency domain  Fig. 4 Supply Bias Noise (ripple) in a GPS application as measured by a spectrum analyzer. Noise in the output of DC-DC converters may be random or periodic fluctuations in output voltage, analytically expressed as peak-to- peak voltage or noise spectral density. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 demonstrate the typical visual characteristics of the output from a switching regulator and a linear regulator (also known as \\"low dropout\\" or \\"LDO\\") respectively. A saw- tooth ripple waveform is the consequence of LC filtering on the output of a switching regulator, while the output of the LDO in this example clearly shows transient/spurious events due to circuit parasitics. These are accompanied by more macro fluctuations in a pulse application due to overshoots and undershoots. Fig. 4 compares the supply bias noise (ripple) in a GPS application as measured by a spectrum analyzer. The primary bias voltage is provided respectively by a LDO and by a switching regulator. The frequency range of the noise spectrum for both is very similar, lying below 1 MHz. However, the noise amplitude of the LDO is about 20 dB lower than the switching regulator. So in general practice, the primary bias voltage provided by the LDO is expected to perform better and is generally used as the golden reference when specifying performance characteristics of an active device such as a GPS or wireless communication module or IC, notwithstanding the relatively low DC-DC conversion efficiencies of linear regulators. FIG. 5 Transient Noise Present with LDO in Pulsed Applications The LDO is indeed able to provide a low-noise bias, but only when the DC load is constant. Of course, in practice the current draw of a load will fluctuate, and careful examinations of the supply bias of pulsed applications will show that transient noise is, in fact, present, as shown in Fig. 5 and this is difficult to filter. Powering a noise-sensitive SoC or circuit component in a pulsed application with an LDO may well turn out to be a sub-optimal solution: in addition to low conversion efficiency, noise is still present on the supply bias in the form of transients which vary in both frequency and density (frequency of occurrence). When observed on an oscilloscope, the ripple waveform on the output of a PFM-type DC-DC converter will appear as shown in Fig. 6. Abnormalities occurring in the time-domain increase the \\"perturbation\\": the variability of switching events in time relative to a reference. Since the converter is PFM type, the switching frequency changes with the fluctuation of the load. This makes it problematic using frequency- domain measurement to discriminate how much of the variation of the waveform in both timing TON and slope S1 (‚àÜV/‚àÜT) is caused by the response of the controller to the load and how much by the noise in the control loop circuitry. The waveform in Fig. 7 demonstrates the outcome from the same setup with SNJ conditioning in place: the variability in TON and S1are substantially reduced.  Measurement  Fig 6: Output-voltage Ripple with SNJ Present Fig. 7 Output-voltage Ripple after SNJ Conditioning Since SNJ occurs on a random basis, the most effective measurement technique employs a determination of how often it occurs. The DPX (digital phosphor) technique from Tektronix is particularly useful, as it directly outputs event density in the form of a histogram analysis. Thanks to the introduction of event density as an additional measurement dimension, a DPX Spectrum display can be used to discriminate between load-induced and jitter-induced movement of the waveform, adding an additional dimension to frequency and amplitude. The color temperature spectrum (‚ÄúZ‚Äù axis) shows the number of occurrences of signals (or ‚Äòevent density‚Äô) over a set period of time. Z-axis scaling adjustments for maximum and minimum occurrence values can be manipulated to discriminate visually between different signals beneath the maximum amplitude. Fig. 8 shows the DPX plot of the supply bias waveform shown in Fig. 6. A measurement box, defined by the horizontal frequency and vertical amplitude ranges, is used to define and measure the average event density over a period of time. The distortion of the intermediate (green/yellow) bands on the bitmap is clearly visible. Fig 8 DPX Plot of Supply Noise with SNJ Present In this example, the measurement period is set to infinite (i.e. the system collects SNJ continuously on the DPX display until stop). This measurement technique enables the identification and measurement of SNJ in the SMPS output both qualitatively and quantitatively. Fig 9: After SNJ Conditioning The crucial noise reduction, achieved when the SNJ is conditioned, can be seen clearly in Fig 9. SNJ conditioning has reduced the event density by about 50%. This level of reduction has been shown in field trials to be significant, with demonstrable improvements in device autonomy and performance. In summary, advances in signal analysis have enabled the discovery of a new component of noise present in electronic systems using DC-DC conversion. Field trials comparing battery-powered devices where SNJ is effectively conditioned to devices using conventional linear regulation and/or switching mode DC-DC conversion have conclusively shown that measurable improvements in performance, precision, and autonomy are obtained.

From 1936 he remained outside of his native Spain (his father Jos√© Mar√≠a Sempr√∫n Gurrea was a diplomat to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War) and later continued in exile after Franco's victory. He was a militant member of the Communist Party of Spain during its first years, but left the Party before the expulsion of his brother Jorge. He continued his anti-Francoist militancy in other left- wing groups. In the magazine that published 'Acci√≥n Comunista' he signed articles with the pseudonym Lorenzo Torres. In the 2000s his ideological \\"evolution\\" placed him in very critical positions towards the left in general. He called himself liberal, anti-communist and said that democracy was only possible in capitalism.An Appreciation of the Sempr√∫n Brothers - Revista de Libros- 8 January 1988 He was a film critic for Diario 16 and regularly collaborated in Libertad Digital and La Ilustraci√≥n Liberal with his 'Cosmopolitan Chronicles' and his 'Letter of Paris', being one of its first columnists.

It is a subtropical species which is found in deep, slow flowing sections of rivers as well as in estuaries although it moves into coastal seas to spawn. It feeds mainly on algae and plant material, as well as detritus and benthic invertebrates. The pinkeye mullet was originally described by Francis de Laporte de Castelnau in 1875 as Mugil petardi. The specific name honours a Mr Petard who sent Castelnau specimens of fishes he collected in the Richmond River in New South Wales; these included the type of this species. It is a dark greenish-brown mullet with a silvery belly and pale yellowish fins. It has a body which is deep and robust with a small mouth and small eyes.

The hospital would remain open until 1978 when its functions were moved to the then newly opened Johannesburg General Hospital. The building is a heritage listed monument and parts of the building are currently used by community groups dedicated to the service of children. History=Origin= The concept for a dedicated hospital for children in the Transvaal began in October 1919 when members of the Johannesburg Branch of the National Council of Women (NCW) discussed the need at a gathering. Two months later on 8 December 1919, the NCW met in Johannesburg and a resolution was passed to build a Children's Hospital which commemorates the deaths of Transvaal men during the First World War. A committee consisting of members of the Transvaal community was formed under Viscountess Buxton to help realise the idea of a 100-bed hospital with accommodation for medical staff and nurses. The collection of funds for the project began with the Johannesburg Town Council donating 8ha of land at Milner Park in Braamfontein as well as ¬£12,000 for the project. The South African Red Cross donated money collected for its efforts during the First World War to the fund. Other organisations donated resulting in the naming of wards such as Red Cross, Musicians, Sunday Times, Primary Schools and Berlein. More organisations such as mining companies, town councils from across the Witwatersrand, businesses and individuals donated money towards cots, theatres, medical and surgical equipment. =Design= After winning a competition, the hospital was designed by the architectural firm, Cowin, Powers & Ellis. The foundation stone was laid in December 1921 by the Governor-General, Prince Arthur of Connaught with the hospital officially opened on 29 October 1923 and the first patient arrived on 3 November 1923. It was then handed over to the Transvaal Provincial Administration and the Johannesburg Hospital. The hospital buildings and nurses home cost ¬£108,258 while the cost of equipping it was around ¬£13,000. The original main building is red face-brick with a terraced garden facing north at an angle to Joubert Street. Two roundels, in the style of the 1400s Italian sculptor Luca della Robbia are found on the main facade of the building. The main building consisted of a memorial hall on the ground floor with six wards of 112 beds, two operating theatres and radiology and physiotherapy departments with a nurses' home on the grounds. In the centre of the main building, there is a memorial hall with bronze plaques lit by skylights that commemorate those who have endowed money for cots and two altars with scrolls dedicating the names of some of the men of the Transvaal who lost their lives during the First World War. In the central blocks, the ground floor contained the admission and casualty section dispensary, small lecture theatre, staff room and administrative offices. The upper floors on this block contained the operating theatres, X-ray department, physio-hydrotherapy section and accommodation for the medical staff. Two double-storied extensions on either side of the central block contained the wards. =Hospital= The early hospital would take patients up to 14 years old and so the wards were divided into three age groups, 0 to 2, 2 to 9 and lastly 9 until 14 years. The Musicians Ward was the observation ward for those yet undiagnosed. The Sunday Times Ward was the medical and surgical ward with 32 beds for the youngest patients. The middle age group's medical patients were catered for in the Berlein Ward while its surgical patients were placed in the Primary School Ward. The oldest patients were placed in the Red Cross Ward and contained medical and surgical beds. From 1925, with no space available in the hospital, out-patient services had to be held off-site until a new university lecture theatre was built and the out-patient services returned to the main buildings old lecture rooms. In 1926, the Ross-Rotary (Solarium) Ward was added. By 1933, the hospital had 133 beds but overcrowding occurred in both the in and out-patient areas, casualty and theatres and X-ray areas. New building plans were implemented from 1936. By 1938 new theatres opened and a convalescent home for 25 patients was temporarily opened at the Otto Beit Home. Coming out of the 1936 building plan, were new buildings that were attached to the original hospital block consisting of a multi-storied building with four new wards and more up-to-date equipment and patient rooms. One of the new wards catered for burns and plastic surgery, another for adolescent patients. After 15 years of planning, from 1965 new building took place. Occupational therapy and physiotherapy departments were first built. An ear, nose and throat ward with a theatre was available in 1966. In 1967, a large casualty complex followed as did a polyclinic, a larger dispensary, administrative offices and record storage, child psychiatry department, social workers and a larger modern X-ray department. Speech therapy and library reading room followed in 1968. =Staffing= From 1923 until 1949, the professional medical doctors were sourced from private practice and would also offer clinical teaching to medical students and paid by the University of Witwatersrand. From 1950 and until 1968, the staffing consisted of part and full-time staff appointed by the Transvaal Provincial Administration in consultation by the University of Witwatersrand. And 1968 saw the recognition by the University of paediatrics as its own School, and more full-time staff followed. Dr E.P Baumann was its first senior physician and served in the role until 1934. He was followed by Dr B.G. Melle and Dr S. Heymann took over in 1949. Current use A new medical school and an academic hospital were planned from 1968 and construction began in 1972 on the Otto Beit grounds in Parktown with a large Paediatric Department to be situated in what was to be called the Johannesburg General Hospital, now known as the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. By 1978-1979, the Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children became part of the new hospital. This building is now owned by the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development and the Gauteng Department of Health. In October 2013, the building at the site of Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children received a blue plaque which acknowledged the historical significance to Johannesburg. The property is now managed by the Children's Memorial Institute with thirty non-governmental organisations that provide services to children.

She is considered to be the only vowess who was not married. She became rich when her uncle, William Hampton, died. Life Hampton was born in Minchinhampton to Ellen and John Hampton. She was one of eight children and thought to be the eldest daughter. Four of her five brothers died young and the remaining brother became a monk. This made her the heir of both her childless uncle and her father. In 1483 she was at the Dominican Dartford Priory when her uncle died. Sir William Hampton had been knighted for his role in defending London against the \\"Bastard of Fauconberg\\". He had been a member of Parliament and was Lord Mayor of London. He had made his money selling fish and had risen to a position where he was offering loans to Edward IV of England. Alice was unusual in being the only unmarried vowess known. It is surmised that she decided to be a vowess rather than a nun when she realised that she had become wealthy. A vowess was usually a widow or a woman who had with her husband's consent taken a vow of chastity. Vowesses devoted their life to religion and they were subject to only church law. In the following year she was living in an oratory near the priory when she became so ill from fasting that a letter was sent to the Pope to release her from her commitments to fast. It was agreed on 14 October 1484 that she would be given the privilege of her own confessor who could allow her fasts to be replaced by alternative commitments. In addition she was allowed to take mass in the oratory. She now had considerable autonomy and an income of ¬£15 per year as part of an annuity granted as part of her inheritance. A 1544 map showing the details of the agreement between Alice and the Prioress concerning her use of the Priory She had inherited not only her uncle's riches but also his influence. By 1492 she was living in London's suburbs at the Augustinian Holywell Priory in Shoreditch where she paid the prioress, Elizabeth Prudde, four pounds of pepper a year. In exchange for this she was allowed to use her well and washing facilities and to make changes to the building's structures. She arranged for her living area to have a view of the church altar and for a locked entrance to her garden. She had her own exit and a dedicated pew in the Lady Chapel; however she lived in two rooms that were just over 18 feet by ten feet.

Paleƒçek discovered that nucleic acids could be analysed by electrochemical research, contradicting previous assumptions from the 1950s that DNA molecules were too large to be affected by electrochemistry.  Personal life  Paleƒçek was brought up by his mother, as his father died in a Nazi concentration camp. Aged 13, he went to work as an apprentice at the Bank of Slavia.  Career  Paleƒçek had a specific interest in the fact that most proteins contain sugar, as he believed that analysis of this could lead to better diagnosis of health and illnesses. In particular, he believed that testing glycoproteins could detect early-stage cancer. In 1959, Paleƒçek received a PhD in biochemistry from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechoslovakia (now in the Czech Republic). During the 1960s, Paleƒçek worked at the Biophysical Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Brno. His first work there was investigating DNA damage caused by radiation. Paleƒçek later worked with the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, part of Masaryk University. In 1960, Paleƒçek discovered that nucleic acids could be analysed through electrochemical research, which allowed him to explore how DNA can be used to diagnose genetic diseases. His discovery contradicted previous assumptions from the 1950s that DNA molecules were too large to be analysed by electrochemical research. It took the scientific world 30 years to understand the importance of his findings, although the method began to be commonly used in the 1990s. In the 1960s, Paleƒçek spent a year doing research at Harvard University in the United States. Paleƒçek was allowed to travel to the United States as he was not a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. In his last month at Harvard University, Paleƒçek's experiments were demonstrated. They were later cited in many biophysics and molecular biology textbooks. During his life, Paleƒçek authored over 300 scientific works, making him one of the most respected scientists in the Czech Republic. In 1989, Paleƒçek became a member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. From 1993‚Äì97, he was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences. In 1994, Paleƒçek was one of the founding members of the Learned Society of the Czech Republic. In 2003, Paleƒçek was the speaker for one of the Mendel Lectures. In 2009, the Emil Paleƒçek award, was setup by the President of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Paleƒçek was still working on the Saturday before his death.  Awards  In 1961, Paleƒçek was awarded the Jaroslav Heyrovsk√Ω award for best young scientist. In 2011, he received the Education Minister's award. In 2014, Paleƒçek was awarded the (Czech Head) award. In 2017, he was one of seven Czech scientists awarded the Cenu Neuron (Neuron Prize) for their contributions to science.  Death  Paleƒçek became ill after having a stroke whilst swimming. He died two days later on 30 October 2018. His death was announced by fellow scientist Eduard Kejnovsky, who worked as Paleƒçek's public relations officer.

Originally published in 2013 in French as Le Dahlia Noir, it was published in English on June 2016, by Archaia Entertainment, a division of Boom! Studios.  Synopsis  Dwight \\"Bucky\\" Bleichert celebrates his first day at the Warrants division of the Los Angeles Police Department, a prestigious position where most police in Los Angeles dream to work. He is teamed up with Leland \\"Lee\\" Blanchard, as he was a former boxer. He also meets Kay Lake, a woman who lives with Lee, but doesn't have an intimate relationship with him. The three form a \\"fairy tale triangle.\\" In January 1947, they begin to investigate a murder as horrible as publicized: that of Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Short, nicknamed \\"The Black Dahlia\\" found dead and mutilated in a vacant lot. Bucky and Lee's personal and professional lives begin to unravel as the investigation continues. They both become obsessed with Elizabeth Short. Bucky discovers that Lee's celebrated case‚Äî\\"The Boulevard-Citizens Bank Robbery\\"‚Äîwas actually orchestrated by Lee. It was an attempt to frame Bobby DeWitt, Kay Lake's pimp at the time, and to save Kay from the violent DeWitt, who scarred Kay's body with a knife. In the course of the investigation, leads in the murder case point to Mexico. Lee heads there alone, and eventually Bucky follows him to Mexico as well, because of the length of Lee's absence. Bucky finds Lee murdered, in a site used to dump bodies. Returning to Los Angeles, Kay reveals many truths about Lee Blanchard's life, as well as hers. Despite this, Bucky and Kay marry May 2, 1947. Bucky begins to deteriorate over the years, but successfully solves Elizabeth Short's murder. Kay has left him at this point because Bucky has become obsessed with Elizabeth Short. Bucky is fired from the LAPD because of his own conduct. Bucky receives a letter from Kay, informing him she is pregnant, postmarked from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Bucky leaves for a flight to Boston, Massachusetts, to reunite with Kay. Style and artwork Miles Hyman used charcoal drawings in The Black Dahlia. Each page contains three comic strips, an idea proposed by Fincher. History In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Matz, one of the two co-authors of the book, described the process of adapting the original novel into the comic book medium. He stated he did not originally start the script in French, but in English. He also said James Ellroy had to approve the script, stating \\"If he didn‚Äôt approve it, the graphic novel was killed. Simple as that.\\" He mentioned how he had known David Fincher from when Fincher was going to adapt Matz's series, The Killer, into a film. He said Fincher's input was \\"very valuable\\" and \\"Having him onboard made a big difference.\\" Reception The Black Dahlia: A Crime Graphic Novel received mostly favorable reviews. An article from Nerdgeist said \\"This book is further reason why graphic novels are not just for kids, it‚Äôs mature, dark and a real gripping read, that does its source material more justice than the film ever did and helps keep alive the memory of someone that died all too young in an all too horrific manner.\\" ComiXology gave it 4 out of 5 stars. An article by 20 minutes stated, \\"As captivating, neat and dense as the novel is, this graphic version enjoys an incredible combination of know-how. It would be surprising that it does not box in bookstores.\\" Le Figaro wrote \\"The authors have fully understood, and the case Betty Short has not finished to upset the souls, thanks to the masterful reinterpretation of Fincher, Matz and Hyman.\\" A review from Forces of Geek praised the graphic novel adaptation, saying \\"The three together condense the novel into a visual form that exceptionally captures the tone and style of the best noirs without ever feeling derivative or referential. They are handling one of the biggest stories in noir folklore and one of the biggest noir novels of the last 30 years, which is a heavy task, but they achieve in so many places where the film failed.\\" Larry Harnisch, a former writer for the Los Angeles Times, critiqued the graphic novel for \\"compressing and compacting\\" the source material of Ellroy's 1987 novel, as well as \\"exposing many weaknesses that aren't apparent in the original book\\", real life historical inaccuracies, artwork appearing stiff and clunky, and difficulty in telling characters apart.

Being a powerlifter, Gray, while imprisoned, achieved incredible results in powerlifting, almost breaking world records. Since 1992, relying on his physical strength, he committed several rapes and murders of fellow inmates, which resulted in taking exceptional measures against Gray by putting him in a high-security prison's solitary confinement cell, restriction of movement within the prison and others. In the 2000s, he was considered the most dangerous prisoner in the state of Colorado, being convicted of 3 murders and suspected in several others, personally confessing to killing 41 people across 8 different states from 1971 to 1992. However, the credibility of his testimony continued to be disputed until his death.  Early life  Marvin Gayle Gray was born on August 7, 1954 in Princeton, Caldwell County in rural Kentucky. He was the 7th child in a family of 10 children. From the age of 4 years, Marvin began to suffer from panic attacks, and as a result of which he had to spend the next 7 years taking drugs containing methamphetamines. Since early childhood, Marvin was attracted to work in the tobacco fields and labor discipline industries. His panic attacks ended in 1965, when his father suffered from a heart attack, after which the main responsibilities for raising children and running the family's budget fell on the shoulders of Marvin's mother. At the same time, having freed himself from excessive parental care, his behavior changed dramatically, with his grades and discipline plummeting. Marvin was first arrested at the age of 12, and subsequently convicted of infiltrating into foreign property and theft, and was sent to an institution for juvenile offenders. According to Gray, an informal hierarchy of minors reigned in the institution, where the youngest and most physically weak were subjected to sexual violence and all kinds of humiliation. Being in this institution, Gray's psycho-emotional state changed a lot, he learned self-defense, and also acquired destructive feelings such as rage, hatred towards elders and representatives of the law, as well as such moral-psychological traits such as cruelty and callousness. When he was released in 1968, he began to his criminal career. On the first day of school, he was expelled for carrying deadly weapons and threatening school officials.  Criminal career  In 1970, Gray burst into a neighbor's garage and stole a weapon from a car. Within a few days, he made several more thefts and attacks, threatening his victims with a pistol. After being arrested, Gray was accused of robbery, burglary, illegal possession of weapons and the threat of murder. In 1971, at the age of 17, Gray received 5 years in prison. He was transferred to the Kentucky State Prison, a 100-year-old stone prison called \\"The Castle\\" in the city of Addivillus. During his incarceration, Gray first took up powerlifting, developed a tattoo addiction, and became an ardent supporter of the concept of white supremacy. Released in early 1975, he weighed more than 100 kilograms (220 lbs.) with a height of 1.90 metres (6'2\\") and possessed impressive muscles and physical strength. At the insistence of his elder brother Eugene, he soon moved to Denver, where he found a job at the O'Neal Hotel, located in the city center. In the summer of 1975, Gray and his friend William Felder were arrested on charges of assaulting police officer James Datsman, who had received a gunshot wound. Datsman had been investigating the murder of 26-year-old Joseph Didier, who had been killed earlier that day in the vicinity of the hotel. Found near the crime scene, Gray and Felder opened fire at the police officer. Datsman survived, and pointed at Felder as the shooter. At trial, Marvin Gray said that he shot, but the court considered the officer's testimony as a priority. Gray was accused only of theft and complicity of the crime and received only 4 years imprisonment, while William Felder received 20 years. Subsequently, the ballistic examination showed that the bullets that killed Didier and injured Datsman were from the same weapon, but the charges of Joseph Didier's murder were not brought against either of the criminals. While in custody, according to the investigation, committed his first crime against an inmate. Inmate David Cook was found beaten and strangled at the end of 1977 in his cell. Gray was pointed at as a suspect by several witnesses. Subsequently, these prisoners changed their testimonies, and even despite allegations that Gray threatened many in prison with physical violence, he was never charged with the murder of Cook. In 1978, Gray was released early and returned to Kentucky. Soon he met with 17-year-old Sheila Olsbrook, and they had a son in 1979. The whole duration of their relationship, Gray scoffed and beat Olsbrook, only ending after the next arrest of Marvin in 1979 for stealing a car. He was helped in this crime by accomplice William Purdue. On March 16, 1980, Gray, Purdue and another inmate named Jerry Keller escaped from prison. They hijacked a van, but quarreled along the way, as a result of which Gray beat Keller to death and disposed of his body in the city. A few days later, Gray reached Denver, and was identified by acquaintances and soon rearrested. Traces of blood and a bloody screwdriver were found inside the van. Gray was interrogated but gave no explanation about the further fate of William Purdue. Despite the fact that the investigators suspected that Gray had killed his second accomplice, Purdue's body was never found. Gray escaped again and was once again arrested on August 11, 1982. He reappeared in Denver, where he met a girl named Joleen Sue Gardner on September 1. After refusing to have sex with him, Gray stabbed her 14 times, after which she died. Gray was arrested and convicted in 1984, with a sentence of 16 years imprisonment. In 1986 he was first charged with raping a cellmate, but the investigation was soon terminated due to lack of evidence that the act was violent. Gray got off with an administrative penalty and was transferred to a prison with more stringent conditions of detention. He was released on parole on January 18, 1991. His freedom was extremely limited ‚Äì he was obliged to find a job, had a probation officer appointed to him, and was prohibited from the limits of the State of Colorado and move closer to places where children and adolescents congregated. Two days after his release, Gray got on a bus and left for Paducah, Kentucky to visit his relatives, thereby violating the conditions for early release. Having appeared in the city, Marvin sought out his family members, but they, fearing his temper and reputation, were told by police to be vigilant, receiving $200 in return, forcing Marvin to get on a bus a few days later and return to Colorado. He did several odd jobs until 1992, when he again was arrested for burglary. Given the severity of the crime he committed in 1984 and the violation of the conditions of his parole, the court, based on judicial directives in effect at the time in the state of Colorado, Marvin Gray was given life imprisonment. From this point on he was never released again.  Aftermath  At the time, Marvin Gray weighed 140 kilograms (308 lbs.), and he continued to be heavily invested in powerlifting for several years. His official record in the bench press was 250 kilograms (551 lbs.), squatting 450 kilograms (992 lbs.) and deadlifting 390 kilograms (860 lbs.). In November 1992, Gray was charged with the murder of another prisoner named Daniel Green, who was an informant in a drug case. Gray blamed Green's murder on two black cellmates, while five other inmates testified against Marvin. However, despite the fact that he was charged with 1st degree murder, Gray was never convicted of Green's murder. In early 1993, he was transferred to another prison. On July 19, 1993, Gray beat and raped his 27-year-old cellmate Gary Hilton. Less than a week later, he committed another similar crime by raping James Mervyn, after which he was transferred to the Colorado State Penitentiary, a special high-security prison where exceptional measures were taken against him.  Confessions  After serving under similar conditions for almost 7 years, Marvin Gray began to show signs of deviant behavior, beginning in 2000, when he suddenly began confessing to murders he had never been accused of committing. By December 22, 2000, he confessed to 23 murders. He was transferred to the court, at which he threatened to kill his lawyers appointed by the state. By March 2001, Marvin Gray confessed to committing 31 murders and was interviewed by The Denver Post, in which he revealed the details of biography and criminal career. He admitted to committing his first murder in 1971, when he was just 17 years old. Almost 26 years later, Gray confessed that it was he who killed Joseph Didier on the day that he attempted to kill James Datsman. Marvin also said that after serving his sentence, released in 1978 and met Sheila Olsbrook, it became necessary to control his 17-year-old girlfriend, so he committed a series of 7 murders allegedly in the states of Nebraska, Tennessee, Iowa, Kentucky and Illinois. He also claimed responsibility for the disappearance of his accomplice, William Purdue, with whom he had escaped from prison in 1980. According to Gray, he killed Purdue by stabbing him in the neck with a screwdriver and threw his body in a landfill. He also confessed to the murder of a man that he committed in the state of Indiana in 1982. When he was released for the last time, in January 1991, Gray alleged that he committed the most murders during that year than the entirety of his life. He described in detail the murder of a young man in the city of San Francisco, which he allegedly committed in 1991, and then threw the corpse into a dog kennel. According to Marvin's testimony, he also committed 3 murders in the summer of 1992, shooting Joseph Solise, killing a prostitute in Denver and killing another man. The last crime to which Marvin Gray confessed to was the murder of Daniel Green. Despite his extensive testimony, Gray was charged only with the murders of Didier and Solise, the latter being killed in 1992 in Denver during a robbery.  Investigation  Despite the fact that almost immediately after his confession, Marvin Gray became interested in the FBI, which began its own investigation, the credibility of his testimony caused controversy. In some instances Gray described in some detail the murders committed many years ago and even provided evidence for this, albeit indirect, that nevertheless made it difficult to ignore his confessions. In 2001, he was required to undergo a polygraph test. The audit confirmed the truthfulness of his confessions in at least 18 murders, but soon the test results were invalidated due to the fact that Gray was taking medication. At the same time, it became clear that a number of Gray's statements had nothing to do with reality. In some instances, Marvin's confessions reflected a big discrepancy in dates, geographic data and the seasons when the victims were allegedly killed, some of the killings and disappearances of people whom Gray could theoretically be related to while he was serving time in prison. In one case, he revealed the details of a double murder that was carried out in 1991 in Louisville, Colorado, but then, confused in his testimony, he said that he had lied. In general, his stories reflected a bad memory. No one else was going to accuse him of the remaining crimes, as the investigation continued to sort out reality from fantasy. A number of specialists such as prison psychologist George Levy said that Gray's actions and statements could be pure fantasy. In his opinion, the reason for the deviant behavior of the criminal was social deprivation, which in turn was the result of Gray's 8-year-old isolation in solitary confinement. The mental disorders developed by this prompted Gray to make a confession in order to change the situation and thereby reduce the degree of severity of isolation and deprivation. Marvin Gray was assigned a forensic medical examination, which revealed his antisocial personality disorder. On June 6, 2001, Gray was charged with the murder of Joseph Didier and Joseph Solise, and received another life sentence as punishment. In June 2002, he made another confession, this time admitting that in June 1992 he killed five women in his hometown of Princeton. Gray petitioned to be transferred to the crime scene, where he was ready to show the burial places of the victims. The true scale of his crimes remains unknown.  Death  Marvin Gayle Gray died on July 19, 2013 from heart failure while imprisoned in the Colorado State Penitentiary, located in Ca√±on City.

Map of Tajikistan showing the border with Uzbekistan  Description  The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Kyrgyzstan, proceeding west, north-west, north-east along the Syr Darya river and finally north-west to reach the Qurama Mountains. The border then follows this range westwards, before turning south in the vicinity of the Uzbek town of Olmaliq at the Syr Darya river. The next section of the boundary is extremely convoluted, with a long protrusion of Tajik territory (Zafarobod District) and a series of irregular lines; eventually the border proceeds roughly southwards before turning sharply west upon reaching the Turkestan Range. The border then follows a ‚ÄòC‚Äô shape, with Uzbekistan‚Äôs Zaamin National Park and the Turkestan Mountains in the north, the Zerafshan Range in the middle, and the Gissar Range in the south.

History  Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin‚Äôs definition of a nation as being ‚Äúa historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture‚Äù. The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalismBergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40, as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore NTD also aimed to create ‚Äòviable‚Äô entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S.

Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers as they are today.

Populations here were extremely mixed, and there was a weak sense of Tajik/Uzbek identity in many areas, with many instead identifying as Sart.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 33-41 Tajik nationalism in particular was poorly developed at this point, and the extremely limited number of Tajik Communists were unable to push a strong case against the much more vocal Uzbeks, many of whom deemed the Tajiks to be merely ‚ÄòPersianised‚Äô Uzbeks. Therefore when the Uzbek SSR was created in 1924 the Tajik areas were included within it as the Tajik ASSR (minus the Khojand region, which was included directly within the Uzbek SSR). The Uzbek SSR as originally constituted, including the directly-administered Khojand region and the Tajik ASSR. At this point a then-larger Karakalpakstan was included within the Kazakh ASSR Over the following years it appears that Tajik nationalism developed, especially amongst the small elite of Tajik Communists.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 153 They increasingly came to resent their ‚Äòlesser‚Äô status within the Uzbek SSR, and chafed against what was seen as Uzbek dominance and high-handedness.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 102 As a result of these increasing tensions the Soviets decided to revisit the Tajik-Uzbek question in 1929. The Central Asian Bureau identified the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and Khojand as the main Tajik-inhabited cities, though this was complicated by the mixed nature of settlement in the surrounding areas; there were also debates about Termez and the Surxondaryo Region, claimed by both sides.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pgs, 51-2Starr, S.

The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. Tensions since then have been high, with several high-level Tajik politicians asserting the traditional claim to Bukhara and Samarkand, and Uzbek politicians asserting their right to protect Uzbeks living in Tajikistan. Uzbekistan accused Tajikistan of allowing the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) to base itself in its territory; following the 1999 Tashkent bombings, said by Tashkent to be the work of the IMU, Uzbekistan began unilaterally demarcating and mining the border. Relations between the two states have markedly improved since the death of Uzbek President Islam Karimov in 2016; new president Shavkat Mirziyoyev has vowed to improve relations with Tajikistan, and there have been recent high- level moves to de-mine the border and improve cross-border travel.

In Bulgaria it is found in Strandzha Nature Park.  Taxonomy  Individuals of this species were formerly classified as T. caeca or T. levantis until being classified as a new species. T. martinorum is not closely related to the other Talpa endemic to the Balkans, T. stankovici. Rather, it is most closely related to the widespread T. europaea as well as T. aquitania, and T. occidentalis, both of which are endemic to western Europe. Based on this, T. martinorum likely originated from an isolated population of a mole species that was also ancestral to T. europaea, as is also considered to be the case for the origin of T. aquitania and T. occidentalis. Fossil evidence shows that a mole species similar to the present T. martinorum lived in the region during the Pliocene, indicating that T. martinorum has persisted in its current territory for a long time.

He played four times for Spain. Career At club level, he played for Athletic Bilbao for eight seasons, coinciding with the introduction of La Liga in 1929; he won three national titles (1929‚Äì30, 1930‚Äì31, 1933‚Äì34), three consecutive Copas del Rey (1930, 1931, 1932, also contributing to a fourth in 1933 although he did not take part in the final) and several editions of the regional Biscay Championship, all before he elected to withdraw from playing at the age of 26. Chirri II was an integral part of what became known as the 'first historic front line' of Athletic Bilbao, combining with Jos√© Iraragorri, Bata, Guillermo Gorostiza and Lafuente (as well as V√≠ctor Unamuno). He has been characterised as a playmaker whose focus was on the creative and technical aspects of the game, in contrast to most forwards of the era who relied mainly on physical power to overcome opponents. He is said to have initiated the practice of destroying the bowler hat worn by the coach Fred Pentland after victories, which became a regular ritual for the successful team. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Agirrezabala joined the Basque Country national football team which toured Europe and Latin America in exile, remaining in Argentina when the rest of the squad moved on to Mexico where they founded a club team, CD Euzkadi. He worked in an engineering and construction firm before deciding to return to Bilbao with his family after eight years, where he became a director of a company in the same industry.

In 1964, at the age of five, Travers travelled with his parents to Kenya where they were starring together in the 1966 true-life film Born Free (1966), portraying conservationists Joy Adamson and George Adamson, who rescue a lioness cub named Elsa and successfully return her to the wild. The experience led Travers' parents to become active supporters for wild animal rights and the protection of their natural habitat. When Travers was 12 years old, the Travers family took care of Christian, a captive-bred lion, originally from Ilfracombe Zoo and who came, via a department store and a furniture shop on the King's Road in Chelsea, London, to live at the Travers' family home in Surrey, England. Christian was subsequently returned to a wild and free life in Africa by the Travers' friend, conservationist George Adamson. The story of Christian was made into a documentary film: Christian, The Lion at World's End, by Travers' father Bill. Travers' mother Virginia McKenna appeared in An Elephant Called Slowly, a travelogue which features elephants Eleanor (brought up by conservationist Daphne Sheldrick) and young elephant Pole Pole.

It is Kyrgyzstan's longest external boundary. Map of Kyrgyzstan showing the border with Uzbekistan Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Kazakhstan and then creates a ‚Äòfinger‚Äô of Uzbek territory wedged between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan; the border traverses the Pskem Mountains, with much of this area being taken up by a series of national parks (Ugam-Chatkal National Park in Uzbekistan and Besh-Aral State Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan). The boundary then proceeds in a roughly south-eastwards direction, traversing the Chatkal Range and the Qurama Mountains before entering the Ferghana Valley near the town of Varzik. The rest of the boundary is very convoluted, consisting of a series of twisted lines forming the 'arrow-head' shape of eastern Uzbekistan. The north side of this ‚Äòarrow‚Äô contains a point of Uzbek territory in the middle, creating a small Uzbek pene-enclave at its tip just to the west of the Kyrgyz town of Kerben. The arrow's ‚Äòtip‚Äô lies just to the east of Khanabad. The border then proceeds via a series of jagged lines westwards to the Tajik tripoint. The northernmost section of the border is mountainous and sparsely populated, in stark contrast to the rest which traverses the densely populated Ferghana Valley. The Uzbek railway network has several sections which cross this border, leaving a handful of stations in Kyrgyzstan at the end of small branch lines, and the easternmost section of railway crosses the border twice. This is a legacy of the Soviet era where infrastructure was built without regard to what were then internal boundaries. Enclaves Map showing the Kyrgyz-Uzbek enclaves There are several enclaves along the border: one Kyrgyz enclave in Uzbekistan (Barak), and four Uzbek enclaves within Kyrgyzstan (Sokh, Shohimardon, Jani-Ayil/Jhangail and Chon-Kara/Qalacha). History Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin's definition of a nation as being \\"a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture\\". The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalism,Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40 as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore, NTD also aimed to create ‚Äòviable‚Äô entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley ‚Äì the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 112 The attempt to balance these contradictory aims within an overall nationalist framework proved exceedingly difficult and often impossible, resulting in the drawing of often tortuously convoluted borders, multiple enclaves and the unavoidable creation of large minorities who ended up living in the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô republic. Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers as they are today. Soviet Central Asia in 1922 before national delimitation NTD of the area along ethnic lines had been proposed as early as 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 40-1Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley ‚Äì the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 105 At this time Central Asia consisted of two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR: the Turkestan ASSR, created in April 1918 and covering large parts of what are now southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Turkmenistan, and the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kirghiz ASSR, Kirgizistan ASSR on the map), which was created on 26 August 1920 in the territory roughly coinciding with the northern part of today's Kazakhstan (at this time Kazakhs were referred to as ‚ÄòKyrgyz‚Äô and what are now the Kyrgyz were deemed a sub- group of the Kazakhs and referred to as ‚ÄòKara-Kyrgyz‚Äô i.e. mountain-dwelling ‚Äòblack-Kyrgyz‚Äô). There were also the two separate successor ‚Äòrepublics‚Äô of the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva, which were transformed into the Bukhara and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics following the takeover by the Red Army in 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39 On 25 February 1924 the Politburo and Central Committee of the Soviet Union announced that it would proceed with NTD in Central Asia.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 55Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 42 The process was to be overseen by a Special Committee of the Central Asian Bureau, with three sub-committees for each of what were deemed to be the main nationalities of the region (Kazakhs, Turkmen and Uzbeks), with work then exceedingly rapidly.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 54Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 52-3Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 92Starr, S.

As a rule of thumb the territorial committees gave nomadic areas to the Kyrgyz and settled ones to the Uzbeks.Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley ‚Äì the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 108 However the Soviets felt that the Kyrgyz entity lacked towns, and that this would act as an impediment to economic development.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 189Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 276 It was for this reason that the Kyrgyz were awarded Osh, an overwhelmingly Uzbek-populated town.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 49 There were further disputes over Andijan, Margilan and Jala-abad; eventually the first two were given to the Uzbeks, the latter to the Kyrgyz.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 191 Originally the border was much longer, as the Uzbek SSR included the Khojand region as well as the rest of what is now Tajikistan as the Tajik ASSR.

Iraj Bashiri, 1996 The Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was originally within the Russia SSR in October 1924, with borders matching those of modern Kyrgyzstan. In 1925 it was renamed the Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast in May 1925, then became the Kirghiz ASSR in 1926 (not to be confused with the Kirghiz ASSR that was the first name of Kazak ASSR), and finally it became the Kirghiz SSR in 1936.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 167 The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. Tensions has already become apparent with the Krgyz-Uzbek riots in the city of Osh in 1990. In 1999/2000 Uzbekistan began unilaterally demarcating and mining sections of the border, citing the threat of cross- border terrorism. A 2001 agreement to potentially demarcate sections of the border and create land-swaps connecting their respective enclaves to the ‚Äòmainland‚Äô was poorly received in Kyrgyzstan and the agreement was never ratified, leading to continued tension along the border at this time. In more recent years relations have improved and a border agreement was signed in 2018 delimiting much of the boundary; discussions over the status of the enclaves is currently ongoing.

The name means refers to the building of cards onto an Unter (the equivalent of the Jack in a French pack). It is a classic children's game.  Overview  Although Domino-style games are common in Europe, the game known as Unteransetzen is only recorded in Austria where it is very popular in Salzburg and Upper Austria, but also played in every other state bar Tyrol. It has many variants: those in which the Unter of Hearts is the starting card (Rot-Mandl-Auflegen or Rot-Unter-Ansetzen), those in which the Unter of Leaves is the leading card (Gr√ºnmandlansetzen or Gr√ºnunteransetzen) and those in which any Unter may start (Unter-Anlegen, Unter-Ansetzen, Unter-Auflegen or Unterlegen).Geiser (2004), p. 48. Unteransetzen is also a component of compendium games such as RosbiratschkaSpielregelb√ºchlein (1988), pp. 175/176 Kein Stich or Herzeln.Herzeln at www.spieletest.at. Retrieved 4 Nov 2018  Cards  The game is usually played with a William Tell pack. In a 2-player game, a third of the pack is placed, face down, as a talon from which to draw. Otherwise all cards are dealt. Cards rank in their natural order ‚Äì Sow, King, Ober, Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven ‚Äì and there are no trumps.  Playing  A game of Unteransetzen under way Usually the player with the Unter of Hearts leads; sometimes the Unter of Leaves is used (hence names like Gr√ºnunteransetzen). In clockwise order, players then attempt to 'build' onto the first card by laying next to it the next higher or lower card in suit sequence i.e. the second player would play either the Ober of Hearts or the Ten of Hearts. If a player cannot build in the same suit, they may lay another Unter, above or below the first, in suit order i.e. the U above the U or the U below the U. If they cannot build on an existing suit sequence or on the existing Unters, they must pass and, in a 2-hand game, draw another card from the talon. The player who is first to shed all their cards is the winner.

Huteng (, also ËÉ°ËÖæËàû, H√∫t√©ngw«î, \\"Dance of the Barbarian leap\\") was the Chinese term for a type of dance that originated in Central Asia, especially among the Sogdians and the region of Tashkent (Áü≥Âúã, Sh√≠gu√≥). The dance was well known during the Tang dynasty, and there are numerous depictions of it in works of art. The dance was characterized by spinning, leaps and backflips. The dancers would particularly make summersaults, first planting their feet firmly on the carpet, tilting their face upward and arching their body, then lift their arms and jump backward to the sound of flutes and the pipa. Another famous dance from Central Asia was the Sogdian Whirl (ËÉ°Êóã, H√∫xuƒÉn, \\"Whirling Barbarian\\", also ËÉ°ÊóãËàû, H√∫xuƒÉnw«î, \\"Dance of the Whirling Barbarian\\"), in which a young woman was spinning inside a circle.

The film follows a haunted red dress as it torments various owners. It stars Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Hayley Squires, Leo Bill, and Gwendoline Christie. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 13 September 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019 by Curzon Artificial Eye and was released in the United States on 6 December 2019 by A24. Plot Sheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a recently divorced bank teller who lives with her son Vince (Jaygann Ayeh). She is frequently chastised for insignificant work errors by her bosses Stash (Julian Barratt) and Clive (Steve Oram), and intimidated by Vince's new girlfriend Gwen (Gwendoline Christie). She visits department store Dentley and Soper's to buy a dress for an upcoming date in the sales. After meeting the enigmatic store clerk Miss Luckmoore (Fatma Mohamed), Sheila is drawn to a beautiful, flowing red dress which she tries on. Luckmoore convinces Sheila to purchase it. Sheila notices a strange rash on her chest after wearing the dress. After putting the dress in the washing machine, the machine breaks down and Sheila injures her hand in the process. Sheila returns to the store to get a new size for the dress only to learn that there is only one version of the dress and that the store model was killed after wearing the dress for the store catalogue. Sheila goes on a date with new suitor Zach (Barry Adamson) while Gwen and Vince have sex. As she climaxes, Gwen is almost killed when the dress floats above her and tries to suffocate her. Sheila and Zach go for a walk together, where Sheila is attacked by an Alsatian, which cuts her leg and rips the dress in the process. Later that day, Vince returns home with the dress which is somehow now fully repaired. After hearing the dress move about in the wardrobe at night, an unsettled Sheila attempts to return the dress to the store but is refused by Luckmoore. Sheila is then killed in a car accident as she is driving en route to spending the night with Zach. The dress comes into possession of washing machine repairman Reg Speaks (Leo Bill) who is made by his friends to wear it on a night out. He is engaged to Babs (Hayley Squires), who takes a liking to the dress and decides to wear it as well. Reg returns home and is hypnotised by the department store's TV advertisement while Babs is at the store shopping. Luckmoore is alarmed to see Babs is wearing the dress and demands she leaves. Meanwhile, Reg dies from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the dress manipulating the boiler. Babs recalls to Luckmoore a dream she had about her being the model for all the dresses in the catalogue but getting thinner and thinner as the dresses got larger and larger. She was then buried in the store by the workers. Babs goes to try on a dress while a fight soon breaks out in the store that quickly spirals into looting. The dress catches fire and the flames spread quickly around the store. Babs burns to death, unable to escape her changing room, while Luckmoore flees down into the dumb waiter with a dismembered mannequin. As she descends deeper into the store, she sees the dead store model, Sheila, Reg, and Babs stitching together the dress from threads made of their blood; there are also several unattended sewing stations. A fireman observes the destroyed store and discovers the dress undamaged amongst the rubble.

Andy Starke served as a producer on the film, and Ian Benson, Lizzie Francke, Rose Garnett, Stephen Kelliher, Patrick Howson, Phil Hunt and Compton Ross served as executive producers on the film under their Blue Bear Rook Films, Bankside Films, BBC Films and British Film Institute banners, respectively. In November 2017, Hayley Squires, Julian Barratt, Gwendoline Christie, Leo Bill, Steve Oram, Fatma Mohamed, Jaygann Ayeh, and Richard Bremmer joined the cast of the film. Strickland commented that when writing the script he drew inspiration from both the curious nature of second-hand shops and his memories of being taken to department stores as a child, in particular the now closed Jacksons head branch in Reading, Berkshire. He wanted to interrogate the reactions people have to clothing. The dress itself was therefore very important. It also needed to fit a range of body types, so costume designer Jo Thompson made a simple red silk wrap dress. Release In March 2018, Curzon Artificial Eye acquired U.K. distribution rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 13 September 2018. Shortly after, A24 acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019. It was released in the United States on 6 December 2019. Reception In Fabric received universal acclaim from film critics. As of November 2019, it held a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 137 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads \\"In Fabrics gauzy giallo allure weaves a surreal spell, blending stylish horror and dark comedy to offer audiences a captivating treat.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 84 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Upon its UK release, The Independent called the film \\"Suspiria set in a department store\\" and commented that it was Strickland at \\"his most free and playful\\". The Daily Telegraph called him \\"modern Britain‚Äôs answer to Luis Bu√±uel.\\" Empire enjoyed the \\"dry, daft wit that reveals itself in surprising ways, from the bonkers premise onwards\\". Writing in The Guardian, Mark Kermode made it his film of the week and praised the \\"heady mix of intoxicating nostalgia, clothing- related alchemy and horror-inflected twisted comedy\\". Internationally, critics also lauded the film. The New York Times stated it was Strickland's \\"most impressive, engrossing, imaginatively unchained work yet\\". Rolling Stone summed up the film as \\"a singular trip into a singularly warped mind\\". In Fabric was included in best of 2019 film lists in The Playlist and Sight & Sound.

He begins to feel alienated after discovering that his mother is having an affair with an outsider and his father has joined the British army. He meets Mika (Iris Yotvat), a young Holocaust survivor from Poland who is finding it difficult to adjust to kibbutz life, and soon falls in love with her. With Israel on the verge of statehood, and despite Mika's objections, Uri joins the Palmach, the pre-state Jewish underground militia, leading his men on missions and maneuvers without being aware of Mika's pregnancy. Uri volunteers for a dangerous military operation and is killed while blowing up a bridge controlled by the British. His parents receive the tragic news, but are comforted by the grandchild that is to be born to them. Critical reception The film received generous financial support, and became one of the major events celebrating Israel's twentieth anniversary. The Prime Minister at the time, Levi Eshkol, as well as ministers and other public figures attended the premiere. Although it garnered mixed reviews, the film had a good box office (selling some 320,000 tickets) and a significant cultural impact. This was Assi Dayan's debut role and it made him into an Israeli film icon. The film has received attention in scholarship from writers like Nurith Gertz and Ella Shohat. Shohat, writing about the film's heroic protagonist, noting that in Hebrew language gibor (hero), gever (man), gvura (bravery), ligvor (to conquer, to overpower), and ligvor al (to win) all share the etymological root GBR, reflecting closely linked concepts of bravery, mastery and masculinity which were part of the Israeli \\"heroic-nationalist\\" films of this generation.

Scope The mission of NCCER is to provide a workforce of safe and productive craft professionals through portable certification and registration that is accepted industry- wide. The assessment for certification falls within two categories, the written assessment and the performance assessment. Passing the written assessment will result in a ‚ÄúKnowledge Verified‚Äù certification, passing the performance assessment will result in a ‚ÄúPerformance Verified‚Äù certificate, and passing both will result in a ‚ÄúCertified Plus‚Äù certification. History In 1991 eleven companies met to address skilled worker shortages and create a standard curricula with industry recognized credentials. In 1993 the organization released the Master Trainer Instructor Certification Program, Instructor Certification Training Program, accreditation guidelines, and fifty-three organizations applied for accreditation. The first completed module was entered into a \\"Registry System\\". On January 1, 1996 the foundation became organized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. OSHA Since 2010 OSHA has been working for rule making requiring national Accredited Crane Operator Certification. A November 9, 2017 deadline was extended for a year over concerns of ‚Äúcertifying by capacity‚Äù and if certification would be equivalent to qualification. Certifying by capacity has been an area of concern since 2013. On November 10, 2018, the final rule will take effect without the capacity requirement. OSHA has determined that industry concerns that capacity is not included in crane training, the rated operating capacity (ROC) is not a determining factor of a crane operator‚Äôs skill and experience, and the cost affecting approximately 117,130 crane operators would be $1.6 million annually. OSHA estimates a one-time industry savings of $25.5 million. The employer requirement to determine competency, that was taken out in 2014, is reversed and made permanent, requiring every new hire to be evaluated on site as well as having their accredited certification. This is seen as a draw-back to mobile crane operator \\"portable‚Äù certification\\" since anytime an operator changes jobs he or she will be treated as a new-hire trainee because an employer will have to assess different skills than the existing certification tests including: Inspecting the equipment, assessing unstable loads, hoisting loads of irregular size, operation from a barge, personnel hoisting, rigging the load, leveling the crane, hoisting in tight spaces, making judgments about wind speed and other environmental factors, performing multiple crane lifts, traveling with or without a load, operating near power lines, hoisting light loads, and hoisting blind picks where the operator cannot see the load. OSHA formally recognized NCCER Crane Operator Certification Program on May 20, 2010. A ceremony was held in Washington, D.C. that included the North American Crane Bureau, the US Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA, the Acting Director for OSHA‚Äôs Directorate of Construction, the President/CEO, Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., the President/CEO, Associated General Contractors of America, the Vice President, Government Relations, American National Standards Institute (ANSI), that accredited NCCER under ANSI/ISOIEC 17024, and the President of NCCER. NTSA participants The National Training Service Agreement (NTSA) currently has more than 140 contractors and association contributors and contractors can be directly reimbursed for approved training and workforce development expenditures. Participants also support development and industry advancement of craft training provided by NCCER.

(2014) Shell Games: Are Chinese Reverse Merger Firms Inherently Toxic?. Stanford Graduate School of Business Working Paper No. 3063. Available at: https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/shell-games-are- chinese-reverse-merger-firms-inherently-toxic A reverse merger, also known as a reverse takeover, is where a private company acquires a publicly traded firm or \\"shell company\\" that has essentially zero value on a registered stock exchange. The shell company's securities since becoming dormant are not registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where transactions on the secondary market are monitored. Reverse mergers in US markets and other countries had occurred in the past, but a large wave of Chinese companies came to the scene in the early 2000s. At the beginning of the 21st century, China was still known as a developing country with about 1.26 billion citizens. With the staggering population and a large majority of state-owned enterprises becoming privatized by the early 2000s, China was poised for substantial economic reform and growth. In order for Chinese companies to expand and to be able to secure further financial capital investment, companies were seeking IPOs on the Shenzhen or Shanghai markets. In seeking these Chinese market IPOs, the long and much more stringent Chinese process could potentially take up to two and a half years at the rate of 10 companies a month being listed.  Reasoning = Access to funding = For private Chinese firms looking to expand and obtain capital investment, they could only raise private forms of equity through private investors, venture capitalists, etc. A company with public status on a United States exchange would give them the ability to access much larger pools of public investments and an entry into the United States capital markets. Being listed on a United States exchange would also enhance companies' credibility, making it appear to investors that the companies are in compliance with the United States' corporate governance standards.Bu, Qingxiu (2013) \\"The Chinese Reverse Merger Companies (RMCs) Reassessed: Promising but Challenging,\\" Journal of International Business and Law: Vol. 12: Iss. 1, Article 3. Available at: http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/jibl/vol12/iss1/3 = Ease of obtaining public status = The process of obtaining public status through a reverse merger is much faster than that of an IPO, usually taking roughly 6 months instead of years. The sped-up process also helps the company cut many costs and avoids underwriting fees of an investment bank that is involved with an IPO procedure. Because the Chinese government does not allow the SEC to oversee these businesses, they can progress relatively unimpeded.  During the Great Recession= China's economic boom = Steep growth in the early 21st century for China as measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) After the financial crisis spread from the United States to China, China was one of the first to implement an economic stimulus plan to attract further investment through large amounts of government spending which was called seed funding. The plan was focused toward large manufacturing and civil infrastructure projects all with the ultimate goal of recovery growth when in presence of slowing exports. China approved subsidies and increased credit that stimulated private investment, showing the country was ready to rely less on government participation to encourage growth. = Investment abroad = With the burst of Chinese Reverse Mergers, it was measured in 2012 that there was greater than 300 U.S. listed Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges. With sales and earnings still growing while the majority of other places in the world were slowing, investors saw opportunity in these easy-to-purchase stocks. With the growth coming in China from the economic stimulus package, lucrative startups originating in mainland China were hard to invest in due to the restriction to foreigners being able to invest in China A-shares and the complicated process to obtain them through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor system. Being listed on established U.S. stock exchanges made for an easy opportunity for abroad investors to purchase stock in prospective companies in which they saw growth in the emerging market sector.  Regulation, fraud, and stock price volatility = Regulation and Secrecy Laws = Seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission The overwhelming main cause of why such a large influx of Chinese companies were easily able to enter the United States markets through these reverse mergers is that U.S. regulators are not able to investigate and monitor these companies under China's federal authority. As for China, these companies registered on the U.S. exchanges and not on the Chinese exchanges gives little incentive for Chinese regulators to oversee these firms‚Äô actions due to the exchange location. For these companies, their audits are a source of controversy between the United States and Chinese governments. A U.S. based accounting firm cannot officially open an office in China, so they run the business through a foreign affiliate under the cover of a multinational enterprise. An example of the complex system of the foreign affiliates is the case of U.S. based accounting firm Deloitte Touche when they were asked to exhibit the audits from the Shanghai affiliate by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deloitte was bounded by Chinese secrecy laws in exhibiting the audits and elected to not. The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission and Public Accounting Oversight Board are working on an agreement for greater oversight of these Chinese reverse merger companies. Even with the discussions of an agreement, the SEC is tightening the prerequisites needed for a company to pursue public status through a reverse merger. = Fraud = As the Chinese companies gained access to the U.S. markets through these reverse mergers, the majority of them were looking to make a quick profit. To make the companies look more attractive for potential investors, companies largely overstated revenue figures, inflated assets holdings, stated customers and employees that did not exist, and exercised other faulty business practices in relation to corporate governance that would easily misled investors. The practice of fraud in these companies was a system feeding from top management and moving throughout the companies, with the understanding that the goal was to deceive and make a large profit. In recent studies on the effects of Chinese reverse mergers, Charles Lee and colleagues suggested that, in their research, the accounting fraud of these Chinese reverse merger (CRM) companies was so in depth that they could not expose the fraud when looking at data of three years since the initial public listing date. Further research displays that over 150 Chinese reverse merger companies on U.S. stock exchanges have exercised unethical/fraudulent business and accounting practices. = Stock price volatility = For investors who have been exposed to the negative news and accusations that surrounded the CRM companies, their mistrust was a cause for large losses and price volatility of these stocks. Chinese reverse merger companies as of 2011 have seen a nearly 50% decrease in stock price. One study in the China Journal of Accounting Research showed for the CRM companies in which fraud was potentially evident, their stock prices post accusations were extremely poor and none of the companies could recover to price levels seen prior to the accusations. 63.7% had continuing falling prices and only four observed firms even made it to greater than 70% of the former stock price. A proper example of stock price volatility for these companies can be found with China Green Agriculture (CGA), where after a report by J Capital Research accusing the company of fraud due to the manipulation to the real value of the company, CGA's stock price plummeted 10% on the day of the report and fell from a starting of $9.05 to $4.45.  Whistleblowing and short-sellers  As the problems in these CRM companies began to appear, a number of whistleblowers and accusers were prominent, mainly investment institutions, research groups, and individual analysts. Ten investment institutions came forward, including Absaroka Capital Management, GeoInvesting, and Kerrisdale Capital. Research groups collectively accounted for 35 accusations, including Glaucus Research Group, International Financial Research & Association, Muddy Waters Research, Variant View Research, Citron Research, and Lucas McGee Research. Ten accusations came from individual analysts. From 2010 to 2011, it was noted that 62 CRM's were accused of fraud by these eventual short sellers. = Short-selling = With the intent of exposing faulty financial reporting on the CRM companies' behalf, whistleblowers began to aggressively short them. Their main purpose in researching these companies was to investigate into the suspiciously high growth in both accounts receivable, revenue, and profits. This was especially prevalent when comparing these numbers to industry competitors of the period and past financial history of the company. The lack of strong internal control by upper management, less than standard audit reports, and low levels of managerial shareholdings of these CRMs made them a target for short sellers looking to do financial investigative research.  Legal and financial repercussions  The short selling and fraud allegations of 62 CRM companies from 2010-2011 lead to a nearly 50% decrease in equity values of CRMs as a whole. A look into the 12-month performance index by Bloomberg reveals that about 80 CRM stock prices peaked in November 2010 at around 200, then sharply declined to under 100 by the end of the year. During this intense period of fraud allegations by short sellers, the SEC legally de-listed or halted the trading of more than 20 CRM companies in 2011. The consistent negative publicity surrounding the accused CRM companies had an also adverse effect on the stock prices of both accredited CRM firms and Chinese IPOs. Resulting from the halted trading and delisting of the various CRM firms from 2010-2011, all US-listed Chinese companies (both IPOs and CRMs) lost roughly 72% in market capitalization. As for the legal repercussions surrounding CRM companies, the SEC wrote a notice highlighting the potential dangers to investors accompanied with investing in CRMs. The notice also explained the reasons for de-listing or halting trading of firms that at the time had been recently investigated. The study in the China Journal of Accounting Research furthered showed that of 37 lawsuits initiated by law firms, there were only 7 settled cases resulting in a verdict and 20 unsolved cases without final verdicts.

To coincide with the tour, the band re-recorded the album and made it available to purchase at venues during the tour. While the album involved original band member Stephen Luscombe, he did not join the band on tour due to health reasons.

Description  Austrotriconodon is known only from its teeth. Their similarity to the triconodont teeth of mammals such as eutriconodonts has caused taxonomic confusion and referral of this taxon to eutriconodonta; however, discovery of similar teeth in animals such as Cronopio has led to its reinterpretation as a meridolestidan.  Discovery and species  Austrotriconodon fossils were found in the Argentinean Los Alamitos Formation, dating to the Campanian or Maastrichtian age. The only known fossils are two lower premolariform teeth. The holotype of A. mckennai was later referred to by Bonaparte as \\"A. ferox\\" in the caption to an image figuring it. This name has been ignored by later researchers and is considered an objective synonym of A. mckennai. A second species, A. sepulvedai, was named by Bonaparte in 1992.

The Victorian Georgian building previously served as store houses and maritime bonded warehouses. It was built from 1850 to 1861. It faces Campbells Cove, an inlet in the north-west of Sydney Cove. In the 1970s, along with the general decline of commercial shipping activities in Sydney Cove, the building was converted for use as tourist-orientated restaurants and bars. It is also known as Old Metcalfe Bond; Campbells Store. The property is owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. The lease to the building is held by private hospitality company Tallawoladah Pty Ltd. From 2015 to 2018, the leaseholder undertook a refurbishment costing 32 million. Restaurants began opening in the refurbished building from autumn 2019.  History  Robert Campbell was born in Scotland, and went to India in 1798 to join his elder brother in the Calcutta business partnership of Campbell and Co. The firm had sent a speculative cargo to Sydney Cove in 1796. Robert Campbell followed in 1798, with another cargo. He bought land at Dawes Point overlooking Sydney Cove from John Baughan and commenced trading gradually building up a reputation as a shrewd but honest merchant. In September 1801, he married Sophia Palmer, sister of John Palmer, who became Commissary of New South Wales. By November 1801, some of Campbell's Storehouses were complete, as was a stone wall and small wharf at right angles to the main warehouse. It was claimed to be the first privately owned wharf in Australia. In 1802, Campbell and Sophia moved into Wharf House which was then incomplete. Beneath their house, vaults to store goods were excavated in the sandstone rock face. John Lewin's watercolour of 1808 showed the jetty completed out from the vaults, a two- storey storehouse and an access road to Wharf House running behind this jetty. Governor Lachlan Macquarie was anxious to grant land to settlers who were building large and substantial improvements on their Sydney leases. Hence on 29 June 1814, Robert Campbell was granted 3 acres, 3 roods, bounded on the south by the premises occupied by the Naval Officer, on the southwest by a road leading to Dawes Point Battery, and on the east by Sydney Cove, \\"in consequence of his having erected thereon several large and expensive Buildings\\". A right to make streets was reserved to the Crown. In May 1807, Campbell had been appointed Naval Officer and a magistrate. As a result of his sympathy for Governor Bligh, he was marked for persecution by the rebel administration after Bligh was deposed. Campbell was later restored to full control of his business by the arrival of Governor Macquarie in 1810, but he was forced to leave it in the hands of Charles Hook, when he went back to Britain to give evidence at the trials following the rebellion. He returned on 18 March 1815 to find his business bankrupt and many of his ships wrecked. He sought compensation from the government. Campbell operated as a commission agent until he was able to operate as merchant again. On 4 January 1822 Campbell formally received compensation from the government for the loss of his ships while he was in England from 1812-15. He built warehouses along the edge of the water, they were all complete by 1825 and they are shown in Stewart's 1825 copy of Harper's map of 1823. These are not the subject Campbell's Stores. Robert Campbell, senior, signed a partnership agreement with his sons who were gradually coming into the management of the firm in 1828. By about 1830 his son, John Campbell, had virtually taken over the business. Equipment for the wharf was also acquired. The Magistrates Returns of Manufactories, Mill etc, in 1831 showed Robert Campbell senior, of Campbell's Wharf, has one hydraulic pump at wharf. By 1838, R Campbell & Co was listed as possessing one crane. John Campbell officially took over as head of the firm in 1836, when it was in financial difficulty. On 6 May 1836, Campbell's Wharf was advertised for sale in the press. It was followed by an injunction to prevent the sale of Campbell's Wharf shortly afterwards. Whatever further action was necessary seems to have been successful, since the wharf remained in the hands of the Campbell family. Although control of the firm was largely in the hands of Campbell's sons, the title to the land on which the wharf was situated was in Robert's name, and so he continued to be involved in matters regarding the land. On 21 January 1841 Robert Campbell formally applied to the Colonial Secretary for permission to enlarge part of his wharf so that ships could unload at low tide, by using a large rock which could not be removed by dredging as the foundation for the enlargement of the wharf. The Colonial Engineer, George Barney, minuted that he could find no objection to the enlargement of the wharf. Over the years, the area of Campbell's Wharf increased as more land was reclaimed. On 29 June 1843, Robert Campbell senior, of George Street, Sydney, mortgaged the wharf to The Australian Trust Company for for three years with interest. The area was specified as being 3 acres 3 roods as in the 1814 grant. The need to mortgage the wharf indicated two alternative strategies being applied by the family to their interest. One was that they were mobilising all their available assets for improvements to their property and business to create a better liquidity. Alternatively, the dating of the mortgage, in the wake of one of the most devastating financial depressions in early Australia, may indicate an attempt to salvage their business using their land as a source of working capital. Whatever the reason for the initial mortgage, it was renewed again and again in following decades, so that the Campbell family did not hold complete equity in the wharf again. There eventually appears to have been some dispute between the Campbells and later mortgagees who took over the loan in later years. Only in 1877, after taking the matter to the Supreme Court, were the Campbells to regain possession of Campbell's Wharf again. Robert Campbell senior was not to know anything of these travails regarding the wharf. On 11 October 1845, he drew up his will leaving his property in six parts to be divided amongst his sons John, Robert, Charles, George, and daughter Sophia Ives Campbell and Arthur Jeffreys, the husband of his daughter, Sarah. On 15 April 1846, Robert Campbell senior died at Duntroon. The first rate assessment of the City of Sydney taken in 1845 showed the following structures on Campbell's Wharf: a house, stores, warehouse and wharf valued at . At the \\"north end of Campbell & Co wharf\\" were three stores plus an office and store, all of three storeys, with slate roofs, valued at each, two of which were vacant and two occupied by Smith and Campbell. Additionally, there was a cottage for the overseer George Atherden, and an empty timber woolshed. The stores identified here appear to be the older stone stores on the waterfront built in the 1820s and not the subject stores which were constructed in the early 1850s. Between 25 August 1851 and 27 September 1852, the Sydney City Council Rate Assessment Book shows that on Campbell's Wharf, J Campbell had added five stores which were built of stone, with slate roofs, all provisionally assessed at a net value per annum of . These are the first five bays of Campbell's Stores. The 1858 Rate Assessment Book shows that the three-storey stone warehouses on the water's edge from the 1820s were still extant. Amongst the array of other wharf buildings were five warehouses of stone with slate roofs, built as two storeys with two rooms in them. Three operate as warehouses while two are conducted as a combined warehouse and office, with four rooms. Soon afterwards, construction of additional warehouse bays commenced. A photograph from the MF Moresby Album dated between 1856 and 1860 showed ten bays with the base of the eleventh bay under construction and awaiting its roof, as well as what appear to be construction materials in front of it. The construction of the additional bays is confirmed by the 1861 Rate Assessment Book which shows that a further six bays had been added to the five bays of the warehouse which were extant in 1858, making eleven bays in all. All bays are of two storeys with two rooms in each. This work is further confirmed by the 1865 Trig Survey of Sydney, completed by the City Council as the prelude to constructing sewers. As construction work on the stores was being completed, Robert Campbell junior died at Duntroon, on 30 March 1859 leaving his elder brother John in charge of the firm. A wide range of tenants took up warehouse space at Campbell's Wharf, some of them in Campbell's Stores. In 1858-59, Sands Directory lists the following at Campbell's Wharf: Campbell & Co; Sugar Company's stores; JC Dibbs & Co, commission agents and wharfingers; Robert Nash, storekeeper; WH Eldred, Capt, Chili Flour Co; Chilian Consulate - Consul, WH Eldred. In 1861, it shows: Campbell & Co; Colonial Sugar Refining Co, stores; Peruvian guano stores; George Lloyd & Co stores; Robey & Co's stores; George Lewis custom house officer; and WH Eldred, broker & general agent. In 1863, it shows: 4. Merry Willis and Co, merchants; 3. Henry Fisher & Son, sugar factors; 2. Brown & Co, merchants; 1. EM Sayers & Co, merchants; Robert Nash; WH Eldred, merchant; 4. Joseph Kendall, marine surveyor; JA Buttrey & Co, merchants; 5 and 6, Daniel Thacker & Co, merchants; 22 Campbell's stores; and John Campbell, merchant. Commercial tenants continued to occupy the stores. A photograph of 1870 showed the eleven bays of the completed warehouse. As late as 1875, the cemetery which had been established on part of Campbell's land in the 1790s before he took possession of the site was still visible at the rear of the store, where a tombstone of a marine, John Jones, who died in 1792 could be made out. A description of Campbell's Wharf in November 1875 stated that it had a landing area of which was backed by 22 very strong stone stores which, along with two sheds on the wharf, could hold . An accompanying engraving based upon some of the extant photographs showed eleven bays of the stores which are two storeys high. =Relationship with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company= Campbell's Wharf with the ASN Co building in the background, pictured in 2007. Negotiations for the purchase of Campbell's Wharf by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company (ASN Co.) appear to have been well advanced by early 1876. The company's old wharf at Sussex Street had become too small for its expanding trade and it needed a newer more central one. On 18 February 1876, the company applied to the Minister of Lands to extend Campbell's Wharf, which they had recently purchased, by running out jetties on piles into the harbour. An accompanying diagram showed that they had already reached the specified limit for reclamation from the harbour. Their application was approved on 1 May 1876. A plan was drawn by Surveyor Wansborough of reclaimed land claimed for purchase by ASN Co. on 19 October 1877. In May 1876, the ASN Co. was stated by the company secretary to have bought Campbell's Wharf for . Before the sale could be finalised there were some impediments in the title which the Campbells had to eliminate, most notably the outstanding mortgage from June 1843 now held by the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company of Sydney. John Campbell applied for the purchase of reclaimed land in front of Campbell's Wharf, measuring 2 roods 5 perches on 6 January 1877. The plan by JF Mann dated 4 January 1877 which accompanied the application showed the water frontage and some buildings but not Campbell's Stores. The plan showed the original High Water Mark as being in front of the stores. Since no limit had been laid down for the High Water Mark in this area, the application was accepted. A detailed press report of November 1877 outlined the changes made by the ASN Co. to Campbell's Wharf. It built a new wharf, under the superintendence of Thomas Macredie. A wharf 320 feet long was under construction with two jetties long. A new road wide was planned to join George Street running in front of the Mariner's Church. For construction of the wharfs, turpentine was used for all timber exposed to seawater, while ironbark and other hardwoods were used for the braces, beams and planking. A seawall was built from stone quarried from the company's old works at Pyrmont, as was stone for its new offices. An accompanying illustration showed Campbell's Store with eleven bays and two storeys. A proposal of 1878 to extend George Street North through the land of the ASN Co. appears to have been linked with the development by the company. Between 1877 and 1878, the tenancy of the stores changed. In 1877, they were called 'Campbell's Bonded Stores'. In 1878, the Sands Directory showed the ASN Co.'s wharf here. On the site was \\"The Metcalfe Bond and Free Stores\\" with D. Murray as the warehouse keeper. The stores retained the name \\"Metcalfe Stores\\" thereafter. John Campbell was permitted to receive a Grant by Purchase of Reclaimed Land under the Crown Lands Act of 1 acre 1 rood and 22 perches of land reclaimed from Sydney Cove in front of Campbell's Wharf for , and the grant was issued on 17 December 1878. On 4 July 1879, he formally transferred title to the reclaimed land to the ASN Co. In October 1879, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company leased the southern part of the wharf at per annum. On 15 February 1881, a further lease of part of the wharf to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was signed. Parts of the land that had formed Campbell's property were hived off. In January 1880, a strip of land was sold to the City Council for to widen George Street North. Land facing George Street was put in the hands of various auctioneers for sale. Richardson and Wrench offered 19 lots between Horse Ferry Road and George Street for sale on 15 October 1880. To the east were shown \\"Metcalfe Bonded and Free Stores\\" on the sale plan. The company secretary reported that in May 1881, the ASN Co. had sold 'Campbell's Garden' for . The company let the former Campbell's Stores, now known as the Metcalfe Bond Stores, to a variety of tenants. In 1882, J Upward appeared in the Sands Directories as the proprietor of the \\"Metcalfe Bonded Stores\\". A photograph of \\"Metcalfe Bonded and Free Stores\\" dating from the early 1880s shows J. Upward as the proprietor while the building still had two storeys. When a survey of the area was completed by Charles Bullock for the Surveyor-General in December 1882, his plan showed the buildings as \\"Bonded and Free Stores\\" with the Branch Store of the Government Printing Office at the northern end. In September 1884, the ASN Co. accepted a contract for ¬£30,000 for the building of new offices and four stores on the site of Campbell's old house. The stores known as Campbell's Stores were not demolished, probably since they were still relatively modern in layout and design being then only a little over thirty years old. Probably to enable them to finance the work, the company took out a mortgage on 31 March 1885 to the Australian Mutual Provident Society of their land. Rather than demolish Campbell's Stores, the company enlarged them. H. P. Dove's plans drawn for insurance companies about 1882 showed the Metcalfe Bond as a two- storey masonry building, with eleven bays, with each divided into two floors, bond or free. When the revisions to these plans were published in 1887, his plans showed the Metcalfe Bond as now being of three floors. It was still of eleven bays, but an extra level to each bay ensured there were three rooms. Interconnecting doors were shown within each group of three bays. These works were completed before major changes in the ownership of the wharf. By 1886, the ASN Co. had become over-extended due to its efforts to match the competition and prices of its rival shipping firms. A major tactical blunder had been the purchase of Campbell's Wharf and the subsequent cost of rebuilding the wharf. While it allowed the company to make some welcome profits from the capital values of the land, especially from the sale of the strip of land facing George Street, the relocation of the company away from its original base in Darling Harbour took it away from the hub of the coastal shipping trade. Additionally, it had to pay a higher cartage charge on its goods from Circular Quay. Matters became ever more difficult for the company so that it made an overture to the Queensland Steam Shipping Company on 30 October 1886, which resulted in the amalgamation of the two companies to form the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company. It took over all assets of the ASN Co. except the engineering works. The company already had adequate wharfage and found Campbell's Wharf redundant. On 21 May 1887, the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, then in liquidation, offered Campbell's Wharf to the government for . It had sold all of its steam ships. Most of the wharf was described as leased. The description of the wharf included amongst its listing \\"Eleven 3-story [sic] stores built of brick on stone\\", which were known as the Metcalfe Bond and were let to J. Upward at with a lease running until July 1890. The government responded on 26 July 1887 that it was only willing to offer for the ASN wharf, an offer which was later accepted by the shareholders of the company. = Ownership by the Crown = On 27 September 1887, the Government Surveyor, S. E. Perdriau surveyed the land and found that it comprised 3 acres 10 perches, of which 1 acre 2 roods and 28 perches were part of the 1814 grant and 1 acre 1 rood 22 perches were included in the 1878 grant of reclaimed land. A plan which was filed with the papers for the sale to the government and probably prepared by Perdriau showed all the buildings on the site. The formal conveyance of the wharf from the ASN Co. to The Crown occurred on 28 October 1887, for . The plan accompanying the deed showed that part of Campbell's 1814 grant, along Lower George Street, had been sold to J. W. Cliffe and W. Clarke. It also showed all buildings on the site. The Metcalfe Stores was shown as partially built on the reclaimed land and not wholly on the 1814 grant. The government demolished most of the buildings to build a Navigation Board slipway, leaving only the Metcalfe Bond stores. It ejected the P & O Company from its lease and leased the land to Blackwall and Company who demolished the P & O buildings and built new ones, which were occupied in 1888 by Flood and Company. The 1889 Detail Survey showed an outline of the Metcalfe Bond stores. The 1895 version of the survey showed the outline of the stores shown with Branch Office, Government Printing Office at the northern end. Re-decking of the old ASN Co. wharf was undertaken by the Public Works Department in 1890 at a cost of . Upward & Co. of Circular Quay continued to lease the Metcalfe Stores, at least until 1901. In 1901, the Sydney Harbour Trust took over the Stores. The 1901 Darling Harbour Resumption Plan shows the Metcalfe Stores as Bond and Free Stores with a branch of the Government Printing Office at the northern end. The survey appears to be based upon the 1895 Detail Survey. The same year, the Sydney Harbour Trust came to an agreement with Norddeutscher Lloyd to build it a new wharf measuring wide, with offices and other buildings which the company would lease for three years at per annum. Associated with this work was the reconstruction of the twin piers into a substantial central jetty, with full length sheds. Also in 1901, the Sydney Harbour Trust compiled a Register of Assets, which described for the former Campbell's Wharf, \\"Two large store stone and brick, slate roof each three floors. The Southern Store has eleven divisions built of stone and brick. The Northern Store has four divisions built of Stone\\". A memo regarding the Northern Store stated To be demolished. The tenant of the Southern Store was given as \\"Upward & Coy\\" at per annum payable monthly. The Sydney Harbour Trust maintained the Metcalfe Stores and did not demolish it in the wholesale removal of buildings which accompanied the building of the Norddeutscher Lloyd wharf. In 1902, it undertook repairs costing to Metcalfe's Bond Store. Small repairs were shown in later reports. During the twentieth century, a series of other modifications have been made. In 1932, a fire broke out in the northern addition to the Metcalfe Bond stores which housed part of the Government Printing Office and the offices of Metcalfe and Upward. Metcalfe and Upward moved after the fire to the second floor in the centre of the stores. The brick section damaged by the fire was later rebuilt. In 1958, the southernmost bay of the Metcalfe Stores was removed to allow construction of the Overseas Passenger Terminal, leaving ten bays. The move of commercial maritime activities out of Sydney Cove and into Darling Harbour and Pyrmont affected Campbell's Stores in the twentieth century. During the late nineteenth century, Circular Quay developed as a terminus for sightseers and day- trippers. The mix of commercial and recreational activities was causing Sydney Cove to become heavily congested, particularly at weekends. One of the first acts of the Harbour Trust after it gained control of the area in 1901 was an attempt to relieve congestion by the resumption of foreshore land and constructing two jetties and a longshore wharf on the eastern side of Bennelong Point. The eastern side of the quay was devoted to recreational traffic by the 1930s and was completely remodelled for that purpose in the 1950s, commercial activity continued in the vicinity of Campbell's Wharf into the late 1950s and early 1960s. Yet the importance of that area for commercial shipping had declined and this was reflected in changing use patterns of Campbell's Stores. After the erection of the Overseas Passenger Terminal in the 1960s, the area was no longer used as a commercial shipping area, as all such activity had moved to Darling Harbour and Pyrmont. Campbell's Stores subsequently came into the control of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (later Sydney Cove Authority) after being handed over by the Maritime Services Board (successor to the Sydney Harbour Trust) in the 1970s. The Sydney Cove Authority later redeveloped the stores and paved the way for the Store's current use as a restaurant area. In the mid-1980s, substantial works were undertaken in the vicinity of Campbell's Stores as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations that included the removal of some of the wharfage near Campbell's Stores. In 1998, the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority assumed control of the area including the Campbell's Stores.  Description  The site comprises the land to the north to the Park Hyatt Hotel, to the harbour sea wall to the east, and to the south east covering the site of the original Campbell Stores building. The new Metcalfe Stores, on the site of the Campbell gardens, is a related site. Campbell's Stores comprise eleven gable fronted, three storey high rectangular plan bays. The bays are oriented almost due east west and, when constructed, were built partially on reclaimed land and were only about from the wharf edge. The building as a whole is oriented almost due north-south. The northernmost bay (Bay 11) is of different materials and construction to the other ten bays and was the last built being completed about 1890s. It abuts the homogenous series of ten bays which are immediately to the south. Bays 1-10 are almost identical measuring wide and long. Bays 1-10 have a continuous front (east facade) and rear (west facade) with openings in both. The ground floor in all bays is presently a concrete slab while Level 2 and Level 3 floors are timber boards on timber joists. The simple roofs are slate sheathed with lead capping and copper-lined trough gutters. Bays 1-10 are sandstone constructions both internally and externally to the top of Level 2, with brick above, including the gable ends. The first five bays to be constructed were built in 1851/52 and are the present Bays 6-10. A further three bays, which are the present Bays 3-5 were completed around 1858 and the final three bays were finished by 1860. Of these last three bays, the southernmost and the final one to be completed was demolished in 1958 to make way for the first overseas shipping terminal at Circular Quay. This left two bays, now known as Bays 1 and 2, and the remaining eight to form the group known as the Campbell's Stores. The building was stepped up towards the south with a rise of about between Bays 1 and 2 and Bays 4 and 5, the change in level being most evident by the string course at gable level and the second level sill course. When originally completed the building was only two storeys high.Godden Mackay, 1996. Note: This building contains a hydraulic hoist and single cylinder gas engine which are important items located within the building. Style: Maritime Georgian; Storeys: 3; Facade: Sandstone (Bays 1-10) to the top of Level 2, with brick above, including the gable ends. Bay 11 is brick.; Side Rear Walls: Sandstone; Internal Walls: Sandstone; Roof Cladding: The roofs are slate sheathed with lead capping and copper-lined trough gutters; Floor Frame: The ground floor in all bays is a concrete slab while Level 2 & 3 floors are timber boards on timber joists; Roof Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 24 May 2006, externally, the building is in fair condition: there are cracks in the walls and sandstone pointing is required.Wyborn, P., 1999. Internally, some sections of sandstone walling on the lowest level are in a highly deteriorated condition. Also, much alteration which has caused damage to or obscured significant fabric and fitout work has been undertaken. The Campbell's Stores site has potential archaeological, scientific and research significance relevant to earlier uses and the development of the site. Timber gantries have been removed and are in storage at 190 Cumberland Street. Preventative maintenance has been undertaken to the remaining timbers. Potential archaeological resource. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Terraced into hill slope from Campbells Cove. Investigation: Archaeological Assessment = Modifications and dates = Sometime between 1882 and 1887, the third level was added to the stores. Unlike the lower two levels, this addition was in dry pressed, well consolidated brick, laid in English bond. The stone gable end was completely removed and replaced with brick. In or 1915 an additional bay was built on the northern end. In 1958, the southern bay was demolished for the construction of the Overseas Passenger Terminal. Since then, Campbell Stores have undergone at least two adaptations. The first was sometime before 1970 and little is known of it. The newly established SCRA oversaw the most fundamental change in usage of Campbell's Stores from commercial to tourist uses, and the greatest change in fabric since the addition of the third level in 1883. The restoration, commenced in 1974/75 and completed 1978/79 was one of the first major restoration projects in Sydney, and included replacement of damaged sandstone and construction of a service tunnel along the full length of the western side of the building. In general, the work done in the 1970s has remained unchanged until today.SCRA Annual Reports 1975-79 Some remedial work has been undertaken to stonework in poor repair since 1996. = 2015-2018 redevelopment = In 2011 discussions were initiated between Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA) and a Joint Venture comprising Dockside and Imperial Peking restaurant group. Dockside and Imperial Peking restaurant group are the major lessees within the Campbell‚Äôs Stores. By letter dated 19 November 2012 the existing lessees put forward submissions to SHFA including a Financial Offer for the re-development of Campbell‚Äôs Stores. Existing lessees formed a Special Purpose Vehicle, Tallawoladah (Pty Limited) for the purposes of the submission and ongoing negotiations. Following SHFA‚Äôs review of the Tallawoladah Financial Offer, SHFA confirmed in principal agreement to proceed by separating the building and public domain works, including the lowering of the Promenade with the lowering of the Promenade to be within the NSW Government‚Äôs scope and at their risk. The in principle agreement set out terms including rent, rent escalation and period of lease for an Agreement to Lease The proposed renovation included: *Removal of intrusive exterior elements and internal fit- outs of little significance: The overall significance of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores is to be recaptured with the removal the 1980s shade canopies and sail ship masts from the eastern elevation that fronts the promenade to Campbell‚Äôs Cove, removal of the 1980s south brick wall duct to Bay 1, and removal of the glazed pavilion at the north end of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores, referred to as Bay 12. The interior of Campbell‚Äôs Stores is to be cleared of numerous kitchen and amenity areas, goods lifts, stairways and all services, including redundant air- conditioning. These works will improve the presentation of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores with enhanced visibility, particularly from the promenade and the harbour, as well as the exposure of internal fabric and the facilitation of required conservation. *Conservation and reconstruction works: The existing sandstone building will be sensitively conserved to highlight and celebrate the historic contribution of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores to the settlement of Sydney. A range of remediation works will address the current deterioration of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores building, including upgrading the existing subfloor stormwater infrastructure, the forecourt pavement levels and the provision of subfloor ventilation. The works also include the conservation of deteriorated fabric, replacement of the slates to the roof, and reconstruction of redundant internal wall and floor openings. These form part of the conservation works established by SHFA (and their consultants) to reverse the existing deterioration of the original building fabric, including the sandstone walls, which will make a significant contribution to the delivery of the key recommendations contained within the Conservation Management Plan prepared by Godden Mackay Logan in 2014 (for SHFA) and endorsed by the Heritage Council. *Adaptive reuse and revitalisation: The adaptive reuse of Campbell‚Äôs Stores includes improved through site public access, new amenities and new services‚Äô infrastructure for future kitchen fit-outs. Proposed adaptive reuse will be complemented by a new stand-alone canopy along the forecourt for patron amenity, and a new stand-alone structure to the north, referred to as ‚ÄòBay 12‚Äô, which allows for the integration of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores into the precinct of The Rocks. The proposed adaptive reuse of the existing building for restaurants, cafes and bars will complete the planned conservation of the Campbell‚Äôs Stores to an ongoing viable use for future generations. The continued use of the building for restaurants is in accordance with the recommendations of the Conservation Management Plan, which seeks to maximise public access to the Campbell‚Äôs Stores to enable an appreciation of its heritage significance by a broad range of visitors.  Heritage listing  As at 24 February 2005, Campbell's Stores and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Campbell's Stores are a superb example of mid-nineteenth century warehouse buildings, now rare in Sydney. They are the only warehouses of their type remaining on the foreshores of Sydney Cove, the hub of commerce and international shipping transport until the late nineteenth century. As a memorable and easily recognisable landmark in The Rocks, visible from a wide area of Sydney Harbour, they have iconic value as a symbol of mid nineteenth century Sydney. Campbell's Stores have historic significance for their association with the Campbell family, one of the earliest and most influential free immigrant families in Australia. They are the surviving element of a complex of wharves and stores that began in 1801 with the construction by Robert Campbell of the first privately owned wharf in Australia. Later significant associations include the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, one of the most important commercial shipping and transport companies in Australian, and the Sydney Harbour Trust, established by the Government following of the bubonic plague scares of 1901. Campbell Stores is significant for its association with commercial Bond and Free store usage for over one hundred and twenty years, with each successive owner, including the Sydney Harbour Trust and Maritime Services Board, leasing sections of the Stores to a variety of merchant companies. The changes made to Campbell's Stores provide evidence of the changing commercial fortunes of maritime Sydney. The construction of the first five bays demonstrate economic growth following the 1840s depression, and the additional six bays demonstrate further economic growth, following the 1850s gold rushes. The construction of the third level by the ASN Co in the mid 1880s demonstrates a further period of economic growth and also of a change in the functional operation of the Stores, as evidenced by the inter-connection of the top floor spaces. The adaptive reuse of the building in the 1970s represents an early approach to the conservation of historic buildings. The continued subsequent use of the building for a series of restaurants demonstrates the changing uses of Sydney Cove from industrial purposes to largely tourist-related purposes. The design, form and materials of Campbell's Stores contribute to their aesthetic significance as a complex of buildings of high visual and sensory appeal. Their design elements reflect their original function in a simple but dignified manner. Their form is a coherent whole, made up of repetitive gabled bays combined with an undulating rhythm of door and window openings. The consistent use of sandstone, brick and slate materials reinforces this visual coherence and provides an appearance of solidity and quality. Campbell's Stores represent a surviving example of mid nineteenth century style warehouses; a building type once common around Sydney Cove, but now rare. The gabled bay form, cathead beams, hoists, goods aprons and doors are evidence of an older warehouse style. The form, bars on openings and lack of internal connections between bays evidence the security required for bond store use. Campbell's Stores have social significance for their contemporary role in cultural tourism. They are esteemed as an historic icon by Sydney-siders as well as international and domestic tourists, due to their appearance, location and use. Campbell's Stores have technical/research significance because of their potential to contribute further to our understanding of the early maritime activity around Sydney Cove and, in particular, within the Campbell's Wharf complex. They also have the ability to contribute further to our understanding of the use and operations of mid-nineteenth century warehouse buildings, particularly in relation to goods handling and the changes in technology that occurred over time. The remnant hoisting equipment of the Campbell's Stores building provides evidence of the changes of technology in goods handling and haulage that occurred during the nineteenth and twentieth century. The hydraulic hoisting equipment and the winches in particular are evocative of the industrial nature of the site and the hydraulic hoists are prominent examples within the Sydney area. They demonstrate the scale and efficiency of the industrial processes undertaken at Campbell's Stores during its use as dockside goods storage.Godden Mackay Logan, 2004. High Significance Fabric: Original fabric from the first three phases of construction (up to ). Industrial items including the hydraulic hoist are also of high significance. Medium Significance Fabric: Bay 11 (Branch Stores Government Printer) , Bay 10 alterations made to facilitate the construction of Hickson Road, . New door openings made on Level 2 as a result of the construction of Hickson Road in . Low Significance Fabric: Reconstruction of fabric as part of 1970s restoration program (e.g. sandstone restoration of eastern ground floor facade). Fabric introduced to provide for new uses in 1970s works (e.g. service tunnel at rear, original restaurant, adaptation work, etc.). Campbell's Stores was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Campbell's Stores are a rare example of mid nineteenth century warehousing in Sydney and the only of its type remaining on the foreshores of Sydney Cove. Campbell's Stores provide evidence of the changing nature of activities around Sydney Cove, the importance of this area as the hub of commerce and international shipping transport until the late nineteenth century, and its recent role as a cultural focus of international importance. The construction of the first five bays of Campbell's Stores in 1851-52 demonstrate the improved and changing commercial fortunes of Sydney and the Campbell family from the late 1840s after the earlier depression. The construction of the additional six bays between 1858 and 1861 demonstrate further economic growth and the impact of the 1851 gold rushes, that resulted in an increased colonial population and the need in Sydney and NSW for commercial storage. The construction of the third level of Campbell's Stores by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company in the mid 1880s demonstrates a further period of commercial confidence in Sydney during a highly competitive period when the expansion and absorption of companies was reshaping the corporate structures of New South Wales shipping. The withdrawal of the ASN Co from Campbell's Stores in the late 1880s reflects the increasing dominance of Darling Harbour as the principal area of commercial shipping activity in Sydney. The hydraulic hoists and winches fixed to the building demonstrate some of the technological changes in late nineteenth-century handling of goods. The external fabric of the Campbell's Stores demonstrates four phases of technological change in the handling of goods in and around the building. The loading doors on the two lower levels and the cat-head beams of the manual handling phase were in use during most of the nineteenth century. The presence of loading doors on both levels demonstrates that each space, on the upper and lower levels of the bays, were separate from one another. The installation of hydraulic hoisting equipment following the addition of the third level to the Campbell Stores illustrates the goods handling and haulage technology introduced in the late nineteenth century. The hydraulic rams, the gas engine-driven winch and the two motor-driven winches were integral to the efficiency of third floor and demonstrate the development in hoisting equipment from the traditional cat- head hoist at the turn of the century. The internal layout of the Campbell's Stores clearly demonstrates the importance of the lifting devices to the efficiency of operations on all levels. By the twentieth century, all of level three of the Campbell's Store building was served by mechanical lifting equipment, and previously separate bays were linked by openings in the walls on the upper level. The acquisition of Campbell's Stores by the Government in 1887 is evidence of a broader government interest in controlling infrastructure and utilities, increasing interest in this area as a base for its own maritime activities. Evidence of the Government acquisition is provided by the establishment of the Branch Stores Office of the Government Printing Office, adjacent to the northern end of Campbell's Stores (now Bay 11). The construction of Hickson Road and its impact on Campbell's Stores is evidence of work of the Sydney Harbour Trust and the changes that occurred in this area as a result of the bubonic plague scares of 1901. Evidence of the construction of Hickson Road is found in the alterations to the west facade of Bay 10 and the current alignment of Bay 11. Campbell Stores are significant for their association with commercial Bond and Free Store usage for over one hundred and twenty years from 1851 to , with each successive owner, including the Sydney Harbour Trust and Maritime Services Board, leasing sections of the Stores to a variety of merchant companies. The demolition of the southernmost bay of Campbell's Stores to facilitate construction of the elevated roadway for the Overseas Passenger Terminal development is evidence of a shift away from the traditional usage of this area. The fabric and use changes instigated by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in the early 1970s are further evidence of the increasing importance of The Rocks as a tourist destination and cultural area and an interest in historic buildings generally. This was one of the first major adaptive reuse and restoration projects undertaken in Sydney and it reflects the philosophical approach to conservation at the time. The existence of Campbell's Stores is indicative of the success of the \\"green bans\\" in the 1970s which prevented the wholesale redevelopment of The Rocks. The changes that have occurred since the 1970s in the fit-out of the leased areas for restaurant use reflect different aspirations and approaches to the recycling of historic buildings. The interior of the Waterfront Restaurant reflects an \\"historic\\" maritime character, the 'Imperial Peking'; and the \\"Italian Village\\" are based on a transformation of character using Asian and European cultural imagery, while respectively, \\"Wolfies\\" involves a contemporary fit-out which retains more of the original spatial character and finishes than the other examples. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Campbell's Stores are associated with the Campbell family, one of the first free immigrant families in Australia and one of the most influential. Campbell's Stores are a surviving element of an evolving complex of wharves and stores that began with the construction by Robert Campbell (Sen), the founder of the dynasty, of the first privately owned wharf in Australia, in 1801. Although Campbell's Stores were not built for Robert Campbell (Sen), they was erected for the firm he created which was then managed by his sons. The first five bays of Campbell's Stores demonstrate the consolidation of this pioneer commercial dynasty rather than the pioneering phase of that family's growth. Campbell's Stores were associated with one of the most important commercial shipping and transport companies in Australian history, the ASN Co. The construction of the third level of Campbell's Stores by the ASN Co. in the mid 1880s demonstrates the company's commercial confidence in Sydney. The withdrawal of the ASN Co. from Campbell's Stores in the late 1880s reflects the financial over-extension of the Company. The technology in use in the operation of the hydraulic hoisting equipment and winch is associated with the Clyde Industries Group, one of the earliest and largest manufacturing organisations in Australian history. The large wheels of the winches mounted on Level 3 in Bays 3 and 9, each bear an embossed inscription bearing the words \\"Hudson Brothers Limited Clyde\\". Hudson Brothers dominated the Australian manufacturing industry in the late nineteenth century and was later amalgamated into Clyde Engineering Co Ltd, responsible for rolling stock, steam locomotives and, most famously, the structural steel for the northern approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Campbell's Stores are a superb example of mid-nineteenth century warehouse buildings; a building type now rare in Sydney. They have iconic value as a representation of early Sydney, particularly in the area around Sydney Cove and The Rocks. The iconic value of their distinctive form is evidenced by their adoption as the logo of the Sydney Cove Authority. They have landmark value as a dominant and easily recognisable form that is visible from a wide area of Sydney Harbour, the Harbour Bridge and North Sydney. The design, form and materials of Campbell's Stores contribute to a complex of buildings of high visual and sensory appeal. Their design reflects and describes the buildings' original function in a simple but dignified manner. Their form is a coherent whole made up of repetitive gabled bays combined with an undulating rhythm of door and window openings. The consistent use of sandstone, brick and slate materials reinforces this visual coherence and provides an appearance of solidity and quality. Campbell's Store have aesthetic significance at a technical level because their form and design details allow for an understanding of their original use. They also represent a surviving example of older style warehouses; a building type once common around Sydney, but now rare. The gabled bay form, cat-head beams, hoists, goods aprons and doors are typical of the older, mid-nineteenth century, warehouse buildings. The gabled bay form, external staircases, bars on openings and lack of internal connections between bays (on Levels 1 and 2) evidence its bond store use. This required secure and segregated spaces, not only between bays but also between levels. The cat-head beams, goods aprons, pulleys, loading doors, hydraulic hoisting equipment and winches are demonstrative of the change from manual handling of goods to the use of hydraulic and other mechanical technology at Campbell's Stores during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The use of hydraulic hoisting equipment and mechanical winches became an integral part of the operations of the Stores, following the addition of a third level in the late nineteenth century. The hydraulic hoisting equipment and winches in particular are a prominent aesthetic element of the Campbell's Stores and are evocative of the industrial origins of this dockside site in Sydney Harbour. The functional design of the third level of the Campbell Stores is significant as it represents a transition in usage between the older style traditional warehouse form of self contained unit bays and the later, larger, warehouses with interconnected spaces. The adaptation of the earlier warehouse illustrates the application of new technology to an older building form. The original internal spatial volumes, timber floor and roof structure and other fabric associated with the original usage of Campbell's Stores is also significant as evidence of their warehouse use and of changes made to them over time for that use. The technology evident in this building such as the hydraulic hoisting equipment is evidence of technical innovation. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Campbell's Stores have social significance within the contemporary community resulting from their role in cultural tourism. They are esteemed as a well known and easily identifiable historic icon by Sydney-siders as well as international and domestic tourists. Its high level of recognition is due, in part, to its location in one of the key recreational and tourist areas in Sydney and because of its popular restaurant use and resultant public exposure. Its greatest exposure, though, is to the thousands of ferry commuters who pass by it daily on their way to and from work in the city. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Campbell's Stores have the potential to contribute further to our understanding of the early maritime operation that occurred around Sydney Cove, and in particular within the Campbell's complex (see Section 4.0). They also have the potential to contribute further to our understanding of the use and operations of mid-nineteenth century warehouse buildings, particularly in the area of goods handling and the changes in technology that occurred over time. The Campbell's Stores site has potential archaeological, scientific and research significance relevant to earlier uses and the development of the site. The archaeological significance may have been reduced due to disturbance from later alterations and refurbishment works to the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Campbell's Stores are a rare example of mid nineteenth century warehousing in Sydney and the only building of its type remaining on the foreshores of Sydney Cove and Sydney Harbour. The collection of late nineteenth-century goods handling equipment is a rare assembly of different types of such equipment in a single location, providing a unique opportunity for comparison and interpretation. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Campbell's Stores demonstrates the evolution and importance of Sydney Cove for maritime trading activities. The building is representative of a class of similar masonry warehouses that were once common on the shores of Sydney Harbour. The changes demonstrate the evolution of increasingly large warehouses in the second half of the nineteenth century, and the activities of the former Sydney Harbour Trust. The materials and construction are representative of mid-nineteenth century warehouses. It provides evidence for the lifting and storage of goods in nineteenth century maritime trade. The exterior of the Campbell's Stores Building displays the hydraulic hoisting equipment in use during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The hydraulic hoisting equipment is representative of a range of similar equipment in use in Sydney at the turn of the nineteenth century.

Its main aim is to give students in the fields of finance, economics, management and engineering, a path to enter the professional world of finance by providing them with lectures, workshops, competitions and connecting them through a global network.  History  The IFSA Network was founded in 2014 in Rotterdam, at the Rotterdam School of Management. Its first focus was to regroup people studying Finance, and connect them both between themselves and established financial actors. It quickly spread across Europe and Asia, before opening chapters in South Africa and the Americas.  Concept  The IFSA Network is composed of different chapters throughout the world. The concept is to have semi-independent units, each composed of their own board & active members and to create synergy between these in order to provide the best opportunities to their members. The objective of the association is to build a comprehensive network that connects finance students across the globe and enable them to interact and communicate with each other.  Hierarchy  Each chapter has a board, composed of at least a Chairman, Vice- Chairman, Treasure and General Secretary. This board manages day to day operations locally and supervises its regional activities. Chapters also typically have departments (Finance, Marketing, Events), with a department head managing the analysts. Chairmen also regularly connect to establish international strategies and overview national operations.  Current Chapters  As of 2017, The IFSA Network has the following chapters: = Europe = Netherlands  Rotterdam School of Management  Switzerland  University of Geneva University of Sankt-Gallen  Russia  New Economic School  Germany  Technical University Ludwig Maximilian University Goethe University Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt = Americas = United States of America  Harvard University Columbia University  Brazil  Federal University of Rio de Janeiro = Africa = South Africa  University of Cape Town = Asia = India  Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies St Stephen's College, Delhi Hansraj College, Delhi  Events = Traders' Cup = The IFSA Trader‚Äôs Cup is the world‚Äôs largest student run trading challenge . All people studying in a recognised university are free to participate. The competition relies on securities trading, and aims to give students an opportunity to distinguish themselves from the competition. The competition is held once per academic year, starting in spring of 2016. For the second edition of the competition, students from more than 35 universities, located in 28 countries on 6 continents competed. = Global Case Competition at Harvard = The Global Case Competition at Harvard is the world‚Äôs most prestigious case competition organized by students. Its goal is to regroup the best students in finance & economics throughout the world for the length of a few days, in order to test their knowledge and skills and offer them a fantastic opportunity to meet like-minded students, world leading institutions, and renowned guests. The competition is a unique opportunity for participants, connecting the worlds smartest academics from the U.S.A., Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. Taking part in this event is also a great moment in which people can interact with the invited companies , financial institutions, guests and partners. For the first two editions this event was organized with the Harvard Extension Business Society, an official Harvard Club. During the first edition, a team from HEC Paris, a leading French university, won the challenge. The second edition was won by the London Business School. = Local Venues = The various IFSA Network chapters try to offer their communities various local events to connect with the professional world. Often, an industry professional will come to the IFSA Network events and meet students. The purpose of those venues is to give students a taste of the professional world, share tips and knowledge, and give an opportunity to network. = Boston Consulting Group Case Competition = In 2018, the IFSA Network in cooperation with the Boston Consulting Group and InvestSoc, organised the first, three-week long International Cape Town Case Competition. The competition has a unique format where teams consisting of 2 to 4 participants, propose solutions for crises that are presented to them. In their solutions, participants are able to showcase their knowledge, creativity and problem-solving skills on a current macroeconomic issue. A jury picks the 15 best international teams and the best local teams, from Cape Town. The selected teams arrive in Cape Town, South Africa, to participate in the second round, and present in front of a select panel of distinguished professors and practitioners. The winning team is awarded a cash prize of 5000 South African Rand.  Network Creation  The IFSA Network is very selective when it comes to opening chapters and selecting board members. Striving for excellency, it will only open chapters in elite universities, and hires only the most ambitious and brightest students. The purpose of this is to ensure smooth operations and maintain a high-level of execution in all of the organisation‚Äôs activities. Ultimately, the goal is to have establishments around the world, regrouping all major academic institutions.

Background  Captain Sensible had grown up musically in the 1960s and 1970s, where \\"some incredible records were being made\\", he said in 2014. \\"The first time I heard The Pretty Things‚Äô S.F. Sorrow, I was transfixed. The concept nature of the album took me on a musical journey‚Ä¶a mind trip, even. It was hugely engrossing, and I started seeking out other records of this kind ‚Äì like The Moody Blues‚Äò Days of Future Passed and Tommy. \\"One day I will make an album like this,\\" I promised myself. And that‚Äôs how Geoffrey Brown came about.\\" The album tells the story of Geoffrey Brown, whose quiet corporate life is turned upside down when aliens start leaving warning messages on his computer screen about mankind's self-inflicted demise. He is abandoned as a crackpot by his wife, co-workers and friends only for the government to recognize his value in the end. Sensible: \\"My main character Geoffrey works at the Ministry of Defence, plotting targets for destruction in a nuclear attack. He considers his job normal until his head is turned by a hippie chick one day on a bicycle ride; he decides to do something more creative with his department‚Äôs missile tracking technology.\\" Captain Sensible came up with the original concept which was condensed into the title track by co-writer Martin Newell. \\"Originally, it was only one song\\", Newell explained in 2011. \\"And then Captain being Captain, said, \\"Do you think we can make a whole album?\\" And I said, \\"We‚Äôve already said it all in one song!\\" So then we had to pad it out. And then Captain said, \\"We need some dialogue.\\" Newell brought the characters to life with some \\"excellent scripts\\", according to Sensible, \\"and we got proper actors to perform the between-song dialogue.\\" Sensible took his inspiration from what he calls \\"the Cold War rhetoric of Reagan and Thatcher.\\" Sensible: \\"The question the album asks is, \\"How did we go from the beautiful love and peace dream of the summer of ‚Äô67 to public acceptance of the Dr. Strangelove world of mutually assured nuclear annihilation?\\" In his book The Damned - The Chaos Years: An Unofficial Biography, writer Barry Hutchinson describes the music as a \\"bright, happy collection of English pop, with some leanings to rock and psychedelia in places.\\"  Critical reception  In a review for AllMusic, Jack Rabid wrote that all of Sensible's \\"usual goofy, nostalgic neo-psychedelic guitar tricks and surprisingly crafted pop tunes are in place\\", adding that \\"such glitzy tunes as \\"Holiday in My Heart,\\" \\"Street of Shame,\\" and the title track claw their way into your affections in a few plays.\\" Rabid felt that the album combines two common Sensible themes: \\"our own self-destructive impulses and the ostracizing of folks who go against accepted practices and actually dare to use their own brains\\".

Charles Hermans at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Through a number of his monumental genre paintings he played an important role in the recognition of Realism in Belgian art.Denis Laoureux (ed.), En nature La Soci√©t√© libre des Beaux-Arts D‚ÄôArtan √† Whistler, Mus√©e F√©licien Rops, 2013, p. 14  Life  Hermans was born in Brussels in a well-off bourgeois family. He showed an interest in art from an early age. In his native city Hermans received some artistic guidance from the painter Louis Gallait. He then studied at the Saint Luc workshop in Brussels, a liberal workshop which offered an alternative to traditional academic education. Between 1858 and 1861 he stayed in Paris where he studied at the workshop of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts.Lucien Solvay, Charles Hermans in: Biographie Nationale de Belgique, p. 672-675 Gleyre was a prominent painter who had taken over the studio of Paul Delaroche in 1843 and taught a number of younger artists who became prominent, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The Masked Ball,Chimei Museum, Tainan, Taiwan From 1862 to 1867, Hermans stayed in Italy. In Rome he became fascinated with the life of the monks, which became a favorite subject of many paintings between 1866 and 1869. The theme of Catholic clergy was popular at the time as evidenced by the vogue of cardinal paintings made by artists such as the Belgian Georges Croegaert.Joost De Geest, 500 chefs-d'oeuvre de l'art belge, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2006, pp. 215 He had an early success with his paintings of clerics. He later made several trips especially in the Mediterranean region and, in particular, Spain.A. Adriaens-Pannier et al., 150 ans d‚Äôart belge : dans les collections des Mus√©es royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique, 26 September 1980 ‚Äì 4 January 1981, Brussels, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, 1980, p. 105 Circe the temptress Hermans joined the Soci√©t√© Libre des Beaux-Arts, founded in Brussels on 1 March 1868, which brought together several famous Belgian naturalist artists such as Charles de Groux, Alfred Verwee, Constantin Meunier, Louis Dubois, F√©licien Rops, Constantin Meunier and Louis Artan de Saint-Martin and Th√©odore Baron. The members admired the work of the French Realist painter Gustave Courbet and wished to confront the prevailing Academism in contemporary Belgian art. The Realist movement in Belgium gradually gained ground as evidenced by the fact that the Realist artists Constantin Meunier and Louis Artan de Saint-Martin received prizes at the Brussels salon of 1869. The battle with the Belgian art establishment appeared to have been won when in 1875 Hermans' At dawn was accepted at the Brussels salon without opposition. Hermans participated in major international exhibitions such as the art section of the World Fair held in Paris in 1878 where he showed At dawn to general acclaim. He earned an international reputation thanks to this success. His paintings were acquired by museums, both in Belgium and abroad. Despite this early success Hermans was not able to realise the expectations. He had hoped to reiterate the reception of At dawn by creating the large, ambitious work The masked ball, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1880. The impact of the work was less than that of his earlier work. Still many reproductions of it were made and the original was acquired by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1882.Charles Hermans, The masked ball at Sotheby's  Work Hermans was a prolific artist who practised many genres throughout his career: history painting, genre art, portraits and landscape painting. He initially painted genre scenes of monks. He subsequently tried to elevate genre painting by treating biblical subjects as genre art. He painted a Job visited by his friends in which he depicted Job as an ordinary poor man in a Realist style. He then turned to genre scenes such as the Honeymoon showing a fashionable young couple clearly in love. He later turned to subjects with a social connotation such as the Sunday visit to the children's clinic at St. Peter's Hospital. In this composition he addressed human tragedy and suffering humanity in a moving and honest manner. The sentimentality of the subject assured the success of this composition. Monks playing bowls The crowning achievement of his genre art was the work of 1875 At dawn. It is a realistic and moralizing painting representing an encounter of an group of inebriated revellers leaving a restaurant with prostitutes on their arms in the early hours and a group of poor labourers on their way to work. The work was interpreted as a work of social criticism by contrasting the honest, simple workers with the depraved bourgeoisie. Hermans himself denied that his intention was to engage in social criticism and argued that he chose the subject because of its artistic possibilities.Maurice Sulzberger, Guide Illustr√© de Bruxelles, Tome II, Les mus√©es, Touring Club de Belgique, 1917, p. 37-38 Bath in the garden Hermans followed up this masterwork with other smaller genre pieces until he attempted another genre scene on a large scale, The masked ball. This work depicts one of the all-night society masked balls of the late 19th century, which were also attended by young women of the demi- monde. The composition shows a large room filled with groups of partygoers some of whom are in the shadows looking from a balcony in the background while others are active on the crowded dance floor in the front. Elegantly dressed men are joined by many women on the dance floor some in close embrace or animated conversation. Many of the men depicted were prominent personalities of the time. Hermans was able to convey with a remarkable skill the jostling and carnival madness of a night at the theater. Not achieving the expected success with this work, Hermans turned to smaller scale works often depicting charming women, which were based on the studies he had made for the Masked ball. These works are in the same vein as the society portraits of Alfred Stevens. He also painted at the sea from which he returned with fantasies of nude women bathing and Bacchantes. A new high point of this period is the composition Circe as temptress, which shows a seductive woman in a modern interior with a man passed out at a table with an overturned wine glass. This was a return to the veiled social criticism of his earlier work. In his later years he painted large decorative works and landscapes with many figures. During World War I he treated some wartime subjects such as The martyrs and the Execution of Edith Cavell by the Germans.

History  Madonna di Pietraquaria protecting the city of Avezzano (serigraphy by Fedele De Bernardinis, 1791) Icon of the Madonna di Pietraquaria (author unknown, 13th‚Äì14th century) Before 1268, in Middle Ages Pietra Aquaria was a populated area, belonging to the Countship of Albe. Here stood three churches dedicated to Saint Mary, Saint John and Saint Peter, respectively. In the church dedicated to the Holy Virgin there was a painting of the Madonna, of unknown age and in a Byzantine style, venerated by local and neighbourhood inhabitants. The historical events of the Battle of Tagliacozzo, which occurred in the Palentine Plains between Charles I of Anjou and Conradin of Hohenstaufen, led to the destruction of the village of Pietra Aquaria and obliged inhabitants to join those of Avezzano in Pantano Square (later called San Bartolomeo Square). The image of the Holy Virgin remained between the ruined walls of the church. Historian Tommaso Brogi confirmed that the name originated from the works for the enlargement of the square opposite the sanctuary: during the digging and demolition of the rock in that area, some well-defined and spaced cistern spaces appeared; besides, some stony canals were found, which supposedly served to discharge water from the reservoirs.. In fact, in ancient Italian pietra aquaria literally means \\"water stone\\". The church, rebuilt and enlarged several times during the centuries, was heavily damaged by the 1915 Avezzano earthquake and reopened for worship in 1969.. On 1 January 1978, Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria was proclaimed the patron saint of the city of Avezzano.  Marian apparition  Oral tradition has brought a story to the present day, about a deaf-mute shepherd boy from Avezzano to whom, while pasturing the flock on Mount Salviano and gazing at the waters of Fucino, the Madonna appeared dressed in white on a mule. She addressed him in tender words, which the deaf-mute miraculously managed to hear, and asked him to have her church rebuilt by Avezzanese people. The shepherd boy came down running from Mount Salviano, and as soon as he reached Avezzano went to the parish priest, whom he told what the Holy Virgin had recommended, that is, to restore the Church of Saint Mary and worthily replace the sacred image onto the altar. The Chapel of the Apparition situated along the via Crucis on Mount Salviano preserves the print that the Madonna's mule carved in the stone with a blow of his hoof before disappearing with the Virgin. The reconstruction of the church occurred in 1614 from the foundations and enlarging the religious building,Documents and depositions attested in the affidavit drawn up by Notary Pietro Orlandi on 27 June 1838. so much so that the cult of the Virgin of Pietraquaria became even more widespread..  Miracles  The rock imprinted with the mule's hoof print The Pietraquaria complex as seen from Mount Cimarani The Madonna di Pietraquaria is traditionally credited with numerous miracles, owing to which the image was solemnly crowned by the Vatican Chapter in 1838: * The liberation from a long period of drought on 27 April 1779: the sacred image was brought in a solemn procession for the first time and a heavy rain suddenly fell on Avezzano, thus putting an end to the dry spell. As a consequence, the Madonna's annual feast was established on that day (previously the Madonna di Pietraquaria was celebrated on the fourth Sunday of May). * The liberation from the French invasion in 1799. * The liberation from the sack of Avezzano by the same French to eliminate the brigands who had occupied it in 1800. * The cessation of flood waters in 1836. * The liberation from cholera in 1837. * On 27 April 1944, Anglo-American Flying Fortresses took off to raze to the ground Avezzano, then an important railway junction. That day, a thick fog covered the city and therefore the Allied forces headed towards Cassino.. Besides, at the Sanctuary of Pietraquaria, visitors can admire about one hundred ex votos, exposed in the Confraternity's dedicated rooms and donated by those who in the past believed that they had received blessings from the Virgin Mary of Pietraquaria.  The Confraternity of Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria  The Confraternita di Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria (\\"Confraternity of Most Holy Mary of Pietraquaria\\") was founded in 1891. Since 1878 the sanctuary has been run by Capuchin Friars, and before them by lay hermits who settled in the monastery erected in 1840. The 1915 Marsica earthquake caused heavy damages to the sanctuary, while the monastery could host the religious people who had come to the aid of the survivors. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's visit to the Marsican land (24 March 1985), the Avezzano Pro Loco (local promotion association) in accordance with the Confraternity of Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria inaugurated a mosaic, made by artist Rita Monaco, portraying Pope Karol Wojtyla and a reliquary containing some memorabilia from the visit preserved as relics. In August 2018 it was announced that Capuchin Friars would not run the sanctuary anymore, due to the growing organizational difficulties related to the monks' old age and the reduction in the number of vocations. Subsequently, however, the news was denied, and as of November 2018, the sanctuary official website still reports Capuchin Friars' presence.  Description  Fa√ßade and bell tower = Exterior = The church plan is Latin cross-shaped with a single nave. The fa√ßade is white-plastered with four small buttresses supporting a gold mosaic cornice with the writing \\"AVE MARIA\\". The architrave is also decorated with a mosaic dedicated to the Madonna. The bell tower on the left is a tower without a spire in unhewn stone. Next to the bell tower a portico unwinds, ending in an irregular rectangular building which is Capuchin Fathers and pilgrims' house. Attached to it the Domus Mariae () stands, built in the 1950s and used for spiritual retreats, whose care is entrusted to Benedictine Sisters of Charity. = Interior = Inside, the church features a single nave, with white-plastered vaults. The apse is much enlarged with geometrical decorations. On the whole, altars are three with two other niches. Some frescoes reproduce the scenes of the miracles performed by the Virgin; outstanding is the large original painting depicting the Madonna and Child placed in an onyx niche on the end wall of the apse. The stained-glass windows were made in 1992 by artist Marcello Ercole.

He is Professor of Biostatistics and Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. He was previously the William Neal Reynolds Professor of statistics and genetics and director of the Bioinformatics Research Center at North Carolina State University. He is known within academia for his research in statistical and forensic genetics, and outside academia for testifying in the O.J. Simpson murder trial in 1995. Testimony in O.J. Simpson murder case During his testimony in the O. J. Simpson murder case, Weir was pressed by lawyer Peter Neufeld on his failure to include a certain genetic marker in his calculations of some of the DNA frequencies he had analyzed. In response, Weir acknowledged that he had in fact made a calculation error in failing to include this marker in all of his analyses of DNA samples in the case. Lawyers for the defense used this admission to attempt to undermine Weir's credibility, despite the fact that the error had little effect on the validity of the DNA evidence that had been presented. Weir subsequently recalculated his statistics and described his new findings in a subsequent day of testimony. Weir stated that after redoing his calculations, the odds that a blood mixture sample taken from the steering wheel of Simpson's Ford Bronco came from two unknown people increased from 1 in 59 to 1 in 26. Similarly, the equivalent odds for a blood mixture found on a glove outside Simpson's home were revised upward from 1 in 3,900 to 1 in 1,600.

It is dedicated to Filipino revolutionary and centenarian, Melchora Aquino who is also known as \\"Tandang Sora\\". Background Melchora Aquino, popularly known as Tandang Sora is a key figure in the Philippine Revolution who offered shelter and medical aid to Katipunan revolutionaries despite her old age. She was known by the titles of \\"Mother of the Katipunan\\" and the \\"Grand Woman of the Revolution\\" for her role in the revolution. The place where the memorial is situated, along in present-day Banlat Road in a barangay in Quezon City named in honor of her is her birthplace. After her death, her remains were initially buried at the Mausoleum of the Veterans of the Revolution at the Manila North Cemetery before being transferred to the Himlayang Pilipino. In 2012, her remains were transferred to the Tandang Sora Shrine. History Historical marker The Tandang Sora Shrine was \\"restored\\" by the Quezon City government in 2005 as a tribute to Melchora Aquino and the shrine was built in 2008 during the tenure of then-Quezon City Mayor Feliciano Belmonte Jr.. Prior to the shrine's construction, a marker is already present near the site of the shrine although it is generally hidden from view from the public by houses. The Quezon City Council declared 2012 as Tandang Sora Year, a year-long celebration to mark the 200th birth anniversary of Melchora Auino. In line of the commemoration, there were efforts by the city government to have Aquino's remains which were then-located at the nearby Himlayang Pilipino exhumed and re-interred in the shrine. Such moves required approval from the Congress and their bid was helped by the approval of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NCHP) of the plan in 2011. The Himlayang Pilipino also gave consent for the exhumation of Aquino's remains. Melchora Aquino's remains were then re-interred at the Tandang Sora Shrine on January 6, 2012, on her birth day. The re-interment ceremony was led by Novaliches Bishop Antonio Tobias who blessed Aquino's casket. The memorial was later declared a national shrine on March 2, 2012 by the NHCP through a resolution. Shrine Tandang Sora Shrine sculpture The shrine is situated along Banlat Road in Barangay Tandang Sora, Quezon City. It covers an area of and features a bronze sculpture. The remains of Melchora Aquino, which consists of three small bones and ash at the time of her re-interment in the shrine, is housed inside a small wooden casket, which in turn is placed inside a square space at the foot of the bronze sculpture designed by the Toym Imao. An art gallery is also hosted within shrine grounds which features paintings and other sculptures dedicated to Tandang Sora made by local artists from Quezon City. It also has a pavilion and stage for events, and a mini-museum dedicated to Melchora Aquino.

On Palm Sunday, 10 April 1960, she became one of the first three female priests in Sweden when she was ordained by Bishop Ruben Josefson in H√§rn√∂sand Cathedral. The same day Margit Sahlin and Elisabeth Djurle were ordained in Stockholm. Biography Born on 29 May 1912 in Sl√∂ta F√∂rsamling, Falk√∂ping Municipality, Ingrid Persson was the daughter of the estate owner John Persson and Hildegard Andersson. After matriculating from high school in Gothenburg in 1930, she passed a preparatory examination in theology and went on to study at Uppsala University where she graduated as Cand.theol. in 1936. On graduating, Persson took up employment in various occupations including teacher and later scouting secretary for the YWCA in Stockholm. In 1939, she served as youth secretary in the Diocese of H√§rn√∂sand, coordinating 129 associations. She began to assist at church services, sometimes holding sermons long before women were admitted as priests. In the mid-1940s, she taught at the Ersta Diaconia Centre in Stockholm, later becoming head of studies at the Samaritans Home in Uppsala. For some time, despite opposition from other bishops, Torsten Bohlin, bishop of H√§rn√∂sand, had supported Persson's wish to become a priest. In 1958, the Church of Sweden agreed that women should be allowed to serve as priests. The following year, Gunnar Hultgren, the archbishop of Uppsala, asked her if she was interested in becoming one of the first female priests. After accepting his invitation, in 1959 she underwent training for the priesthood in Lund. On 21 January 1960, a meeting of bishops decided that three women should be ordained as priests: in addition Persson, Elisabeth Djurle Olander and Margit Sahlin. The ordination of all three took place on Easter Sunday, 10 April 1960. Persson continued to support the ordination of women as priests and helped many to accomplish their goals and to perform their duties. In 1979, Ingrid Persson married the minister Sven S√∂derlind (1914‚Äì2003). They had no children together. She died in H√§rn√∂sand on 22 October 2000.

The French attempted to suppress cinema in French Togoland. After the Togolese Republic gained independence in 1960, Togo's national government encouraged cinema, though government support for cinema lapsed when French funding was withdrawn in the 1990s. More recently, however, the film industry is once again growing in Togo. Cinema in the colonial period The amateur filmmaker Carl M√ºller filmed Lom√© in 1906, touring Germany with his films on his return. More systematic encouragement to colonial filming of Togoland was provided by the explorer Adolf Friedrich, colonial governor of Togoland from 1912 to 1914. Wilhelm Solf's 1913 visit to the colony was filmed and distributed in Europe. Hans Schomburgk first visited Togo in 1913-14, working with the British cameraman James S. Hodgson and the actress Meg Gehrts. Though the outbreak of World War I led to most of their material being confiscated and lost, Schomburgk had enough material to release a series of short films in 1916-17. Schomburgk's Im Deutschen Sudan (In the German Sudan) was a feature-length 1917 documentary, used for colonial propaganda. French colonial law did not initially regulate film production and distribution. In 1932 the French colonial administrator Robert de Guise complained that Africans in French Togoland, such as Albert John Mensah in Lom√©, were turning their homes and businesses into illicit cinemas. As a result, the Laval Decree established censorship to control the authorship, content and distribution of films. Cinema post-independence The 1970s were \\"a great period for Togolese cinema\\", according to cultural administrator Komi Ati: the post-independence government encouraged cinema, establishing the Service du Cin√©ma et des Actualit√©s Audiovisuelles (CINEATO) in 1976 to make newsreels and documentaries. However, Togolese cinema suffered a setback in 1993, when the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie withdrew all their funding for ten years. Cinemas and distribution companies closed down. Contemporary growth The Togolese film sector is relatively small and undeveloped, and struggles with postcolonial dilemmas of representation. However, it has recently started to grow in self-confidence. Anne-Laure Folly, making documentaries since the early 1990s, is a Togolese filmmaker who has gained an international reputation. In 2009 Christelle Aqu√©r√©buru established ECRAN,Beti Ellerson, Christelle Aqu√©r√©buru, Directrice de l‚ÄôECRAN - Ecole de cin√©ma au Togo  Director of ECRAN film school in Togo, 15 April 2014 a film school in Togo which has taught over 100 students and produced 20 films and documentaries.

A new film and animated code has been established to boost the film industry in Togo.

Dependency increases the likelihood of human error due to interactions with other seemingly independent defense mechanisms. Engaging multiple people to perform a task does not ensure that the task will be done correctly. One potential dependency is team error, an error of one or more members that allows other individual members of the same group to make a mistake. Common types of team errors  *Halo Effect ‚Äì Immediate judgment discrepancy or cognitive bias, where a person making an initial assessment will assume the validity of ambiguous information based upon concrete information: blind trust in the competence of specific individuals because of their experience or education. *Pilot/Copilot ‚Äì Reluctance of a subordinate to challenge the opinions, decisions, or actions of a superior. *Free Riding ‚Äì Tendency to ‚Äútag along‚Äù without actively scrutinizing the intent and actions of another worker. *Groupthink ‚Äì When the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in a dysfunctional outcome. While cohesiveness, loyalty and consensus are worthy attributes, groupthink can result when dissenting opinions are discouraged. *Diffusion of responsibility ‚Äì Sociopsychological phenomenon whereby each person in a group is less likely to take responsibility when others are present. It often causes a shift towards greater risk in decision-making and problem resolution, if two or more people agree together that they know a better way to do something. Examples= Pilot/copilot error = Air Florida Flight 90 at Washington‚Äôs National Airport in January 1982 DOE-HDBK-1028-2009, Human Performance Improvement Handbook. https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/1000/1028-BHdbk-2009-v1 had not been properly de-iced. Snow accumulated on the leading edges of the wings as the flight crew prepared for takeoff. During the after-start checklist procedure, the co-captain called out ‚Äúengine anti-ice system\\". The captain reported, ‚Äúengine anti-ice system off,‚Äù and then failed to turn it on. The system should have been on. Consequently, ice interfered with the engine pressure ratio (EPR) system, the primary indication of engine thrust. The copilot called the captain‚Äôs attention to the anomalous engine indications at least five times in the last moments before the plane rotated off the runway, but he did not oppose the captain‚Äôs decision to continue takeoff. Given the engine indications, he should have insisted on aborting the takeoff. The plane crashed, killing 74 of the 79 people on board. = Diffusion of responsibility error = At a US Department of Energy production facility in the late 1980s, the shift manager in the operating contractor organization, along with a small group of shift supervisors, planned and carried out the replacement of a faulty pump. Following the work control system had not been successful. The supervisory group reasoned that continued reliance on that system would not be successful. Schedule pressures and frustration led the men to take matters into their own hands and do the work themselves. The team violated procedures governing the work control system, quality inspections, worker certification and union labor rules governing work assignments and responsibilities. No single salaried supervisor would otherwise have considered doing a union mechanic‚Äôs job. In the group situation, the rules were discounted. Strategies tend to reduce the occurrence of team errors The following strategies were proposed by the DOE Human Performance Improvement Handbook. * Maintain freedom of thought from other team members. *Challenge actions and decisions of others to uncover underlying assumptions. *Train people on team errors, their causes and interventions. *Participate in formal team- development training. *Practice questioning attitude/situational awareness on the job and during training. *Designate a devil's advocate for problem-solving situations. *Call ‚Äútimeouts‚Äù to help the team achieve a shared understanding of plant or product status. *Perform a thorough and independent task preview before the pre-job briefing.

Location and Route  The Lindwurmstra√üe runs one kilometer to the northwest, parallel to the Isar and mostly just at an altitude of about 520 m above sea level from the Sendlinger Tor in a southwesterly direction. Between Poccistra√üe and Implerstra√üe, it passes under the M√ºnchner S√ºdring, a railway line that connects Bahnhof M√ºnchen Ost with M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof and the Laim shunting yard to the south of the city center. Only shortly before its southern end in Munich-Sendling, it rises to the Pfeuferstra√üe at 534 m above sea level. Well- known occupants are, umong others, the Klinikum Gro√ühadern, the Haunersche Kinderspital as well as the churches St. Matth√§us and St. Margaret.  History  The Bavarian archival cadaster shows the Lindwurmstra√üe in the 1810s as a then, nameless Chaussee, that leads past the Burgfriedstein Nr. 2 to Untersendling, with a mutually planned tree planted route. In the 1860s, it was crossed by the railway line and on its northeaster route direction was a nameless street village. It was formerly called Sendlinger Landstra√üe. The Alte Stra√üe nach Sendling (old road to Sendling) was renamed in 1878 after the physician Joseph von Lindwurm (1824-1874, dermatologist and chief physician). House No. 127 (then 125), now a branch of the Munich Adult Education Center, served as an emergency shelter for the Jewish religious community because the National Socialists had demolished the synagogue and community buildings on Herzog-Max-Stra√üe. In 1941, the occupants were deported. The Lindwurmstra√üe today, is a place of the cultural history trail Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt.

The first player - called BoxMaker - tries to pick all elements of a single box. The second player - called BoxBreaker - tries to pick at least one element of all boxes. The box game was first presented by Paul Erd≈ës and V√°clav Chv√°tal. It was solved later by Hamidoune and Las- Vergnas.  Definition  A box game is defined by: * A family of n pairwise- disjoint sets, A_1,\\\\ldots,A_n, of different sizes. The sets are often called \\"boxes\\" and the elements are called \\"balls\\". * Two integers, p and q. The first player, BoxMaker, picks p balls (from the same or different boxes). Then the second player, BoxBreaker, breaks q boxes. And so on. BoxMaker wins if he has managed to pick all balls in at least one box, before BoxBreaker managed to break this box. BoxBreaker wins if he has managed to break all the boxes.  Strategies  In general, the optimal strategy for BoxBreaker is to break the boxes with the smallest number of remaining elements. The optimal strategy for BoxMaker is to try to balance the sizes of all boxes. By simulating these strategies, Hamidoune and Las-Vergnas found a sufficient and necessary condition for each player in the (p:q) box game. For the special case where q=1, the each of the following conditions is sufficient: * If all boxes have the same size k, and p\\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^n {1\\\\over i} < k, then BoxBreaker wins the (p:1) box game (using the obvious strategy of breaking the smallest boxes). For comparison, the winning condition for Breaker in a general (p:q) biased game is: n < (q+1)^{k/p}. With q=1 this becomes p\\\\cdot \\\\log_2{n} < k. The proof uses a potential function. The potential of the game before BoxBreaker's j-th move is defined as: {1\\\\over n-j+1}\\\\sum_{i=j}^n c_iwhere c_iis the number of elements remaining in box i. * If the boxes have different sizes k1,...,kn, and \\\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{-k_i/p} < {1/e}, then BoxBreaker wins the (p:1) box game. For comparison, the winning condition for Breaker in a general (p:q) biased game is: \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (1+q)^{-k_1/p} < {1\\\\over 1+q}.

Its official English translation, done by Jane Weizhen Pan and Martin Merz, was published by Penguin Specials in 2018.  Original page Peter Gordon of the Asian Review of Books stated that the work's focus on the characters and their situations was an influence from Russian literature. It is set in the 1950s, in Shanghai, when the new government began requiring former prostitutes to be re-educated. Two former prostitutes, Petulia and Autumn Grace, are among those taken away to the Women's Labour Training Camp, even though their previous place of employment, Red Delight Pavilion, is still operating. Petulia spends three years, there and develops her relationship with her longtime customer, and husband, Mr. P'u, who tries to maintain his former quality of life after having assets seized by the new government. Autumn Grace escapes from the truck taking her to the camp and stays in a compound for Buddhist nuns. Gordon stated that a \\"clear denouement or resolution\\" was not present in the book, and that this was also a Russian influence. The title is a reference to a piece of tin that is the only aspect remaining from the characters' pre-1949 lives. Writing style An essay in Modern Chinese Literature, Volume 10 stated that it was an example of a work that had a \\"more straightforward, realistic description and greater thematic openness.\\"Modern Chinese Literature, Volume 10. San Francisco State University Center for the Study of Modern Chinese Literature, 1998. p. 100. \\"Su Tong conveys the possibility of greater freedom of action once he further simplified his style in novellas such as \\"Hongfen\\" [Rouge] (1991)[...] These novellas offer[...]\\" According to Gordon, the author \\"has great economy of language, saying a great deal in few words.\\" He characterised the reading pace as \\"brisk\\". The translators stated that the original Chinese version of the work used aspects of the grammar of \\"traditional vernacular literary Chinese\\", which the author used to \\"inject a nostalgic mood\\".Su, Tong.

These features included referring to characters by names in place of using pronouns and not using quotation marks; the usage of pronouns and quotation marks in literary Chinese dated from the 1920s. Since Hanyu Pinyin had not yet been introduced to China in the time period of the setting, the translators chose to use Wade-Giles romanization.Su, Tong. Petulia's Rouge Tin: Penguin Specials. Penguin UK, 8 June 2018. , 9781743773215. Google Books PT6-PT7 (from \\"Translators' Note\\"). The translators chose not to emulate the lack of pronouns nor the lack of quotation marks in the English version due to readability concerns. Characters The translators rendered the names of the women characters into their literal meanings to highlight their roles in the stories, instead of keeping the names in a romanized form. *Petulia () - Catherine Shipley of the Reading Chinese Network described her as \\"needy\\". Her original Chinese name means the calyx of a flower; the translators decided that using \\"Petulia\\" has the \\"feel\\" of the Chinese name and has a \\"suggestive nature\\". *Autumn Grace (Qiu Yi/Chiu I) - Shipley described her as \\"Strong-Headed\\". *Mr. P'u - He is described by Shipley as \\"kind\\", and by Gordon as \\"feckless\\" and unfortunate. According to Gordon, he has more trouble adjusting to his new life than the two women do, and that P'u is \\"courageous when pushed, yet completely out of his depth when it comes to dealing with women.\\" *Lucky Phoenix (Ruifeng) Reception Gordon ranked the book four of five stars and called it \\"another winner\\". Shipley stated that the author \\"intelligently and creatively produced a story that allows the reader to gain an insight into a politically turbulent time, and has used a unique approach to do so.\\" Henry Yunwei Wang, also of the Reading Chinese Network, stated that the original book had \\"brisk style of writing and exquisite command of language\\", and that the translation was a \\"brilliant English equivalent\\" in which the features of the original \\"are well reflected\\" and \\"shine through well\\".

In the 19th century small tollkeeper's cottages were built to house tollkeepers who collected tolls on the roads that lead into the city later known as Toronto, Ontario. Private companies were licensed to maintain the province's roads, and they were allowed to levy tolls from those traveling on the road to pay for that maintenance. Tollkeepers were provided with cottages, so they could work from home. The first tollkeeper's cottage was built in 1820, at the corner of Yonge and King streets, when that intersection was on the outskirts of York, Upper Canada. The tollkeeper system was retired in 1896. Tollhouse Park Tollkeeper's cottage, Davenport and Bathurst, after restoration. In 1993 what had been tollhouse number 3, one of five tollhouses on Davenport Road was rediscovered. It had been moved, and repurposed, and was about to be demolished. After a long period of restoration it was turned into a museum, and turned into the centerpiece of a park, near its original location, at the corner of Davenport Road and Bathurst Street. John Allemang, writing in The Globe and Mail, contrasted the poverty of working class citizens, as documented by the cottage, to the luxury of the rich, as documented by two nearby former mansions, Casa Loma and Spadina House, now open to the public.

It was built from 1843 to 1868 with convict and paid labour. The property is owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The Argyle Cut, looking east, pictured in . The Argyle Cut, looking west, pictured in 2012. Agitation for a link between The Rocks and began early; the Sydney Gazette in 1803 lamented the lack of a short cut across the rocky peninsula. Maclehouse in the Picture of Sydney and Strangers Guide in NSW for 1839, an early tourist guide, says that Argyle Street was in two parts. The eastern from George Street to Harrington Street separated by the western side by a \\"precipice of considerable height\\". At that stage a set of stairs which had once been cut into the rock to provide access between the two halves was already deteriorated and unsafe. Before the cut was built the only way that vehicles could get from the Sydney Cove to Darling Harbour was via a circuitous route along lower George Street, to Dawes Point and into Windmill Street. For pedestrians there was no other way except along the steep alleyways and flights of crude steps. As Darling Harbour developed it became crucial for a link between the Cove and Millers Point. The first schemes came from private enterprise, with an ambitious plan to cut a deep channel through the central spine of The Rocks. The father of this plan was Alexander Berry, one of the richest landowners and merchants in the colony. He had already presided over cutting a channel between the river and an arm of Crookhaven which became the virtual mouth of the Shoalhaven River. Besides his large landholding in the Shoalhaven, Berry had vast commercial interests in Sydney as an importer and exporter. His office was in Lower George Street and he was vitally concerned in plans to extend Argyle Street. The proposal was that the shareholders should have the right to levy tolls on all passengers and stock using the cut and from the revenue the shareholders were to get a dividend. Any excess was to accumulate until it equalled the amount originally expended in the making of the cut. The capital was then to be returned to the shareholders and the toll would cease. Governor Bourke and the Legislative Council turned down the plan and the Government decided to undertake the work. A plan for the Argyle Cut was drawn up by the Government Architect, Edward Hallen in 1832. The plan shows the proposed bridges over the streets above, a view and the inclination of the road. The Argyle Cut, was begun by 1843, with convict labour in chain gangs. Their overseer was a cruel man, Tim Lane, who used to declare to the labourers that 'by the help of God and the strong arm of the flogger, you'll get fifty before breakfast tomorrow!' Despite his efforts the job proved beyond the crude tools of the convicts. Transportation to NSW had ceased in 1840 after much agitation, and many of the residents were unsettled by the sight and sounds of convicts labouring in chains in full view. The Government abandoned the project when it was half completed. The cut was eventually completed by Sydney Municipal Council, using explosives and council labour in 1859. The spoil was used to fill the mouth of the Tank Stream and to buttress the sea wall at Circular Quay. Overhead bridges were built for Gloucester Street in 1862, Cumberland Street in 1864 and the Princes Street in 1867-68 (the latter demolished as part of the Sydney Harbour Bridge construction).de Vries Evans, 1983: 38-39. There is an inscription identifying Charles Moore, Mayor (1867-8) from this Bridge now relocated to the south wall of the cut. With the building of new wharves at Walsh Bay and the laying out of Hickson Road the Cut lost much of its importance. As part of the improvements undertaken by the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1911-12, Gloucester and Cumberland Streets were realigned and the two road bridges over the Argyle Cut replaced by a single bridge at Cumberland Street, and the Argyle Stairs were constructed. This work involved the demolition of 22-24 Gloucester Street, part of View Terrace. Later, as part of the building of the Bradfield Highway in the 1920s, the Princes Street Bridge was demolished and the Argyle Cut was widened at the Princes Street end and the Bradfield Highway was constructed overhead, completed in 1932.  Description  The Argyle Cut is a deep rock cutting giving a direct connection between Millers Point and The Rocks. It is covered by two bridges, the Cumberland Street bridge of and the Bradfield Highway . On the wall of the Argyle Cut is an inscription that refers to the completion of the overhead bridges: completed 1867-1868, by Sydney Municipal Council, Charles Moore, mayor. = Condition = As at 22 March 2004, the archaeological assessment of the cut was assessed as partly disturbed. = Modifications and dates = The Cut was begun by 1843, and completed in 1859. Overhead bridges were built for Gloucester Street in 1862, Cumberland Street in 1864 and Princes Street in 1867‚Äì68. In 1911‚Äì12 Gloucester and Cumberland Streets were realigned and the two bridges replaced by a single bridge at Cumberland Street at the same time the Argyle Stairs were built. In the 1920s the Bradfield Highway was constructed, involving the demolition of the Princes Street bridge, widening the Cut at that end and the construction of a much larger bridge to accommodate the traffic from the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Argyle Cut is of State heritage significance for its historical and scientific cultural values. The site is also of State heritage significance for its contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Argyle Cut has significance in that it is identified with the changing labour market in Sydney. It has associations with convict labour and the acceptance of responsibility of urban growth and public works by the Sydney Council. Argyle Cut has historical significance as an early east-west route across The Rocks, as an imposing example of convict public works, and as evidence, in its ongoing changes, crossings and widening, of improvements in the provision of access and infrastructure, including the work of the Sydney Harbour Trust and that for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and its approaches. It has aesthetic significance with the deep cutting providing a dramatic feature in Argyle Street. It has been ranked along with Busby's Bore and the building of Circular Quay as one of the most impressive engineering feats in early Sydney. The Argyle Cut has social significance as an important feature in The Rocks conservation area, and contributes strongly to the character of The Rocks. The Argyle cut is held in high esteem as indicated by its listings on the National Trust register and the Register of the National Estate, and thus is recognised by an identifiable group and has importance to the broader community. The Argyle Cut has significance from the links it derives with and support function associated with the development of a society in which it has sat for more than 150 years. The Argyle Cut has research potential for its association with town planning and street and urban development in early Sydney, and with the ongoing development of transportation systems within the city. The Argyle Cut is a rare example of early responses to the geographical difficulties presented to urban growth. The large spine of rock which cut the area into two was a barrier to the ease of transportation between two important and growing maritime and mercantile precincts.

Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen in 1870 and Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen in 1873. From 1869 to 1874 White was Chaplain to the House of Commons and was reappointed in 1889. On Sunday 11 October 1891 the Henry White Memorial Window by Clayton and Bell was unveiled at the Royal Chapel, Savoy.

On the night of 4 March 2016, they were in the Atenas mine, on the border between the municipalities of Sifontes and Roscio, a poor area where, like most of the southeast of the country, the main economic activity is mining. Attack Bol√≠var state in Venezuela. According to anonymous witnesses, the Banda del Topo (\\"Mole gang\\") arrived at the mine, allegedly with the aid and complicity of unidentified security forces, and may have dispersed hundreds of miners with the ambush, with dozens falling and dying in the stampede. The bodies were allegedly put in a truck and moved across the Guayana Esequiba border. Some say that parts of the victims were dismembered to intimidate the survivors. However, the commission formed by the National Armed Forces and the CICPC assured that there was no evidence of any massacre or confrontation, and the governor of Bol√≠var state, Francisco Rangel G√≥mez, assured that \\"there is not a single thing to show that they have died or been massacred.\\" The Venezuelan Ombudsman commissioned local investigations, and the Public Ministry authorised three prosecutors for the incident. Victims The remains of at least four of the disappeared miners were later found in the middle of the country, and seemed to have been shot, Venezuelan Prosecutor General Luisa Ortega D√≠az said, but they had no identification.\\"Hallaron restos de mineros desaparecidos en Venezuela\\", art√≠culo del 14 de marzo de 2016 en el sitio web Cadena3.\\"Hallan restos de 28 mineros desaparecidos en Venezuela\\", art√≠culo del 14 de marzo de 2016 en el diario La Voz de Galicia (Espa√±a). Ortega D√≠az reported late on the night of 14 March 2016 that the search efforts for the disappeared miners had concluded with the discovery of 17 bodies total. Subsequently, the Ombudsman, Tarek William Saab, announced on 15 March 2016 that the remains of 17 miners found in a mass grave in Tumeremo were wounded by firearms. He met with local and military authorities that began investigating the massacre and also indicated that officials of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and security forces of Bol√≠var state were continuing to search a sector of the Hoja de Lata mine.  Responses  President Nicol√°s Maduro said that investigations into the disappearance of the 28 miners in the town of Tumeremo would be undertaken to the fullest extent and those responsible for the crime will be punished, blaming a paramilitary group for the attack. Lester Toledo, a Voluntad Popular leader, criticised Rangel, explaining that \\"[i]t is a national shame, because it is a humanitarian issue: 28 people disappeared and Governor Francisco Rangel G√≥mez didn't travel to Tumeremo to face the relatives.\\" Toledo was one of many opposition politicians who asked for the governor's resignation due to the mismanagement of the case of the disappeared miners.

It reached #4 on the Hot R&B; LPs chart. The song \\"In The Dark\\" was released as a single, with \\"Ten Years Of Tears\\" as the B-side. Stephen Cook at AllMusic says, \\"Wilson displays all her talents\\" on Nancy ‚Äì Naturally. \\"On the blues end of things, she turns the lights down low with a smoldering cover of Lil Green's classic 'In the Dark' and swings it hard and brass-heavy on the Joe Williams/Count Basie number 'Alright, Okay, You Win.'

Map of Tajikistan showing the border with Kyrgyzstan Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Uzbekistan in the Ferghana Valley. The border proceeds roughly westwards, with a sharp Tajik protrusion at the town of Chorku; it almost reaches the Kayrakkum Reservoir, however a thin strip of Tajik territory lies between the reservoir and the border. It then turn southwards near the Tajik enclave of Kayragach before turning sharply eastwards upon reaching the Turkestan Range. The border then follows this range, and the Alay and Trans- Alay ranges, eastwards to the Chinese tripoint. Enclaves Map showing Tajikstan's enclaves; Kayragach is the smaller one at the far left There are two enclaves along the border (Vorukh and Kayragach), both Tajik enclaves within Kyrgyzstan. History Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin‚Äôs definition of a nation as being ‚Äúa historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture‚Äù. The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalism,Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40 as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore NTD also aimed to create ‚Äòviable‚Äô entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley ‚Äì the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 112 The attempt to balance these contradictory aims within an overall nationalist framework proved exceedingly difficult and often impossible, resulting in the drawing of often tortuously convoluted borders, multiple enclaves and the unavoidable creation of large minorities who ended up living in the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô republic. Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers as they are today. Soviet Central Asia in 1922 before national delimitation NTD of the area along ethnic lines had been proposed as early as 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 40-1Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley ‚Äì the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 105 At this time Central Asia consisted of two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR: the Turkestan ASSR, created in April 1918 and covering large parts of what are now southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Turkmenistan), and the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kirghiz ASSR, Kirgizistan ASSR on the map), which was created on 26 August 1920 in the territory roughly coinciding with the northern part of today's Kazakhstan (at this time Kazakhs were referred to as ‚ÄòKyrgyz‚Äô and what are now the Kyrgyz were deemed a sub- group of the Kazakhs and referred to as ‚ÄòKara-Kyrgyz‚Äô i.e. mountain-dwelling ‚Äòblack-Kyrgyz‚Äô). There were also the two separate successor ‚Äòrepublics‚Äô of the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva, which were transformed into the Bukhara and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics following the takeover by the Red Army in 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39 On 25 February 1924 the Politburo and Central Committee of the Soviet Union announced that it would proceed with NTD in Central Asia.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 55Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 42 The process was to be overseen by a Special Committee of the Central Asian Bureau, with three sub-committees for each of what were deemed to be the main nationalities of the region (Kazakhs, Turkmen and Uzbeks), with work then exceedingly rapidly.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 54Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 52-3Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 92Starr, S.

Iraj Bashiri, 1996 The Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was originally within the Russia SSR in October 1924, with borders matching those of modern Kyrgyzstan. In 1925 it was renamed the Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast in May 1925, then became the Kirghiz ASSR in 1926 (not to be confused with the Kirghiz ASSR that was the first name of Kazak ASSR), and finally it became the Kirghiz SSR in 1936.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 167 The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. There were tensions in the post- independence era over border delimitation and policing, and especially after an Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) incursion into Kyrgyzstan from Tajik territory in 1999/2000. At present border delimitation is ongoing.

Occurring over three days from 14 October 2018, it is suspected that a Colombian guerrilla group is responsible for the murders.  Attack  The miners attacked were at Los Candados mine. The opposition politician for the state, Am√©rico de Grazia, claimed that the recovered bodies were of 4 men and 3 women. He also posted a thread of tweets showing several bodies, including those with gunshot wounds showing how they had been killed and abandoned. The number of people murdered is unknown, but local reports suggest it may be 16. Five survivors of the attack returned to their village to report the events, there are reportedly six people injured.  Suspected attackers  According to The Guardian, victims' families blame the Colombian guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and that this group is supported by Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro. These kinds of attacks were previously described as a type of gang warfare between mining mafias, but the leftist ELN and Maduro are allegedly attempting to disrupt production and gather mining profits, according to analytical reports.  Responses  Local businesses and schools were closed for the investigation, which lasted many weeks. The attack furthered opposition displeasure at the government's supposed complicity with organized crime and harboring Colombian terrorists. It drew international media attention to the violence in remote parts of the country. It is viewed as the worst of many massacres in the region since the 2016 massacre. Shortly after the events, towards the end of October, armed violence broke out in Tumeremo, which de Grazia says began with the presence of government military forces.

Civil Registrar-General (G.R. No. 217910) was a case which arose out of a petition filed by Filipino lawyer Jesus Falcis III before the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The Court promulgated its ruling on September 3, 2019. The high court was asked about the constitutionality of the provision of the Family Code of the Philippines defining marriage as \\"between a man and a woman\\". History The petition was filed by Atty. Jesus Falcis III in 2015. =Oral arguments= In March 2018, the Supreme Court of the Philippines approved the scheduling of a same-sex marriage petition that seeks to invalidate Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code. During the second week of June 2018, the Supreme Court announced that they will hear arguments in a case seeking the invalidation of the Family Code's provisions prohibiting same-sex marriage. The news of the historic oral arguments was also reported by the international media. Duterte also expressed his support for same-sex marriage to be legalized in the Philippines. On June 19, 2018, oral arguments commenced with the following arguments made: whether or not the petition is properly the subject of the exercise of the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, whether or not the right to marry and the right to choose whom to marry are cognates of the right to life and liberty, whether or not the limitation of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples is a valid exercise of police power, whether or not limiting civil marriages to opposite-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause, whether or not denying same-sex couples the right to marry amounts to a denial of their right to life and/or liberty without due process of law, whether or not sex-based conceptions of marriage violate religious freedom, whether or not a determination that Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code are unconstitutional must necessarily carry with it the conclusion that Articles 46(4) and 55(6) of the Family Code (i.e.: homosexuality and lesbianism as grounds for annulment and legal separation) are also unconstitutional, and whether or not the parties are entitled to the reliefs prayed for. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) under Jose Calida argued against the case. The second session of arguments took place on June 26, 2018. Supreme Court justices queried Falcis III on what injury was inflicted on him due to the implementation of the Family Code but it was learned during the oral arguments that Falcis III was a single man did not apply for a marriage for himself which meant he was never denied one. Falcis III was told that his concern should have been raised in a lower court, particularly a regional trial court first. =Decision= The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on September 3, 2019 for \\"lack of standing\\" and for \\"failing to raise an actual, justiciable controversy\\" and stated that it could only base a decision on actual facts and \\"real adversarial presentations\\" noting that Falcis III cannot claim injury since he is not seeking marriage for himself or has presented an actual case. The high court however added that the 1987 Constitution in \\"plain text\\" imposes no restriction on same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court suggested in its ruling that Congress should address the issue. The petitioners were also cited for indirect contempt with the high court reasoning that \\"[t]o forget [the bare rudiments of court procedure and decorum] ‚Äì or worse, to purport to know them, but really, only to exploit them by way of propaganda ‚Äì and then, to jump headlong into the taxing endeavor of constitutional litigation is a contemptuous betrayal of the high standards of the legal profession.\\" Falcis III described the decision as a \\"temporary setback\\" and has already considered the fact that oral arguments were held regarding his case as a victory \\"for the opportunity to educate the public\\" about the issue of same sex marriage in the country. Reaction Two days after the first arguments occurred, the presidential palace of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte stated that it was \\"too soon for same-sex marriage in the Philippines\\", causing outrage from various human rights organizations. Additionally, Senate President Tito Sotto, an ally of Duterte, commented: \\"Same sex union, no problem. Marriage? Debatable,\\" saying that he will vote in favor of same-sex civil unions, a turnaround from previous pronouncements in 2016 and 2017 where he was against both same-sex civil unions and same-sex marriage. Roman Catholic bishops praised the dismissal of the petition interpreting the high court's decision as a defense for the \\"sanctity of marriage\\".

In mid-2020, there was a massive drop in the pond's water levels, the likes of which have only been seen a few other times in the prior 60 years, causing large stretches of mudflats over the pond's north side. It has been speculated that this drop may be due to overdrafting by farmers in Sonoyta as well as the summer heat, but others suspect that the drop may be due to the construction of the Trump wall right nearby, which could have caused cracks in the pond's lining, causing water leakage, as well as excessive pumping of groundwater to create concrete for the wall.

It was built from 1911 to 1912. It is also known to include the Argyle Stairs. The property is owned by the Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The original Argyle Bridges were built for Gloucester Street in 1862, Cumberland Street in 1864 and Princes Street in 1867-68. The Princes Street Bridge was demolished as part of the Sydney Harbour Bridge construction. The inscription from the Princes Street Bridge identifying Charles Moore is now relocated on the south wall of the Argyle Cut. As part of the improvements undertaken by the Sydney Harbour Trust, Gloucester and Cumberland Streets were realigned and the two road bridges over the Argyle Cut replaced by a single bridge at Cumberland Street in 1911-12. Cumberland Street had previously been located to the west of its current location. The Cumberland Street bridge replaced the lower Gloucester Street Bridge and the higher Cumberland Street Bridge over the Argyle Cut. The work also involved the demolition of 22-24 Gloucester Street, part of View Terrace (now 26-30 Gloucester Street), and construction of the abutments to the bridge and the Argyle Stairs. The parapet of the part of the bridge directly over Argyle Street was replaced in the 1950s.  Description  The site includes the 1911 road bridge at Cumberland Street, abutments to the bridge with small obelisk shaped pylons on either side of the road (at the north and south approaches to the bridge), and intact original light fittings. The parapet of the part of the bridge directly over Argyle Street was replaced in the 1950s. The original parapet of the bridge can still be seen to the south of the southern abutments. In 2008 structural cracks and areas of concrete cancer were detected and remedial works carried out to repair the damage. = Condition = As at 4 February 2009, in 2008 remedial works were carried out on the bridge to repair structural cracks and areas of concrete cancer. At the same time the Bridge was thoroughly inspected for any other damage and necessary repairs undertaken.

History The Puntites were ancient Somalis who are believed to traded myrrh, spices, gold, ebony, short-horned cattle, ivory and frankincense with the Ancient Egyptians and ancient Mesopotamia through their commercial ports. An Ancient Egyptian expedition sent to Punt by the 18th dynasty Queen Hatshepsut is recorded on the temple reliefs at Deir el-Bahari, during the reign of the Puntite King Parahu and Queen Ati. In the classical era, the Macrobians, who have been ancestral to the Automoli or ancient Somalis, established a powerful tribal kingdom that ruled large parts of modern Somalia. They were reputed for their longevity and wealth, and were said to be the \\"tallest and handsomest of all men\\".The Geography of Herodotus: Illustrated from Modern Researches and Discoveries by James Talboys Wheeler, pg 1xvi, 315, 526 The Macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers. According to Herodotus' account, the Persian Emperor Cambyses II, upon his conquest of Egypt (525 BC), sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based on his stature and beauty, replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow: if the Persians could manage to draw it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire.John Kitto, James Taylor, The popular cyclop√¶dia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work, (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p.302. The Macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and gold wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains. The Harla an extinct people credited for building various monuments in the Horn Africa are possible candidates of Proto-Somali. After the collapse of Macrobia, several proto-Somali ancient wealthy city-states emerged, such as Malao, Mundus, Mosylon and Opone which competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade, also flourished in Somalia.Oman in history By Peter Vine Page 324 Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of gold, silver, gemstones, frankincense, myrrh, acacia gum, salt, livestock, ivory, feathers, hide (skin) and spices, items which were considered valuable luxuries. Other notable proto-Somali city-states included Avalite, Bulhar, Botiala, Essina, Damo, Hannassa, Sarapion, Nikon, Toniki, Gondal, Macajilayn, Salweyn and Miandi. Genetics In Somalis, the Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated to be 4000‚Äì5000 years (2,500 BCE) for the haplogroup E-M78 cluster Œ≥ and 2100‚Äì2200 years (150 BCE) for Somali T-M184 bearers. Deep subclade E-Y18629 is commonly found in Somalis and has a formation date of 3,700 YBP (years before present) and a TMRCA of 3,300 YBP. States There have been many examples of proto-Somali states.

The flora and fauna is limited by the geography and climate of the island. The habitats on the island include high mountains, lava fields, tundras, rivers, lakes and a coastal plain of varying width. There is a long coastline, much dissected by fjords, especially in the west, north and east, with many offshore islets. Geography View into the Botnsdalur Mountains in western Iceland from the Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur Iceland is of volcanic origin with the landscape being influenced by water and wind erosion, abrasion and frost action. The Highlands form a plateau some above sea level, lying in the central and southeastern part of the island, and occupy about 40% of the landmass; they consist largely of volcanic deserts interspersed with glaciers. Other parts of the country consist of mountains and hills surrounded by coastal lowlands, cut by steep-sided valleys and fiords. There are many small lakes and short, fast-flowing rivers. Only about 25% of the land has a complete cover of vegetation and two fifths of this is marshland. Another 60% is sparsely or very sparsely vegetated. Climate The climate is subarctic. In general, the southern part of the island is warmer, wetter, and windier than the north. The coldest part of the country is the Central Highlands. The low-lying inland areas further north are the driest part but these areas of the country get the heaviest snowfalls in winter. The climate is rendered warmer than other places at similar latitudes by the North Atlantic Current and the coast normally remains free of ice. Plants Iceland moss There is a limited number of plant species in Iceland. At one time a well-forested island, the arrival of settlers was followed by the felling of trees for construction and firewood and few trees now remain. The settlers introduced livestock, and overgrazing, particularly by sheep, led to damage to the volcanic soils. Three quarters of the island is now affected by soil erosion, with the remaining soil unable to support much vegetation. The flora includes about 540 species of plant, with woody plants typically including heather, bilberry, bearberry, crowberry, hairy birch, rowan and willow. Most of the trees are less than in height with a few taller trees in the river valleys of the north and east. Much of the northern part of the country is marshy or tundra, with the vegetation being predominantly mosses, lichens and sedges. Typical is Iceland moss, a lichen which grows abundantly forming mats on the tundras and mountain slopes and which can provide \\"famine food\\" in times of necessity. Sedges and grasses dominate the vascular plants, with 53 species of the former and 47 of the latter. Of dicotyledonous plants, the commonest family is the Asteraceae (daisy family), followed by the Caryophyllaceae (carnation family). There are around 560 species of bryophyte (mosses and liverworts), 550 species of lichen and 1,200 species of fungi, with both lichen and fungi being similar to those found in Scandinavia. Animals Arctic fox in summer coat The only native land mammal on Iceland is the Arctic fox. Walruses were native to Iceland, but disappeared after human settlement, likely as a result of hunting, climate change and/or volcanism. Animals that have been introduced include the American mink, which escaped from fur farms and prospered, and the reindeer. A herd of reindeer in the southeast has died out but a larger herd in the northeast has a population of several thousand animals. The wood mouse has also been introduced and inhabits the countryside, with the house mouse, the brown rat and the black rat being restricted to urban areas. Great skua About 72 species of bird breed on Iceland. These include the gyrfalcon, the white-tailed eagle and the merlin, the snowy owl and the short-eared owl. There are also ducks, geese, waders, gulls and other sea birds, the arctic skua and the great skua, with the Icelandic population of the latter representing almost half of the total world population. There are few passerines (perching birds), perhaps because of a lack of nesting opportunities or a dearth of insect food at some times of year. The rivers and lakes are home to Atlantic salmon, brown trout and Arctic char, as well as European eel and three-spined stickleback, and there are rainbow trout which have escaped from fish hatcheries. There are no amphibians or reptiles on Iceland. Around 270 species of marine fish occur in the waters around Iceland, with the most important commercial species being cod, haddock, sea perch, plaice, herring, capelin and blue whiting. The harbour seal and the grey seal breed on beaches and several species of whale occur in the waters, as well as dolphins and harbour porpoises.

Described as being a cloud of energy or fire, the force is used to destroy or despoil that which displeases Indra. The force is referenced to in Hindu and Jainist texts. Samvartaka is also strongly associated with comets.  Description  In Hinduism and Jainism, samvartaka is a force primarily wielded by the god Indra. However, some texts portray the force as being wielded by deities other than Indra. Regardless of caller or wielder, the force is portrayed as being incredibly destructive. = Instances of use = In the epic Vana Parva, Indra calls forth samvartaka to settle a dispute between himself and Krishna. In the epic, a jealous and prideful Indra sends the cloud to flood the lands of Vrindavan; this is stopped by the intervention of Krishna, who lifts the Govardhan Hill to shield the land from the devastating rain the cloud brings. In Book 3 of the Vana Parva, the hero Yudhishthira prays to the sun, asking the celestial body to \\"let the fire Samvartaka born of thy wrath consumeth the three worlds and existence alone\\" upon the dissolution of the universe. Similarly, the sage Markandeya describes to Yudhishthira how samvartaka, spread by an inauspicious wind, will consume the earth. In another text, a Rudra (storm god) is able to release and command samvartaka to subdue a great bull that has threatened to drink dry the oceans. In this story, samvartaka is depicted as a raging fire. In the works of Garga, an influential Vedic sage in ancient India, samvartaka is described as a devastating, energetic force that will arrive as one of two comets. In the sage's words, \\"Like the stellar wheel rotating (repeating) in the sky, the comet-wheel also repeats in the sky. At the end of 1000 years, at the end of the comet strand, two comets‚ÄîDh≈´ma and Samvartaka‚Äîappear together.\\" Garga writes that these twin comets will cause earthquakes and meteorite showers that will sunder the mountains and the oceans. He notes that samvartaka will be the more devastating of the two, as it will be responsible for \\"reducing\\" the world.A Profile of Indian Astronomy before the SiddhƒÅntic Period Prof. Dr. R. N.

In this text, the comet appears and grows so large as to take up one third of the sky. It is described as having \\"a thin dreadful copper colored spear-like head, ejecting a jet of smoke.\\" While the comet hangs above the world, kings are projected to fight among themselves.

When it failed at its premiere on February 15 1720 at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Voltaire withdrew it and cancelled the printing. Action The action is set in Larissa in Thessaly after the death of Alexander the Great. Art√©mire, the virtuous wife of the usurper Cassandre, who actually loves the rightful aspirant of Philotas, is persecuted by her husband, and is ultimately saved by his unexpected death. The publishers of the Kehl edition of Voltaire's complete works could not find a synopsis for the play, so their arrangement of the surviving fragments was based on a parody of Art√©mire listed in the Com√©die-Italienne in an act by Dominique, only two days after the premiere. Contemporary reception The play was originally conceived as a vehicle for the famous actress Adrienne Lecouvreur, who was to become Voltaire's lover. It was first performed at Sully by a group of aristocratic amateurs, guests of the Duke. After being withdrawn from the public theatre, Art√©mire had seven further performances by request of the Regent's mother Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine.Theodore Besterman: Voltaire, Winkler, M√ºnchen, 1971, p.63f The literary review L'Europe savante reported the play had had few performances, and that it contained the same weaknesses and favourable points as Voltaire's first tragedy Oedipe though it failed where Oedipe had succeeded.L'Europe savante, vol. 12, A. de Rogissart, 1720, p.158 Voltaire reused some of the material from Art√©mire in his 1724 play H√©rode et Mariamne. Although not popular with the theatre-going public, Art√©mire was sufficiently well-received at court to secure Voltaire's permission to return to Paris, from where he had been banished for offending the Regent. Printed editions Voltaire retained the manuscript of the play. Two short fragments from the fourth act were first published by Pierre Desfontaines in the appendix to the Bernard edition of La Ligue in Amsterdam in 1724. A summary and arrangement of the surviving fragments was contained in the 1785 in the Kehl edition of Voltaire's works. Additional fragments from a manuscript of Decroix were incorporated into the Beuchot edition of the works of Voltaire (1829-1840).

Early life Rhinelander was born on June 5, 1858 in New York City. He was one of three sons born to William Rhinelander (1825‚Äì1908), who grew up in Washington Square, and Matilda Cruger (n√©e Oakley) Rhinelander (1827‚Äì1914), who grew up in Gramercy Park. His younger brother was Philip Jacob Rhinelander (1865‚Äì1940), who married Adelaide Brady Kip, and was the father of his namesake, Thomas Jackson Oakley Rhinelander II, who died fighting in France during World War I, and Kip Rhinelander of the 1924 Rhinelander v. Rhinelander infamy. His maternal grandparents were U.S. Representative and Chief Justice of the Superior Court in New York, Thomas Jackson Oakley and Matilda (n√©e Cruger) Oakley (the daughter of Henry Cruger, who had the unique distinction of serving as both a member of Parliament and as a New York State Senator). His paternal grandfather was prominent merchant William Christopher Rhinelander, of whom his father was his only son. Among his paternal aunts was Serena Rhinelander (who donated the former Rhinelander Farm for Holy Trinity Episcopal Church), Mary Rogers (n√©e Rhinelander) Stewart, the wife of Lispenard Stewart and mother of New York State Senator Lispenard Stewart II, T.J.'s first cousin. Rhinelander's ancestor, Philip Jacob Rhinelander, was a German-born French Huguenot who immigrated to the United States in 1686 following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, settling in the newly formed French Huguenot community of New Rochelle, where he amassed considerable property holdings which became the basis for the Rhinelander family's wealth. Career Rhinelander was educated at Columbia Grammar School, and graduated from Columbia College with an AB degree in 1878. While there, he was a member of the Peithologian and Delta Phi secret societies. Two years later, he graduated from Columbia Law School in 1880, was admitted to the bar in 1881, and began working for the family helping to manage their vast real estate holdings. After his grandfather's death in June 1878, he inherited great wealth in the form of shares that held his grandfather's estate, which was conservatively valued at $60,000,000 upon his death. By 1893, the estate was said to be worth $75,000,000 with annual income in excess of $3,000,000. He was elected a director and served as president of the Rhinelander Real Estate Company, one of the largest landholders in New York City, rivaling the Astor, Goelet, and Stuyvesant families. Upon his father's death in 1908, the entire was estate left to his mother. Upon her death in 1914, T.J. and his younger brother inherited all of her $2,000,000 estate, with their elder brother receiving just $1,000 due to his brother's marriage to a chambermaid employed by the family. Rhinelander served with the 7th Regiment, also known as the \\"Silk Stocking\\" regiment, and was generally called \\"Major\\". He served 35 years with the Regiment, thirteen years with the Veterans Corps of Artillery and two with the Ninth Coast Artillery. =Society life= Sch√∂nburg, in Oberwesel on the Rhine. In 1884, T.J. and his brother Philip purchased the ancient castle of Sch√∂nburg in Oberwesel on the Rhine river in Germany, where his famous emigrant ancestor was born. Rhinelander restored the castle, which poet Ferdinand Freiligrath called \\"the most beautiful retreat on the Rhine,\\" between 1885 and 1920. In 1892, Rhinelander and his future bride, Edith, (and cousin Lispenard Stewart) were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York, the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, and the Badminton Club. Rhinelander was a member of the General Society of Colonial Wars, serving as historian general twice, from 1899 to 1902 and agin from 1908-1911. He was also a member of The Huguenot Society of America, serving as its treasurer from 1905 to 1906. Personal life On June 6, 1894, Rhinelander was married to Edith Cruger Sands (1874‚Äì1923), bringing together two old New York families. She was the daughter of Charles Edwin Sands (son of Ferdinand Sands) and Letitia S. (n√©e Campbell) Sands. Her older sister, Letitia Lee Sands, was married to Maturin Livingston Delafield Jr., a Livingston family descendant. Together, they lived at 36 West 52nd Street, and were the parents of one child: * Philip Rhinelander II (1895‚Äì1973), who married Hortense LeBrun Cruger Parsons (1894‚Äì1968) in 1916. She was a descendant of suffragette Lucretia Mott and colonial New York City mayor John Cruger. They divorced in 1935, and he married Hazel (n√©e Marquis) Stuart (1892‚Äì1977), the widow of Charles Buchanan Stuart, that same year. After his wife's death, he continued to live in their ornate brownstone until three years before his death when he moved to 470 Park Avenue in New York City. Rhinelander died at his New York home on July 25, 1946. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. =Descendants= Through his son Phillip, he was the grandfather of socialites LeBrun Cruger \\"Brunie\\" Rhinelander (1917‚Äì2012), wife of financier William G.

The title doesn't have a fixed definition and can mean different things at different companies. Although the craft of distilling has existed for centuries throughout history, the term \\"master distiller\\" only dates back as far as the 1800s when it was first used to acknowledge the distilling expertise and knowledge a person gained after practicing and perfecting the craft of distilling for many years. In more recent usage, the term can have a much broader meaning and is sometimes used for owners and company leaders who run their companies but do not actively create the distilling recipes and processes used at their distilleries.  History  The craft of fermenting and distilling beverages dates back centuries, but the actual term \\"master distiller\\" has not been around for nearly as long. The 1867 edition of The English Cyclopaedia (Arts and Sciences section) offers a clear definition of the original meaning of the term: Originally, master distiller was a term most commonly used in relation to bourbon, both before and after Prohibition in the U.S., and its historical usage was typically limited to only those who had truly mastered the craft of distilling. In particular, Kentucky bourbon makers often had a hierarchy that consisted of distiller, head distiller, and master distiller.  Common responsibilities  Although the level of scientific involvement may vary, master distillers usually supervise the production of the spirits made at their distilleries and are responsible for the final products and their quality. It was once common for master distillers to simply learn through years of hands-on experience, often as apprentices, but now many distillers ‚Äì even those not labeled as master distillers ‚Äì have related academic backgrounds with degrees in chemistry, biology, microbiology, food science, or actual distilling. At the very least, those with master distiller titles typically have some type of related experience and the skills necessary to manage staff and supervise food safety throughout the distilling process. They also frequently possess the public relations skills needed to communicate with the public and the press. A master distiller's exact responsibilities will vary, depending on the company, but common job duties include: = Product development = A modern master distiller who fits the traditional definition and actively participates in the production of existing spirits and the creation of new ones often has a background in chemistry and yeast physiology combined with years of distilling experience. However, some learn to master their craft without a formal education or training, instead learning from mentors who train them on the job. Regardless of the method, they learn how to take raw base ingredients, such as various grains for different types of whiskey or sugar cane for rum, and create fermented washes designed to produce spirits with very specific desired characteristics. The spirit produced at different points in the distillation process varies in quality and has different characteristics. Making \\"cuts\\" to the distilled spirit to separate the heads (foreshots), hearts, and tails (feints) is an important part of the process that is often supervised by master distillers. They also choose the type of container for aging, such as wooden casks, and make decisions about blending, filtering, coloring, and bottling. Even when master distillers entrust recipe-based decisions on malting, fermentation, maturation, and blending to other experts on their teams, they are generally responsible for the quality of the final product. They usually source the raw materials themselves and work with tasters on quality control to ensure consistent quality and flavor across all batches. They also have to ensure the distillery maintains the proper facilities and equipment for long-term storage for products that require aging. = Marketing = Master distillers often participate in the development of marketing campaigns and financing initiatives for new and existing products. With a goal of maximizing the value of the spirits produced by the distillery, they often incorporate the opinions of marketing teams and tasters into the product development phases. Additionally, master distillers often serve as the \\"face\\" of the distillery, meaning they are usually the recognizable person who interacts with the public and the press at tastings, product launch events, trade shows, and other key events. They work with everyone from customers to wholesalers and sometimes even other distilleries to promote products and gain a loyal following of satisfied customers. = Management = In addition to managing staff, master distillers are often responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the distillery, including handling finances and organizing distribution systems. They may have varying levels of involvement in the distilling process but usually at least manage the distilling team and plan staff training and development for a range of duties, including distillery functions like mashing and fermenting and administrative functions like accounting. Ensuring the team meets food safety standards at all times is also a key responsibility. = Administrative = On an administrative level, master distillers are sometimes in charge of regulatory paperwork to ensure all spirits remain in compliance with government rules and standards. The information that is monitored includes details about raw ingredients, equipment, and final product specifications. Master distillers either record each phase of the distillation process themselves or assign this duty to someone else. Detailed records are necessary to ensure the right procedures are followed to create products that meet all the quality and food safety guidelines.  Training  Various schools and institutes offer programs to teach distilling. Additionally, some distilleries offer educational programs, often combined with on-the-job training.

Nathan \\"Nearest\\" Green ‚Äì The actual first master distiller of Jack Daniel's whiskey went unacknowledged for more than a century, but Brown-Forman ‚Äì the owner of Jack Daniel's ‚Äì officially recognized Green, an African American former slave, as the mentor of a young Jack Daniel in May 2017. Two new whiskeys named after Green ‚Äì Uncle Nearest 1856 aged whiskey and Uncle Nearest 1856 silver whiskey ‚Äì were released the same year. John Jameson ‚Äì Scottish by birth, Jameson took over management of the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin after marrying Margaret Haig, a cousin of the owners.

The actress had wanted to appear in the serial since the start of her acting career and described the part as her \\"dream job\\". During the audition process, McNamee was paired with various male actors to find the right combination for the Morgan siblings. A month later, she learned that she had won the role of Tori and began filming in November 2015. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 5 May 2016. The character was introduced to the show along with her three brothers; Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood), Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger). Tori is portrayed as a caring, intelligent, understanding, successful doctor. She is very protective of her brothers and comes to Summer Bay ahead of them to see if it is safe to live there. She is caught up in an explosion at the local caravan park and helps treat several characters. The Morgans initially concealed the fact that they were in witness protection. The storyline saw the siblings targeted by their parents' killers, leading Tori to be held hostage, threatened, and involved in a plane crash. Later storylines have revolved around Tori's romantic relationships with Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor), Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall), and Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason). In 2018, a new storyline arc began with Tori deciding to become a mother and saw her undergoing fertility treatment in order to have a child. For her portrayal of Tori, McNamee has received nominations for the Logie Award for Best New Talent and the Inside Soap Award for Best Daytime Star. Readers of TV Week voted the character as their favourite Morgan out of her and Justin. Casting On 22 November 2015, Australian news outlets reported that Penny McNamee had joined the cast of Home and Away as a new doctor called Tori. McNamee stated that the part was her \\"dream job\\" and she had wanted to appear on the show since she began her acting career. Following her first audition for the role, McNamee received a call back, along with five other actresses. They were each paired with various male actors to find the right combination for the four Morgan siblings. She explained, \\"we spent about 10 hours, all 24 of us, going in and matching with different brothers to see which grouping worked best and had the most chemistry ‚Äì which actors could work well as a family.\\" McNamee admitted that she \\"desperately\\" wanted the role, and found the month long wait for news \\"fairly stressful.\\" When she was contacted, McNamee could not initially answer the call as she was in a hospital with relatives. She filmed her first scenes in early November, and made her debut as Tori on 5 May 2016. Development=Characterisation= Tori is the second eldest Morgan sibling and a successful doctor. The show's series producer Lucy Addario said Tori was \\"a total sweetheart\\" and someone everyone wants to be friends with. Addario also described Tori as \\"loving, understanding, caring and supportive.\\" McNamee described her character as having a \\"warmth and sense of humour\\", but she tends to avoid personal questions, so others find it hard to connect with her sometimes. The actress called Tori \\"a total commitment-phobe\\", and commented that she was nothing like that, as she married her high school sweetheart. Growing up with her three brothers has left Tori able to laugh at herself and good with comebacks during arguments. McNamee told Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz that Tori is \\"a real family girl\\". She is protective of her brothers and often puts them first over everything else, which has affected her romantic life. McNamee added, \\"I think that's often where she goes wrong.\\" McNamee also said her character is \\"highly intelligent and driven\\", and her co-workers respect her \\"professionalism and her kindness\\". McNamee initially thought Tori had been written as a \\"Doctor Death\\" character, as her early storylines saw the characters she came into contact with die, lose limbs, or have bad events happen to them. The actress stated, \\"It's been a very bumpy ride for Tori so far. You think she'd leave. You think she would think 'Wow. All the bad stuff happens here, I'm out'.\\" McNamee admitted that she had some trouble pronouncing the medical terms, especially anaesthetic and anaesthetist. =Introduction= The character was introduced during the caravan park explosion storyline. Tori attends a fundraiser for the local hospital at the Summer Bay Caravan Park. When a gas bottle is knocked over and ignites, the resulting blast injures many of the attendees. Tori immediately starts to help those who have been injured. Of her character's reaction, McNamee stated, \\"She sees all these people who need help and she just goes into doctor mode.\\" The actress also thought it was lucky Tori is there, as fellow doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) is \\"emotionally invested\\" as his friends and wife have been hurt. Tori \\"tag-teams\\" with Nate to help save everyone. Back at the hospital, Tori also has \\"the difficult task\\" of informing Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) that her injured arm needs to be amputated. As Tori continues to treat the victims of the explosion, she realises that she feels \\"at peace\\" in the Bay and believes that she can settle down there. She also finds the residents are kind and welcoming, which McNamee said was something that Tori has been \\"craving\\" for a while. McNamee also said Tori wants \\"a fresh start\\", but she had \\"some dark secrets.\\" Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tries to find out more information about her, after he learns that she is looking for a four-bedroom house. He initially assumes that Tori has a husband and children. Tori is actually looking for a house for herself and her three brothers, who she does not talk about much. McNamee explained, \\"Tori's brothers aren't there and she hasn't quite figured out if they, as a family, are going to stick around. So, she doesn't want to share too much information if these people aren't going to become their neighbours and friends.\\" Alf begins to suspect Tori is hiding something, as she tries to dodge his questions. Tori's brothers eventually arrive in the Bay, and Tori helps defuse a fight between Justin and Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason), as she announces that he, Brody, and Mason are her siblings. McNamee teased, \\"So far, Tori has been very mysterious. But her brothers arrive, and that's when things really take off and all her secrets will be spilled!\\" =Witness protection= Upon their introduction, an Inside Soap columnist observed that the Morgans appeared to live a normal life, but they had \\"a dangerous past\\" and nobody was allowed to know who they really were. The family initially keep to themselves, and Justin warns Tori against befriending Nate. Stewart commented that it does not matter how upset Tori is by Justin's demand, \\"it's just 'no' to making friends with Nate.\\" Stewart also said that the Morgans have to live by a certain set of rules, which relate to their secret. Justin is concerned when Tori admits that she told Nate their parents are dead, as he does not want Nate \\"to follow the crumbs.\\" Mason's former girlfriend Lara Adams (Elle Harris) comes to the Bay to see him, and Mason tells her that his family are in witness protection. Brody later reveals that he is being followed and Justin thinks the family need to leave the Bay immediately. Guest character Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery) was soon introduced to the storyline. After he approaches Nate to talk, it emerges that he has been tracking the Morgans. Spike later drugs Nate with ketamine and he collapses. When Tori finds a needle mark on his arm, she believes that someone has harmed Nate to get to her. As the staff wonder if Nate has been using drugs, Tori \\"is full of fear and panic\\", as she knows the incident is connected to her family. She also knows that she needs to look after Nate, keep her brothers safe, and continue being professional when letting Nate know what has happened without giving her secret away. Tori learns Spike is responsible after viewing CCTV footage, and she rushes home knowing that her family need to leave because their location has been discovered. However, Spike is already inside the house and he is \\"really violent towards her\\". McNamee told Cromarty (TV Week) that Tori is aware that there are people out there who want to hurt her family, but this is the first time she has been physically assaulted. The actress described the ordeal as \\"terrifying\\" and said Tori fears that Spike is going to kill her. Justin arrives home and Tori worries that he will endanger them both, as he is a \\"hothead\\". In the wake of the Spike's appearance, the Morgans are moved to a safe house by their police liaison officer Atticus Decker (John Adam), where they all agree that they are sick of running from the drugs syndicate that killed their parents. While Tori, Brody and Justin are arguing, Mason slips outside to meet Lara and it emerges that she is working for Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), the man who killed the Morgan's parents. Spike and Blaine hold the family hostage at gunpoint. The scriptwriters later devised a large stunt storyline involving a plane crash. Tori's love interest Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall) organises a plane trip to a winery for her birthday and invites her friends and family along. However, Justin is not with the group and tries to contact them, after receiving a threatening message from Spike, who has sabotaged the plane. The passengers pass out from a carbon dioxide leak, but Duncan manages to make a crash landing in the sand, minimising the impact and ensuring the survival of everyone on board. McNamee revealed that the plane crash sequence was filmed two hours north of Sydney. The cast spent 12 hours filming in sand dunes and the heat, which McNamee described as fun, but \\"hard work\\". Later developments in the storyline saw the Morgans find their half-sister Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble), while members of the syndicate are arrested and jailed. The Morgans realise that they are finally free of witness protection, and they decide to keep their assigned identities instead of returning to their old names. Speaking to Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, McNamee said that having been in witness protection for seven years, the family find it hard to believe that they are finally safe. She continued, \\"There are still some loose ends to be tied up, though, and unfortunately that spells danger for the family.\\" As part of the show's 2016 season finale, Tori is kidnapped and brought to corrupt police officer Ranae Turner (Sacha Horler), who then lures Justin to their location. Ranae threatens to kill them both, before going after Brody and Mason. McNamee stated, \\"This is high stakes for Tori and Justin ‚Äì the syndicate murdered their parents, and they're prepared to kill again.\\" Justin and Tori free themselves and flee, but Ranae stabs Justin. During Home and Aways season opener in January 2017, Justin is rushed to the hospital in a serious condition and needing surgery. Tori finds that Nate is busy with a patient, and asks the nurses to prep Justin, as she will have to perform the surgery herself. At the last moment, new surgeon Riley Hawkins (Ryan O'Kane) steps in to perform the operation. He calls Tori by her real name, Tess, and it emerges that they used to be in a relationship. McNamee described the moment as \\"shocking\\" for Tori, as she has not seen Riley in seven years. Riley is also surprised to learn that Tori and her family have been in witness protection, which is why they left so suddenly. McNamee praised the writers for the witness protection storyline and said she loved working so closely with Stewart, Heywood and Pledger. She added that she was happy about moving on from the plot and focus on more \\"joyful\\" stories for Tori. =Love triangles=Nate Cooper and Duncan Stewart Tori becomes involved in her first love triangle with Nate Cooper and Duncan Stewart (actor Benedict Wall pictured). Tori's friendship with Nate becomes the subject of gossip among the nurses at the hospital. Nate is struggling to move on from the breakdown of his marriage to Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen) and confides in Tori. Pryor told TV Week's Stephen Downie that Tori is someone Nate can really talk to and she provides \\"a nice escape\\" for him, which he values. After Tori sees a group of nurses staring at her, she and Nate learn that there is a rumour going around that Tori is the reason Nate and Ricky's marriage ended. Nate tells his colleagues that Ricky left him because of issues between them, and that Tori was not involved, so they should get on with their work. Tori is appreciative of Nate's efforts to quash the rumour, but their friendship is left strained. However, later that week, Tori comes over to Nate's home with a bottle of wine and falls asleep on his couch. The writers continued to put obstacles in the way of Tori and Nate forming a relationship, by developing a love triangle for the characters. Tori is \\"devastated\\" when Nate begins dating Danika Kulevski (Ash Ricardo), however, she soon befriends Alf's son Duncan, who makes it clear that he is attracted to her. McNamee said Tori becomes \\"flustered\\" by Duncan's advances, as she has feelings for Nate, but he is the less complicated option. She also finds his upfront attitude \\"refreshing\\". A drunk Nate later comes to Tori's home and declares that he does have feelings for her. When Duncan organises the plane trip for her birthday, Tori is overwhelmed by the gesture, as she has yet to work out her feelings for him. Tori is torn between Nate and Duncan, and is further confused when Nate admits that what he said while drunk was genuine. McNamee commented, \\"Tori is still wary of Nate, but can't deny her feelings. She has this natural chemistry she tries to avoid, but can't.\\" Tori turns Nate down, as she wants to give Duncan a chance. However, Nate refuses to accept her rejection and joins the group going on the trip. Following the plane crash, Justin tells Tori that it is time they relaxed their rules on forming relationships, which changes Tori's mind about closing herself off from romance. She meets up with Duncan, as she knows he is blaming himself for the crash, and they have a picnic at the caravan park. As they get to know each other, Tori \\"gets gutsy\\" and kisses Duncan. McNamee pointed out that he was the first person Tori had let herself get close to in seven years. Tori and Duncan's relationship comes under strain following the introduction of his former wife Caroline Stewart (Nicole Shostak) and young son Bryce (Jack and Ace Long). It soon emerges that Caroline has Huntington's disease and Tori assumes that Duncan will leave the Bay to care for her, but he chooses to stay with Tori. Duncan commits to the relationship, while Tori still has feelings for Nate. Duncan later leaves to look after Bryce, which ends the relationship with Tori. McNamee explained that while Tori is attracted to Nate, she thinks he is the \\"dangerous option\\" due to his relationship history. When Nate and Tori get stuck in a hospital elevator, they end up having sex. They become awkward around each other, as they work out what the moment means for their relationship. Tori later tells Nate that she does not want it to be a one off, or the start of a casual relationship, but he admits that he does not want that either and they kiss. The couple initially decide to keep their relationship a secret, until Tori admits that she dislike the secrecy. Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy noted that Tori's change of heart was \\"slightly ironic given her family history.\\" Nate agrees, and kisses her in front of Kat Chapman (Pia Miller) to show they are together, before they go on their first actual date. Nate Cooper and Riley Hawkins Writers soon implemented a break up for the couple, and began a second love triangle for Tori. When the Morgans' involvement with the drug syndicate and their time in witness protection is printed on the front page of the local newspaper, Nate comes to Tori's home to confront her, before she has a chance to talk to him about it. As Tori apologises for not saying something sooner, Nate struggles to deal with her past and questions whether he really knows her. When Tori begs him to give her a chance, telling him that she is still the same women he fell for, Nate replies that he cannot be with someone who does not trust him. McNamee called the development \\"a pretty big speed bump in the road for Tori and Nate.\\" Tori's former boyfriend, surgeon Riley Hawkins (O'Kane) was introduced in early 2017. As he and Tori work alongside each other at the hospital, Nate becomes jealous that Tori has history with another man. Riley informs Tori that Nate made a bet about winning her back, which escalates the rift between her and Nate. Tori also sees Nate berating Mason at the hospital, so when she sees Riley offering Mason the chance to help him out, she softens towards him and later invites him for a drink. The former couple soon get back together. In an interview with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, McNamee thought that Tori was tempted by Riley, as she was feeling vulnerable after Nate's rejection. She finds Riley \\"fun and flirty, and he makes Tori feel a bit wild!\\" McNamee continued saying that Tori's heart ultimately lies with Nate, and found that viewers agreed. Tori and Riley's relationship does not last long. Brody tells his sister that he saw Riley flirting with Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast), leading Tori to doubt Riley's commitment to her, especially as he cheated on her once before. Riley later asks Tori to move to the city with him. He then sets Nate up, suggesting that Nate has committed medical negligence in Billie Ashford's (Tessa de Josselin) death, which Tori has to help investigate. Tori finds issues with Riley's report, and Nate is later cleared. Tori confronts Riley and accuses him of making deliberate exaggerations about Billie's health in a bid to get Nate fired, which he does not deny. Riley accuses Tori of still having feelings for Nate, and she ends their relationship. Pryor decided to leave the serial in 2017 and his exit aired in June of that year, meaning his character's relationship with Tori would end shortly after they get back together. Nate and Tori's relationship becomes strained when Nate reveals that he recently turned down a job with CareFlight. Tori believes that they should have discussed it together, and later becomes \\"frustrated\\" when Nate keeps secrets for Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen). Tori was then brought into Brody's drug addiction storyline, as Nate decides to break up with her. Just before he has the chance to tell her the relationship is over, Tori drinks from a water jug and immediately falls ill, leading to her hospitalisation. She later learns that she has been poisoned by Brody's drug dealer William Zannis (Caleb Alloway), who poured potassium into the water jug. =Relationship with Martin Ashford= Following her break up with Nate, producers decided to pair Tori with Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason). The story arc begins with the pair bonding, as Tori treats Ash's young niece Luc Patterson when she is hospitalised. Tori develops a crush on Ash after seeing his \\"caring, paternal side\\", and she offers her support when he realises that he will have to raise Luc as a single parent, following his own relationship break up with Kat Chapman. When Tori encourages Ash to have a night off, he suggests they have lunch together at his apartment instead. Tori and Ash share \\"an emotionally charged moment\\" in which they almost kiss when Ash opens up to Tori, and she makes a quick exit. Speaking to an Inside Soap columnist, McNamee explained \\"Every girl has a crush on a bad boy at some stage, and now it's Tori's turn! However, Tori is scared that she is imagining Ash's feelings for her. She thinks that he couldn't possibly like her, which is why she runs off.\\" Ash and Kat go on a date to repair their relationship. Both Ash and Kat confide in Tori about how the date went. Of her character's reaction, McNamee commented, \\"She was optimistic that there was something there, and was floored when they shared a moment. But when Kat and Ash go on a date, she's embarrassed for thinking there might have been something.\\" McNamee also said that Tori does not want to risk jeopardising her friendship with Kat, so she does not plan to take her crush any further. She noted that Tori's feelings for Ash prevent her from being a good friend to Kat, leaving her feeling \\"torn and disloyal.\\" Kat soon realises that she and Ash have been talking about their relationship with Tori, and accuses Tori of \\"meddling\\". Their friendship is strained as Kat becomes suspicious of why Tori has been around more than usual. She later confronts Ash for not realising that Tori likes him and asks that he does not spend time with her anymore. After Ash and Kat's relationship ends, Tori tells her friend Leah Patterson (Ada Nicodemou) that she is not interested in pursuing Ash, so Leah encourages Tori to go on a date with another man, leading Tori to arrange a date with policeman Colin (Ben Barber), who she meets in the queue at the diner. Ash is shown to be jealous of the development and spies on Tori and Colin during their date. Tori is \\"furious\\" when Ash disrupts the date, prompting Colin to leave. Later that day, Ash comes to see Tori to apologise, and he declares his feelings for her. Tori refuses to take his declaration seriously, believing that Ash is just on the rebound from Kat. Tori goes on another date with Colin, while Ash turns up with a date of his own, leading to jealousy from them both. When both dates come to an end, Tori and Ash argue before he kisses her. She responds for a few seconds, before pushing him away as she assumes he is still on the rebound. McNamee found that viewers liked the couple and were waiting for them to get together. Tori and Ash eventually start a relationship. Their first date, a meal at Salt, does not go according to plan when they realise that some of the locals are watching them, Ash's drink is knocked over, while Tori receives an emergency call. Ash and Tori share a \\"passionate\\" kiss, but he cuts the date short to get back to Luc. Scriptwriters soon wrote in a big obstacle for the couple when Kat learns she is pregnant. After assuming that her new partner Robbo (Jake Ryan) is the father, Kat realises that she is further along in her pregnancy, meaning the child is Ash's. This leaves Tori feeling \\"insecure and paranoid\\" about the relationship, as she fears that Ash will want to reunite with Kat. She admits that she is unsure if they have a future together. When Ash and Kat begin spending a lot of time together, Tori becomes suspicious and refuses to believe that they are just discussing the baby. Ash admits that he and Kat do share a secret, but it could put Tori in danger, leading her to end the relationship. Tori reunites with Ash, but their relationship is soon threatened by Ash's desire to get revenge on Robbo, who he blames for the death of Kat and his unborn son. When Ash learns that Tori has been hiding Robbo, so that he will not harm him, he ends the relationship and refuses to accept that Tori was trying to protect him. Tori helps to save Robbo from prison by getting him psychiatric help, which leaves Ash \\"fuming\\". He attacks Robbo, before turning on Tori and \\"hurling some home truths\\" at her. Tori's motive for helping Robbo is questioned by her brothers, who think that she may have developed feelings for him, but she assures them she just wants to get him justice. Tori and Ash are brought back together when he is crushed underneath a car he is repairing. She supervises Justin as they help stabilise Ash until the paramedics arrive. Tori is then forced to tell him that lifting the car could kill him, which prompts Ash to admit that he understands why she helped Robbo and that he forgives her. Ash temporarily leaves the Bay to do \\"some soul searching\\". On his return, he appears calmer and he and Tori become closer again. She overhears Ash telling Justin that he regrets losing her, so she pulls Ash in for a kiss. The following day they admit the kiss was a mistake and happened out of habit. As they talk, Ash admits that he returned for her, so they agree to work through their problems from the last few months. Following Mason's decision to leave Home and Away, producers took the decision to split the couple up for good. Ash struggles to deal with his grief over Kat and the baby's deaths, so he purchases a one-way ticket to Cyprus to be with Luc. After hearing that Ash is leaving, Tori \\"is in denial\\" and refuses to say goodbye, following their failed attempt at reconciliation. As Ash drives out of the Bay, Tori rushes to catch him and he tells he that she is one of the best things to happen to him. They share one last kiss, before he leaves. =IVF and pregnancy= Tori risks her relationship with Ash to help his enemy Robbo (actor Jake Ryan pictured). She later asks Robbo to father her child. The character was given her first issue-led storyline in 2018, as she decides to undergo fertility treatment to have a child. The arc began shortly after Ash's exit, when Tori suspects she may be pregnant. Realising that she wants to be a mother, Tori decides to use In vitro fertilisation (IVF) and a sperm donor to have a child. Of Tori's decision, McNamee said \\"Tori has made no secret of the fact that she would love to have children. Ultimately, she assumed, she would find a partner and they would have kids together. However, so far, a long-lasting relationship has evaded her, and so she has only recently started considering IVF.\\" Fertility tests show Tori has low ovarian reserves, meaning she needs to start IVF treatment straight away. McNamee said that Tori is \\"sad and frustrated\\" by the news, as it will be harder for her to have children. After learning that there is a long waiting list for donor sperm at the fertility clinic, Leah suggests that she asks someone she knows to provide a donation. Tori initially dismisses the idea, but she soon reconsiders and asks Robbo, knowing that he will make a good father. Robbo is \\"stunned\\" by Tori's request and McNamee told Cullen (TV Week) that Tori has not made \\"the decision lightly.\\" The situation is complicated by Robbo's burgeoning relationship with Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost). Tori gives him a chance to back out, knowing that he can have a family with Jasmine, but he wants to honour his agreement with Tori. As the storyline played out on-screen, McNamee announced that she was pregnant with her second child. McNamee said she planned to carry on filming with the show until she was around eight months, and that her pregnancy could be written into Tori's storyline. She also said that she felt \\"a very strong connection\\" to her character's story and found it to be both emotional and poignant. After Tori learns she is pregnant, Robbo becomes over protective of her. He sleeps on the porch of the Morgan's home, continuously calls Tori, and later breaks a window when he does not get a reply to his knocking. Both Tori and Jasmine become concerned by his behaviour. McNamee told Jackie Brygel of New Idea that Tori and Robbo's journey \\"proves to be more complicated than they anticipated.\\" Tori miscarries the baby, and while she is devastated, she wants to try again as soon as possible. However, Robbo admits that the miscarriage has made him reconsider the idea of having a baby with her and he says that he cannot put himself through it again. Tori secretly undergoes embryo implantation, and is left feeling immense guilt when Robbo and Jasmine announce their engagement. McNamee noted that her character \\"has always had a very strong moral compass\\", so she feels bad about what she has done. After confiding in Leah, Tori decides to tell Robbo the truth, but she stops herself at the last moment. McNamee said Tori is wary of Robbo's reaction. Reception For her portrayal of Tori, McNamee received a nomination for the Logie Award for Best New Talent in 2017. The following year, she was included on the longlist for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. TV Week readers voted Tori as their Morgan favourite out of her and Justin. She received 89% of the vote. Shortly after her arrival on UK screens, a Sunday Mail reporter observed that Tori \\"hasn't been around for long but has already been involved in pretty much everything.\\" They also called Nate \\"Tori's knight in shining armour\\" as they got to know each other. Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz commented that the Morgan's arrival \\"sets off what seems like a never-ending chain of disasters.\\" Tori's love life in particular has been the subject of critical commentary. Ali Cromarty of TV Week pointed out \\"The chemistry between Nate and Tori has been sizzling since they met.\\" Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy commented that \\"it's clear a rather complicated love square could be brewing\\" between Tori, Nate, Duncan and Danika. A writer for Soap World observed that \\"the slow-burn romance between Tori and Duncan has been one of the sweetest love affairs that the Summer Bay locals have witnessed in a long time.\\" They also thought it was \\"a case of like minds meeting\\" at the right time. During a feature on the top Aussie soap moments of 2016, a TV Soap columnist wrote, \\"Romance on Home and Away was at fever pitch in 2016 and no one was more aware of that than Tori. The sexy newcomer had both hot doctor Nate and local returnee Duncan fighting for her affections.\\" After Tori chose Nate, the columnist commeted that their relationship had \\"plenty of sexual-tension-fuelled moments.\\" Kerry Harvey (Stuff.co.nz) dubbed the character \\"unlucky-in-love\\" and found her relationship with Ash to be \\"tempestuous\\". In February 2018, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy included Ash and Tori's on-off relationship in his feature on \\"7 soap storylines that are past their sell-by dates\\". He wrote, \\"Home and Away is known for endless make-up-then-break-up storylines at the best of times, but no couple has been through the wringer more than Ash and Tori recently. Ever since getting together last year, the pair have endured weekly dramas due to Ash's anger issues and Tori's paranoia that he still has feelings for his old flame Kat (good job she won't have to worry about that for much longer).\\" Kilkelly bemoaned the fact that he and his colleagues had to regularly write about a \\"shock split\\" for the couple during their weekly spoilers, and asked the producers to \\"either break them up for good or give them at least two weeks of happiness!\\" ReferencesExternal links *Tori Morgan at 7plus *Tori Morgan at TVNZ Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 2016 Fictional physicians Fictional orphans Fictional victims of kidnapping Fictional female doctors Female characters in television ","title":"Tori Morgan"},{"id":"58964372","text":"Roger Vincken was a Belgian boxer.

In all, 17 people from various families were killed in the violence. The deaths led to a criminal case‚ÄîMachhi Singh And Others vs State Of Punjab‚Äîwhich resulted in legal precedent being set on when the death penalty should be applied in Indian courts.  History  On the night of 12 August 1977, a series of attacks took place in and around five villages in Punjab, India. The attacks were organized and perpetrated by Machhi Singh, a local man who was in a feud with another man, Amar Singh, and his sister Piaro Bai. The victims of the attacks were all part of Amar and Piaro's family, while the perpetrators were all affiliated with Machhi Singh. In all, 17 people were killed, after which Machhi Singh and some of his close relations were arrested. Following the arrest of Machhi Singh, he and several other men who had participated in the attacks were put on trial for murder and for breaching law and order. Arrests continued, and in all 11 of Singh's affiliates (many of whom were close relatives) were put on trial for various crimes. 5 sessions of cases were held, all with Machhi Singh named as the primary defendant. By the end of the first round of legal proceedings in 1980, 9 men had been sentenced to life in prison, while Machhi Singh and three others were sentenced to death. Upon being sentenced to death, the convicts made a total of fourteen appeals before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. These appeals were rejected by the court, and thus the death penalty sentences were upheld. Undeterred, Singh and the three other men asked for special leave to have their requests for an appeal heard before the Indian Supreme Court. This was accepted, and the court began the appeal process for Machhi Singh And Others vs State Of Punjab in 1983. The court's verdict was that the death penalty sentence should not be overturned as, though the crimes had been committed to settle a dispute, said crimes had been violent, destructive, and egregious enough to warrant the death penalty. In making this verdict, this established the legal test that the death penalty should be reserved for the \\"rarest of rare\\" cases in which the manner of commission or the motive behind the crime were unusually cruel. In the aftermath of the case, the \\"rarest of rare\\" legal precedent created by the case became the standard guideline for Indian courts entertaining the issuing of the death penalty.

She works on enantioselective catalysis and natural product synthesis. She won the American Chemical Society's 2019 Elias James Corey Award.  Early life and education  Dong was born in Big Spring, Texas. She was the daughter of a machinist and manicurist and the first of her family to graduate from college. She grew up in Anaheim, California. She studied chemistry at University of California, Irvine as a Regents' scholar. She decided to become a scientist during her sophomore year after taking a class with Larry E. Overman. She completed a research project with Larry E. Overman, and graduated magna cum laude in 1998. She met her future husband, Wilmer Alkhas, at the University of California, Irvine. She moved to University of California, Berkeley as a graduate student. She worked with David MacMillan and earned her master's degree in 2000. She joined California Institute of Technology for her PhD, working on the Zwitterionic Claisen Rearrangement and the total synthesis of Erythronolide B. Dong was appointed a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley College of Chemistry, working on supramolecular chemistry with Robert G. Bergman and Ken Raymond.  Research and career  Dong moved to Canada to work at the University of Toronto. She was awarded an Ontario Research Fund grant in 2008. She delivered the inaugural Eli Lilly Young lecture at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 2009, where she discussed the catalytic transformations of C-H bonds. At Toronto, she worked on heterocycles for medicinal chemistry. She demonstrated how lactones could be made from ketoaldehydes using rhodium catalysts, achieving regio- and enantioselective lactones without any waste products. She continues to explore new reagents, catalysts and strategies for organic synthesis. She was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 2009 and an Amgen Young Investigator in 2010. In 2010 she was awarded the AstraZeneca Award in Chemistry. She won an Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award of the American Chemical Society in 2010 for her contributions to organic chemistry. She was made an Adrain Brook distinguished professor at the University of Toronto in 2011. That year she won the Roche Excellence in Chemistry award. She was made a Novartis lecturer in 2012 and a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in 2013. She became a lecturer for the Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry in Japan. She returned to the University of California, Irvine, in 2013. Her group came with her, working on catalytic hydroacylation and the activation of aldehyde C-H bonds. She became an associate editor of the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Chemical Science in 2015. She delivered a talk at TEDxIrvine in 2015, talking about her passion for organic chemistry. She demonstrated that rhodium catalysis could be used to make cyclic peptides. She achieved this by using entirely achiral building blocks and hydrogenation catalysts. Rh-hydride catalysis permits enantioselective reduction and allows access to motifs popular in medicinal chemistry. She combines rhodium with Jacobsen's amine. =Awards and honors= In 2016 she was awarded the Iota Sigma Pi Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award for her exceptional research in catalytic hydroacylation in 2016.

Early life and education Hart was born Alice Marion Rowland to Alex William Rowland and his wife, Henrietta Maria Margeretta Ditges. He was part of the Rowland Macassar oil company family. The family lived in London at Lower Sydenham. Hart was educated at the Apothecaries Society in London and went on to further study medicine in Paris. One of her sisters, Fanny, was badly brain-damaged. Another sister was Dame Henrietta Rowland Barnett who was also a philanthropist. Together these two sisters taught the poor at Toynbee Hall. Career In 1883 Hart went to Donegal with her husband where they discovered extreme poverty. Hart made an appeal publicly for money to deal with the acute issues but also saw the need to find a way to deal with the chronic unemployment in the area. Sha also noticed and was impressed by the standard of local craftmanship. She decided that the best option was to revive the local cottage industries, especially of weaving tweed. By the end of 1883 the Donegal Industrial Fund had been founded with ¬£50 capital and contacts in London for a market for knits. In 1884 the Donegal tweed was shown at the London International Health exhibition and was so successful that Hart opened a shop at 31 New Cavendish St., London. Hart worked with the local weavers, sending designs and examples of Scottish tweeds to them and by experimenting with dyes from local plants. The result was dyes that won a Sanitary Institute of Great Britain medal. In 1885 Hart expanded her ideas, appealing to Irish women for help in setting up embroidery schools which resulted in the ‚ÄòKells embroidery‚Äô schools. Classes were held all over the country teaching the embroidery of flax on linen using designs from Irish manuscripts and Japanese art. Hart may have created the Japanese designs herself as she and her husband owned an important collection of Japanese art and she was a noted watercolourist. She had paintings shown in both the Dudley and Dowdeswell galleries as well as being commended by the Magazine of Art in 1895 for her far east landscapes. The Kells schools produced household items which were displayed at the London International Inventions Exhibition in 1885 where they won a gold medal. By 1886 the Donegal industrial fund moved to bigger premises into what became known as ‚ÄòDonegal House‚Äô at 43 Wigmore St., London. They were given a grant to allow for further schools to be opened for instruction in weaving and embroidery. Hart also invested her own and her friends money into the business. In 1888 at the Irish Exhibition held in Olympia, London she set up the successful exhibit of the a ‚ÄòDonegal industrial village‚Äô. She followed the original crafts with investment in carpentry and woodcarving. Farm labourers from Donegal were brought to train in the Regent St. Polytechnic until the workshop was opened in Gweedore in October 1891. Apart from the more usual household goods the shop also got commissions from people like Lady Aberdeen. She initially assisted Hart in the creation of an industrial village at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, though a later falling out meant that there were two such villages present. Throughout the work with the fund Hart painted. After a trip to Burma with her husband she wrote a book on the people and the country. She became the editor of House Beautiful in 1904. The Donegal Industrial Fund itself didn't survive long after Hart was no longer involved. But it had created huge support for the industries and trained large numbers of people in the area.

Early life  Hirsch was born in Hamm. She joined the BDM at age sixteen and became one of its principal organizers in the town of Monschau. In the late stages of World War II, she was part of Werwolf (German for werewolf), a German resistance group that operated behind enemy lines.  Unternehmen Karneval  Unternehmen Karneval was a Werwolf mission authorized by Heinrich Himmler to assassinate Dr. Franz Oppenhoff, who, in October 1944, was appointed mayor of Aachen by the Americans after they took control of the city. Hitler took a personal interest in this appointment and ordered Oppenhoff's elimination. = Team = The team assembled by Generalinspekteur f√ºr Spezialabwehr Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann, who was given the task by Himmler, was: * Untersturmf√ºhrer-SS (Lt.)

Morgenschweiss and Hirsch, who knew the city well and acted as guide, would enter town and locate their target. After identifying his daily schedule, they would pass the information to Wenzel and Leitgeb. Following the assassination, the team would head east toward friendly lines. They were to stick to the plan even if separated. Traveling strictly at night, they would hide in forester and game warden cabins during daylight. All carried forged papers identifying them as members of the Reich‚Äôs Organisation Todt labour force. If captured, they were to convince their interrogators that they were working on nearby border fortifications. =Assassination= On 20 March 1945 the team were flown in a captured, Luftwaffe-operated B-17 Flying Fortress from Hildesheim airfield near Hanover and parachuted around the village of Gemmenich. Upon landing they were discovered by a 20-year-old Dutch border guard, Joseph Saive, whom they shot. The team then made for 251 Eupener Strasse, where Oppenhoff lived with his wife Irmgard and their three children. He was away at a party so they asked the housekeeper to send for him. When Oppenhoff arrived, Wenzel‚Äîwho had assured his accomplices he would do the shooting‚Äîlost his nerve. Leitgeb barked ‚ÄúHeil Hitler!‚Äù, grabbed the pistol and shot Oppenhoff dead. Escaping with Leitgeb, Hirsch tripped a buried landmine; she injured her knee and Leitgeb was killed. Later life After the war the surviving members of the Werwolf group were located. At trial in 1949, they were found guilty of killing Oppenhoff and sentenced to 1‚Äì4 years in prison. Hirsch was acquitted and another of the team members was never charged.

He had two brothers, Matija (who was killed by the Ottomans in the battle of Moh√°cs in 1526) and Petar. He was married to kneginja (princess) Ana Baboniƒá of Blagaj. After the battle of Moh√°cs and the death of King Louis II in 1526, the throne was empty, so Croatian nobility decided to elect a new Croatian king, possibly a mighty and rich personality who could help against the massive Ottoman expansion. Juraj III Frankopan was among those most influential magnates in the country who organized assembly of the Croatian Parliament in his Cetin Castle. Like many of nobility, he already earlier supported Ferdinand I of Habsburg to be the new Croatian king. On the contrary, some members of the Frankopan family, especially those of the Modru≈°‚ÄìOzalj branch, were supporters of count Ivan /John/ Z√°polya, like some other Croatian noblemen, mostly from Slavonia. The 1527 election in Cetin confirmed Ferdinand I of Habsburg as King of Croatia, with a charter verified by six Croatian aristocrats and dignitaries, including Juraj III. His seal is located on the right side of the charter, close to the chequered state seal of Croatia. Following the election, the country joined the Habsburg Monarchy. Juraj III Frankopan had three children ‚Äì Franjo, Ana and Katarina. The daughters were married to Hungarian noblemen and the son ruled as the Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia. Juraj died in 1553 and was buried most probably in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Slunj. There is a commemorative plaque in the church, partially damaged, with the inscription ‚Äû‚Ä¶jacet in tumba magnificus‚Ä¶‚Äú and the Frankopan coat of arms, which is believed to refer to him. In the church courtyard, a statue of him was erected in 2016, made by sculptor Josip Turkalj.

He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1904. He worked as a carpenter, primarily in Moscow and St Petersburg, until 1917. He had two periods of exile, from 1911 to 1914 and then from 1915 to 1917. After the revolution he developed as a playwright and was very active in Proletkult, very much influenced by Alexander Bogdanov. He was chairman of Proletkult. His wife, Anna Dodonova, was also on the national praesidium. 1922 articles in Pravda In 1922 his article \\"On the Ideological Front\\" (\\"Na ideologicheskom fronte\\") was published in Pravda in September 1922. Here he defended Proletkult which was facing marginalisation at that time. He rejected class compromise and the use of experts. He was against the participation of the peasantry, the bourgeoisie, and the intelligentsia in Proletkult. Proletarian culture was to be developed by the workers themselves and would provide a necessary antidote to the problems affecting post-revolutionary Soviet society. Influenced by Bogdanov, he defended the view that a proletarian science was necessary. He stated that the proletariat had to find new systems of knowledge, develop new ties between the different disciplines, which would require a monistic understanding of the world. As regards art, he stated that the new culture must be made by worker-artists, who aim to change the world, not merely to beautify it. He pointed out that the last four years in which Proletkult had existed was a very short period of time, compared to the period of the bourgeois domination of society. In second article, \\"In the Proletkult\\" (\\"V Proletkul'te\\"), published in Pravda, October 1922, he responded to his own question on whether these first steps in proletarian culture should be considered as a utopian, unnecessary luxury?\\" by essentially arguing for continued state subsidies for Proletkult which were being reduced under the New Economic Policy. He praised the organisations literary output, including the role of drama as well as the development of production art. Later life From 1933 to 1936 he was Deputy Head of the General Directorate of the Film Industry at the SNK of the USSR. However he was subsequenlty purged and shot in 1942.

Rabinovich worked at KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11'), now known as the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, where was one of a significant group of physicists, mathematicians and chemists working in secret; his work was under the direction of Yakov Zel'dovich, a principal nuclear theorist (and well-known cosmologist) who was directing research groups at KB-11 and the Institute of Chemical Physics. During the development of the RDS-220, Rabinovich became concerned that the device would not work and shared his worries with colleagues before raising them with his superiors. His concerns were taken so seriously that after discussion with the project design leads Viktor Adamsky and Vyacheslav Feodoritov, and chief weapons designer Andrei Sakharov, all of whom provided counter-arguments, Sakharov - one of the chief designers - altered the design of the bomb to reduce the margins of error in calculating the processes which had vexed Rabinovich. He authored papers on electron- positron pair production and (with Zel'dovich) statistical formulae in a Fermi gas.

In geometric group theory his most well-known and significant results are obtained in two papers published in the Annals of Mathematics in 2002, the first joint with Jean- Camille Birget and Eliyahu Rips, and the second joint with Birget, Rips and Aleksandr Olshansky. The first paper provided an essentially complete description of all the possible growth types of Dehn functions of finitely presented groups. The second paper proves that a finitely presented group has the word problem solvable in non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) if and only if this group embeds as a subgroup of a finitely presented group with polynomial Dehn function. A combined featured review of these two papers in Mathematical Reviews characterized them as \`\`remarkable foundational results regarding isoperimetric functions of finitely presented groups and their connections with the complexity of the word problem\\".Ilya Kapovich (2005) Mathematical Reviews, and . Sapir is also known for his work, mostly joint with Cornelia Drutu, on developing the asymptotic cone approach to the study of relatively hyperbolic groups. A 2002 paper of Sapir and Olshansky constructed the first known finitely presented counter-examples to the Von Neumann conjecture. Sapir also introduced, in a 1993 paper with Meakin, the notion of a diagram group, based on finite semigroup presentations. He further developed this notion in subsequent joint papers with Guba. Diagram groups provided a new approach to the study of Thompson groups, which appear as important examples of diagram groups.

Wuppertal, Germany 1905 - d. October 19, 2000 in Allentown, Pennsylvania) was a German born American artist who worked mostly in an abstract format and is primarily considered to have been a colorist. Biography From 1919 until 1927 Moller was an instructor at the Kunstgewerbeschule Wuppertal-Barmen an arts and crafts learning institution in the town in which he resided and also earned money as a bricklayer. Next he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. In 1936 he emigrated to the united States from Germany to protect his Jewish wife (whom he had married in 1933), Helen Rosenblum from the Nazis. Once settled in the U.S. he went to work for the advertising firm Lord and Thomas as a graphic designer and works of his from that endeavor were exhibited at MOMA as part of a group exhibition in 1949. The first solo exhibition of his paintings was held in 1942 at the Bonestell Gallery in New York City. In the following twenty years or so he had some twenty five solo exhibitions at various galleries. Moller created paintings in a multiplicity of styles, including; expressionism, abstractionism, surrealism, cubism, pointillism, and fauvism. Later he was represented for a stretch ending in 1995 by the Midtown-Payson Gallery in New York City. Therein in 1995 the Dusseldorf gallerist Torsten Br√∂han put together an exhibition of Moller's work; it was the first solo exhibition of Moller's work in Germany. Moller was known foremost as a colorist and once stated...‚ÄúI only want to wake up every day and decide what colors to paint my sky.‚Äù. Ad Reinhardt included Moller in his 1946 work \\"How to Look at Modern Art in America\\". Personal life Moller and his wife were long time residents of Allentown and the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania as well as Monhegan Island, Maine. His wife Helen predeceased him in 1997. Hans Moller died in 2000. . Legacy Following Moller's death a retrospective of the painter's work was mounted at the Lore Degenstein Gallery at Susquehanna University with an accompanying catalogue published by the Penn State University Press. The exhibition then traveled around Pennsylvania from 2001 until 2002 and then to the Portland Art Museum in Portland, Maine.

It was written by Pete McTighe, directed by Jennifer Perrott, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 November 2018. In the episode, the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) travels to the delivery company Kerblam, alongside her companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), to investigate why a package sent to her contained a message asking for help. They soon discover the company has missing human employees and that the automated workforce is behaving oddly. The episode guest stars Julie Hesmondhalgh, Lee Mack, Callum Dixon, Claudia Jessie, Leo Flanagan, and Matthew Gravelle. The episode was watched by 7.46 million viewers.  Plot  The Thirteenth Doctor and her companions travel to Kerblam!, a galaxy-wide online shopping service consisting of automated warehouses, and a mostly robotic workforce known as \\"TeamMates\\". Under the guise of being new employees, the group attempt to find out who sent them a delivery with a call for help. They quickly learn from their new colleagues ‚Äì Dan Cooper, the company's poster boy; Kira Arlo, a member of the dispatch team; and Charlie Duffy, a maintenance worker who loves Kira ‚Äì that staff have been vanishing in recent months, and that the company has a strong culture of productivity. When Dan disappears while finding an order, the Doctor suspects something is wrong with the company's artificial intelligence and automated workforce. Both human resource managers Judy Maddox and Jarva Slade quickly deny involvement when confronted about the disappearances. When Kira is abducted, the Doctor tracks her to the completely automated packaging and delivery floor, leading the group to gain access below. After finding the remains of the missing workforce and an army of TeamMates holding packages, the Doctor uses an early model of TeamMate to speak with Kerblam's AI. She quickly learns it called for her help directly, after suspecting something was wrong with its workforce. When Yasmin, Ryan and Charlie reveal they had witnessed Kira die when playing with bubble wrap, the Doctor discovers someone had weaponised the material, intending for it to be used upon Kerblam's customers. Charlie quickly admits to being the culprit, explaining that Kira's death was not part of his plans. He reveals his motive was to prevent rampant automation making human workforces redundant. Gaining access to the company, Charlie used the missing staff as test subjects for his weaponised bubble wrap. He intended to use it upon the company's customers, knowing blame for the sudden deaths would be placed upon automation and a lack of human diligence. Realising the company's AI killed Kira to make Charlie understand the severity of his actions, the Doctor reprograms the TeamMates to deliver to themselves and pop the wrap. While the others leave, Charlie remains and perishes in the floor's destruction. In the wake of the incident, Maddox and Slade undertake to rebuild Kerblam with a mostly human workforce. = Continuity = Towards the end of the episode, the Doctor uses her \\"Venusian Aikido\\" technique to paralyze Slade, which she had previously used to paralyze Epzo in \\"The Ghost Monument\\". Venusian Aikido was also used by the Third Doctor and Twelfth Doctor. In the opening scene, the Doctor receives a package from Kerblam containing a fez, a reference to the Eleventh Doctor, who had a running gag of wearing them.

Today the neighborhood contains many historical brick tenements and of mixed residential, commercial, and industrial zoning including many of the remaining businesses of the city's paper industry. The neighborhood is also home to the city's Puerto Rican-Afro Caribbean Cultural Center, the Carlos Vega and Valley Arena Parks, as well as the Holyoke Turner Hall, one of the last remaining turnvereines in New England, and the William G. Morgan Elementary School. In 2018, South Holyoke had the highest percentage of renter-occupied housing of any neighborhood outside of Boston, with an average of 1.5% owner-occupied households across the neighborhood's two census block groups. History In the mid-19th century the area was predominantly open land with some factories and brickyards, and was originally known as Tigertown, as it hosted a number of baseball teams with one Boston Globe writer later attributing the name to the fact that \\"local baseball men played for blood and showed such tigerish propensities toward rival teams if the game did not go to their liking\\". In the earliest days, the players and attendees of these games as well as the settlers of the area were largely Irish, as one of the three early working class Irish settlements in Holyoke, rarely referred to as \\"The Bush\\", with others being \\"The Patch\\" in the downtown and \\"The Flats\\" to the north. * By the 1890s these baseball fields had largely disappeared and the area became characterized by factories and worker housing, seeing influxes of different immigrant groups from Germany; with industrialist millwrights emigrating from Rhineland and about half of workers from Saxony, by the 1875 it had the highest population, per capita, of German immigrants of any neighborhood or ward in New England, representing 88% of residents. In subsequent decades this demographic would Americanize and dissipate, with other immigrant communities settling there from Canada, Greece, and Puerto Rico into the 20th century. There was a large \\"post-Hurricane Maria migration of Puerto Ricans\\" to Holyoke after Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. As of 2018, the neighborhood's residents were predominantly Puerto Rican, with the highest concentration of any such population in Holyoke or New England, representing 83.3% of residents. On December 10, 2019, as part of a $72 statewide initiative, Governor Charlie Baker's administration announced a $6.56 million grant to support street, alley, and traffic infrastructure improvement in the neighborhood around Carlos Vega Park. The grant was part of a larger set of projects, including a mixed owner-renter housing development around the park to be funded and built by the Holyoke Housing Authority, and capital infrastructure improvement by the Water Works.

H. brevicula is very rare‚Äîonly ten specimens have ever been collected‚Äîand critically endangered: the species was found only in Eyrewell Forest, a single plantation of exotic pine trees currently being converted into dairy farms.  Description  H. brevicula was named and described in 1984 by Michael Butcher in a revision of the genus Holcaspis. At that point it was known from only two male specimens, both collected in Eyrewell Forest on the Canterbury Plains in 1961. H. brevicula can be distinguished from its slightly-larger close relative H. algida by the patterns of punctures and setae on its pronotum and elytra, and by the male's shorter aedeagus. It is a small (10‚Äì11 mm long) shiny black ground beetle, and is flightless, predatory, and probably nocturnal. As adults have been collected during winter months, H. brevicula probably lives for over two years ‚Äì relatively long for a beetle.  Distribution  The Eyrewell Forest area has dry, stony, free-draining soils, and its original vegetation area was probably kƒÅnuka (Kunzea serotina) shrubland and forest up to 10 m high, with some t≈çtara (Podocarpus totara). This habitat was widely burnt off by Polynesian and European settlers, and now exists on the Canterbury Plains only as small fragments, less than 20 ha. There are several such fragments in the Eyrewell area, the largest being the 16 ha Spencer-Bower Reserve. All are on private land, some protected by a QEII covenant, except for the Eyrewell Scientific Reserve (2.4 ha), which is administered by the Department of Conservation. The poor soil at Eyrewell was considered unsuitable for agriculture and used mainly for sheep farming. Between 1928 and 1932, the tall mƒÅnuka (Leptospermum scoparium) forest at Eyrewell was cleared and the 6764 ha Eyrewell Forest plantation of introduced Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) was established. Most of the area has been in plantation forestry ever since, with blocks of trees being felled in rotation approximately every 27 years. Some of the older blocks had an understory of kƒÅnuka up to 4 m high and most included native shrubs, herbs, and mosses, despite regular tree felling and replanting. Holcaspis brevicula was present in kƒÅnuka forest at the time it was knocked down and interplanted with pine trees, and has persisted in the regularly-felled plantation forest. At the same time it has disappeared from the remaining fragments of nearby kƒÅnuka forest, which appear to be too small, increasingly degraded, and browsed by sheep to support populations of the beetle. Intensive searching and pitfall trapping in remnant kƒÅnuka forest, pine plantation, and adjacent pasture, comprising 57,494 trap days over 2000‚Äì2005, captured five more specimens of H. brevicula. All were found in the pine forest. Three more specimens, collected between 1956 and 1967, were located in the Forest Research Insect Collection. All the ten known specimens of this beetle came from the Eyrewell Forest, which thus contains the only known population of this species.  Conservation  Because of its rarity and single locality, H. brevicula is classified as \\"nationally critical and under acute threat of extinction\\". It was chosen as one of the 150 priority species in the Department of Conservation's 2017 Threatened Species Strategy. The beetle has no legal protection under the Wildlife Act, and in New Zealand plantation forests on private land can be felled, even if they are the only habitat of a threatened species. Land-use change in the Canterbury Plains in the 21st century has been towards irrigation and dairy farming, more profitable than traditional dryland farming and forestry. Eyrewell Forest was Crown Land, administered by the New Zealand Forest Service; it was purchased from NgƒÅi Tahu in 1848 as part of the ¬£2000 Kemp Purchase of 8 million ha. In 2000, the Eyrewell Forest was returned to NgƒÅi T≈´ƒÅhuriri, a subtribe of NgƒÅi Tahu, as part of the 1998 Ngai Tahu settlement. NgƒÅi Tahu Farming proposed converting 1200 ha of the land, now known as Te Whenua Hou, into three trial dairy farms, in the face of some opposition from within the iwi. Six farms were later established as forestry licenses expired, then a seventh. In 2016 it was announced the Eyrewell Forest would be completely felled and converted into 8,500 ha of pivot-irrigated pasture to support 14,000 dairy cows in 13 farms and 7 dairy support farms, with almost all the forest to be cleared by 2017/2018. As of January 2019, all but 120 ha of the Eyrewell Forest had been cleared, as can be seen in Sentinel satellite imagery. The conversion involved \\"felling all the trees, ripping out the root stock and then pretty much mulching the coarser woody material which is left behind into small chips‚Ä¶ not only shredding any plant matter, but any invertebrates that are larger than a pinhead.\\" Correspondence obtained under the Official Information Act revealed that the Department of Conservation had been unable to reach an agreement with NgƒÅi Tahu Farming over preserving enough beetle habitat to save the species. Forest and Bird criticised the Whenua Hou development, claiming it would lead to the extinction of H. brevicula. NgƒÅi Tahu responded that they would be planting 150 ha of native shrubland to replace the 6700 ha of pine habitat, and a further 150 ha around the edges of farms and buildings. The beetle does not currently inhabit the remaining native forest in the area, so it is unclear whether it would colonise and inhabit these new plantings. The revegetation project appears to have been largely unsuccessful, with forest trees being planted in dry open pastures, exposed to excess nutrient runoff from cow pasture. File:Eyrewell Forest native forest restoration 2.jpg File:Eyrewell Forest plantings MRD 1.png File:Eyrewell Forest plantings MRD 2.png File:Eyrewell Forest plantings MRD 4.png Lincoln University have been surveying the remaining forest since 2013 without finding any Eyrewell beetles; the surveys are set to continue until 2020. Scientists criticised the decision to convert the forest to dairy farms as \\"driven by an economic assessment of profitability, with little consideration of biodiversity values.\\" If NgƒÅi Tahu Farming did not restore kƒÅnuka forest or set aside areas of plantation forestry, H. brevicula would soon be extinct. The lead scientist on the study said in November 2018 he was thinking of writing the beetle's obituary.

It was designed by Prevost & Waterman and built from 1922 to 1923. It is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first Harbour View Hotel was built in 1843 on the opposite corner. The present site was occupied by \\"Oliffe Terrace\\". In 1913 both sites were resumed. By 1922 the terraces had been demolished, and by 1924 the present hotel building had been constructed. Construction of the hotel was funded by Tooth and Co., under a 50-year lease. In 1927 the Sydney Harbour Trust assumed control of the site from the Resumed Properties Dept. Licencees of the hotel included William Ireland 1924-1941 and Gavin Miller 1941-1949. In 1936 the Maritime Services Board succeeded the SHT as owner. The 50-year lease expuired in 1971 and the MSB transferred ownership of the hotel to Tooth & Co. The hotel experienced a gradual decline in its patronage, and in 1998 it was again sold.CMP, s1.4  Description  The Harbour View Hotel is a three-storey (plus basement) masonry hotel structure with remnant outbuildings and exterior walls. The most prominent element on the site is the three-storey hotel, which strongly addresses the curved corner of Lower Fort Street. The well-composed Inter-war Free Classical style facade with curved centre piece anchors the hotel building to the site and provides space between the two storey attached columns for sub-dominant groupings of pairs of double hung windows. The fenestration comprises multi-pane double-hung windows composed in pairs with projecting rendered frames, a deep rendered band with an entablature featuring a semi-circular pediment at the corner, and terminating on the top band with circular, raised decorative elements. The facade below awning features highly glazed tilling with encaustic signage to both street frontages. The eastern, or Sydney Harbour Bridge, section of the building is two storey at the street with an open deck and a set of rooms to the rear. Internally the lower floor has been extensively modified with the public and saloon bars opened to form one room and the dining room used as a bistro. The upper floors are relatively intact with original fabric and layout. Building development covers most of the site except for an open side service access area to the east,.CMP, s2.1 The construction methods employed in the Harbour View Hotel were traditional and the structural design conservative. Load-bearing stone and brick, with an internal render finish, forms the main basis of structure throughout the hotel.CMP, s2.3.2 = Modifications and dates = * 1923 - general repairs * 1940 - alterations to ground floor lavatory and cellar * 1953 - major alterations to ground floor * 1986 - major alterations to ground floor * 1992 - alterations to ground floorCMP, s2.3.4  Heritage listing  The Harbour View Hotel was one of a small number of pubs constructed in the Millers Point area following demolition by the Sydney Harbour Trust after land was resumed for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In an area of trade facilities and industrialisation, hotels formed an important social role. The hotel's location, strategically sited at the south western end of the Harbour Bridge, is a physical reminder of the importance of meeting places associated with movement to and from the city. It is representative of many such buildings servicing the early local labour force and residents during the early decades of the 20th century. Aesthetically, the hotel exhibits consistent Inter-War period form and detailing and is mostly intact externally and internally. The structure is designed in the Inter-war Free Classical style. The hotel is strongly sited and curved around the corner with a classical banded and face brick masonry element. It makes a significant contribution to the local streetscape especially at its curved section of the site. The hotel has significance as part of a small number of popst-1920s purpose designed hotels that have survived in the city area which reflect the social character of the area during the early to mid decades of the 20th century. Of rare significance is the glazed tiles with signage to the lower portion below the awning level fa√ßade as few such examples of tiled signage remain in the CBD.CMP, s5.1 Harbour View Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Harbour View Hotel has historical significance through its link to the early Harbour View Hotel and as a significant social institution dating from the Inter-War Period. It has further significance through its association with the land reclamation programs of the post-plague era and the establi9shment of the Sydney Harbour Trust. The building of the hotel represented a new phase of development in the Millers/Dawes Point precinct and it was associated for many years with Tooth & Co., a major brewer and lessee of hotels throughout the state in the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Harbour View Hotel has aesthetic significance as a fine example of an Inter-War Free Classical corner hotel building, well designed and executed and located in a precinct in which few such buildings have survived. The hotel was sited to take advantage of the once extensive harbour views and the sharp corner of the intersection on which it stands. The building is a landmark in the area and is a strong visual streetscape element.CMP, s5.2 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Harbour View Hotel has social significance as a major social institution in the area for over 70 years. Through its link with the earlier Harbour View Hotel, it has provided a continuity of social venue and accommodation for the people of the area for over 150 years. The hotel also has a value as a link to the post- plague land reclamation programs which changed forever the face of the Millers/Dawes Point area. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Harbour View Hotel has technical significance for its demonstration of Inter-War building techniques and architectural design. It allows investigation into the processes and difficulties of masonry construction in the 1920s and interpretation of an inner-city working class hotel. This site (assuming intact archaeological deposits) has been assessed as having moderate to high significance based on its value under the historic and scientific assessment criteria. However, the site has limited potential to yield archaeological deposits which are of high cultural significance. The reason for this is that site development processes, particularly the construction of the current hotel, are likely to have heavily impacted upon the deposits which are most likely to have provided new information about the site. The end result is that the overall site significance is reduced by the low potential for intact archaeological remains.Arch.Ass., s5.3 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Within the Sydney Metropolitan Area, the Harbour View Hotel is of relative rarity, as few hotels of similar design and construction have survived, particularly in the Millers/Dawes Point precinct. Within a state context, a number of similar hotels have survived, particularly in country towns. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Harbour View Hotel is a good representative example of an Inter-War corner hotel, executed in the Free Classical style, well constructed and detailed.

It was built from 1843 to 1844. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site of the Hero of Waterloo Hotel on the south side of Windmill Street was located in the government reserve. In 1831 the Town Surveyor, Ambrose Hallen reported that John Clarke had fenced in the site and his ownership was challenged. Clarke produced a legal transfer from the son of John Leighton (Jack the Miller, after who Millers Point was named). David Leighton had purchased it from Patrick Marmount who was said to have received it as compensation from Governor Lachlan Macquarie for land resumed for the new Military Hospital. It was 1841 before the grant was formalised for John Clarke. The site was first occupied by George Paton when he built the first part of a stone hotel consisting of a kitchen and bedroom which is now in part of the cellar. The Hero of Waterloo is the second oldest surviving hotel in Sydney; the oldest is the nearby Lord Nelson Hotel. Paton was a stonemason who had worked on the nearby Garrison Church. Paton constructed the existing hotel 1842 on the corner of Lower Fort and Windmill Streets from sandstone excavated from the Argyle Cut. The hotel was first licensed in 1845. Rumours persist that the labyrinthine stone cellars of the Hero of Waterloo contain a concealed entrance from which a \\"smuggler's tunnel\\" had been dug to Darling Harbour. The Hero of Waterloo was acquired by the Sydney Harbour Trust in the resumptions following an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1901. The Trust demolished many hotels of dubious quality and many licenses were revoked following the Liquor Act of 1912 but the Hero of Waterloo was one of a few early hotels to survive. The present main bar was two rooms until the removal of the dividing partition in 1928 to create one large room. In November 1988 the Department of Housing advertised the sale of the hotel and it passed into private ownership. The Sands Directory records occupants as 1860: J. Henderson; 1868: Mrs. A. Lincoln; 1873: Robert Russell; 1879‚Äì80: John Silk; 1883-91: William Oliff; 1892-95: H. Samuel; 1896-1900: William Healey.  Description  The Hero of Waterloo, located on a prominent corner site in the centre of Millers Point, is a three-storey building designed in the Old Colonial Regency style and constructed in ashlar stone. The building features a splay corner with a double entrance door of 2 by three panels under a hanging sign. Above this is a large 12 pane Georgian window on 1st floor and a distinctive 8 pane window on the 2nd floor that appears to be original (the 1842 drawings shows it as 4 pane). The North elevation has a large shopfront with Georgian beaded timber panelling to the bottom half, a door with stone and concrete steps, a cellar carriage way door, and the rest of the ground and first floor is made up of 12 pane Georgian windows separated by stone pilasters of extremely subtle relief all under a simple parapet with a central feature that is little more than a raised section of wall. Earlier photos show corbelling and stone relief to the parapets which has since been removed 1980s. The 2nd floor again features the odd 8 pane windows. Similarly the lower fort street elevation is made up of 12 and 8 pane windows, a ground floor shopfront and entry door. A painted corbel runs across at first floor height. The design is subdued, free of ornament and very subtle. The hipped and gable roof is clad in corrugated steel behind simple parapets. The interior features exposed stonework on ground and first floor, an early stone detailed fireplace and original timber joinery. The cellars contain the earliest structure on the site as well as a series of tunnels and cells which are said to have historic value from their nineteenth century use. = Modifications and dates = *Post 1988 - some maintenance, repairs and minor renovations.  Heritage listing  Hero of Waterloo Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Hero of Waterloo is one of the earliest remaining hotels in Sydney, being of simple yet strong vernacular design and an excellent example of an 1840s city pub. It has been in continuous trade since 1845 and is one of the oldest surviving trading hotels in Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hotel retains substantial evidence of its original form and is an integral component of the Millers Point precinct, an area demonstrating the changes of over a century of Sydney life and which has remained virtually unchanged since the 1920s.

The Freeman's Bureau reported in 1868 there were 15 pupils enrolled in the school. After 1869 the Bureau could no longer perform due to budget cuts. Then in 1870 the City of Newport, Kentucky took over the running of Campbell County's only black school. By 1873, they established a school on Southgate Street. Elizabeth Hudson was hired as the first teacher at $35.00 per month. In 1893, the current two-level building was constructed on Southgate Street. The school remained in operation until 1955, when the Brown v. Board of Education decision closed the segregated schools. After the school's closure, the building was bought by local gangster Frank \\"Screw\\" Andrews. The building was used as a warehouse. The school building is presently owned by a Black Masonic Lodge (Prince Hall Masonic Lodge 120). In 1985, The Southgate Street School was listed as a contributing property to the Mansion Hill Historic District. As of 2017 the first floor is used by the City of Newport and the Newport Foundation as the Newport History Museum. Museum displays remind visitors of school life in the early twentieth century.

He served as chief of Holmen from 1645 to 1657 with rank of admiral. He was the owner of the estates Lindersvold, B√¶kkeskov and Store Restrup. Early life and education Lindenov was born in circa 1612, the son of Godske Christoffersen Lindenov and Karen Gyldenstjerne. His father had been appointed as chief of Holmen in 1610 but fell ill and died shortly after his son was born. Lindenov studied at Sor√∏ Academy from 1629. In 1635, he was granted an annual royal allowance to train as a naval officer abroad. Career In 1645, Lindenov followed in his father's footsteps when he was appointed as chief of Holmen with rank of admiral. Holmen had fallen into disrepair under his predecessor, Erik Ottesen Orning, and bringing it up to date was made difficult by rigshofmesteren Corfitz Ulfeldt's hiring of incompetent and dishonest suppliers. Lindenov secretly briefed Christian IV about the situation through chancellery Secretary Otte Krag but it is not known how the king responded to the accusations. He commanded a fleet in the Kattegat in 1653 and another one in the Baltic Sea in 1656. After being accused of embezzlement, in February 1757, he was fired and expelled from the court by Frederick III. In February 1658, during the Assault on Copenhagen, he was put in charge of the defence of Christianshavn. Property Lindenov inherited Lindersvold after his parents. He purchased B√¶kkeskov and Store Restrup. He was also granted the fiefs of Helgeland (1646‚Äì51) and Utstein kloster (1652‚Äì55) in Norway by the king. Shortly after falling out of favor at the court, in 1757, he was granted the fief of Nyk√∏bing Len and kept it until 1661. Personal life Lindenov married Dorthe T√∏nnesdatter Friis (19 March 1624 ‚Äì 1652) in circa 1646. She was a daughter of T√∏nne Friis of Hesselager.

History Huey was born October 27, 1942 in Sartinville, Mississippi to Harold Magee and Eartha Lee Huey. Huey was a 1961 graduate of Carver High School in Pascagoula, Mississippi. At Carver, he was team captain, MVP, and all-city, receiving all- city honors as a basketball player as well. Upon graduating, he briefly attended the Tuskeegee Institute, then went to Oakland City College, where he was selected as an honorable mention All-American Junior College quarterback. Huey applied to his congressman in Mississippi for an appointment to the Naval Academy, but was refused on the grounds that he would be a \\"stain on Mississippi\\". A California representative was willing to nominate him, and he was accepted by the academy as a student, with no mention of his football prowess. When he reached Navy he tried out for the football team. Because there were so many quarterbacks trying out, he decided to try out as a wide receiver instead. He sufficiently impressed coaches Carl Schuette, Lee Corso and Steve Belichick to make the team; he also tried out for and made the basketball team. When Navy played Georgia Tech in 1964, he became the first black player to play at Bobby Dodd Stadium. HE also became the first black person to play in an Army‚ÄìNavy Game. In 1963, as a Plebe, wearing number 49, he began the season as an end, before moving to flanker behind Navy's top receiver, Ed Orr. When Orr was injured during the third-from last game of the season, Huey earned the starting position and caught 4 touchdown passes from quarterback Roger Staubach. In 1967, Huey was one of two African-Americans to graduate from the Academy. He was assigned to the USS Perry and served two tours of duty in Vietnam. He earned a PhD in Chemistry, and returned to Navy as a professor and assistant football coach in 1973. He then left Navy to work for IBM for fourteen years, before retiring due to kidney failure. In 2012, the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill titled \\"Calvin Huey; commend accomplishments and legacy of as Naval Academy academic and football phenomenon\\", recognizing doctor Huey for his outstanding achievements in academics and athletics, overcoming the substantial barriers in his path. In 2017, the city of Pascagoula placed an 18 feet tall image of Huey, along with Jimmy Buffett, Trent Lott, and Sara Bailey Thomas on Main Street. Huey died from kidney failure on September 1, 2018.

Taxonomy The holotype specimen, a partial skeleton, was discovered by curator Toshiyuki Kamei in October 1981 in the Ashiya Group of the Jinnobaru Formation on the island of Kyushu, and stored in the Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History and Human History. The genus name honors the old name of Japan, Yamato, and Latin cetus, \\"whale.\\" The species name translates to \\"with groove\\" in reference to the grooves in its mouth which indicate functional baleen. It was placed into the family Eomysticetidae, a primitive group of baleen whales. Description As in other baleen whales, the skull is wide and flat. The skull, along the sides, has several narrow, straight grooves‚Äìeight in total‚Äìand there are several foramina in the skull used as passage for blood vesselsthough not as many as modern baleen whales‚Äìwhich indicate it had baleen in its mouth. The skull contains several tooth sockets, but no teeth were discovered; it is possible these sockets were vestigal and held no teeth, or the teeth naturally fell out over the course of the animal's life. The blowhole was located midway along the snout, near the position of eyes. Unlike the closely related Eomysticetus, the head is relatively flat, and the snout is blunt. The auditory bulla in the ear is more similar to primitive baleen whales and archaeocetes. Yamatocetus had seven neck vertebrae, and the complete series was preserved. The neural spine projecting up from the vertebra increases along the series. Thoracic vertebrae one through seven and nine were preserved. The ribs had a double- headed joint with the vertebrae. The shoulder blade was concave on the side facing the ribs, a primitive feature for baleen whales. The left forearm and fragments of the right were discovered. As in modern whales, the elbow joint probably could not rotate. The humerus is proportionally longer than that of modern baleen whales, a characteristic of eomysticetid whales, suggesting eomysticetids had less swimming capabilities. Paleoecology Yamatocetus was an early filter feeder, and its teeth, if it had any, were likely vestigial and served no purpose. Since the whale had several double-headed vertebral joints, and modern baleen whales have a reduced number of these to increase the flexibility of the ribcage to aid in deep-sea diving, Yamatocetus likely stayed near the surface. Several marine vertebrates were found in the Ashiya Group: the baleen whales \\"Metasqualodon,\\" Chonecetus, and an unidentified aetiocetid; and an unidentified squalodontid dolphin; a Trionyx softshell turtle; the tortoise Indotestudo takasago; an unidentified sea turtle; an unidentified crocodile; the seabirds Copepteryx and an unknown pelagornithid; and unknown dugong.
