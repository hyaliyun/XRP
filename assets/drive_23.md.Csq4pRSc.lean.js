The name anthotheca was taken from the Greek word anthos, meaning flower, while theca refers to a capsule. It is known by a number of other common names, including Nyasaland, red or white mahogany. Oos-Afrikaanse mahonie is the Afrikaans name and acajou is its name in French. Distribution It is widespread, occurring from Guinea Bissau east to Uganda and Tanzania, and south to Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It is fairly widely grown in plantations within its natural area of distribution, but also in South Africa, tropical Asia and tropical America. It is easily confused with other Khaya species like K. grandifoliola, K. senegalensis or K. ivorensis in the north of its natural range. =Habitat= The East African mahogany grows in medium to low altitude areas in evergreen forests. They require damp lands in order to grow. The Big Tree in Chirinda Forest is the tallest native tree in Zimbabwe. Description Khaya anthotheca trees may grow between tall. They have greyish-brown bark. On mature trees, white scented flowers are borne at the ends of the branches. Common uses It is used for furniture, flooring, paneling and boat building and for musical instrument (e.g. guitar). It is a very suitable tree for these projects because the bark weathers well, is resistant to borers and termites, besides fungal decay, and is tough but saws well. The bark has a bitter taste which is often used as a medicine for common colds. The oil from the seeds can also be rubbed into a person's scalp to rid of insects and lice. Threats It is often cut down and destroyed in East and West Africa. Planting new trees in these areas to make up for what was destroyed is very rare. Genetic erosion is thought to have occurred as well. Because of this, the species is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" on the IUCN Red List. Some of its populations have been offered protection, and some countries placed bans on its export. The foliage is eaten by the larvae of the moth Heteronygmia dissimilis.

It is found in Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. It is threatened by habitat loss. Medical uses In many malaria endemic countries, like the tropics, the extract of Khaya grandifoliola is used as an antimalarial herbal remedy. Recent studies show that 90% of malaria cases around the world come from sub-Saharan Africa. People in these areas resort to medicinal plants for treatment because alternative medical resources are often low or unavailable. The bark and seeds of Khaya grandifoliola are the most common parts used for treatment and are extracted by infusion or decoction. The extracts have proven to fight against the P. falciparum parasite, one of the vectors of malaria in humans. Crude water extracts of Khaya grandifoliola have shown to have therapeutic effectiveness on mice. A study was designed to show the effects of the extract on the red blood cells and bone of mice for 3 weeks and 7 day. Doses of the extract that were administered daily had no impact on mortality rates, physical appearance or behavior of the rats. The results of the experiment indicated that K. grandifoliola had a positive effect on red blood cell production and no real effect on bone mineral contents at therapeutic doses. Studies have shown that the optimum therapeutic dose size is about 5.5 g/kg body weight.

It was discovered by Bayer in 1913 and was used shortly thereafter for the treatment of insomnia, but its use was quickly phased out in response to newer drugs with far more favorable safety profiles. The drug was marketed again in the United States, Europe and elsewhere from 1956 well into the 1960s as a rapid-acting sedative; The drug was quickly overshadowed at that point by benzodiazepines and is no longer sold anywhere. Synthesis Methylpentynol is prepared by reaction of butanone (MEK) with sodium acetylide. This reaction must be done in anhydrous conditions and in an inert atmosphere.

He was born in Shandaken, Ulster County, New York. At age 13, he set out on foot for Providence, Rhode Island. He walked 368 miles before arriving at Brown University. However, upon his arrival he was informed that tuition would be free, but no other funds were available for boarding or clothing. He then walked 368 miles back home. On June 11, 1819, he was baptized and became a member of the Freewill Baptist Church in Phelps. The following year he joined the Freewill Baptist Church in Junius. At age 15, he felt the call of God leading him to enter the ministry. He left home and began preaching in what was known as the Holland Purchase. Large congregations would gather to hear his preaching. However, during his first 3 months absence from home, his mother died and his father's house was burned.

ivorensis, also called African mahogany or Lagos mahogany, is a tall forest tree with a buttressed trunk in the family Meliaceae. It is found in Angola, Cameroon, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, and Nigeria where it grows primarily in lowland tropical rainforests. It is threatened by habitat loss. Khaya ivorensis is a species in the African mahogany family. Other common names are Gold Coast mahogany, Ivory Coast mahogany, Nigerian mahogany. It grows to be about 40‚Äì50 m high. It has thick and reddish brown bark. It grows many white flowers at the end of its branches. Its woody fruit is slightly thinner than those of Khaya grandifoliola. Distribution and habitat Khaya ivorensis typically grows in drier climates. It can be found in lowland rainforest that have a short dry season. It grows in groups or singly. It does not have many demands to survive because it can tolerate some shade and short periods of flood during rainy seasons. It is mostly found in West Africa and southern Nigeria. Uses Its bark is durable and is used to make many things such as furniture and paneling. The tree's bark is bitter and can be used as a natural remedy for coughs and whooping cough. Some find that when mixed with black peppercorns it can beused to treat diarrhea and dysentery. A bark concoction is used as a drink or bath for back pains and as a lotion for rheumatism. Planting the tree improves and enriches the soil, so many people use the tree for that as well. References *World Agroforestry Centre (AgroForestryTree Database)..

Common names include African mahogany, dry zone mahogany, Gambia mahogany, khaya wood, Senegal mahogany, cailcedrat, acajou, djalla, and bois rouge. Description African mahogany is a medium-sized tree which can grow up to 15-30 m in height and 1 m in diameter. The bark is dark grey to grey- brown while the heartwood is brown with a pink-red pigment made up of coarse interlocking grains. The tree is characterised by leaves arranged in a spiral formation clustered at the end of branches. The white flowers are sweet- scented; the fruit changes from grey to black when ripening. Distribution and habitat The tree is native to Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. It is found in riparian forests and higher-rainfall savannah woodlands; in moist regions it is found on higher ground. Within its first year, the seedling develops a deep root system that makes it the most drought resistant member of its genus. Uses The wood is used for a variety of purposes. It is often used conventionally for carpentry, interior trim, and construction. Traditionally the wood was used for dugout canoes, household implements, djembe, and fuel wood. The bitter tasting bark is used for a variety of medical purposes; it is taken against fever caused by malaria, stomach complaints, and headaches. It is applied externally to cure skin rashes, wounds, or any abnormality. It has been exported from West Africa (Gambia) to Europe since the first half of the 19th century and has been exploited heavily for its timber. It is now used more locally, and is planted ornamentally as a roadside tree. Conservation and threats Khaya senegalensis has experienced high amounts of exploitation, and little regeneration takes place once disturbance occurs. Because of this the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers it a vulnerable species. The only conservation which takes place are log export bans and legal protection in some countries.Khaya senegalensis - MHNT Khaya senegalensis - MHNT Khaya senegalensis near Mount Tenakourou in Burkina Faso References * Northern Tropical Timbers - Khaya Fast Growing African Mahogany Trees. * at Protabase Record display * at AgroForestryTree Database External links Flora of Burkina Faso Flora of Cameroon Flora of Chad Flora of Gabon Flora of Ghana Flora of Guinea Flora of Guinea-Bissau Flora of Ivory Coast Flora of Mali Flora of Niger Flora of Nigeria Flora of Senegal Flora of Sierra Leone Flora of Sudan Flora of the Central African Republic Flora of Togo Flora of Uganda Plants described in 1832 Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Trees of Benin Vulnerable flora of Africa senegalensis ","title":"Khaya senegalensis"},{"id":"12891277","text":"Hexapropymate is a hypnotic/sedative.

The screenplay by Wilder, , Max Colpet, and Claude-Andr√© Puget focuses on a wealthy young playboy who becomes involved with a gang of car thieves. Although Wilder and Esway shared the directing credit, in later years leading lady Danielle Darrieux recalled Esway had been involved with the project in some capacity but clearly remembered she had never seen him on the set. In her opinion the film, which marked Wilder's directorial debut, was his alone.Chandler, Charlotte, Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, A Personal Biography. New York: Simon & Schuster 2002. , pp. 60-68 Plot Set in 1930s Paris, the story centers on Henri Pasquier, whose wealthy father announces he no longer will support his playboy lifestyle. Dr. Pasquier sells his son's beloved Buick roadster, which Henri later sees parked on a street with the keys left in the ignition by the new owner. Unable to resist temptation, he takes the car to keep a date with a young lady he recently has met. Henri is followed by three men who overtake him and bring him to the service station that serves as the front for a gang of car thieves. Believing he is one of them, they warn him not to compete with their operation. At the garage, Henri is introduced to the childlike Jean-la-Cravate, who invites him to stay at his flat with him and his sister Jeannette, who lures men away from their expensive cars so her brother's fellow henchmen can steal them. Jean convinces Henri to join his gang, and he and Jeannette soon are engaging in a series of daring thefts. When they manage to steal three luxury Hispano-Suizas, Henri insists everyone be entitled to better compensation, and the gang leader grudgingly agrees. Perceiving Henri and Jeannette to be troublemakers, the leader sends them to Marseilles in a car with a damaged front axle, hoping it will crack and crash, killing the two. It does crash, but the couple escape without injury. They decide to sail to Casablanca and begin a new life, but Jeannette refuses to leave without her brother. Henri returns to Paris to retrieve him, only to arrive at the garage in the middle of a raid. Jean is shot and seriously injured, and Henri brings him to his father for medical treatment, but he dies. Dr. Pasquier, anxious to help his son escape a life of crime, gives him money so Henri and Jeannette can sail off and start anew. Cast *Danielle Darrieux as Jeannette *Pierre Mingand as Henri Pasquier *Raymond Galle as Jean-la-Cravate *Paul Escoffier as Dr. Pasquier *Michel Duran as Gang Chief Production When Billy Wilder arrived in Paris from Berlin on March 1, 1933, he settled in the Hotel Ansonia, a haven for members of the German film industry who had fled from their homeland to escape the encroaching threat of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Among those living there were actor Peter Lorre, composers Franz Waxman and Friedrich Hollaender, and screenwriters Jan Lustig and Max Colpet, who agreed to help Wilder develop a plot he had conceived in Berlin. In order to secure financing from a producer, they needed someone with directing credits to join their project, and Alexander Esway accepted their invitation. Without making specific reference to the extent of Esway's participation in the film, Wilder later recalled, \\"I directed out of pure necessity and without any experience. I cannot say that I had any fun making Mauvaise Graine . . . There was pressure. People depend on you, and you aren't really in control, but you can't show that, or everyone gets nervous . . . I, alone, was responsible for everything - everything! I had to be everybody from the producer to script girl. I was an extra, not because I was trying to pull a Hitchcock, but because we couldn't afford another body.\\" Budget constraints required the director to make use of whatever locations were available to him. \\"We didn't use a soundstage. Most of the interiors were shot in a converted auto shop, even the living room set, and we did the automobile chases without transparencies, live, on the streets. It was exhausting. The camera was mounted on the back of a truck or in a car. We were constantly improvising . . . We were doing nouvelle vague a quarter of a century before they invented a fancy name for it.\\" Much of the film is silent, with long sequences punctuated by a jazz-infused score by Franz Waxman and Allan Gray. Mauvaise Graine proved to be Wilder's last European film. By the time it premiered in the summer of 1934, he had relocated to Hollywood, although he recalled, \\"I still didn't think of myself as a director, not exactly. I wasn't certain I liked being a director, but I did know I could do it. That was satisfying.\\" It would be eight years before he would direct again, making the 1942 comedy The Major and the Minor after establishing himself as a successful screenwriter. DVD release Image Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on November 26, 2002. It is in fullscreen format, with an audio track in French and subtitles in English. The sole bonus feature is Joie de Vivre, an animated short subject released the same year as Mauvaise Graine.

A right- hander in his playing days, he stood tall and weighed . Adams won 193 games in the minor leagues from 1939‚Äì42 and in 1944‚Äì58, including a 21-victory season for the 1945 Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. His Major League pitching tenure, however, consisted of only 12 innings over eight games for the Chicago Cubs in . All of his appearances came in relief. His one decision came on Memorial Day, when he allowed a game-winning home run to Ray Mueller of the Cincinnati Reds, which capped a six-run, ninth-inning rally and enabled Cincinnati to defeat Chicago, 7‚Äì6, at Wrigley Field, in the second game of the holiday doubleheader. Adams allowed 11 earned runs, 18 hits and seven bases on balls in 12 total innings pitched during his MLB career, with eight strikeouts. After his playing career, he was a scout for the Dodgers from 1959‚Äì68. He then worked as the Dodgers' MLB pitching coach from 1969‚Äì80, serving on three National League pennant-winning teams (1974; 1977‚Äì78) under managers Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda, and helping develop many of the Dodgers' pitchers. Said 324-game-winning pitcher Don Sutton upon his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in July 1998: \\"No person ever meant more to my career than Red Adams. Without him, I would not be standing in Cooperstown today.\\" Tommy John, 288-game winner, also had praise for Adams. \\"When I joined the [Dodgers in 1972], I was still convinced that I had only a mediocre fastball and that I was going to have to depend chiefly on my breaking pitches to win ball games. But Red disagreed with me, emphatically,\\" John said. Adams encouraged him to rely more on the fastball, which though slower than most pitchers' fastballs, had a lot of movement. In 1979, Adams was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. He died on January 18, 2017, at the age of 95.

Etymology The genus is named in honour of the Eliza Catherine Jelly (1829‚Äì1914), of Cornwall, England in honour of her contributions to the study of bryozoans. Morphology Jellyella closely resemble Membranipora, and in common with other members of the family Membraniporidae has twinned ancestrular zooids. However, Jellyella can be distinguished by the presence of intricately branched processes (called spinules) projecting into the zooidal chambers. Jellyella also have a calcitic skeletal ultrastructure made up of transversely arranged, elongate spindles. Ecology Jellyella is unusual in being a pseudoplanktonic bryozoan found encrusting floating objects, both natural and artificial. Jellyella eburnea is common on shells of the squid Spirula (which become detached from the soft body of the squid after death) and on the shells of the planktonic gastropod Janthina. Jellyella tuberculata grows on the floating alga Sargassum, and on flat-bladed kelp and other seaweeds around the Cape Peninsula of South Africa.

This becomes of particular importance as multiple network based file systems proliferate within an organization‚Äîthe challenge becomes one of effective file management. A Global Namespace has the unique ability to aggregate disparate and remote network based file systems, providing a consolidated mount point which can be mounted on any machine via network protocols and it can greatly reduce complexities of localized file management and administration. For example, prior to file system namespace consolidation, two servers exist and each represent their own independent namespaces; e.g. server1share1 & server2share2. Various files exist within each share respectively; however, users have to access each namespace independently. This becomes an obvious challenge as the number of namespaces grows within an organization. With a GNS, an organization can access a virtualized file system namespace; e.g. files now exist under a unified structure, such as company.comshare1, share2‚Äîwhere the files exist in multiple physical servershare locations but appear to be part of a single namespace. Some of the main reasons behind a GNS is to open up more storage pools for larger working pools of disk, migrate data transparently, and reduce number of mount points / shares in an environment. Vendors implement this technology in different ways, but the client view is designed to be the same. A GNS is always made of several name spaces using concatenation or individual shared volumes. Standards Global Namespace technology can virtualize file server protocols such as Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocols. These are standard protocols used by all servers, network attached storage (NAS) devices and client systems for handling file data.

The plot originated at the onset of World War I, between the Ghadar Party in the United States, the Berlin Committee in Germany, the Indian revolutionary underground in British India and the German Foreign Office through the consulate in San Francisco. The incident derives its name from the North American Ghadar Party, whose members of the Punjabi community in Canada and the United States were among the most prominent participants in the plan. It was the most prominent amongst a number of plans of the much larger Hindu‚ÄìGerman Mutiny, formulated between 1914 and 1917 to initiate a Pan-Indian rebellion against the British Raj during World War I. The mutiny was planned to start in the key state of Punjab, followed by mutinies in Bengal and rest of India. Indian units as far as Singapore were planned to participate in the rebellion. The plans were thwarted through a coordinated intelligence and police response. British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement in Canada and in India, and last-minute intelligence from a spy helping to crush the planned uprising in Punjab before it started. Key figures were arrested, mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed. Intelligence about the threat of the mutiny led to a number of important war-time measures introduced in India, including the passages of the Foreigners Ordinance, 1914, the Ingress into India Ordinance, 1914, and the Defence of India Act 1915. The conspiracy was followed by the First Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial which saw death sentences awarded to a number of Indian revolutionaries, and exile to a number of others. After the end of the war, fear of a second Ghadarite uprising led to the recommendations of the Rowlatt Acts and thence the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Background World War I began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership. Contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt, India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained hotbeds of anti colonial activities. Militancy in Bengal, increasingly closely linked with the unrest in Punjab, was significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration. Also, from the beginning of the war, an expatriate Indian population, notably from the United States, Canada, and Germany, headed by the Berlin Committee and the Ghadar Party, attempted to trigger insurrections in India along the lines of the 1857 uprising with Irish Republican, German and Turkish help in a massive conspiracy that has since come to be called the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Mutiny This conspiracy also attempted to rally Afghanistan against British India. A number of failed attempts were made at mutiny, of which the February mutiny plan and the Singapore Mutiny remain most notable. This movement was suppressed by means of a massive international counter-intelligence operation and draconian political acts (including the Defence of India Act 1915) that lasted nearly ten years. Indian nationalism in US Early works towards Indian nationalism in the United States dates back to the first decade of the 20th century, when, following the example of London India House, similar organisations were opened in the United States and in Japan through the efforts of the then growing Indian student population in the country. Shyamji Krishna Varma, the founder of India House, had built close contacts with the Irish Republican movement. The first of the nationalist organisations was the Pan-Aryan Association, modelled after Krishna Varma's Indian Home Rule Society, opened in 1906 through the joint Indo-Irish efforts of S.L. Joshi and George Freeman. The American branch of the association also invited Madame Cama‚Äîwho at the time was close to the works of Krishna Varma‚Äîto give a series of lectures in the United States. An \\"India House\\" was founded in Manhattan in New York in January 1908 with funds from a wealthy lawyer of Irish descent called Myron Phelps. Phelps admired Swami Vivekananda, and the Vedanta Society (established by the Swami) in New York was at the time under Swami Abhedananda, who was considered \\"seditionist\\" by the British. In New York, Indian students and ex- residents of London India House took advantage of liberal press laws to circulate The Indian Sociologist and other nationalist literature. New York increasingly became an important centre for the global Indian movement, such that Free Hindustan, a political revolutionary journal published by Tarak Nath Das closely mirroring The Indian Sociologist, moved from Vancouver and Seattle to New York in 1908. Das collaborated extensively with the Gaelic American with help from George Freeman before Free Hindustan was proscribed in 1910 under British diplomatic pressure. After 1910, the American east coast activities began to decline and gradually shifted to San Francisco. The arrival of Har Dayal around this time bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants, laying the foundations of the Ghadar movement. Ghadar party The Pacific coast of North America saw large scale Indian immigration in the 1900s, especially from Punjab which was facing an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with a series of legislations aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada, and restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth, and the community had expected, to honour its commitment, equal welcome and rights from the British and Commonwealth governments as extended to British and white immigrants. These legislations fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. A large number of Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Meanwhile, nationalist work among Indians on the east coast began to gain momentum from around 1908 when Indian students of the likes of P S Khankhoje, Kanshi Ram, and Tarak Nath Das founded the Indian Independence League in Portland, Oregon. Khankhoje's works also brought him close to Indian nationalists in the United States at the time, including Tarak Nath Das. In the years preceding World War I, Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party. He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party. He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911. He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy. The Ghadar Party, initially the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, was formed in 1913 in the United States under the leadership of Har Dayal, with Sohan Singh Bhakna as its president. It drew members from Indian immigrants, largely from Punjab. Many of its members were also from the University of California at Berkeley including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V. G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada, and Asia. Ghadar meetings were held in Los Angeles, Oxford, Vienna, Washington, D.C., and Shanghai. Ghadar's ultimate goal was to overthrow British colonial authority in India by means of an armed revolution. It viewed the Congress-led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter's constitutional methods as soft. Ghadar's foremost strategy was to entice Indian soldiers to revolt. To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the Yugantar Ashram press in San Francisco. The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature. Ghadar conspiracy Punjabi Sikhs aboard the SS Komagata Maru in Vancouver's Burrard Inlet, 1914. Most of the passengers were not allowed to land in Canada and the ship was forced to return to India. The events surrounding the Komagata Maru incident served as a catalyst for the Ghadarite cause. Har Dayal's contacts with erstwhile members of India House in Paris and in Berlin allowed early concepts of Indo-German collaboration to take shape. Towards the end of 1913, the party established contact with prominent revolutionaries in India, including Rash Behari Bose. An Indian edition of the Hindustan Ghadar essentially espoused the philosophies of anarchism and revolutionary terrorism against British interests in India. Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab, and Ghadarite publications that reached Bombay from California were deemed seditious and banned by the Raj. These events, compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy of 1912, led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature, which emanated mostly from San Francisco. =1914= During World War I, the British Indian Army contributed significantly to the British war effort. Consequently, a reduced force, estimated to have been as low as 15,000 troops in late 1914, was stationed in India. It was in this scenario that concrete plans for organising uprisings in India were made. In September 1913, Mathra Singh, a Ghadarite, visited Shanghai and promoted the Ghadarite cause within the Indian community there. In January 1914, Singh visited India and circulated Ghadar literature amongst Indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for Hong Kong. Singh reported that the situation in India was favourable for a revolution. In May 1914, the Canadian government refused to allow the 400 Indian passengers of the ship to disembark at Vancouver. The voyage had been planned as an attempt to circumvent Canadian exclusion laws that effectively prevented Indian immigration. Before the ship reached Vancouver, its approach was announced on German radio, and British Columbian authorities were prepared to prevent the passengers from entering Canada. The incident became a focal point for the Indian community in Canada which rallied in support of the passengers and against the government's policies. After a 2-month legal battle, 24 of them were allowed to immigrate. The ship was escorted out of Vancouver by the protected cruiser HMCS Rainbow and returned to India. On reaching Calcutta, the passengers were detained under the Defence of India Act at Budge Budge by the British Indian government, which made efforts to forcibly transport them to Punjab. This caused rioting at Budge Budge and resulted in fatalities on both sides. A number of Ghadar leaders, like Barkatullah and Tarak Nath Das, used the inflammatory passions surrounding the Komagata Maru incident as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party's fold. =Outlines of mutiny= By October 1914, a large number of Ghadarites had returned to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country that were being arranged to be shipped in from United States with German help. The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, where they would be provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were to be joined by more Indians arriving in smaller groups. During the September‚ÄìOctober time period, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia, Chinyo Maru, China, Manchuria, SS Tenyo Maru, SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru. The SS Korea's party was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta. In spite of this, a successful underground network was established between the United States and India, through Shanghai, Swatow, and Siam. Tehl Singh, the Ghadar operative in Shanghai, is believed to have spent $30,000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India. Amongst those who returned were Vishnu Ganesh Pingle, Kartar Singh, Santokh Singh, Pandit Kanshi Ram, Bhai Bhagwan Singh, who ranked amongst the higher leadership of the Ghadar Party. Pingle had known Satyen Bhushan Sen (Jatin Mukherjee's emissary) in the company of Gadhar members (such as Kartar Singh Sarabha) at the University of Berkeley. Tasked to consolidate contact with the Indian revolutionary movement, as part of the Ghadar Conspiracy, Satyen Bhushan Sen, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Vishnu Ganesh Pingle and a batch of Sikh militants sailed from America by the SS Salamin in the second half of October 1914. Satyen and Pingle halted in China for a few days to meet the Gadhar leaders (mainly Tahal Singh) for future plans. They met Dr Sun Yat-sen for co-operation. Dr. Sun was not prepared to displease the British. After Satyen and party left for India, Tahal sent Atmaram Kapur, Santosh Singh and Shiv Dayal Kapur to Bangkok for necessary arrangements.Statement of Pingle and Mula Singh to Cleveland, d/31-3-1915, H.P. 1916, May 436-439B. Notes on Tahal, Roll 6, RG 118.Rowlatt Report ¬ß110, ¬ß121 and ¬ß138.. In November, 1914, Pingle, Kartar Singh and Satyen Sen arrived in Calcutta. Satyen introduced Pingle and Kartar Singh to Jatin Mukherjee. \\"Pingle had long talks with Jatin Mukherjee, who sent them to Rash Behari\\" in Benares with necessary information during the third week of December. Satyen remained in Calcutta at 159 Bow Bazar [Street]. Tegart was informed of an attempt to tamper with some Sikh troops at the Dakshineswar gunpowder magazine. \\"A reference to the Military authorities shows that the troops in question were the 93rd Burmans\\" sent to Mesopotamia. Jatin Mukherjee and Satyen Bhushan Sen were seen interviewing these Sikhs.Terrorism in Bengal, Government of West Bengal, Vol. III, p505 The Ghadarites rapidly established contact with the Indian revolutionary underground, notably that in Bengal, and the plans began to be consolidated by Rash Behari Bose and Jatin Mukherjee and the Ghadarites for a coordinated general uprising. =Early attempts= Indian revolutionaries under Lokamanya Tilak's inspiration, had turned Benares into a centre for sedition since the 1900s. Sundar Lal (b. 1885, son of Tota Ram, Muzaffarnagar) had given a very objectionable speech in 1907 on Shivaji Festival in Benares. Follower of Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Sri Aurobindo, in 1908 this man had accompanied Lala in his UP lecture tour. His organ, the Swarajya of Allahabad, was warned in April 1908 against sedition. On 22 August 1909, Sundar Lal and Sri Aurobindo delivered \\"mischievous speeches\\" in College Square, Calcutta. The Karmayogi in Hindi was issued in Allahabad since September 1909: controlled by Sri Aurobindo, the Calcutta Karmagogin was edited by Amarendra Chatterjee who had introduced Rash Behari to Sundar Lal. In 1915, Pingle will be received in Allahabad by the Swarajya group. Rash Behari Bose had been in Benares since early 1914. Large number of outrages were committed there between October 1914 and September 1915, 45 of them before February was over. On 18 November 1914, while examining two bomb caps, he and Sachin Sanyal had been injured. They shifted to a house in Bangalitola, where Pingle visited him with a letter from Jatin Mukherjee and reported that some 4000 Sikhs of the Gadhar had already reached Calcutta. 15.000 more were waiting to join the rebellion.Rowlatt, ¬ß121, ¬ß132-¬ß138 Rash Behari sent Pingle and Sachin to Amritsar, to discuss with Mula Singh who had arrived from Shanghai. Behari's man of confidence, Pingle, led a hectic life in UP and Punjab for several weeks.Terrorism in Bengal, Vol. V, p170 During the Komagata Maru affray in Budge Budge, near Calcutta, on 29 September 1914, Baba Gurmukh Singh had contacted Atulkrishna Ghosh and Satish Chakravarti, two eminent associates of Jatin Mukherjee, who actively assisted them. Since then, angry letters from US-based Indians had reached India expressing hopes for a German victory; one of the emigrant leaders warned that his associates were in touch with the Bengal revolutionary party. It was at this juncture, in December 1914, that Pingle arrived in the Punjab, promising Bengali co-operation to the malcontent emigrants. A meeting demanded revolution, plundering of Government treasuries, seduction of Indian troops, collection of arms, preparation of bombs and the commission of dacoities. Rash Behari planned collecting gangs of villagers for the rebellion. Simultaneous outbreaks at Lahore, Ferozepore & Rawalpindi were organised while risings at Dacca, Benares, and Jubbalpur would be further extended.Rowlatt, ¬ß138 Preparing bombs was a definite part of the Gadhar programme. The Sikh conspirators ‚Äì knowing very little about it ‚Äì decided to call in a Bengali expert, as they had known in California Professor Surendra Bose, associate of Taraknath Das. Towards the end of December 1914, at a meeting at Kapurthala, Pingle announced that a Bengali babu was ready to co-operate with them. On 3 January 1915, Pingle and Sachindra in Amritsar received Rs 500 from the Ghadar, and returned to Benares. =Coordination= Pingle returned to Calcutta with Rash Behari's invitation to the Jugantar leaders to meet him at Benares for co-ordinating and finalising their plans. Jatin Mukherjee, Atulkrishna Ghosh, Naren Bhattacharya left for Benares (early January 1915). In a very important meeting, Rash Behari announced the rebellion, proclaiming: \\"Die for their country.\\" Though through Havildar Mansha Singh, the 16th Rajput Rifles at Fort William was successfully approached, Jatin Mukherjee wanted two months for the army revolt, synchronising with the arrival of the German arms. He modified the plan according to the impatience of the Gadhar militants to rush to action. Rash Behari and Pingle went to Lahore. Sachin tampered with the 7th Rajputs (Benares) and the 89th Punjabis at Dinapore. Damodar Sarup [Seth] went to Allahabad. Vinayak Rao Kapile conveyed bombs from Bengal to Punjab. Bibhuti [Haldar, approver] and Priyo Nath [Bhattacharya?] seduced the troops at Benares; Nalini [Mukherjee] at Jabalpur. On 14 February, Kapile carried from Benares to Lahore a parcel containing materials for 18 bombs.Rowlatt, ¬ß121 By the middle of January, Pingle was back in Amritsar with \\"the fat babu\\" (Rash Behari); to avoid too many visitors, Rash Behari moved to Lahore after a fortnight. In both the places he collected materials for making bombs and ordered for 80 bomb cases to a foundry at Lahore. Its owner out of suspicion refused to execute the order. Instead, inkpots were used as cases in several of the dacoities. Completed bombs were found during house searches, while Rash Behari escaped. \\"By then effective contact had been established between the returned Gadharites and the revolutionaries led by Rash Behari, and a large section of soldiers in the NW were obviously disaffected.\\" \\"It was expected that as soon as the signal was received there would be mutinies and popular risings from Punjab to Bengal.\\" \\"48 out of the 81 accused in the Lahore conspiracy case, including Rash Behari‚Äôs close associates like Pingle, Mathura Singh & Kartar Singh Sarabha, recently arrived from North America.\\" Along with Rash Behari Bose, Sachin Sanyal and Kartar Singh, Pingle became one of the main coordinators of the attempted mutiny in February 1915. Under Rash Behari, Pingle issued intensive propaganda for revolution from December 1914, sometimes disguised as Shyamlal, a Bengali; sometimes Ganpat Singh, a Punjabi. =Setting a date= Confident of being able to rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. The 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal revolutionaries contacted the Sikh troops stationed at Dacca through letters of introduction sent by Sikh soldiers of Lahore, and succeeded in winning them over. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately. =1915 Indian mutiny= The public executions of convicted sepoy mutineers at Outram Road, Singapore, By the start of 1915, a large number of Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab province alone by some estimates) had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans had been made to attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December, a number of politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915. =February 1915= In India, confident of being able to rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately. However, the Punjab CID successfully infiltrated the conspiracy at the last moment through Kirpal Singh: a cousin of the trooper Balwant Singh (23rd Cavalry), US-returned Kirpal, a spy, visited Rash Behari's Lahore headquarters near the Mochi Gate, where over a dozen leaders including Pingle met on 15 February 1915. Kirpal informed the police. Sensing that their plans had been compromised, the D-day was brought forward to 19 February, but even these plans found their way to the Punjab CID. Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 February were thwarted. On 15 February, the 5th Light Infantry stationed at Singapore was among the few units to actually rebel. About half of the eight hundred and fifty troops comprising the regiment mutinied on the afternoon of the 15th,Philip Mason, pages 426‚Äì427 A Matter of Honour, along with nearly a hundred men of the Malay States Guides. This mutiny lasted almost seven days, and resulted in the deaths of forty-seven British soldiers and local civilians. The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden. The mutiny was only put down after French, Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements. Of nearly two hundred tried at Singapore, forty-seven were shot in a public execution,. Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years. Some historians, including Hew Strachan, argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit, the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy. Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy. Plans for revolt in the 26th Punjab, 7th Rajput, 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments did not go beyond the conspiracy stage. Planned mutinies in Firozpur, Lahore, and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested, although some managed to escape or evade arrest. A last-ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut. Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore, but was arrested in Benares, and V. G. Pingle was apprehended from the lines of the 12th Cavalry at Meerut, in the night of 23 March 1915. He carried \\"ten bombs of the pattern used in the attempt to assassinate Lord Hardinge in Delhi,\\" according to Bombay police report. It is said that it was enough to blow up an entire regiment. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled to Thailand or other sympathetic nations. Later efforts Other related events include the 1915 Singapore Mutiny, the Annie Larsen arms plot, Christmas Day Plot, events leading up to the death of Bagha Jatin, as well as the German mission to Kabul, the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India, as well as, by some accounts, the Black Tom explosion in 1916. The Indo-Irish- German alliance and the conspiracy were the target of a worldwide British intelligence effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The conspiracy led to criminal conspiracy trials like the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial in India and the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial in the United States, the latter being the longest and most expensive trial in the country at that date. Trials The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny. Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge. At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial. Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment. A number of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman. Forty-two defendants in the trial were acquitted. The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot. Following the conclusion of the trial, diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably. Impact The Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy as a whole, as well as the intrigues of the Ghadar Party in Punjab during the war, were among the main stimuli for the enactment of the Defence of India Act, appointment of the Rowlatt Committee, and the enactment of the Rowlatt Acts. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is also linked intimately with the Raj's fears of a Ghadarite uprising in India especially Punjab in 1919.

Walter Tennyson Swingle segregated these species into a separate subgenus, Papeda. It included the Ichang lemon, yuzu, kaffir lime, kabosu, sudachi, and a number of wild and uncultivated species and hybrids. Recent genetic analysis shows the papedas to be distributed among distinct branches of the citrus phylogenetic tree, and hence Swingle's proposed subgenus is polyphyletic and not a valid taxonomic grouping, but the term persists as a common name. Because of generally slow growth and bitter, less palatable fruits than in other citruses, papeda species have only limited commercial cultivation. Some species, like ichang papeda, are used in landscaping, while others are important for rootstocking and as genome source for breeding disease-resistant and frost-hardy citrus hybrids. In some cases the skin or leaves are used as a flavoring in Asian cuisine. It is believed, based on molecular studies, that the citron, pomelo, mandarin and papedas were the ancestors of most hybrid citrus species and their varieties, which resulted from breeding or natural hybridization among the parental species. For example, the Key lime, a hybrid between a papeda, the micrantha, and a citron, has in turn given rise to many commercial types of limes.  Classification  PCA of SNP diversity).

It collided with an oil tanker off Europa Point, the southernmost tip of Gibraltar on 12 August 2007, and ended up partially submerged in the Strait of Gibraltar. The vessel broke into two in December 2007 amid numerous unsuccessful recovery efforts. The cargo was salvaged and the stern section removed for scrap. Following the crew's rescue, the captain was arrested for having departed without authorisation. Charges of endangering shipping were later dropped.  Ship description  New Flame measured long, wide and tall, of which were under the water line. It measured and had a capacity of nearly . At time of the incident it had a crew of 23 and it was owned by Transmar, a Greek shipping company. The ship was built in June 1994 by Daewoo H.I, South Korea and first named as Skaustrand. From 1995 it was named Aditya Gautam and was owned by the Indian company Century Textiles & Industries Ltd, who sold it in 2005 to Transmar for $22.5 million.  Collision  In the early morning of 12 August 2007, New Flame departed from Europa Point en route to Turkey, carrying 27,000 tons of scrap metal and 750 tons of fuel oil. About one kilometre south of Europa Point, it ran into the stern of Torm Gertrud, a double-hulled Danish petroleum tanker that was scheduled to complete a personnel transfer in the Spanish port of Algeciras. The tanker proceeded towards Algeciras after the collision, where it was secured, with its cargo of 39,000 tons of fuel, whilst New Flame took water by the bow. The ship was abandoned by the crew and thereafter became partially submerged, drifted and eventually ran aground nearby.  Recovery efforts  Recovery efforts underway, 13 October 2007 The rescue response at the working level of Gibraltar was commended, although there was considerable criticism at a local level in Spain, due to the dispute between Spain and Gibraltar. Removal of the vessel‚Äôs fuel was initiated on 15 August with the arrival of the tug Hua-An, later joined by the tug Fotiy Krylov (one of the largest of the world). It was the first priority of the salvage operation to minimise the environmental impact of the collision, followed by operations to refloat the ship. On 20 August the salvage operation turned to the controlled break-up of the ship in two halves and the first reports of a 'minor' oil-spill were reported. It was reported that 500 tons of fuel remained on board. The tug Fotiy Krylov had attempted to move the ship and divers checked the damage, concluding that the ship's structural integrity was sound enough for the removal of fuel to continue. By 24 August, it looked likely that the ship would be refloated, even if only partially to then tow to a safer location. The salvage companies involved were Tsavliris (based in Greece) and Svitzer Wijsmuller Salvage (Dutch subcontractors). On 14 September 2007, the Government of Gibraltar announced that all fuel had been removed from the vessel, totalling 780 cubic metres. The operation had been hampered by bad weather and the exposed location of the wreck. It was also reported that the ship would not be salvaged in a single piece due to structural damage and would be instead cut in two parts at one-third of its length from the bow. The stern section would be removed first and towed to a safe area, where it would have its cargo removed and then be taken to dry dock in Gibraltar. On completion, the bow part would have been taken apart where it rested. The operation was scheduled to start in October 2007 with the removal of the stern in November and the bow as late as March 2008. However, the salvage company experienced technical difficulties in cutting up the vessel. Following heavily prolonged bad weather, the vessel broke into two on 22 December 2007, prompting an emergency meeting by the Government of Gibraltar with maritime authorities. On 28 December 2007, the vessel's insurers placed the salvage operation in the hands of Titan Maritime, one of the world's largest marine salvage companies. New Flame avoided becoming a local shipwreck when in August 2008, the stern section was lifted and taken to the ship repair yard.New Flame finally out The salvage operation of New Flame featured on \\"Salvage Code Red\\" on the National Geographic Channel on 16 February 2009. Political impact Following the collision, there were concerns raised that such incidents in the area were commonplace, with local politicians on both Gibraltar and Spanish sides calling for a review of procedures. On 21 August the Spanish Maritime Safety Agency (Salvamento Maritimo) announced that it had put in place its anti-pollution alert program. This involved the deployment of the ship Don Inda, based in Galicia, which arrived at Algeciras on 14 August. On 31 August the European Maritime Safety Agency announced that, at the request of the Spanish administration the ship Mistra Bay, which specialised in the treatment of pollution, would be sent to the area. Following continued media speculation and accusations in Spain, the Government of Gibraltar announced it would make no further public comment, except to say that \\"this salvage operation has taken place more quickly than comparable salvage operations elsewhere in the world.\\"information given publicly in good faith has abused  Legal issues  The captain, Demetrio Konstantinos, a Greek national, was arrested and later released on bail. He faced safety charges that New Flame may have left the Port of Gibraltar without authorisation. Subsequently Konstantinos pleaded guilty to leaving port without proper notification and paid a small fine, but charges of endangering shipping were dropped.

Location  Cassidy Lake is located in the community of Clover Hill, surrounded by rolling hills in the Caledonia Highlands, southeast of the village of Norton. Neighbouring communities are Poodiac, Salt Springs, and Southfield. there are less than 30 families living in the immediate area. Numerous cottages dot the lake's shores, along with several camps and a youth drug rehabilitation centre.  Lake, wildlife, and recreation  The lake is approximately one kilometre in length and half a kilometre wide. The water is clean, and the lake is fed by two large brooks, as well as surface runoff and numerous underwater springs. At the north west end of the lake the water is very shallow and marshy. This area contains most of the wildlife around the lake. There are many types of birds, including bald eagles, loons, cormorants and king fishers, several beaver dams, and mainly chain pickerel, splake, and sunfish, there are also largemouth bass, and speckled trout. Although small, the lake is a popular spot to fish, swim and boat. Every year in May the Fish and Game Society holds a fishing derby which always attracts a crowd.  Area history  Originally called DeForest Lake, it was later named Cassidy Lake after settler Francis Edward Cassidy. His original homestead on Cassidy Hill burned many years ago, but you will still find the foundation, apple orchards, cemetery and church. The church has a very interesting interior design, but is only open to worshipers for one day every August. At one time there was a saw mill on the lake, near what is now Route 865. The Kilpatrick family also owned a general store and millinery on the same road. There is no commerce in the area at present.  Potash mining  Potash is mined to the south east of the lake, the mine was opened by Dennison and was later purchased by the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. In the late 1990s areas of the mine began to flood, shortly after it was allowed to flood completed and production was terminated. Today the mine acts as water storage for its sister operation in Penobsquis, New Brunswick, which has also been leaking for some years. By trucking the water to Cassidy Lake, and other sites the Penobsquis Mine has been able to maintain production.

It was released on 7 December 1999, through Avantgarde Music.  Background  The album takes its name from a synonym for the word \\"neologism\\", which means a made-up word which enters everyday use. The album's recording sessions were marred by a mixing console that caught fire. = Sound = On the sound of the album, band member Cornelius said, \\"The hard will be harder, the passion will be more passionate, the ecstatic more ecstatic.\\" The band wanted to utilise a \\"true black metal production\\" sound, having it recorded at Sunlight Studios (home to many reputed black metal acts in the mid 90s). The album expands upon their debut The Linear Scaffold by bringing a concept to the unique sound. It is in theory a black metal album, but contains many sonic elements and themes the genre usually does not touch on. The vocals by Cornelius and Lazare are different on this album than the first; though Lazare retains his clean singing and Cornelius continues his black metal screams/growls, some are delivered in a rap-like cadence and one song, \\"Omnipolis\\", is sung in French. Some songs feature keyboards and electronic sounds unlike those typically used in other black metal songs. Indeed, the album was so far from traditional black metal, the band received a death threat.http://wormgearzine.com/2009/01/11/solefald-interview/ = Lyrical content = Although there is some thematic continuity between songs, the album is not as strictly a concept album as some of the band's later works.

The CD includes three bonus tracks, including a live recording of their 1990 concert on the riverfront in Keokuk, Iowa. The final track on the CD is the original recording of \\"Pretty Girl\\" by Urban Discipline, a band that includes the son of drummer Dave Johnson. Release history This album was released in the CD format by MCCM Records in 1996, with a catalogue number #MCCM-9602; and in the LP format by CME Records, also in 1996, with a catalogue number of #KE/LP 12001. Nature of the music This is actually the first album released by GONN and consists of all new material, although there is a snippet of their classic \\"Blackout of Gretely\\" at the end of \\"Fellow Slave\\". They had previously released two singles in 1966 and 1967, along with other unreleased songs in this time period; these have been collected on several retrospective albums, including a CD that was issued contemporaneously with this album, Frenzology. The first true reunion of the band occurred at a riverfront concert in 1990; one of the three bonus tracks on the CD is a performance from that concert. Although other garage rock bands have reformed and released albums in recent years ‚Äì the Litter and the Outsiders as examples ‚Äì GONN is unusual in that their reputation rests essentially on a single 1966 song, \\"Blackout of Gretely\\", which is considered by many to be among the greatest tracks in the entire garage rock genre. For instance, while acknowledging that \\"'Blackout of Gretely' is without doubt one of the Top 10 great punk records of all time\\",Liner notes, Pebbles, Volume 10 (CD). Greg Shaw says of the band that it was a \\"typical garage band . . . [that] played a lot of Standells, Stones, Kinks, etc. [covers and] were better than most bands of the day\\".Liner notes, Pebbles, Volume 1 (CD). Besides the obscurity of the band, this album differs from many reunion albums that have been released over the years in the exuberance shown by the musicians, who are most definitely not just going through the motions. The tracks include many covers, including familiar songs by the Animals (\\"When I Was Young\\") and the Byrds (\\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\"), along with others that were originally by other mid-1960s garage-rock bands: \\"Fellow Slave\\" (originally by the Stone Cutters) and \\"Found Love\\" (originally by the Fly-by-Nites). (The original version of the latter song can be found on Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 8). The original songs include \\"In the Wind\\", written as a tribute to garage-rock fans everywhere and created especially for this album. A 40th year reunion album is being prepared (as of mid-2007). Liner notes Besides the extensive listing of credits, each of the bandmembers has their own comments on a page in the CD booklet, along with \\"then and now\\" photos and comments on the songs on the new album. The heartfelt joy at being able to record an album together after so many years is palpable in all of their entries:As taken from the liner notes of this album. * Rex Garrett ‚Äì We had the 1990 reunion under our belt. I figured if we could pull it off live we can damn sure do it in the studio! Boy was I in for a rude awakening. You hear absolutely everything at 'The Studio', nothing gets by! It's not \\"Blackout of Gretely\\" with two mikes any more! * Gary Stepp ‚Äì When we decided to do the 'Rollin' on the River' reunion in 1990, I felt a little nervous about it because I hadn't played that kind of music for over 15 years. But I was really excited when we all got together to practice that first time because it came together so well. When we were playing, it was like all the years disappeared and we were back in 1966 again. * Craig Moore ‚Äì After reissuing \\"Blackout [of Gretely]\\" twice in response to demand, I thought it was high time the guys got directly involved in a GONN project. The Frenzology CD needed a book with their words in it, not just mine, and by the time I got 'em all on board with that I thought, 'hell, why not do a new album?' I think they thought I was 1/2 nuts, except Gary who wrote back at once in support of the idea, but in short order we were all ready to do it (except Brent [Colvin] who sends his best wishes but couldn't join us this time). * Gerry Gable ‚Äì It had been 25 years since I played keyboards in public or on a session, and I hadn't really sung since 1986. . . . After the first hour or so, though, it was like we had never stopped playing together. Imagine putting out 10¬Ω songs in 2 days with almost no rehearsal including new originals and songs we'd never played together before! * Dave Johnson ‚Äì It was magic in the studio. Once again Craig pushed us beyond what we thought we were capable of and made us better. The new recordings made me say 'wow, I didn't realize we were that damn good'. . . . I want to thank the members of the band for being my friends and for taking on that 14-year-old in 1967. * Larry LaMaster ‚Äì I never once thought that the 1990 reunion would be the end of it. It was more of an 'ice-breaker' getting everyone talking again and putting any ghosts from the past behind us. I'm glad to see Gary a part of the group again. The 30th Anniversary is/was a crazy idea, but that's probably its appeal. To think that 6 old fat guys can make some good music is pretty cool.

It was built from 1830 to 1833 by William and Andrew Lang. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 16 August 2012.  History  =Lang family's emigration to New South Wales= William Lang of Greenock in Scotland, was a wood merchant specialising in block making, coopering and ship's joinery. He married Mary Dunmore and four children were born to them: * John Dunmore, born August, 1799. * George Dunmore, born 1801. * Andrew, born 1804. * Isabella Ninian, born 1806. In 1806, William retired from business and settled on the farm, Nethra Dochra near Largs (Scotland), which his wife had inherited. The Laird, Colonel Thomas Brisbane, who was later to be knighted and become Governor of New South Wales, negotiated to purchase Dochra from the Langs for ¬£800, but the purchase fell through and the Langs remained on the farm. John entered Glasgow University at the age of 12. After 8 years he graduated with a Master of Arts degree, later completing his Doctorate in Divinity. George commenced his studies in Medicine, but was offered a glamorous position of superintendent of a large sugar plantation at Lucia in the West Indies. However, his patron was killed just before George left, putting George's future in jeopardy. His brother, John, wrote to his friend Captain Piper in New South Wales regarding a career in the new country for his brother. As a result, on 24 April 1821, George sailed from London for Hobart on the Brixton under Captain Lush. He arrived in Hobart in the following August. He then proceeded to Sydney arriving 16 September 1821, a few months before Sir Thomas Brisbane was to arrive to relieve Lachlan Macquarie of his position as Governor. John Dunmore Lang left for New South Wales at the urging of his brother George, to raise the moral tone of the colony. He sailed from Leith on October 14, 1822 on the Andromeda under Captain James Muddle. Most of his fellow travellers were settlers with grants and some were already agriculturalists. The two elder boys now being so far away from the family, those of the immediate family remaining is Scotland, chose to emigrate also. In 1823, the Lang family, comprising William and Mary and their children Andrew and Isabella, accompanied by one female servant, who travelled steerage at a cost of ¬£40, left Leith aboard the vessel Greenock. They were greeted on arrival at Campbell's wharf by their older sons. The Brisbanes also welcomed them, with William being offered a grant of 2000 acres, and pledging to take 20 convicts. Of these, he received four. William and Andrew began work as builders in the rapidly developing town of Sydney, a logical extension of his father's trade in Scotland. =Securing the Land Grant and the establishment of Dunmore= On his arrival in Sydney, George Lang obtained a job in the mercantile house of Riley and Walker through the goods offices of Deputy Commissary, General William Wemyss (in whose house John was to board when he arrived in Sydney). Later, George moved to Parramatta where he joined the Commissariat Department. He had been a conscientious worker, not having given time to the development of his land grants and in one case, not having even made a selection of land. George did not have a Home Governor's Order for land. However, he applied for a grant of land on 5 March 1822 and he was granted an initial 1000 acres (424 ha) from Governor Macquarie, adjacent Standish Harris' land. The site he chose was between the future villages of Largs and Paterson. He later purchased an additional 600 ha and named the property Dunmore. Cecily Mitchell ascribes the naming of Dunmore to William Lang's wife's maiden name, Mary Dunmore. This is verified in an implicit way in John Dunmore Lang's History of New South Wales. Conditions applicable to the grant included the following: * George Lang was not to sell within five years. * The government reserved the right to take out timber deemed fit for naval purposes. * And that grant \\"procure and have assigned to him 10 convicts who were to be clothed and fed until the expiration or remission of their respective sentences.\\" The convicts were to be used exclusively on the grant of land. Tragically, George Lang died in 1825, in Sydney, aged 23. The property was inherited by his elder brother, Dr John Dunmore Lang, who became the first Presbyterian minister in the colony. Dr Lang was unable to remain at Dunmore and the estate passed to his younger brother Andrew. Andrew supposedly paid 5/- (shillings) for the property. J. D. Lang in his account says that he was in England at the time of his brother's death, and that the land \\"consequently fell to my younger brother, Andrew Lang.\\" Dunmore House was built by Andrew and his father William. It was possibly commenced in 1827 and completed in 1830. These dates are quoted differently in many references, ranging from a commencement in 1830 to a completion in 1833. J. D. Lang writes that his brother took possession of the land in 1826, but \\"as he had to reside in Sydney the whole of that year, he entrusted it to the management of an emancipated convict overseer, who proved a very inefficient servant, and did very little in the way of improving it.\\" Historical Records of Australia give an account of Andrew's later representations to the Governor to acquire further lands. He wrote to Governor Bourke from Dunmore, Hunter's River, 30 April 1832 explaining that his brother George Lang arrived in the colony as a free settler in 1821, and that he, Andrew, as an heir to his brother's estate, was claiming 400 acres of land that had been offered to his brother from Governor Macquarie, but had not been selected by his brother. Governor Brisbane, to whom George had been well known, had granted George a further 1000 acres. Andrew explained that until 1824, his brother had been employed in His Majesty's Service as a store keeper in the Commissariat Department and was unable to leave his station and go in search of land. He left the Department on December 24, 1824 to settle on his land at Hunter's River, then died in 1825. The recorded reasons vary. He \\"was seized with an inflammatory fever...of which he died on 18th January 1825\\" (in Sydney) according to one record. In Cynthia Hunter's work \\"The Settlers of Paterson's Plains\\" wherein George Lang is said to have drowned in the wreck of a sailing coaster between Sydney and Newcastle in January 1825. In April 1827, Andrew was seeking to secure further lands comprising 400 acres immediately adjacent to his 1000 acres property, Dunmore. In the meantime, this land had been claimed by Mr George Sparke in August 1831. Lang wrote and warned him to \\"desist from improving it in any way until the case was referred to (the Governor).\\" Governor Richard Bourke wrote to Viscount Goderich in Despatch number 73 (per ship Rubicon) in relation to this matter. This correspondence was acknowledged by the Right Honourable E. G. Stanley on 15 April 1833. The request of both Andrew Lang, as well as Mrs Lang, whom had also applied, was not accepted. Andrew Lang wanted alternative land, if he could not obtain the 400 acre adjacent parcel of land. The influence of Reverend Dr Lang was impetus enough for Governor Bourke to look further toward a positive answer. In reply the Right Honourable E. G. Stanley wrote: \\"The application of Mr Andrew Lang to be allowed to benefit by the Order for 500 acres, given by Governor Macquarie (sic) to his late brother, is totally inadmissible.\\" Standish Lawrence Harris had 2000 acres adjacent to Lang's grant. In 1825, he purchased 1114 acres which he named Goulburn Grove. This gave him an area of land from the banks of the Paterson River (Phoenix Park) to the Hunter River adjoining Maitland Vale north of the city of Maitland. Harris became insolvent in 1833 and his properties were put up for auction in 1835. Andrew Lang purchased 1400 acres (556.560ha) for 24/- an acre. He estimated that it cost five to six pounds an acre to clear the impenetrable brush containing huge forest trees (the land was also still heavily wooded along the Paterson River). This gave him a large and superb estate with five miles of river frontage. J. D. Lang describes the property; =Settling Dunmore= Just prior to moving north, the Langs sold some of their furniture, and the following advertisement appeared in The Australian: > \\"To be sold by Public Auction at the residence of Messrs. William and Andrew > Lang builders Elizabeth Street, on Wednesday December 29th, 1824, an elegant > assortment of Spanish mahogany furniture as follows: 1 set of Dining Tables > 14' long; 4 Pembroke Tables; 1 Card Table; 2 Tea Tables;1 Ladies work table; > 2 Chests of Drawers with wardrobe; Post and tent bedsteads etc., etc.\\" Andrew and his father William took possession of the property on the Paterson River in 1825, but did not settle the land until 1826. \\"The settlement of the Scots Church in Sydney having been attended with much greater difficulty and expense than was anticipated, and certain influential Scotsmen in the colony having rather augmented than diminished the burden that was thus entailed on its friends, my relatives had been induced to make common cause with myself, in bringing whatever capital and credit they could command in the colony to bear upon the ultimate accomplishment of that object. My brother was consequently left with comparatively little capital to commence upon his land.\\" Not only did they build the church, but the Langs had also to contribute their own monies for the completion of the church. By his brother's account, Andrew Lang was a frugal man, who instead of following the trend of the surrounding landowners in mortgaging their properties and purchasing sheep and cattle, \\"he remained satisfied with the few that he possessed, and determined not to buy more until he could pay for them.\\" \\"Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.\\" Proverbs XXIV 27. Andrew Lang's method of going about establishment of the property, was scriptural according to J D Lang, when he drew on this verse to exemplify an object lesson of good stewardship. He put forward the development of Dunmore as a good example of this passage in action. He and his family were all given to take evangelistic opportunities. By 1827, some dwelling had been erected at Dunmore, as Mrs Lang had furniture made by Quong and Tchion, cabinetmakers of Sydney. This was as J. D. Lang described the property: \\"The first dwelling erected was formed of rough slabs of split timber, the lower ends of which were sunk in the ground, the upper brought together in a wall plate. It was thatched with reeds or coarse grass, and contained three apartments-a parlour or sitting room, a store room, and a bedroom, each of which served a number of different purposes as required. The kitchen was detached, and was inhabited by a convict servant and his wife. The bare ground served as the floor, and the gaps between the vertical slabs were grouted with a composition of mud, to form a plaster. The walls were white washed inside and out. It was fitted with glass windows and a timber floor at a later stage. It served as the farmhouse for three or four years.\\" By 1830, with the aid of convict labour, they had erected two stone buildings incorporating a barn and granary, dairy, kitchen and store. The two stone pavilions were later used as outbuildings upon completion of the two storey stone residence, which formed the next phase in the establishment of the Dunmore buildings. The wooden buildings were given up to the farm overseer. In the interim period, these stone buildings were fitted up and used as a second temporary residence (from JD Lang's account).These buildings are still standing and after significant reconstruction and stabilisation, are in use today, and form two sides of a quadrangle behind the main house. J. D. Lang goes on to describe the final residence, adjoining the out buildings \\"...on an elevated and commanding situation, between the two lagoons, and about half a mile from the river. It is a two story(sic) house, built of hewn stone, having a verandah or covered portico all around.\\" That the rear (south) single storey flanking walls are completed in ruled render, would be accounted for by the fact of the verandah running around the whole house originally. It is therefore likely that the southern verandah was closed in to form a store room off the kitchen and a laundry at a later time. The turned balusters in the now roofed parapet of the south east and southwest flanking rooms are not explained in Lang's account. It is assumed that the rooms were a later addition. Also, as the stone pavilions were constructed prior to the main house, with direct reference to the detail and quality of stone work on the north facade, it would appear that the dressed facing stones are an applique or veneer, applied when the stonework for the main house was being cut and dressed, and as a final aesthetic touch to relate the earlier buildings to the newer homestead in their detail and outward presentation. Symmetry and congruency of detail are important elements in the Colonial Georgian style of building. In the Sydney Gazette of January 9, 1828, W. and A. Lang advertised that they were going to erect a flourmill on Paterson's River. It would appear that the mill was ultimately run by the husband of Isabella, Robert Muir. From Robert Muir's diary, he went to Largs on 2 August 1838 at three thirty bound for Plymouth. On 15 September 1838 the steamer Juno left for Plymouth. It arrived at 11pm on 16 September. He arrived in Sydney Tuesday 15 January 1839. On Sunday 21 June 1840 he went to Maitland arriving in the afternoon. On Monday 22 JUne he visited Dunmore where he remained all day. He again visited Dunmore on Thursday 25 June, staying until Friday 26 June. Conjecturally one would conclude that he met Isabella Ninian Lang on this occasion, leading ultimately to their subsequent marriage in Scots Church, Sydney on 8 July 1845. Muir's mill operated on the banks of the Paterson River at Woodville. Four masted barques came up the Paterson to Woodville to procure flour from Mitchell's flour mills. An old boiler-probably a ship's boiler- was to be seen until recently (1947) and still may be, in a creeper covered building on the water's brink, where the old punt used to be. In this building, the first flour mill worked by steam was erected by Mr Robert Muir. Later on the mill changed hands. The road to the Paterson River was diverted from its original route as indicated as a \\"Sufferance Road\\" on the accompanying map,Figure 1 to make straighter and more direct approaches to the new bridge, constructed in 1864 or 1865. Until then the road passed far closer to Dunmore House than it does now present, skirting the crown of the ridge upon which the house stands, and leading to the punt that was located to the west of the present position of Dunmore Bridge. This would explain the definition of gate positions on the eastern side of the immediate house yard, and the presence of the stand of giant bamboo in its position to the southeast of the house, a feature that designated an entry point in properties of the day. =The Midlothian immigrants= One of the most important and indeed controversial phases in the growth of land settlement at Dunmore, was the arrival of the highland settlers who travelled to New South Wales on the Midlothian. During 1837, Dr J. Lang commenced his Bounty Scheme for bringing out to Australia carefully selected (described as upright Calvinist highlanders) Scottish and some Irish migrant families. The scheme continued through until 1852. It had a considerable effect on the development of society and religious values in the colonies. Amongst the Scots who settled on the Paterson at Dunmore were the Beatons, Campbells, Gillies, McKay, McLeod, McKinnons, McWilliams, McShaws, McLennans, McRaes, Munros, Shaws, Grants and Grahams. A great many of them were highlanders from the Isle of Skye, refugees from the Highland Clearances. The following is from G. S. Munro's essay on J. D. Lang. The barque Midlothian entered Sydney Heads on 12 December 1837. The passengers disembarked the next day. It was the third ship of twenty in Lang's Bounty Scheme. Bounty ships gave assisted passage to 4000 Scots between 1837-40. The second, William Nicol, arrived in Sydney a week before the Midlothian. Lang himself arrived back from England at the same time on the \\"Portland\\". A week after arriving, the Midlothian passengers attended the first Gaelic speaking church service in Australia, at Scots Church. They refused to be split up as the first shipload had been, and demanded to be settled as a community, with their clergyman, William McIntyre. They presented a petition through Lang and McIntyre \\"representing that they had been induced to emigrate by the hope held out to them of being enabled to settle in one neighbourhood, so as to be within reach of religious ordinances administered in their native language, the only one understood by four fifths of their number, and praying that facilities to enable them to do so might be granted by the Government\\". (FN57) The Executive Council had an emergency meeting, and decided that even though no such undertaking had been given, the Highlanders should be allowed to settle together, if any large landowner could be found who would accept them as a body. The government would give them free passage and supplies for six months.FN 59 Rather suspiciously, the landowner willing to take them was Lang's brother, Andrew, who ran the family property of Dunmore. It is hard not to wonder whether Lang orchestrated the whole affair so that Andrew could establish twenty families of tenant farmers on his property at the Government's expense. FN 59 goes onto say that \\"Governor Gipps was not at all happy about the situation, as expressed in his despatch to Glenelg of 20th July, 1838...considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed in this Colony at the manner in which a number of Emmigrants [from] the ship \\"Midlothian\\" were disposed of, they having been settled as a Body and thus become occupiers of land on their own account, instead of being forced to work for wages as farm labourers. One suspects the \\"considerable dissatisfaction\\" was felt by other landed gentry deprived of the opportunity to exploit these new migrants and jealous of Andrew Lang's windfall.\\" Added to the above sentiments, Harry Boyle writes in his publication Historic Largs Village \\"John Eales came to the government's aid and offered to take them. Before accepting, they sent two of their number to inspect the property, which they reported, was subject to flooding. The group said they would not accept. They settled on Goulburn Grove, which had now become part of the Dunmore Estate.\\" The village that began to form, probably as flood free place to build homes and to accommodate the services needed for this large group, was named Dunmore. This name was retained until the death of Emily Lang in 1889 when the name adopted was Largs. Within the private village, a National School was built in 1838 as a school/church for the Presbyterians, on land provided by the Langs, to educate the children of the tenant farmers, approximately 60 families and to be used as a Presbyterian Kirk on Sundays. St Andrews Presbyterian Kirk was built in 1846 and remained the only church for some time to come. =The character of Dunmore= In 1827, John Dunmore Lang visited Dunmore describing the journey and the character. Forty miles from the mouth of the Hunter, 70 miles north of Sydney. It was hard riding over 110 miles of rugged mountainous countryside, via Wollombi, where he was forced to sleep out for two nights. If he travelled by boat, he still took several days on the journey, as the boat trip ended at the mouth of the river (Paterson) and he had to be rowed upriver by two boat men, which all meant delay, fatigue, annoyance and expense. He wrote that Dunmore Estate was \\"250 acres-4 square miles, 1500 acres of alluvial land, 300 acres of wheat, worked by 40 convicts under an overseer. The land was let in small farms of 20 to 150 acres for 10/- to 20/- per acre per annum.\\" Lang describes there being 300 souls on the property. There was a 14 horsepower mill, the Presbyterian Church, the National Board School, with 76 pupils, of whom but 30 were of the tenantry. Grain was grown for the Sydney market. In 1830, Dr Lang commented on the advisability of growing tobacco in the district, after his father had pointed out to him indigenous tobacco growing in the bed of the dried up lagoon. It was he who suggested the cultivation of cotton, and he was a strong advocate for the cultivation of the grape. Historical Records of Australia shows that German immigrant vinedressers were brought to Dunmore for the purpose of caring for the vineyards in the 1840s. The grape crop yielded 1800 gallons of wine in 1849 under the supervision of George Schmid. The property was famous for its vineyards in its early days. Grapes still grow in the southern courtyard. Whether these are black Hamburgh, remnant of Schmid's time is not known. The grapes grew on the alluvial flats of the Paterson. In 1850, Andrew Lang had eight acres planted. Grapes were sold on site as well as being taken to the Maitland Fruit Market, as well as wine being produced. Initially, Andrew established a small dairy establishment with the cattle he already possessed, and agricultural operations were commenced on the alluvial flat. The dairy was managed by a tenant family, with the produce being regularly sent to market in Sydney \\"to meet the various items of expenditure incurred in the maintenance of the other convict-servants on the farm.\\" The convict labour was employed in felling and burning off trees for land clearing operations and cultivation, or in grubbing up the roots of those that had been already felled; in ploughing, sowing, reaping, threshing and grinding wheat; in planting, hoeing, pulling, and threshing Indian corn. About one hundred and fifty acres of heavily timbered land had been cleared and cultivated in this way. In 1832, about eighty acres of land was under wheat and another eighty acres was under maize. The wheat was ground into flour and sold as flour in Maitland. The maize was either shipped to Sydney or used in the feeding of horses, or in fattening pigs and poultry on the farm. Potatoes and tobacco was also grown for sale as well as for consumption on the farm. During the summer months, the dairy produce was cheese, which was sold in Sydney by the hundred-weight or the ton. For the rest of the year, butter was produced for shipping fresh to Sydney every week by steam-boat and sold at market. The quantity per week was in the order of 70 to 100 pounds. In 1832, when the cattle herd had increased to 3400 head, he purchased a flock of fine wool sheep. These were sent, together with his horses and cattle to his property some 30 miles distant to form a grazing station under the management of a hired overseer. A garden comprising fruit trees had earlier been destroyed through floods, so a second orchard was established beyond the reach of flood waters, together with a vineyard. To the northwest of the house is a steep cliff. Described in the Newcastle and Hunter District Historical Society article relating to a visit to the house in 1946; > \\"A walk down one of the fields led to an unexpected change of altitude. The > ground level ended abruptly in a line of heard rocks, the edges straight and > clean as if sliced out by a gigantic knife. Immediately below was an orchard > with some of the trees bearing blossoms. Between there and the river smooth > acres of cultivation lay like a patchwork quilt. Miss Swan, of Lemon Grove, > remembers her mother saying that this land had been known in Andrew Lang's > time to have 18 feet of water on it.\\" There is no orchard remaining in this location on the property. =The Lang family= William Lang, aged 52 (the patriarch) was drowned in 1840 while travelling from Newcastle to Sydney in a small coastal vessel. Cecily Mitchell puts his death in April 1830 and offers the following description of the circumstances surrounding his death: > \\"William Lang was to make a visit to Sydney to attend the May meeting of the > Sydney College Committee. He could not get a berth on the usual packet so > accepted passage on a very small vessel. During the night a southerly gale > blew up, the vessel wrecked and William was drowned.\\" In the Weekly Register, 10 August 1844: \\" DEATH: On 5th inst. At the residence of her son, Mr Andrew Lang, of Dunmore, Hunter's River, in the 75th year of her age, Mrs Mary Dunmore Lang, relict of Mr William Lang of Sydney, and mother of Dr. Lang.\\" Andrew Lang married Emily Caswell in Maitland Presbyterian Church on 8 November 1849 at the age of 45. Emily Caswell was from the nearby property of Ballicara. Emily, daughter of Lieutenant William Caswell, was 23. There was one child to this marriage, said to have been a son, who died at birth in June 1851. After this occurrence, they returned to England settling in Devonshire. Andrew returned to sell Dunmore and his other properties. Andrew returned to his English home, also called Dunmore, dying in London on 3 June 1874. Emily died in Devonshire on 17 October 1889, aged 63. Isabella Ninian Muir died as a result of childbirth on 20 June 1847, leaving a two month old baby, John Sibbald Muir, born 11 April 1847. He died unmarried at the age of 27 in August 1874, as a result of falling from a horse. Robert Muir, Isabella's husband died on 1 July 1851, leaving the child of nearly 5 years of age, parentless. The Reverend Doctor John Dunmore Lang was the founder and minister of Scots Church Sydney, between 1826 and 1878, when he died aged 79. In the property to the east of Dunmore lay a tomb, bearing the inscription: :Sacred to the Memory of :Mary Dunmore Lang :Isabella Ninian Muir :Robert Muir :Infant Child of Emily and Andrew Lang =Later owners of Dunmore= Joseph Pearce, of \\"Edinglassie\\" near Muswellbrook, who owned other properties near Denman and Jerry's Plains, bought Dunmore in 1872, then a 490 ha property. He subdivided the property into four small farms, which were let to tenant farmers, keeping the house on a block of six hectares. A few years later, when Pearce retired to Armidale, the property was sold to Henry Trenchard, a West Maitland bank manager on Saturday 30 October 1886. The Warden family, Arthur and Amy of Paterson, purchased \\"Dunmore House\\" in 1892. They kept it for 18 years until Arthur's death, when Amy moved to Sydney. John Graham, born 1843, apparently in the kitchen of Dunmore House, purchased the property in 1910 and died there in 1932. The property passed onto William, his son. In 1954, William's eldest son, Malcolm, bought out his brother's interests and embarked on a much needed renovation of the property, before taking up residence in 1965 with his wife, Elizabeth. The residency ended with Elizabeth's death in 1999. The property was occupied by the Graham family for 90 years, until it was sold to Paris and Mittie Osborne in 2000. Paris and Mittie Osborne have made a significant contribution to the repair and reconstruction of the two flanking outbuildings to the south east and south west of the two storey homestead. These buildings were in a state of partial collapse when they purchased the property. The stone work has been dismantled and relaid on new footings. The roofs having been maintained in their original line and position through supplementary support during reconstruction. The outbuildings have become viable residential and potential hospitality resources, ensuring these important elements in the group remain intact and serviceable condition.  Description  The buildings are prominently located on a ridge line overlooking the Paterson River and Dunmore Bridge at Woodville, to the north and has sight line to other principal properties along the river alignment from Mindariba to Wallalong. It is an identifiable group of buildings from the north, south and eastern approaches to the site, and has a prominent stand of Giant cane marking the historical entry to the building group. Dunmore House and its site consists of four principal buildings forming four sides of a quadrangle in which a water cistern and old grapevine covered pergola are located along the centre line subtended between the vertical slab barn to the south and the two storey stone residence to the north. The main homestead is a large two storey residence which commenced construction in 1830 and was completed by 1833. It displays the symmetry of a classical Georgian (Regency) building. A flagged verandah enclosed in part extends around all four sides. Original columns replaced earlier this century by unsympathetic posts with Art Nouveau brackets detail. Sash windows and door openings have a raised stone surround. The interiors, consisting of four rooms on two levels, are largely intact featureing fine cedar joinery and an original cantilevered stone staircase off the central ground floor entrance hall. Forming a courtyard at the rear are two single storey stone outbuildings, which predate the main house, dating from the 1820s. The eastern outtbuilding was formerly a stable, with stone flagged flooring, and a wine cellar and larder. The western building formerly functioned as a bakehouse, bread oven, kitchen and laundry, with a workshop to the north. It is understood that the eastern building was the earliest of the stone outbuildings to be constructed, with the western building following; being utilised by the Langs as a temporary residence during the construction of the main residence. = Condition = Work in refurbishment and reconstruction of the two southern pavilions commenced in 2002. Since the reconstruction of the stonework of the two southern pavilions and the adaptive reuse of these structures as guest rooms and Laundry (western pavilion) and barn and entertainment area (east pavilion) the condition is now excellent. Before these conservation works, the northern exterior walls were badly cracked, the west pavilion west wall was in a state of partial collapse, the bread oven was beyond repair, the timber lintels over openings were badly deteriorated and infested with white ants, the render that had been applied to the field stone walls to east, west and south walls of each pavilion were badly fretted, the mortar had all but disappeared and the walls were crumbling. This has all been rectified. The roof has been reclad, but was held in its original position and form while the stone work was relaid. The two storey residence has been retained in much the same manner as it was when purchased by the present owners. Stone flagging on the verandah has been raised and relaid in its original configuration. Reroofing has been undertaken on the verandah. Trees in close proximity to the house, that were jeopardising the stability of the building, were removed. Geotechnical investigation was carried out in the courtyard formed by the house and two outer pavilions. This was found to be fill material to a depth of approximately 600mm. There may be archaeological potential in the surrounding area. Sections of the original dressed stone from the pavilions and collapsed stone chimneys post 1989 earthquake, had been used as garden edging. Some of these elements have been able to be refixed in their original position. The chimneys were rebuilt in brickwork post earthquake, and have not been subject of further intervention. = Modifications and dates = 1827 Original construction of a vertical slab dwelling as temporary accommodation during the construction of the two stone outbuildings. The location of this structure is not determined. In 1827, the original building consisted of three apartments‚Äìa parlour or sitting room, a store room and a bedroom and was constructed from vertical slabs of split timber. During this time frame, the detached kitchen was built consisting of bare ground for the floor, a composition of mud to block the gaps between the vertical slabs for the walls. At a later stage these walls were white washed inside and out and were also fitted with glass windows and the original bare floor was lined with timber. This kitchen served as a farm house for 3‚Äì4 years. 1829 two stone buildings were erected incorporating a barn, granary, a dairy, a kitchen and a store room. These two stone buildings were used as outbuildings upon completion of the two storey stone residence. Construction of the outbuildings and use as temporary accommodation during the construction of the principal two storey residence. In 1830, construction of the two storey residence had begun and the two stone buildings were later used as outbuildings upon the completion of the two-storey stone residence. These stone buildings are still standing and form two sides of a quadrangle behind the main house. 1833 completion of construction of the quadrangle behind the main house. Around this time, the original wooden buildings consisting of the three apartments and detached kitchen were given up to the farm overseer. 1890 (circa) Kitchen additions to the western outbuilding  Heritage listing  Dunmore House represents a fine and early example of a convict-built Colonial Georgian homestead complex dating from c.1833. The Georgian property maintains links to the earliest establishment of the New South Wales colony in the Hunter region. It represents the early settlement and farming practices of the colony, as well the colony's early connections to the Presbyterian Church, evangelism, Scotland and Scottish migration. Dunmore House has strong associations with the colony's first Presbyterian Minister, the Reverend John Dunmore Lang. The land was granted to, built for and used as the principle residence for his brother's family, as recorded in Lang's journals. John Dunmore Lang was an active proponent for moral reform in the young colony and served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Lang was instrumental in establishing the Presbyterian Church and education in the colony, including successfully agitating for British funding for building churches for this faith. Scots Church in Sydney was largely funded by the Lang family through income derived from farming this estate. Dunmore House is also closely associated with John Dunmore Lang's significant endeavours for promoting early Scottish migration to the colony during the early to mid-19th century, which influenced the development of society and religious values in the early colony, as well as the development of early Australian industries such as viticulture. From 1837 to 1852 Lang's pioneering Bounty migration scheme provided assisted passage to Scottish, German and Irish settlers who were carefully selected to inject religious values into the colony as well as much needed trades and skills. Dunmore House has direct associations with this migration scheme as the destination point, place of settlement and work for many of the Scottish migrants imported through this scheme. Dunmore House provides evidence of two forms of early colonial settlement - in its use of convict labour under private assignment for constructing the buildings and farming the estate, as well as the migration, settlement and use of skilled free settlers mostly from Scotland and Germany for farming the estate and establishing a society modelled, it seems, on Scotland. Dunmore House is likely to have social significance to members of the Scots Church in Sydney, the Presbyterian community and present-day descendants of the early German, Scottish and Irish settlers who Lang was responsible for shipping out to the Colony and who settled at and worked for the Lang family on the Dunmore House estate. Dunmore House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 16 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The convict-built and operated Georgian property maintains links to the earliest establishment of the New South Wales colony in the Hunter region. It represents the early settlement and farming practices of the Colony, as well the colony's early connections to the Presbyterian Church, evangelism, Scotland and Scottish migration. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Dunmore House has strong associations with the colony's first Presbyterian Minister, the Reverend John Dunmore Lang. The land was granted to, built for and used as the principle residence for his brother's family, as recorded in Lang's journals.

Dunmore House has direct associations with this migration scheme as the destination point, place of settlement and work for many of the Scottish migrants imported through this scheme. Lang is recognised in J. M. Freeland's Architecture in Australia as an \\"Australia-conscious leader\\" in the colony. Through his major migrant intake he brought trade skills to the country which influenced the evolution and quality of colonial architecture. His Presbyterian beliefs manifested themselves in other architectural idioms at the time including, in 1824, the introduction of the first appearance of the Gothic style in Australian building (under architect Standish Lawrence Harris) who designed a small stone kirk in the form of a parish church. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Dunmore House represents a fine and early example of a convict-built Colonial Georgian homestead complex dating from c.1833. It retains many of its original outbuildings, which have recently undergone extensive conservation works. The homestead complex is a prominent local landmark visible from multiple directions because of its elevated situation in a landscape of rolling hills intersected by the river. It predates the construction of Tocal Homestead and Aberglasslyn House by seven years, making it a very early surviving example of a substantial European residential/rural development in the Hunter Region. The property also demonstrates the nature of rural properties established as a result of land grants given by Governor Macquarie. It also represents a substantial record of the incremental manner in which this property grew under the hand of a person who purchased and developed the place on the basis of cash rather than mortgages, a family philosophy. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Dunmore House is likely to have social significance to members of the Scots Church in Sydney, the Presbyterian community and present-day descendants of the early German, Scottish and Irish settlers who Lang was responsible for shipping out to the Colony as part of his pioneering Bounty Scheme which operated from 1837-1852. Many were highlanders from the Isle of Skye, who were refugees from the Highland clearances. A large number of these Scottish migrants settled as a group around Dunmore House to farm his family's estate, including twenty families off the \\"Midlothian\\" ship. The nearby Largs village (originally named \\"Dunmore\\") was established by the Lang family to house these new migrants. One present-day descendant of German migrants who made a submission on the proposed listing recalls her ancestors, Ignatz and Anna Maria Hartge, who sailed from England in 1849 on the \\"Parland\\", a British merchant vessel. On this ship alone were 165 German immigrants - nearly all from the Rheinish provinces of Germany. The Hartge family were sent to work on the property for Andrew Lang as vine dressers. The free German settlers were valued for their knowledge of the culture of the vine. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Dunmore House has potential to provide evidence of two forms of early colonial settlement - in its use of convict labour under private assignment for constructing the buildings and farming the estate, as well as the migration, settlement and use of skilled free settlers mostly from Scotland and Germany for farming the estate and establishing a society modelled, it seems, on Scotland. The property also provides evidence of early 19th century farming practices, architecture and building techniques used in the settlement of the early New South Wales colony. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Dunmore House predates the construction of Tocal homestead and Aberglasslyn House by seven years, making it a very early surviving example of a substantial European residential/rural development in the Hunter region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The convict-built and operated Colonial Georgian property represents the early settlement and farming practices of the New South Wales colony, as well the colony's early connections to the Presbyterian Church, evangelism and Scottish immigration. Dunmore House meets this criterion of State significance because it shows much of the layering of development of the property from 1827 onwards. The only external component missing is the slab hut that was the original shelter while the pavilion was constructed. The group of buildings retain their landmark qualities. Residents lower down on the Paterson River, towards Raymond Terrace and Millers Forest, relied on the forewarnings of floods impending from properties upstream. The large landholdings were the key locations for these warnings, including houses at Tocal, Mindariba, Dunmore, Wallalong properties, providing a chain of visual communication. The openness of the landscape and lines of sight of each of these properties to the other facilitated this important measure. Dunmore was a large agricultural producer including wheat and maize for flour, milled on site, tobacco, dairy products including milk, butter and cheese, fruit and wine. German vinedressers were brought to the colony for the particular task of tending the vineyard. Dunmore supplied the Sydney markets via the steam ferries that plied the Paterson and Hunter Rivers and traversed the coast from Newcastle to Sydney. The buildings remaining demonstrate the core support facilities that provided such produce. The property supported 300 people engaged in tending the land as tenant farmers and labourers. While the property is much smaller now, Dunmore still retains the riverfront views for its 8.047 km (5 mile) river frontage, that which was finally included within the scope of the property.

His life work was recognized by the Japanese government. At the time he was honored with Japan's Order of the Sacred Treasure, he was one of only a very small number of Americans to have been singled out in this way.Scott, Janny. \\"John W. Hall, Historian of Japan, Dies at 81\\" [obituary]. New York Times, October 27, 1997. Hall became an authority on pre-modern Japan, and he helped transform the way Western scholars view the period immediately preceding Japan's modernization as well as the thousand years before that. Professor Jeffrey Mass, a one-time student and later colleague of Hall's on the Yale faculty, described him as a quiet, self-contained man‚Äîand a master punster. Hall was a great admirer of Japanese culture and he amassed a large collection of prints, folk art, and pottery; but in addition to being a dedicated academic, he was also an experienced mountain climber who had climbed extensively in the Japanese Alps. Early years The only son of Congregational missionaries, Hall was born in Kyoto in 1916 and lived in Japan until he was a teenager. According to his wife Robin, he visited the United States with his parents as a child and he had been appalled by how little Americans knew about Japan. After her husband's death, Mrs. Hall explained, \\"Being brought up in Japan and by missionaries, he was a very straight-arrow kind of person. There is this kind of missionary feeling, that you must make something of this [life], not just throw it away.\\" He prepared for college by attending Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. At Amherst College, he majored in American studies, comparing the United States to Japan. After receiving an A.B. degree in 1939, he returned to Japan an instructor in English at Doshisha University in Kyoto until 1941. During the war, he served with the United States Naval Intelligence, leaving the service with the rank of Lieutenant Commander.Hall, John. (1968). Japan, From Prehistory to Modern Times, p. 397. Hall earned his Ph.D. in East Asian languages and literature from Harvard University in 1950. At Harvard, he became one of the first graduate students to study under Edwin O. Reischauer, who was another missionary's son and a pioneering Japan scholar. Academic entrepreneur Hall's obituary in the New York Times described him as \\"something of an academic entrepreneur\\" because he was so central in the work of building up the fledgling field of Japanese studies in the years after World War II. In his lifetime, he served as a stalwart bridge linking historians in Japan with historians in the West. Harry Harootunian, a professor of history at New York University and a former student of Professor Hall's, summarizes this view succinctly: \\"What I think guys like Hall tried to do was de-exoticize the study of Japan. To de-exoticize, anything is to bring it closer to us, to eliminate the distance that we imagine exists between ourselves and the object of our study.\\" Hall himself explained: \\"My own fascination with Japanese history lies primarily with the manner in which Japan's political and social institutions have changed and diversified over time and how this fundamentally 'Eastern' culture gave rise to modern world power.\\"Hall, p. xi. In 1948, Professor Hall began teaching at the University of Michigan, one of the few American universities that had a significant program in his field. He would become director of the Center for Japanese Studies (1957‚Äì1960) and a founder of the first American research venture in post-war Japan. Through that program, a field research station in Okayama, Professor Hall spent a year in Japan in 1952 and became the first person to begin examining the voluminous records of one of the daimyo families that had ruled Japan during the early modern period between 1600 and 1868. He became an expert in that period, identifying the seeds of Japan's subsequent industrialization and modernization‚Äîfindings which challenged the traditional Western view that that period had been nothing more than Japan's rather backward, final feudal age. His earliest book was Tanuma Okitsugu, 1718‚Äì1787.Hardacre, Helen. (1998). The Postwar Development of Japanese Studies in the United States, p. 92. Among other interests, his research focused on the Kamakura period in the history of Japan.Hardacre, p. 57. George Wilson Pierson recruited Whitney to join the Yale University faculty as part of a plan to expand the department's curriculum to include a greater emphasis on Asian history.Kennedy, Randy. \\"George Pierson, 88, A Professor at Yale And Its Historian,\\" New York Times. October 15, 1993. In 1961, he was named as the A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History, a position he held until his retirement in 1983. Five years after arriving at Yale, Hall published his most famous book, Government and Local Power in Japan, 500 to 1700, which traced the development of Okayama during that period and, some say, opened up the first thousand years of Japanese history to the English-speaking world. Although scholarly books rarely have a shelf life of more than a generation, some colleagues assert that Hall's book is in a category all its own. While at Yale, Hall served as Chairman of the History Department from 1973 through 1976. He was also Chairman of the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department from 1971 through 1974. In 1983, he retired from the faculty. Yale University's John W. Hall Lecture Series in Japanese Studies was established in his memory. During the 1960s and 1970s, Professor Hall became a leader in many of the organizations that were working to build up the field of Japanese studies. These groups were attempting to represent the interests of the field in order to get support from universities, foundations and the Japanese government. Professor Hall's activities included * Chairman, the Japan-United States Friendship Commission * Chairman, the United States-Japan Conference on Educational and Cultural Interchange * Chairman, the Social Science Research Council/Joint Committee on Japanese Studies. Throughout these years, Professor Hall also worked closely with the Japan Foundation, which was set up by the Japanese government in the 1970s to help American universities establish Japanese studies programs. The Japan Foundation eventually gave $1 million to 10 major universities for activities in the field. Hall was honored with the Japan Foundation Award in 1976.Japan Foundation Award, 1976 =Selected works= In 1987 Hall was one of the recipients of American Historical Association's Award for Scholarly Distinction.

Such events are normally organized by a group of volunteers that operate in cooperation with the Police and other local authorities, and would always use marshals to help control the traffic (see .) The term suicide skate evolved to describe events where a group of around 5-30 people use In-line skates to tour around a city without informing the Police or other local authorities and without using marshals to help control the traffic. The term Suicide Skate probably evolved because in many cases, the participants would push themselves beyond their normal comfort zone, perhaps skating faster or using narrower or more crowded roads than they would normally be happy to use. In the case of relatively inexperienced skaters, simply skating on roads without the help of marshals to control traffic could be a significant step outside their personal comfort zone. Observers might regard such behavior as suicidal. However, participants would not, running the gauntlet with taxis and buses is all considered part of the fun. In some suicide skates, participants that could not keep pace with the others would simply be left behind. However, in other cases, the leading group of skaters would be happy to occasionally stop and wait for slower participants to catch up, thus ensuring that nobody was left behind. Many gumbie skaters refer to anytime they are skating alone as \\"doing a suicide skate\\" which is an inappropriate use of the term.

United States. In its 6-3 decision written by William J. Brennan, Jr., the court held that material being obscene depended upon \\"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\\" With its emphasis on the reaction of an average person rather than that of an especially susceptible person, the court rejected applying the Hicklin test as a means of determining whether material is obscene, and the ruling represented a liberalization of the nation's obscenity laws. The concept was further refined in the matter of Miller v. California in which the Court's adoption of the Miller test, also based upon community standards, had the opposite effect. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the author of the Court's 5-4 opinion, wrote that it is not \\"constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City,\\" thus opening the way for the Justice Department to prosecute adult entertainment businesses that distribute their products nationally in especially conservative jurisdictions.

It is the uppermost of the three formations found in the Stormberg Group of the greater Karoo Supergroup rocks and represents the final phase of preserved sedimentation of the Karoo Basin.Broom, R. 1948. A contribution to our knowledge of the vertebrates of the Karroo Beds of South Africa. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 61, 577‚Äì629.  Geology  The Clarens Formation is composed nearly entirely of fine to medium-grained, thickly-bedded sandstones that range from pale orange or pinkish to cream in color. It is characterized by its remarkable gross lithological uniformity and that its deposits mainly outcrop as high cliffs. These Clarens Formation cliffs frequently contain shallow caves and overhangs at the contact of the underlying Upper Elliot Formation (UEF) due to processes of erosion. This particular feature of the Clarens Formation lead to the initial naming of these rocks the ‚ÄúCave Sandstone‚Äù in older literature.Beukes, N.J., 1970. Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Cave Sandstone stage, Karoo System. In: S.H. Haughton (Editor), Proceedings and papers of the 2nd Gondwana symposium. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, 321-341. It is thought that the geographical range of the Clarens Formation was much greater millions of years ago, covering most of southern Africa in a vast sand dune environment which stretched out from the main Karoo Basin westwards into Namibia and into Zimbabwe in the northeast.Meiklejohn, K.I., 1997. The role of moisture in the weathering of the Clarens Formation of the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg: implications for the preservation of indigenous rock art. South African Geographical Journal, 79, pp.199-206. There has been very little recent research undertaken on Clarens Formation,Beukes, N.J., 1969.

Unpublished MSc thesis, University of the Orange Free State,Bloemfontein, 138pp. [Online] Available at http://hdl.handle.net/11660/7671 but overall, due to the dominant nature of the sandstones, the Clarens Formation is considered to have been deposited in an arid climate where dune fields were abundant.Eriksson, P.G., 1981. A palaeoenvironmental analysis of the Clarens Formationin the Natal Drakensberg. Transactions of the Geological Society of SouthAfrica, 84, 7-17.Eriksson, P.G., 1986. Aeolian dune and alluvial fan deposits in the Clarens Formation of the Natal Drakensberg. Transactions of the Geological Societyof South Africa, 89, 389-393. The Clarens Formation deposits have been categorized into three notable sedimentary facies. These are laid out below: * Basal Zone 1: This facies is located in the lower or older sections of the Clarens Formation, and always have eroded bases at their contact with the underlying Upper Elliot Formation (UEF). The sandstones in this facies zones are thickly-bedded, massive, are fine-grained and are silt-rich. Minor mudstone lenses are also found within the sandstone layers and often exhibit desiccation cracks. These are interbedded with lenticular sandstones that contain various ripple structures, calcareous concretions and clay-pellet conglomerates. These have been interpreted as loess deposits. Various trace fossils are found in the mudstone layers of the Basal Zone 1. * Middle Zone 2: The middle section of the Clarens Formation exhibit either massive or large-scale planar or cross trough bedding structures, and in some instances minor herringbone cross bedding. The sandstones are well sorted and the grain size is coarser than that found in the lower deposits. The sandstones from this facies and up are composed either of quartz arenites or greywackes. Scour and fill structures, and scour marks are also commonly observed in the upper sandstone deposits. These sedimentary facies have been interpreted as preserved sheet flood and ephemeral stream deposits, as well as playa lakes that were formed in a proper desert environment. * Upper Zone 3: In the upper sections of the Clarens Formation, silty sandstones reappear which grade laterally into fine-grained, massive, and immature sandstone beds. These massive sandstones contain quartz- rich feldspathic wackes and subordinate arkosic arenites. Other minerals identified - which are found in all sandstones across the entire Clarens Formation - are zircons, garnets, agates, riebeckite, spinel, sphene, and hornblende. Thin, lenticular sandstones also reappear in the uppermost Clarens Formation, as do ripple marks and clay-pellet conglomerates, which reveals that the environment where these sedimentary rocks were formed was similar or the same as that of Basal Zone 1. Minor basalts begin to appear in the uppermost sections of the Clarens Formation which are interpreted as the commencement of the magmatic activity associated with the Drakensberg Group. The appearance of the basalts signals the termination of the sedimentation of the Karoo Basin. Extremely rare occurrences of shallow water structures have been found in the basaltic deposits.  Palaeontology  Paleontological finds of the Clarens Formation are less common than the underlying Upper Elliot Formation (UEF), but this is likely not a true reflection of the species diversity that was present at the time of deposition. Fossils are more well known from its lower facies zones, however, no systematic biostratigraphic mapping of the Clarens Formation has been undertaken to date. This is partly due to the fact that the uppermost sections of the Clarens Formation are difficult and dangerous to access due to these deposits forming steep cliffs. Nevertheless, various vertebrate and invertebrate fossils have been recovered from its lower sections.Bordy, E.M., Bumby, A.J., Catuneanu, O. and Eriksson, P.G., 2004. Advanced early Jurassic termite (Insecta: Isoptera) nests: evidence from the Clarens Formation in the Tuli Basin, southern Africa. Palaios, 19(1), pp.68-78. Vertebrate fossil material generally comprises dis- articulated or isolated bone material of various theropod, sauropodomorph, and ornithischian dinosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and cynodont therapsids.Sues, H.D., Reisz, R.R., Hinic, S. and Raath, M.A., 2004. On the skull of Massospondylus carinatus Owen, 1854 (Dinosauria: Sauropodomorpha) from the Elliot and Clarens formations (Lower Jurassic) of South Africa. Annals of Carnegie Museum, 73(4), pp.239-257. Freshwater fish fossils such as that of Semionotus capensis, and crustaceans have been found in the playa lake facies deposits. The Clarens Formation is also well known for its numerous preserved dinosaur trackways of both large and small theropods, and also of small ornithischian dinosaurs. Petrified wood fragments, rhizoliths, coprolites, and planolites burrows have also been found.Kitching, J.W., 1979. Preliminary report on a clutch of six dinosaurian eggs from the Upper Triassic Elliot Formation, Northern Orange Free State.  Correlation  The Clarens Formation corresponds with numerous localities in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is currently considered to correlate in age with the Forest Sandstone of Zimbabwe, the Bodibeng Sandstone in the Tuli Basin of Botswana, and the Etjo Sandstone of Namibia. In South Africa, equivalent sedimentary facies to the Clarens Formation are present in the Lebombo Belt, north of Eswatini.

Ecology A group of rock lobsters on a reef Generally found on rocky reefs, where it prefers the shelter of crevices. Often seen in groups with antennae protruding from the shelter. Swims backward in emergencies using the tail, but generally crawls around on the reef. Its predators include seals, sharks and large fish. It is susceptible to low oxygen levels in the water which may cause mass strandings.. =Feeding= Jasus lalandii is a generalist predator and scavenger of mussels, sea urchins, abalone, barnacles, among other thing. When both abalone and sea urchins are available, rock lobsters preferentially feed on abalone. Which could be due to the higher calorific value of the sea urchins. In its choice for sea snails it selects prey below the critical size as attacking these prey is likely to involve the least risk. Small prey sea snails are opened by cracking the whole shell, while larger individuals are cracked sequentially by chipping parts of the shell until the muscular foot can be extracted. This indicates that overall J. lalandii optimizes the energetic returns from feeding while minimizing the risk involved. Fishery Jasus lalandii may grow up to a total length of , with a carapace length of . It is widely caught for its meat, with over 6,500 t being caught annually in lobster pots and hoop nets. In order to prevent overfishing, individual fishing quotas are allocated by the Republic of South Africa to fishermen and companies, totalling 1,700 t. There is also a closed season from 1 June to 15 November, a size limit of 80 mm (carapace length) and a ban on catching ovigerous females (females which are brooding their eggs).

A later play presented by the National Theatre recounts how these music hall stars rescued the song from their rejects pile and re-scored it to win a wartime competition for a marching song. It became very popular, boosting British morale despite the horrors of that war. It was one of a large number of music hall songs aimed at maintaining morale, recruiting for the forces, or defending Britain's war aims. Another of these songs, \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\", was so similar in musical structure that the two were sometimes sung side by side. Lyrics The song is best remembered for its chorus: :Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag :And smile, smile, smile, :While you've a lucifer to light your fag, :Smile, boys, that's the style. :What's the use of worrying? :It never was worth while :So pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag :And smile, smile, smile. In other languages The Dutch version goes: :Pak al je zorgen in je plunjezak en fluit, fluit, fluit! :Aan alle moeilijkheden heb je lak, fluit man en 't is uit! :Waarom zou je treuren, het helpt je niet vooruit, :Dus: pak al je zorgen in je plunjezak en fluit, fluit, fluit. The Spanish version :¬°Guarda tus penas en el fondo del morral y r√≠e ya. :Ponte contento y as√≠ vencer√°s la dificultad. :Siempre estar√°s alegre, nunca triste estar√°s, ¬°no! [or ¬°jam√°s!] :¬°Guarda tus penas en el fondo del morral y r√≠e ya. The German version: :Weit ist der Weg zur√ºck ins Heimatland, so weit, so weit :Dort bei den Sternen √ºber'm Waldesrand liegt die alte Zeit :Jeder brave Musketier sehnt heimlich sich nach dir :Weit ist der Weg zur√ºck ins Heimatland, ja weit, so weit! The Norwegian translation \\"Legg dine s√∏rger i en gammel sekk\\" (possibly 1916) and the Swedish \\"L√§gg dina sorger i en gammal s√§ck\\" (1917) were by written by Karl-Ewert Christenson (1888‚Äì1965) and recorded by singer Ernst Rolf.  Other performances  Florrie Forde performed it throughout the United Kingdom in 1916. Other performers associated with this song include Helen Clark, Reinald Werrenrath, and Oscar Seagle. Cilla Black performed the song as a comedy/singing sketch on her variety television series Surprise Surprise. The original version was sampled in and inspired the song \\"Pack Up\\" by English musician Eliza Doolittle.  In film  The song appears in several films, including Varsity Show (1937 film) with Dick Powell Pack Up Your Troubles (1932) with Laurel & Hardy, High Pressure (1932), and The Shopworn Angel (1938). It is also featured in For Me and My Gal (1942) starring Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, and ‚ÄúOn Moonlight Bay‚Äù with Gordon MacRae and Doris Day (1951). The song also featured briefly in the 1979 film All That Jazz, sung between Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) and a hospital orderly. It was sung during a march in the 2010 film Private Peaceful, based on the book by Michael Morpurgo. The song is also played by Schroeder in \\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\\" and in an episode of \\"The Waltons\\" In the Rugrats episode Music, Chuckie sings this song.

Biography Peter, Paul, and Jerry met in the first grade at St. Matthew's Catholic school in Dorchester, Massachusetts. After eight years at St. Matthew's, each of their families moved from Dorchester to South Shore suburbs during while they were in high school. Paul started a band with lifelong friend T.K, singer Skag, guitarist Sam Babbitt, and drummer Joey Olsen. They called themselves the Savage Beasties. This band would be the starting point for future bands. T.K eventually moved to Boston on Thayer St., where he co-founded \\"Spearhead Go\\" along with Barry Hall, B.C Kagan and Joey Olsen. This accomplishment encouraged Paul to move to the Thayer St. loft along with his twin brother Pete. Paul, eager to pick up where the Beasties left off, enlisted his brother and longtime friend Jerry Lehane to start a band in Boston. Their good friend Dan Shannon played drums in this new band. The future Dogmatics would play their first and last show under the name \\"Guttersnipes\\" at their Thayer St. loft. Not happy with the \\"Guttersnipes\\" name, Pete thought that \\"Dogmatics\\" was more appropriate. The Dogmatics played their first show at Cantones in 1981. They were honored to open on a Tuesday night for no money. They continued to play throughout Boston for the next year with drummer Dan Shannon, who would leave the band for college. Squantum native Thomas Long, the 18-year-old celebrated drummer, would take over on sticks and the Dogs would be forever changed. The Dogmatics played anywhere they could get a gig in the United States. In 1984, the Dogmatics released their first and only single to date on their own label \\"Cat records\\": 'Gimme the Shakes' on the A-side and the Eddie Cochran classic \\"20 Flight Rock\\" on the B-side. This little know single garnered lots of local airplay on WMBR, WERS, and other local college radio stations. In 1985, the Dogmatics signed with Homestead Records and released their first album, \\"Thayer Street\\", one of the highest selling records to date on Homestead records. It immediately had an impact as the album made the cover of the College Music Journal. This exposure dramatically increased the much need attention to the band and with the help of management, and a real booking agent they began touring throughout the United States playing with the Replacements, Young Fresh Fellows, Los Lobos, The Bangles, The Fleshtones, Dash Rip Rock, Del Fuegos, Scruffy the Cat, Dinosaur Jr., Hoodu Gurus, Long Ryders, Forgotten Rebels, Lyres, and Neats. Their second LP, Everybody Does It recorded in the summer of 1985 was delivered to Homestead Records in December. It would not see the light of day until June 1986. Gerad Cosley, the new president of Homestead Records buried the band with delay after delay. This fact is not lost on the band to this day. The singles \\"Teenager on Drugs\\" and Teenage Girls\\" were released on the Mr. Beautiful and Rock Turns to Stone compilations, respectively.

The game is based in an American natural history museum and aims to teach the player many aspects of history such as technology, geology, space, American history, and prehistory. PC Magazine described the game as having kids learn about educational topics (i.e. ecology) while making logical deductions in a series sequence and solving puzzles. Plot The player (at right, with red cap) and MICK listening to an animatronic historical character in the Salem Witch Trials exhibit (DOS version.)The game starts in the bedroom of an American high school teenage boy who is seated at his computer, attempting to access the National Museum Interactive Service System, only to see that it is offline for repair. An interactive robot from the museum named MICK (Museum Interactive Computer Kiosk) appears onscreen and talks to the boy, explaining that the museum is in danger of losing its secrets forever. The boy appears to have an extraordinary relationship with MICK as he alone understands that MICK can talk back to him, which he uses to learn more about the contents of the museum. MICK recognizes this understanding and thus asks the boy for help to save the museum. MICK explains that the exhibits have come to life and are acting very strangely. He announces his suspicion that a virus has infected the system while the museum was being converted to complete autonomous computer control. The player takes the role of the boy and enters the museum. Through the game, the boy visits each of the exhibits, solving mysteries and puzzles by talking to the historical characters, rearranging objects, trading objects with characters and generally putting things back the way they were. The game is educationally-based, and the player learns both from the many museum-like information cards placed throughout the exhibits, as well as from solving the problems in the exhibits themselves. Along the way, the boy is aided by MICK, who follows him through the exhibits, instructs him and gives additional help and advice on request. Once the 25 exhibits are restored, the virus itself must be destroyed, which is the final puzzle to be solved. Exhibits and objectives The exhibits in the museum, which can be entered by clicking a box on the map in the Main Hall, and can be revisited if not completed (the user can exit an exhibit at any time and return later), are shown by the map to be split into five sections: *Robots: An out-of-control robot has built itself with stolen parts from the machines in the exhibit, which must be returned. *Computer Technology: The exhibit computer's circuits are messed up, and must be repaired. *Discovery of Radio: The protagonist must help Guglielmo Marconi, Heinrich Hertz, Alexander Graham Bell and Reginald Fessenden with their experiments so they can share their devices and invent the radio. *Energy Technology: The energy sources (polluting and non- polluting) are out of balance, and must be restored to their right values to save the exhibit's ecology. *Simple Machines: An animatronic kangaroo is stuck on a high shelf after destroying the exhibit's machines, and the protagonist must fix them in order to rescue the kangaroo. *How Big is the Universe? *The Solar System: Five stars in the exhibit are out of place, and must be returned to their right positions. *Rockets and Computers *Air-Powered Flight: The giant fan in the exhibit has blown all the aircraft away, including the airship, so the protagonist must clean up the mess and put everything in their right places. *Wright Brothers: The Wright Brothers are having trouble inventing the airplane, so the protagonist must help them. *Transcontinental Railroad *Salem Witch Trials: The virus has deleted the proof that Sarah Good, who has been convicted of witchcraft, did not create three specters the other women of Salem Village have seen, so the protagonist must prove it himself. *American Revolutionary War: The virus has scrambled the animatronic George Washington's memories, causing him to support the British oppression instead. The protagonist must find the various documents to convince him otherwise. *Ellis Island: The protagonist is put into the role of the immigrants and must successfully reach the U.S. as well as pass his inspection at Ellis island. *Louisiana Purchase *Hall of Dinosaurs: The virus has infected the exhibit's assembly computer, scrambling the dinosaur skeletons, so the protagonist must re-assemble them properly. *Ocean Life: The protagonist must fix a leaking sewage pipe to restore the exhibit's marine life. *Hall of Animal Habitats: The animals are missing from their respective habitats and must be returned. *Hall of Ecology *The Earth's Geology *Prehistoric People: The animatronic woolly mammoth has escaped from its pen, and the protagonist must get the cave people to help lure it back. *The Development of Writing: the protagonist must collect notes from all the writing in the exhibit to help a scribe translate a message left to him by his master. *Knights, Heraldry and Jousting *Galileo's Telescope: Galileo is missing the components of his telescope, so the protagonist has to gather them from the rest of the exhibit. *Industrial Revolution Order of gameplay The player begins by entering the museum through the basement, working out the basement door's passcode. The player navigates the way into the Main Hall of the museum by a series of numbered doors with corresponding keys which are to be located in the maze of the basement (this introductory location can be skipped if desired). Once in the Main Hall, the player must locate some batteries to power MICK, which can be found in one of the museum tour tape players. Additionally, the map of the museum on the wall in the Main Hall is found to be in pieces and needs to be reconstructed in order to continue. Then the player must choose an exhibit to try to repair, using the museum's map to select one. After attempting to repair an exhibit, the player is returned to the Main Hall to select another exhibit. Not until every single one of the exhibits has been returned to normal can the player progress in the game. When each of the exhibits have been restored, the player returns to the Main Hall to find MICK missing and a cassette tape in his place on the floor. Using one of the museum tape players from which the batteries used to power MICK were borrowed, the player can listen to the tape (shown as on-screen text), which consists of a message from MICK warning the player to go home; the player decides to follow MICK into the basement and finds him in pieces on a bench in the workshop. Upon reassembling MICK, the player must then access the computer to try to stop the virus by answering general knowledge questions. If the player is successful, the virus self-destructs and the museum is saved, and the game is complete.

Family background Enock was born on February 27, 1857, in London, England to Richard and Elizabeth (Hill) Turnock. His father made several trips to America and in 1871 moved his family on the Cuba. They arrived in New York City after several weeks at sea. After visiting with friends and relatives, they settled in Elkhart, Indiana in 1872. Enock Hill attended grammar schools in Elkhart as well as high school at the age of 15. It was once explained by Mrs. E.H. Turnock Jr., the origin of the spelling of Enock with a ‚Äúk‚Äù rather than the common spelling with an ‚Äúh‚Äù, she said, ‚ÄúI have been told, that the London family had a son Enoch who died in infancy, but the parents like the name, and named their next son Enock, to distinguish him in family records. Enock was mostly known as E. Hill but his brothers called him ‚ÄòNock‚Äô.‚Äù E. Hill Turnock spent his early years in Elkhart, Indiana where he accepted employment with the Lakeshore railroad. Early career Here he worked his way up to head pattern maker. His inclinations and his early talents indicated his career for him when a young man. Part of his training was acquired in the Art Institute of Chicago, and for nine years he was with the noted Chicago architect, William Le Baron Jenney. Afterwards, he established his own firm in Chicago until 1907, when he returned to Elkhart, Indiana. Influences *W.L.B. Jenney *Henry Hobson Richardson *Louis Sullivan *Daniel H. Burnham These architects were among the most influential American architects in the later 19th and early 20th centuries. Later years When Enock Hill Turnock returned to Elkhart he opened his own architectural firm where he designed many finer buildings which included homes, factories, and public buildings. Some of these buildings included the Elkhart City Hall, Elkhart General Hospital, Elkhart High School, the Elkhart Masonic Temple, Elkhart Public Library, a Presbyterian Church, Christian Science Church, the YWCA building, and the Water Company building. Turnock's other structures include the A.R. Beardsley Mausoleum in the Grace Lawn cemetery, the Rice Cemetery office, and many residential homes located throughout the city of Elkhart. On the other hand, the most recognized and famous home built in Elkhart is the Ruthmere, which was originally built for Mr. and Mrs. A.R. Beardsley. Turnock was a member of the Tyrian and Royal Lodge of Masons, Christiana Country Club, Atherton Club, the old Century Club, and the American Institute of Architects. He also served as the first president of the Indiana Society of Architects. Enock Hill Turnock was honored with a fellowship in the American Institute of Architects. Turnock received the only honorary member of the state association for the Indiana Society of Architects. For some undetermined time Enock Hill Turnock had been ill with kidney troubles. He spent approximately seven months at the Mayo Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota before returning to Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Enock Hill Turnock and his wife returned to Ft. Wayne to live with his wife's two sisters. Enock Hill Turnock died with kidney trouble approximately two months after returning home from the Mayo Hospital. Enoch Hill Turnock designed many upscale residential homes, finer buildings, churches and businesses in Chicago, Illinois; Elkhart, Indiana; and surrounding cities. An extensive list of structures credited to E. Hill Turnock as well as a listing of all structures believed to be designed by Turnock, but not verified, can found at the Robert B. Beardsley Arts Reference Library at Ruthmere Museum in Elkhart. Work Following is a list of notable properties created by Enoch Hill Turnock. *Brewster Apartments, Chicago, Illinois. Formerly known as Lincoln Park Palace. :Built in 1893, this building was constructed with dark masonry polished Jasper walls that gave way to an airy interior distinguished by spacious cast-iron stairways, open elevator cages, glass blocks embedded in walkways and a massive skylight. *Ruthmere Mansion, Elkhart, Indiana. Formerly Albert and Elizabeth Beardsley Residence. :Built in 1910, this three story mansion built in Beaux Art style is Elkhart's most prominent historical residence. Refurbished in the early 1970s, the Ruthmere Mansion is now open to the public as a museum home. *Havilah Beardsley Memorial, Elkhart, Indiana. :Located a short distance from the former Beardsley Residence is a monument designed by E. Hill Turnock and dedicated to Havilah Beardsley, the area's first doctor, and the founder of the City of Elkhart. It was commissioned by his nephew A.R. Beardsley. Turnock's influence is easily recognized by the large stone flower bowls which border the monument.

Among his most prominent books are The Character of Egypt, Studies of the Arab World, and The Contemporary Islamic World Geography, which form a trilogy on Egypt's natural, economic, political and cultural character and its position in the world. Birth Hamdan was born in the Qalyubia Governorate on February 4, 1928. His father, a teacher of Arabic language, had been discharged from Al Azhar University educational institution on charges of participating in demonstrations in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. Education At the age of eight, he joined the primary school. He then moved to the prestigious Tawfiqiyya secondary school, which had a nationwide fame for its high educational standard and sports facilities. There, he became aware of his love and innate talent for geography. Having completed his secondary education in 1944, with distinction, ranking sixth on the list of graduates nationwide, he joined the Department of Geography at the Cairo University. Faculty of Arts. At the age of twenty, he obtained his B.A. with Distinction. He was soon appointed a staff member at Faculty of Arts, where he was granted a scholarship at the University of Reading, UK to obtain his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. There, he was a student of the eminent English geographer, professor Austen Miller. Major viewpoints and thoughts Hamdan‚Äôs intellectual and geographical achievements constituted the most important accomplishment of the Egyptian geographical school, that stresses Egypt‚Äôs uniqueness and singularity in terms of time and place, of geography and history. In his works, he adopted a multi-disciplinary approach, encompassing geography, history, sociology, politics and culture. Hamdan‚Äôs writings clearly manifested a unique wealth of knowledge, an immense power of meditation and observation and a distinct, devoted love of Egypt. His was the connoisseur‚Äôs love of the components of a unique gem. Utilizing these exceptional resources, Hamdan could delineate and interpret the Egyptian personality as influenced by location and geographical considerations. Major works Hamdan left behind a rich legacy of writing in both Arabic and English languages, including seventeen books in Arabic and eight in English, in addition to several articles in Arabic, published in newspapers, magazines and other publications. It is worthy of note that he had a futuristic outlook in his writings. He predicted several events, which, he thought, were compatible or incompatible with the facts of geography. Chief of these was his prediction of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. His encyclopedic work The Personality of Egypt, the most outstanding of his intellectual achievements, was the product of ten years of dedicated efforts, during which time he used 245 Arabic language and 691 foreign reference books in several languages. In this prestigious book, he elaborately expounded the constituent factors making-up the Egyptian personality since the early days of the Pharaohs. To him, Egypt was the central chapter of the book of geography, that turned into the opening chapter of the book of history, maintaining all through a coherent civilization across history. Egypt, to Hamdan was a unique unrepetitive geographical anomaly. Apart from the ‚ÄúDescription of Egypt‚Äù, which appeared in print during the French Expedition to Egypt, this book remains an unprecedented scientific masterpiece on Egypt. Main prizes and merit awards Dr. Gamal Hamdan won several scientific prizes and merit awards including: State Incentive Prize for Arts and Letters, 1959. State Merit Prize for Social Science, 1986. Scientific Criticism Award, by the State of Kuwait, 1986. Order of Merit of the First Class for Science and Arts, 1988. In line with his full dedication to science and his almost ascetic attitude to formalities, he refused to break up with his self-imposed solitude. Apart from the first prize awarded to him in 1959, he refused to receive any of the other prizes. Hamdan died on April 17, 1993. His works had a far-reaching impact on the entire field of social sciences that was almost tantamount to a revolution in geography. With his unique literary style, Dr. Hamdan turned the science of geography into a universal, encyclopedic social science. Taking geography as an access road to other branches, he skilfully used this multi-disciplinary approach to study Egypt‚Äôs location, history, culture and future.

Boston Red Sox (1959‚Äì1965) On December 2, 1958, the Indians received Jimmy Piersall from the Red Sox for Geiger and veteran slugger Vic Wertz (no money was involved) after Geiger had hit .231 in 91 games as a 21-year-old Cleveland rookie.\\"Indians Obtain Piersall From Red Sox and Send Avila to Orioles in Trades.\\", New York Times, December 3, 1958, Page 48.\\"Piersall Goes to Indians in Wertz Trade\\", Los Angeles Times, December 3, 1958, Page C1. In late March 1959, late in spring training, Geiger collided with teammate (shortstop) Don Buddin chasing a foul ball in left field, in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was knocked unconscious and severely bruised.\\"Gary Geiger Injured As Bosox Beat Tribe\\", Washington Post and Times Herald, March 31, 1959, Page A21. But he recovered to play left field later that year.\\"This Morning...With Shirley Povich\\", Washington Post and Times Herald, August 24, 1959, Page C3. On July 29, 1960, he was operated on for a collapsed lung at Sancta Maria Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\\"Geiger Improved\\", Los Angeles Times, July 31, 1960, Page G3. and was advised to rest fully afterwards.\\"Sports Datelines\\", Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1960, Page C2.

Geiger's Topps 1961 baseball card was featured in the 2000 film Skipped Parts as part of a baby's mobile at the end of the film. In March 1961, during spring training, Geiger made a game-saving catch in Palm Springs, California for the Red Sox against the new expansion Los Angeles Angels, robbing Julio B√©cquer of a sure double in deep right center field in an 8‚Äì7 Boston win. Earlier in the game, he had collected three hits and scored three runs.\\"Angels Lose To Red Sox in Ninth, 8-7\\", Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1961, Page C1. Batting second and playing center field on April 17, 1961, early in the regular season, he hit a game-winning home run into the Fenway Park right field bullpen in the 7th inning of a 3-2 Boston win over the Angels.\\"Red Sox Triumph Over Angels, 3-2\\", New York Times, April 18, 1961, Page 46. But then he dropped a fly ball hit by Brooks Robinson with two outs in the 9th inning of a 5‚Äì4 Red Sox loss to the Baltimore Orioles on May 27. It should have been an easy catch, but Geiger bobbled it when he and two other Red Sox players tried to glove it. The error was the first by Boston in ten games. He had accounted for a Red Sox run in the 5th by doubling and scoring on a single by Wertz.\\"Geiger's Error Costly\\", New York Times, May 28, 1961, Page S2. He broke up what might have been a second consecutive shutout by 18-year-old $125,000 bonus baby Lew Krausse, Jr. on June 23 with a game- winning three-run home run in the 7th inning after a walk to Pete Runnels and an error on Chuck Schilling's sacrifice bunt. Krausse had pitched a 4-0 shutout of the Angels in his major league debut for the Kansas City Athletics the week before.\\"Red Sox Set Back Athletics, 5-4\\", New York Times, June 24, 1961, Page 13. Geiger and Jackie Jensen launched home runs in the late innings of a 9‚Äì4 Red Sox win over the new expansion Washington Senators on August 23.\\"Red Sox Rout Senators\\", New York Times, August 24, 1961, Page 33. In the second game of a doubleheader Geiger pinch-hit for Carroll Hardy, connecting for a triple off Cal McLish which scored Pumpsie Green to earn Boston a split with the Chicago White Sox.\\"White Sox Split at Boston\\", New York Times, September 27, 1961, Page 46. In November, it was reported that Geiger, Schilling and star pitcher Bill Monbouquette were likely to be lost to Boston for military service\\"Chief Yankee Foes Lose Top Talent\\", Los Angeles Times, November 2, 1961, Page C3. after Geiger had led the Red Sox with 18 home runs in 1961, but it didn't happen. (Catcher Jim Pagliaroni was 2nd with 16.)\\"The Bull Pen\\", Los Angeles Times, February 14, 1962, Page B3. On June 9, 1962, Geiger crashed directly into the center field wall at Fenway Park attempting to catch a Tito Francona drive as the Red Sox lost to his old team Cleveland in 13 innings. He ventured back on the dirt track and looked as if he were going to come up with the ball. He made a sudden leap for it but struck the wall, and the ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly to his knees and fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.\\"Geiger Hits Wall, Taken To Hospital\\", Washington Post, Times Herald, June 10, 1962, Page C2. On May 27, 1963, a recovered Geiger and shortstop Eddie Bressoud hit 8th-inning home runs against the Detroit Tigers in a 6‚Äì5 Boston win at Tiger Stadium.\\"Clutch Homers Salvage Split For Red Sox\\", Los Angeles Times, May 27, 1963, Page C4. But on February 27, 1964, Geiger underwent surgery for a bleeding ulcer at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis after having been stricken en route to training camp. Doctors advised him to remain in the hospital for 7‚Äì10 days before returning for spring training in Arizona.\\"Geiger Operated On for Bleeding Ulcer\\", February 25, 1964, Page B5. He was placed on the voluntary retired list at his own request on May 13, and was expected to be sidelined for at least 40 days.\\"Reds Purchase Reliever Duren From Phillies\\", Los Angeles Times, May 14, 1964, Page B7. He ended up taking the rest of 1964 off because of general fatigue, lack of stamina and an underweight and weakened constitution, but returned the next year. On June 8, 1965, he sustained a triple fracture of the left hand diving for a Tom McCraw double in the 8th inning of a game won by the White Sox 7‚Äì3, after racing in from deep center field and diving for the shallow fly ball. That October, the Red Sox sold him along with seven other players to their Triple-A affiliate Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League.\\"Red Sox Sell Gary Geiger\\", Washington Post, Times Herald, October 22, 1965, Page D1. Atlanta Braves (1966‚Äì1967), Houston Astros (1969‚Äì1970) In May 1966, the newly relocated Atlanta Braves were reportedly desperate for pitchers. Geiger, Rico Carty and Gene Oliver were outfielders mentioned as possible \\"trade bait\\".\\"Let It Be War\\", Los Angeles Times, May 22, 1966, Page G3. But Geiger was still with the Braves on July 28, 1967 when they rose to 3rd place in the National League. Filling in for an injured Mack Jones, he was a whiz in center field with a fine catch in the 6th inning to help the Braves out of a bases-loaded jam and then, the next inning, caught a fly ball against the fence.\\"It Only Hurts Atlanta's Aaron When He Doesn't Hit Solidly\\", Washington Post, Times Herald, July 29, 1967, Page E1.

He overcame his pronounced fear of flying, making every trip with the teams he played with, albeit reluctantly. According to his younger sister Linda and his lifelong friend Jack Shepard (quoted in another Internet article), he did so in a way that ultimately cost him his life, by \\"taking a few drinks\\" (Linda) or \\"getting drunk\\" (Shepard) before every flight. His inability to stop drinking led to his premature death of cirrhosis at 59.

History  The generic name Lasianthus is derived from the Greek lasios, \\"shaggy, velvety, hairy\\", and anthos, \\"flower\\".Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol. II). (see External links below). The genus was named by William Jack in 1823.Lasianthus in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below).William Jack. !823. Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 14:125. (See External links below). Some authors have recognized Dressleriopsis and Litosanthes as genera separate from Lasianthus. Dressleriopsis was sunk into Lasianthus in 1982. Litosanthes was erected by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1823. It was synonymized under Lasianthus in 1992.Mohan G. Gagnopadhyay and T. Chakrabarty. 1992. \\"A note on the status of Litosanthes Bl. (Rubiaceae)\\". Journal of Economic and Taxonomic Botany 16(2):337-338. DNA sequence analysis has not resolved the question of whether Litosanthes is nested within Lasianthus or separate from it.  Affinities  Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichostachys form the tribe Lasiantheae in the subfamily Rubioideae. Perama is related to this group and might be included within it.Long-Qian Xiao and Hua Zhu. 2007. \\"Paraphyly and phylogenetic relationships in Lasianthus (Rubiaceae) inferred from chloroplast rps16 data\\". Botanical Studies 48(2):227-232. (See External links below). Lasiantheae was formerly thought to be close to Psychotria, but is now known to be a basal clade in Rubioideae. It is sister to the large clade containing Coussarea, Psychotria, Spermacoce, and many other genera.Catarina Rydin, Kent Kainulainen, Sylvain G Razafimandimbison, Jenny E E Smedmark, and Birgitta Bremer. 2009. \\"Deep divergences in the coffee family and the systematic position of Acranthera\\". Plant Systematics and Evolution 278(1-2):101-123. Saprosma and Amaracarpus were traditionally thought to be close to Lasianthus. Saprosma is polyphyletic, with only part of it related to Lasianthus. Amaracarpus is close to Psychotria. The African genera Batopedina and Dirichletia have also been suggested as relatives of Lasianthus.  Taxonomy  Only one molecular phylogenetic study has sampled more than a few species from the tribe Lasiantheae. In that study, 11 species of Lasianthus were sampled, but few relationships were resolved. In 2012, a revision of the Malesian species divided Lasianthus into 3 sections, based on the following type species: L. section Stipulares (Lasianthus stipularis), L. section Lasianthus (Lasianthus cyanocarpus), and L. section Nudiflorae (Lasianthus blumeanus). They did not recognize L.section Pedunculatae (Lasianthus biermanii), which some previous authors had recognized. They considered it to be indistinguishable from L. section Lasianthus.

He was the younger brother of Leopold Wharton (1870‚Äì1927), who was also became a film director. In 1890, Wharton started in both the business side of the theater as well as acting in Dallas, Texas. He worked for a number of stock companies, including that of Augustin Daly until 1899, and then became a stage manager. In 1907, he visited Edison Studios and worked there until 1909. Over the next 3 years, he wrote and directed many screenplays for various studios including Essanay Studios. In 1912, the US government commissioned him to produce The Late Indian Wars, the first sevel-reel motion picture in America.

Plot When an office building collapses, House has to diagnose a young woman, Megan, who survived the disaster. Due to her injuries, Megan's only form of communication is blinking with one eye. House's first instinct is to break into Megan's home to look for clues, where he discovers her diary and deduces that she must be on antidepressants. However, the diagnosis fails as new symptoms continue to appear. To prove to House that he needs a team, Cuddy sends a memo out banning anyone in the hospital from assisting him in his diagnosis. When Cuddy finds a doctor working on a diagnosis House has made regarding Megan's possible alcoholism, she discovers House has sent out a second memo from her e-mail telling staff to ignore the first memo. House makes several startling revelations about the patient that surprise her boyfriend and mother. House states that she has had an abortion and apparently lied to her boyfriend about it. The patient is also a heavy drinker, something which shocks her family. House continues to give treatment based on the woman's condition and medical records, none of which work and her condition deteriorates. House realizes that the patient he has been treating has been getting the wrong medication because it is the wrong patient and wakes from her comatose state to ask her name. The woman struggles, but finally says \\"Liz\\". Liz is Megan's co-worker who worked in the same area of the office building that collapsed. Both have the same hair color and build and their faces were badly injured when the building collapsed, allowing them to be mistakenly identified by their families. The real Megan died elsewhere in the hospital with Liz's boyfriend by her side. Cuddy tells House that while he did solve the case, he would have solved it much earlier if his team was there. Cameron would not have accepted that a boyfriend knew so little about the love of his life, and when House diagnosed multiple conditions, Foreman would have worked hard to prove House wrong, while Chase would have worked harder to prove House right. House realizes the validity of Cuddy's point and decides to hire a new team. The episode ends with a close up of House strumming a small tune on his guitar, prepping his new recruits, who turn out to be a room of 40.

This is remarking on its major use for the Jewish ritual etrog during Sukkot.The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture, vol 2, by Liberty Hyde Bailey, 1914 It was also called pitima, or the cedro col pigolo (\\"citron with a pitom\\"), because of its usually persisting pitom (carpel). The last does not only enhance its character, but also adds Halachic promotion.  Description and illustration  \\"Cedro col Pigolo\\" - the citron with persisting carpel, was illustrated and described by Johann Christoph Volkamer in 1708, as the Jewish citron The following description is from the Nurenbergische Hesperides (2nd Volume; 8th Chap.) by Johann Christoph Volkamer, titled \\"About the Cedro col Pigolo\\". He was growing that kind in his botanical garden in Nuremberg, and writes that it can also be called the \\"Jewish Citron\\", since it is mostly used for the four species. This tree does not become particularly big. The leaves are smaller than those of other citrons, and serrated, oblong, pointed towards the front, mixed with many thorns. The bloom is small and reddish from outside. The fruit blossoms (- the carpels) are not less oblong from the beginning, appearing as reddish and dark-green; thereafter they turn entirely green, and when they ripen, straw-yellow, remaining, however, rather small all the time and never growing to a proper size, like other kinds of Citron. Such a fruit as the one shown in the illustration grew one year ago in my garden, and I hope to grow more of those. This fruit is pointed above and has at the top a small long distaff (- the pitom); it has a very pleasant smell, very like that of the Florentine citron described below. It contains very little juice and tastes somewhat sour and also somewhat bitter. As it seems, this plant thrives better in pots, than standing in the ground, for this tree of mine has remained very short in height, and its branches have not overgrown the [supporting] stalk.  Uses and cultivation  The variety was initially cultivated in towns near Corfu. The etrogim were under the hashgachah of the Corfu rabbis and were transported to Trieste by way of Corfu, and that is why Jews referred to this as the Corfu etrog. A citron tree in front of a private home in Naxos While citron trees are still found on Corfu, and in Naxos, the citron is no longer exported from Greece for the ritual purpose. The Crete citron growershttp://www.21food.com/showroom/47399/aboutus/cretan-citron-growers- association.html sell it for the candied peel, which is called succade, and in Naxos it is distilled into a special aromatic liqueur called kitron.The Citron in Naxos by Greek Travel * The Citron in Naxos * The Citron in the Mediterranean: A Study in Religious Influences by Erich Isaac * The history of the manners and customs of ancient Greece  Role as etrog  = Initial source = According to the Romaniotes this variety of citron was in their hands since the times of the Second Temple or earlier, and was always used by them for the religious ritual.by the Grand Rabbi of ◊®◊ê◊ì◊ñ◊ô◊ü, printed in the end of his work named ◊°◊ï◊ì ◊ô◊©◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊î\\"◊™ Afterwards it was appreciated by the Sephardim who settled in Italy,Shipped through Venice, Rabbi Daniel Tirni of Firenza (Florence, Italy) in his work named ◊¢◊ô◊ß◊®◊ô ◊î◊ì◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù Ikrei HaDinim (or haD\\"T), chapter 33.

Historically speaking, the citron is considered by numerous writers, to be introduced to Europe by the troops of Alexander.See Wikipedia Article on Citron It was also described by Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle as the curator of the Botanical garden in Athens.See Wikipedia Article on Citron = In Ashkenazi hands = When the Corfu etrogim started to be imported into the rest of Europe in 1785, the communities adherent through Ashkenazi tradition to the Genoese variety were very skeptical about it. The Ashkenazim assumed that since the Greek is so much different from the Genoese, it might have been grafted or hybridized.◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊û◊ê◊ô◊® ◊ë◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊î ◊î◊†◊ì◊§◊°◊™ ◊°◊ï◊£ ◊ê◊ï\\"◊ó * ◊ú◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ò◊ô ◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊ï◊™ ◊ó◊™◊ù ◊°◊ï◊§◊® ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊õ◊î At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Yanova Esrog was ceased due to the battles of Napoleon I of France, it really started to dominate the market. Rabbi Ephraim Zalman Margolis, in his responsa Bet Ephraim (volume 1;56), confirmed that at the time, none of the so-called Corfu etrogim were from grafted citron trees. He argued that, even if it could not be verified whether the plant was propagated by cuttings of grafted plants since the tradition lineage is missing, it should still be considered kosher. Therefore, he concluded that in case no nice, clean and kosher \\"Yanove Esrog\\" is to be found, the Corfu etrog may be used instead. This certification, as well as the lenient position of many other authorities, eventually opened doors for the permission of this etrog. = The new places = The seashore of Parga and its castle Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started claiming in 1846 that only those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed that under the previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga under the control of Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking. The local Sephardic rabbis in head of Judah Bibas, the Chief Rabbi of Corfu, kept arguing that all of them are kosher, and that not one grafted tree is to be in the regions of cultivation. Their position was supported by the great Rabbi Chaim Palagi the chief rabbi (Hakham Bashi) of ƒ∞zmir in neighboring Turkey. The dispute ended up with Rabbi Shlomo Kluger banning all sources including, those of Mintz, which were said to be from Parga, and Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathanson permitting all sources, if they bore a certification from the local rabbis.Cultural Geography ‚Äì Google Book Search * Commentary ‚Äì Google Book Search * ◊ô◊ú◊ß◊ï◊ò ◊§◊®◊ô ◊¢◊• ◊î◊ì◊® ◊ú◊ë◊ï◊ë ◊™◊®\\"◊ï * ◊©◊ï\\"◊™ ◊ú◊ë ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ó\\"◊ë ◊°◊ô◊û◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊õ◊ê-◊ß◊õ◊í * ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊ò◊¢◊ù ◊ï◊ì◊¢◊™ ◊û◊î◊ì◊ï\\"◊ß ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊ß◊¢◊ê * ◊©◊ï\\"◊û ◊û◊î◊ì◊ï\\"◊í ◊ó\\"◊ê ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊ß◊û◊ì = The monopoly and its break = Rabbi Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, a known opponent of the Corfu etrog This controversy did not significantly decrease the abundance of the Corfu. In 1875, they incorporated themselves into a cartel and drastically raised the price of each single etrog to six florins, assuming that the Jews would have no choice and pay the price. There was an underlying misconception, that there is a belief by the Jews that whoever doesn't reveal a Corfu etrog for Sukkot will not survive the next year. However, this was not the case. The rabbi of Kovno, Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, intended to stop this record-breaking monopoly, and banned the Corfu etrog until the prices would be lowered, and the status of kashrus clarified. Even the rabbi of Corfu certified in a letter that there were already many grafted trees in the region, and the certification process was very complex. The ban was further supported with signatures of many leading rabbis throughout Eastern Europe. The preferred etrog was now the Balady citron of Israel, which had just started being imported, and they regarded even the Corsican citron above the Corfu, while the most respected Genoese citron was very hard to get. Each Jewish etrog merchant committed himself to his local rabbi that he would not buy any etrog from the Greek farmers, since this would result in a record breaking expense for the Jewish community, which was impossible for them to pay. This was a great sacrifice from the local Jewry in Corfu, who went without income for the year. This act severely affected the Greek planters and dealers, who, left with high costs and no revenue, were forced to lower prices. = The blood libel and pogrom = Aron Kodesh in Corfu In the pre-Pesach season of 1891, an unidentified female body was found on a street neighboring the Jewish ghetto. The Greek etrog growers made a blood libel, accusing local Jews of the murder. The local Church officials on Corfu (as well as on the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood.The Greek Orthodox Church and the Holocaust by The University of Crete Similarly the Greek press played a role in publicizing the unfairness of the accusations. The culprits were never prosecuted, however. After several days of violence, a short investigation found that the victim was Sarda, a member of a famous Jewish family on the Corfu Island, who was killed in sexual violence. The discovery was too late for the total of 139 dead, and this composed the Jewish saying, \\"Rather should the etrog have a 'blatt-flaw', [a flaw similar to apple russet that is presumably caused by a scratch from a leaf, this was common in the different varieties of citron but not in the Greek] but not in any case a 'blood-flaw'\\", referring to the blood spilled in Corfu.HaZefira 1981 , Continuation , Call to ban the Corfu Etrog , more-1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 . *Mishpach Magazin: 12 Tishrei 5767 * Remember the Corfu Jews * Albert Cohen: Dissonant Voices * The Jewish Quarterly . * Antisemitism: Myth and Hate from Antiquity to the Present By Marvin Perry, Frederick M.

After World War II, some European Jews who had relocated to Israel or the United States still continued using the Greek for at least two decades. In 1956, Rabbi Yeshaye Gross, a Satmar from Brooklyn, proceeded to visit the orchards in Calabria, and found out that a large percentage of the trees are actually grafted. From then on he realized that no etrog could be picked off the tree without a careful inspection, which he was allowed and able to do. The Greek growers, in contrast, didn't let any Jewish merchants visit their orchards to inspect their trees, and only sold etrogs on Corfu. This forced many Satmars to switch back to the traditional Yanova citron, even not bearing a pitam. The cultivation of the Greek citron was thereafter on concentrated in Halki, Naxos where there is a small production for distillery. In those years, the Moroccan citron took place and appealed for both traditional purity without any history of grafting, and its bearing a persistent healthy pitam.◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊©◊¢◊ô◊î ◊ú◊î◊®◊ë ◊ô◊©◊¢◊ô◊î ◊í◊®◊ê◊° ◊û◊ë◊®◊ï◊ß◊ú◊ô◊ü * ◊ß◊ï◊†◊ò◊®◊° ◊ë◊ô◊®◊ï◊® ◊î◊¢◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ì◊ë◊® ◊î◊ê◊™◊®◊ï◊í◊ô◊ù ◊û◊ô◊ê◊†◊ê◊ï◊ï◊¢ ◊ú◊î◊†\\"◊ú * ◊ß◊ï◊†◊ò◊®◊° ◊§◊®◊ô ◊¢◊• ◊î◊ì◊®, ◊ê◊™◊®◊ï◊í◊ô ◊û◊ê◊®◊ê◊ß◊ê, ◊ú◊î◊®◊ë ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ì◊ï◊ì ◊î◊®◊§◊†◊° Still the Skverer rebbe manages to get annually one esrog from Corfu. The esrog is brought from Greece by Meyer Knoblach from New Square.  Introduction to Israel  At about 1850, Sir Moses Montefiore was instrumental in establishing etrog plantations in the Holy Land, in order to help the Jewish settlers to survive. As the Balady citron had little chance for success ‚Äì being not so great in shape, color etc., with a persistent style ratio as low as 1;1000 ‚Äì the Sephardic settlers, who were always positive about the Corfu, planted its seeds in the coastal region of Israel, especially in the vicinity of Jaffa. The transplantation was witnessed as kosher by the local Sephardic Rabbi Yehuda Halevi. An old specimen of the ordang type, whole, cut in length and in width Arab farmers imported cuttings from Greece, which they budded onto rootstock of the Palestinian sweet lime for cleansing diseases and for longer life. The Corfu variety, which they called kubbad abu nunia ('citron with persistent style'), did not acclimatize well in Israeli land, so growers started employing the grafting method on a large scale. The great scholar and kabballist Rabbi Aaron Ezrial of the Beit El Synagogue still certified some ungrafted citron orchards in Jaffa by eliminating the plants he found to be grafted. The Greek-Jaffa citron was also promoted by most of the Sephardic and even some Ashkenazic rabbis, who saw a great future in the beautiful and pitamed variety. The permission was based upon inspection of each and every tree prior to picking, just like it is practiced today in Calabria.◊ß◊ï◊†◊ò◊®◊° ◊§◊®◊ô ◊¢◊• ◊î◊ì◊® ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊™◊®◊ú\\"◊ó, ◊î◊©◊ï◊™◊§◊ô◊ù ◊°◊ú◊†◊ò In the following time, the Greek citron of Jaffa pushed the Balady citron off the market. The Jaffa Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook founded and headed the \\"Atzei Hadar\\" union for kosher etrog cultivators and marketers, to prevent grafting the Jaffa etrog unto rootstock of sour orange or sweet lime, but very much promoted intraspecific grafting of the Greek citron upon Balady citron rootstock,Igroth HaRaye, Vol. 1, Chap. 52,114. which is permitted by Halacha. The act led to the establishment of a beautiful variety in Israel, yet kosher, and saved the economy of Israel for decades. As of today it is the leading variety in Israel, and is a very important article in international trade.The Purdue University * The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture: Etrog = Suspicions = Grand Rabbi of Munkatch, Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira, author of Minhath Elazar Although the graft of Greek citron on Balady rootstock was a great idea from practical and Halachic views, it induced suspicion from customers who wondered why the Israeli citron was suddenly so beautiful with an erect pitam. Suspicion arose in Israel and in the diaspora, and many rumors spread. The late Grand Rabbi of Munkatch, Chaim Elazar Spira, was aware of the change. He speculated that it was the same problem continuously claimed against the Greek in their homeland Greece, namely to be grafted or bred with lemon, which renders it non-kosher.Responsa of Minhath Elazar Volume 3;77. This was not completely false, since those not supervised were grafted also onto bitter orange or limetta. Also, even with supervision it is very hard to detect the rootstock type, while not the same as the scion. Such skeptical views about the beautiful Greek-Israeli citron, were also expressed by the Rabbi Solomon Eliezer Alfandari,◊©◊ï\\"◊™ ◊°◊ë◊ê ◊ß◊ì◊ô◊©◊ê ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊ô◊ë-◊ô◊í and by the former chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Later an ungrafted tree was found in the backyard of a Shochet in Hadera with the name ordang. Today, most Hasidic communities in Israel, as well as in the diaspora, are using descendants of this strain while planted under rabbinical Hashgacha.

This is, the laurel forest habitat. The Tihue Growth best on well-drained, slightly acidic soils rich in organic matter. Description The tihue is a large ( up 30 m. tall to 2 m. diameter) evergreen, Laurel forest tree with smooth, pale yellow bark. The bark cracks when aging coming off in roughly circular plates. The wood and the leaves are strongly aromatic. The bright green leaves of the Chilean laurel are arranged in opposite pairs, and are oblong in shape, narrowed at the base. The leaves are leathery, shiny, and around 5 to 10 centimetres long and 2.5 to 5 centimetres wide. The serrated edges of the leaves help to distinguish this tree from the closely related Laureliopsis philippiana, which has more deeply toothed leaf margins. The tihue bears bundles of small yellow unisexual or hermaphrodite flowers. The fruit is a greenish achene with seeds bearing feathery anemophilous filaments. The seed is dispersed by the wind (anemochory). Cultivation and uses Its wood is pale-yellowish, with growth rings little notorious and homogeneous and fine texture. It is threatened by habitat loss.

One difference the B-5 had from radial engines of other manufacturers was that each individual cylinder had its own camshaft, a system also used by the contemporary Soviet- built, 8.6 litre-displacement Shvetsov M-11 five cylinder radial, while most other radial engine designs used a \\"cam ring\\" for the same purpose, connected to every cylinder's valves. The B-5 was a rough running but reliable engine. The B-5 and its derivatives were produced in the thousands, powering many World War II trainer aircraft; its military designation was R-440. The B-5 was followed by the R-5 and R-55.

Early life Ehlers was born on May 7, 1921, in Junction City, Kansas. Military service Ehlers joined the Army from the city of Manhattan, Kansas in October 1940.WWII Army Enlistment Records He and his older brother Roland served in the same unit and participated in the fighting in North Africa and Sicily. By D-Day on June 6, 1944, Ehlers was a staff sergeant and squad leader in the 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. His squad, part of the invasion's second wave, waited off shore in a Landing Craft, Infantry, while the first group of soldiers landed. When the first wave became pinned down on the beach, his unit was transferred to a Higgins boat and sent forward early to assist. They fought their way off the beach and by June 9 were near the town of Goville, inland. On that day, he led his unit's attack against German forces and single-handedly defeated several enemy machine gun nests. The next day the platoon came under heavy fire. Ehlers was wounded, but managed to cover the platoon's withdrawal; this included carrying a wounded automatic rifleman to safety and running back through enemy fire to retrieve his Browning Automatic Rifle. After treatment of his wounds, Ehlers refused to be evacuated and continued to lead his squad. For his actions he was awarded the Medal of Honor five months later on 11 December 1944. He was decorated at Paris in the office of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, Commanding General, Communications Zone, ETO. By this time Ehlers had received a battlefield commission to 2nd lieutenant. On July 14, more than a month after D-Day, Ehlers learned that his brother Roland had died at Omaha Beach when his landing craft was struck by a mortar shell. Later life Ehlers appeared in the 1955 film The Long Gray Line, starring Tyrone Power. He went on to work for the Veterans Administration, and as a security guard at Disneyland, California. Ehlers died on February 20, 2014 of kidney failure in Long Beach, California. He was 92 years old. He was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Ehlers' Medal of Honor is on display at the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana Personal life Ehlers has a wife who passed away in 2017, 3 children, and 11 grandchildren, all of whom are still living.

The diocese covers the department of Loz√®re. The diocese was already in existence in 314, since Genialis, a deacon of the Church of Gabalum (G√©vaudan), was present at the Council of Arles in that year.de civitate Gabalum provincia Aquitania. C. Munier, Concilia Galliae A. 314 ‚Äì A. 506 (Turnhout: Brepols 1963), p. 15 line 47; p. 16 line 39; p. 18 line 34; p. 21 line 34. Duchesne, p. 54. Louis Duchesne chooses to place the earliest known bishop, Privatus, before 314, though he points out that his date depends on a synchronicity with an invasion of Aquitaine by a band of German marauders under the leadership of King Chrocus; Chrocus' date is variously placed between the third and fifth century.Duchesne, p. 54, no. 1. The notion that a Saint Severianus was the first apostle of the Gevaudan, or that Privatus held the same honor, and that the whole country was converted to Christianity in one stroke,has long been exploded, by a demonstration that the legends are based on representations made to Pope Urban V in the 14th century to obtain indulgences.Gaydou, √âtudes critiques, pp. 3-16. The diocese of Mende was a suffragan of Bourges under the Ancien R√©gime. When it was re-established by the Concordat of 1801 it became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon and united with the department of Ard√®che, which however it lost again in 1822 by the creation of the Diocese of Viviers, at which point Mende became suffragan to Albi. On December 16, 2002, Mende was made a suffragan to Montpellier. The Bishop has his seat at the Cathedral Basilica of Notre Dame and St. Privat in Mende. Funds to begin the cathedral were supplied by Pope Urban V (1362‚Äì1370).The actual construction took place much later. Work began in 1364 and stopped in 1386; construction resumed in 1452, and the altar was consecrated on 2 August 1467. The works were completed under Bishop Clemente Grosso della Rovere (1483‚Äì1504). Pascal, pp. 114-120; 375-376. Before the French Revolution, the Cathedral Chapter consisted of a Praepositus (Provost), the Archdeacon and the Precentor (the dignities, dignit√©s) and fifteen canons. There were approximately 200 parishes, and one abbey.Gallia christiana I, pp. 85-86. In 2013, the diocese, which is mostly rural, had a total population of 78,400, of whom 77.6% were claimed as Roman Catholics. They are served by 76 priests, and there were 135 parishes.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy: Diocese of Mende. Retrieved: 2016-07-17. St Privatus, patron of the diocese History According to late legends belonging to the Limousin cycle relating to St. Martial, he passed through the territory of the Gabali (G√©vaudan) of which Mende is the capital, and appointed as its first bishop, St. Severian his disciple, about the beginning of the first century. The first bishop known to history is Saint Privatus, who according to Gregory of Tours, died in a grotto of Mount Mimmat, a victim of the ill treatment he suffered at the time of the invasion of the Alamanni under their King Chrocus. Gregory of Tours places this event about 260 (though Fredegarius puts the invasion of Chrocus at 407). Louis Duchesne, however, places the invasion of Chrocus and the death of St. Privatus at the beginning of the reign of Constantine, c. 312, perhaps before the Council of Arles. It is certain that there was an organized church in the country of the Gabali from about 314, since in that year it was represented at the Council of Arles.Carolus Munier, Concilia Galliae, A. 314 ‚Äì A. 506 (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 15 line 47: Genialis diaconus de civitate Gabalum provincia Aquitanica. Other bishops of the Gabali, who doubtless resided at Javoulx, near Mende, were: Hilarius, present at the Council of Auvergne (Clermont) in 535,Carolus De Clercq, Concilia Galliae, A. 511 ‚Äì A. 695 (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 111 line 7: Helarius...episcopus ecclesiae Gaualetanae. and founder of the monastery of Canourgue, and whose personality has been wrongly described in certain traditions concerning Saint Illier ; and St. Fr√©zal of Canourgue (ninth century), assassinated, it is said, under Louis le D√©bonnaire. Towards the year 1000 Mende became the seat of the bishopric. Under Bishop Aldebert de Tournel (1151‚Äì1186), Pope Alexander III passed some days at Mende in the last two weeks of July 1162.P. Jaffe and G. Wattenbach, Regesta pontificum Romanorum Tomus II (Leipzig 1888), p. 160. Bishop Aldebert wrote two works, on the passion and on the miracles of St. Privatus whose relics were discovered at Mende in 1170.L√©opold Delisle has noted the historical interest of these two works for the early history of the Third Estate in the G√©vaudan. L√©opold Delisle, \\"Un manuscrit de la cath√©drale de Mende, perdu et retrouv√©,\\" in Journal des Savants (Octobre 1908), pp. 505-512. Bishop Adalbert's most noteworthy achievement, however, was his negotiation of an act of fealty with King Louis VII of France, sometimes called the 'golden bull' or act of par√©age of 1166.G. de Burdin, I, p. 7 note 1, points out that the original bull does not survive, and there is no proof that a golden bull was ever attached. King Louis noted that it was the first time that a bishop of G√©vaudan had ever made his submission to a king of France. He also recognized the powers of the bishop, not only in the spiritual sphere, but also ad iudicandum in gladio (judging with the sword), and stated that the agreement in no way was to be taken to diminish the privileges already enjoyed by the bishops. The King surrendered to the bishop and his successors all the regalian rights with reference to his crown.G. de Burdin, I, p. 8. In 1278, under Bishop Stephanus (III), the Dominicans established a convent in Maru√©jols, in the diocese of Mende.Gallia christiana I, p. 93. Pascal, p. 205. The city of Mende was not important enough to become the capital of the G√©vaudan until the act of par√©age of King Philip IV of 3 February 1307, which granted the bishops the title of Count and the high Seigneurie of G√©vaudan. This act increased their temporal authority and brought the submission of all of the seigneurs of the region.A. Martin, p. 4. Gallia christiana I, p. 96. =Estates of G√©vaudan= The territory of Lod√®ve had its own Estates from an early period, and it retained it even after it became part of the Estates of Languedoc in the fourteenth century. The Bishop of Mende was the President of the Estates of G√©vaudan; the First Estate (clergy) were represented by a Canon of the Cathedral (representing the Chapter), the Dom d'Aubrac, the Prior of Saint-Enemie, the Prior of Langogne, the Abbot of Chambons, the Commander of Palhers, and the Commander of Saint-Jean. The Second Estate (nobility) were represented by the eight Barons who were Peers of G√©vaudon (d'Apchier, de Peyre, de Cenaret, du Tournel, de Randon, de Florac, de Mercoeur, de Canilhac), twelve gentlemen (the Seigneurs d'Allene, de Montauroux, de Saint- Alban, de Montrodat, de Mirandol, de S√©verac, de Barre, de Gabriac, de Portes, de Servi√®res, d'Arpajon, and the Consuls of la Garde-Gu√©rin); the Third Estate were represented by the three Consuls of Mende, the three Consuls of Marvejols (when the meeting took place at Marvejols), and a Consul (or deputy) from each of sixteen communities. The Estates met annually, alternately at Mende and at Marvejols. The Estates opened with a procession from the Episcopal Palace to the Cathedral for a Mass of the Holy Spirit, and closed with a Te Deum and episcopal blessing.G. de Burdin, I, pp. 37-43. =Some individual bishops= Mende had later as bishops, Guillaume Durand (1285‚Äì1296), a Doctor of Laws (Bologna) and teacher of law at Modena, author of \\"Speculum juris\\", and of the \\"Rationale divinorum officiorum\\";Pascal, pp. 425‚Äì439, includes an analysis of the works. he was secretary of the Second Council of Lyon in 1274. His nephew, Durand le Jeune (1296‚Äì1328) who negotiated the \\"Par√©age\\" with King Philip, definitively settled the respective rights of king and bishop in the G√©vaudan; he left a work on the general councils and on the reform of abuses. Guillaume de Grimoard, born about 1310 at the castle of Grisac near Mende, the fief of his father Guillaume de Grimoard, Seigneur de Grisac, Bellegarde, and Montbel. He was sickly and deformed, but was restored at the prayer of his godfather, Elz√©ar de Sabran, who had come to baptise him. Magnan (p. 83) questions the miraculous story, pointing out that it does not appear in the extensive documentation for the canonization of Urban V. Elected pope in 1362 under the name of Urban V, he administered the Diocese of Mende himself from 1368 to 1370, since it had been left vacant by the transfer of his nephew to the See of Avignon. Among the bishops of Mende were: Pietro Riario (1473‚Äì1474), nephew of Sixtus IV and a cardinal; Giuliano della Rovere (1478‚Äì1483) later pope under the name of Julius II; and his nephews, Cardinal Clement della Rovere (1483‚Äì1504) and Francesco della Rovere (1504‚Äì1524). Urban II is said to have visited the Diocese of Mende in 1095, and to have had consecrated in his presence the church of the monastery of Saint Sauveur de Chirac or of Monastier, which had been founded in 1062 and was a dependency of the Abbey of Saint Victor in Marseille. There is no actual evidence for this story, which is retailed by local historians, and which is rejected by Jean-Baptiste- √âtienne Pascal.Pascal, Gabalum christianum, p. 76. =Plague and Protestants= In 1374 Mende was stricken by the plague, and of the 160 clerics attached to the cathedral in one capacity or another, eighty were killed. The epidemic returned in 1399 and again in 1435, and in 1460 the suffering lasted from June through mid-August. It returned in 1482, and in 1490 the Cathedral Chapter left the city of Mende for Marvejols, some seventeen miles to the west. On 21 April 1504 the Canons held a chapter meeting in an open field along the Lot River in order to avoid the plague. The plague returned in 1523 and 1532. In 1533 the Grand Archdeacon of Mende donated a considerable sum of money to build a small hospital for victims of the peste, outside the walls of the city, a project which was immediately carried out by the Consuls of the city. The Bishop of Mende cooperated by contributing a sum of money. In 1578, during the wars with the Huguenots, Mende suffered from another 'peste' which carried off 2,000 inhabitants.Martin, p. 9-11. Mende was captured for the first time by the Huguenots in 1562. The adventurer Mathieu Merle, a native of Uz√®s and leader of the Huguenots in G√©vaudan from 1573‚Äì81, led into the region bands of Protestants raised from among vagabonds in P√©rigord, Querci, and the Haut- Rouergue. They were masters of Mende for eighteen months in 1580 and 1581. They destroyed a great part of the cathedral that Urban V had caused to be rebuilt. In the village and Chateau de Serverette he and his band massacred twenty-four priests.L'Ouvreleul, p. 43. The Diocese of Mende was one of the regions where the insurrection of the Huguenot Camisards, peasants and rural craftsmen of the C√©vennes, broke out at the beginning of the eighteenth century and continued c. 1702 to 1710. In 1720 and 1721 the last of the great epidemics hit the G√©vaudan. At Mende 1061 died; at Marvejols 1800 persons died, out of a total population of 3500; in the parish of Canourgne 945 died.A. Martin, p. 12. In 1677 the city of Mende had around 5,000 inhabitants: Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 268 note 1. In 1767, the city of Mende claimed to have only around 2,000 inhabitants. Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 289 note 1. Cardinal Dominique de la Rochefoucauld, Archbishop of Rouen, who presided in 1789 over the last assembly of the clergy of France, was born in 1712 at Saint Ch√©ly d'Apcher, in the diocese. The chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756‚Äì1832), who attended the Coll√®ge de Mende and then Riez, was one of the last of those who profited by the scholarships founded by Urban V for twelve young students at Montpellier. =Revolution and Church of the Concordat (1789‚Äì1905)= In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decided to bring the French church under the control of the State. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called 'd√©partements', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. The Diocese of Mende found itself swept into the Constitutional Diocese of Loz√®re. Clergy would need to take an oath of allegiance to the State and its Constitution, specified by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and they would become salaried officials of the State. Both bishops and priests would be elected by special 'electors' in each department. This meant schism, since bishops would no longer need to be approved (preconised) by the Papacy; the transfer of bishops, likewise, which had formerly been the exclusive prerogative of the pope in canon law, would be the privilege of the State; the election of bishops no longer lay with the Cathedral Chapters (which were all abolished), or other responsible clergy, or the Pope, but with electors who did not even have to be Catholics or Christians. All monasteries, convents and religious orders in France were dissolved, and their members were released from their vows by order of the National Constituent Assembly (which was uncanonical); their property was confiscated \\"for the public good\\", and sold to pay the bills of the French government. Cathedral Chapters were also dissolved.Philippe Bourdin, \\"Coll√©giales et chapitres cath√©draux au crible de l'opinion et de la R√©volution,\\" Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise no. 331 (janvier/mars 2003), 29-55, at 29-30, 52-53. Since Bishop de Castellane refused to take the required oath, his throne was declared vacant by the French government. An election was therefore ordered, and the Electors of Loz√®re therefore assembled, or rather 157 of the 229 approved electors assembled on 20 March 1791. Next day there were only 148 electors, and in the evening only 124. 52 of the electors demanded changes in the oath that they would have to take which would protect the power of the Church in spiritual matters; when they were refused, they departed, leaving only 77 electors. On the third ballot on 22 March, √âtienne Nogaret, the sixty-five year old cur√© of the church of Canourgue, was elected. His election was certified by the Constitutional Metropolitan of the C√¥tes-de-la-M√©diterran√©e Charles-Beno√Æt Roux of Aix on 29 April, and he was consecrated in Paris on 8 May 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel. The consecration was valid, but it was also uncanonical, schismatic, and blasphemous. When Bishop de Castellane declined to leave the diocese or to vacate the Ch√¢teau de Chanac, Nogaret denounced him to the Minister of the Interior and the President of the Assembly. De Castellane was arrested and executed on 2 September 1792 at Versailles. Nogaret resigned his episcopal and priestly functions, due to age (he said), on 11 January 1794, during the Reign of Reason, and retired to a house in Canourgue. In 1800 he made an attempt to enter the cathedral, but was rebuffed by crowds of inhabitants of Mende. He was dismissed in 1801 and lived with his sister in Canourge until his death on 30 March 1804. He was unrepentant.Pisani, pp. 348-349. Napoleon, Pius VII, and the Concordat After the signing of the Concordat of 1801 with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, Pope Pius VII demanded the resignation of all bishops in France, in order to leave no doubt as to who was a legitimate bishop and who was a Constitutional imposter. He then immediately abolished all of the dioceses in France, for the same reason. Then he began to restore the old Ancien Regime dioceses, or most of them, though not with the same boundaries as before the Revolution. The diocese of Mende was revived by Pope Pius VII in his bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November 1801. On 11 April 1802, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte named Jean-Baptiste de Chabot as the new Bishop of Mende under the Concordat. Pius VII gave his consent on 1 May 1802.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 169 with note 3. Chabot had previously been Bishop of Saint-Claude, but he had been forced to flee France on 10 February 1791. He spent some time at Lugano, but then reentered his diocese toward the end of the Directory, in 1799, and attempted to reorganize diocesan operations. On 16 September 1801 he gave his resignation, as requested, and on 17 March 1802 his name was removed from the list of emigr√©s, and he was appointed Bishop of Mende. He immediately set to work to bring peace and order to the diocese of Mende, but, when the Constitutional Bishop Nogaret died on 30 March 1804 without having made a retraction or submission to the authority of Rome, Chabot's Vicar General advised against allowing the priests of the diocese to participate in Nogaret's funeral. An uproar from Nogaret's friends arose, and the Minister of Cults in Paris, Chaptal, demanded the resignation of the Vicar General. Rather than consent, Bishop Chabot resigned.S., in: L'episcopat fran√ßais..., p. 351. Bishop Jean-Antoine-Marie Foulquier (1849‚Äì1873) held three diocesan synods, in 1853‚Äì1855, to prepare the diocese of Mende to adopt the Roman rite in its liturgy. He participated in the First Vatican Council as a convinced supporter of papal infallibility. He obtained the canonical recognition of the cult of Blessed Urban V, a native son of the G√©vaudan.S., in: L'episcopat fran√ßais..., pp. 353-354. The end of the 19th century concordats between France and the Papacy came in 1905, with the Law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. This meant, among other things, the end of financial support on the part of the French government and all of its subdivisions of any religious group. An inventory was ordered of all places of worship that had received subsidies from the State, and all property not legally subject to a pious foundation was to be confiscated to the State. That was a violation of the Concordat of 1801. In addition the State demanded repayment of all loans and subsidies given the Churches during the term of the Concordat. On 11 February 1906, Pope Pius X responded with the encyclical Vehementer Nos, which condemned the Law of 1905 as a unilateral abrogation of the Concordat. He wrote, \\"That the State must be separated from the Church is a thesis absolutely false, a most pernicious error.\\"Ceslas B. Bourdin, \\"Church and State\\" in: Diplomatic relations were broken, and did not resume until 1921. Religious orders in the 19th century In the period between the signing of the Concordat of 1801 and the implementation of the Law of the Separation of the State and the Churches, there operated in the diocese of Mende five congregations of men. The Jesuits directed the Coll√®ge de Mende and the diocesan seminary (They were expelled in 1880). There were also the Fathers of the Sacred-Hearts (or of the Adoration), an order based in Paris; the Marists at Langogne; the Brothers of the Christian Schools at Mende, Meyrueis, Langogne, Malzieu, Canourge and Saint-Germain-du-Teil; and the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, at Maru√©jols, Saint-Chely-d'Apcher, Chanac, Ispagnac, Saint- Alban, Florac, Nasbinals and Serverette.Pascal, pp. 102-103. There were fourteen congregations of women. The Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary had a convent at Mende. The Sisters of the Visitation were located at Maru√©jols. The Sisters of Notre-Dame were established at Langogne. The Ursulines had convents at Chirac, Ispagnac, Qu√©zac, and Serverette. The Trinitarian Sisters had a hospital at Mende and a hospice at Langogne. The Daughters of Charity operated at Maru√©jols. The Sisters of Saint Vincent de Paul had a hospital asylum at Saint-Alban. The Dames de Saint Maur were established at Canourge. The Sisters of the Presentation had establishments in twelve locations, The Sisters of Saint Joseph had a house at Villefort. The Soeurs-Uni√©s had establishments at Mende, Maru√©jols, Chirac, Chanac, and Badaroux.Pascal, pp. 103-104. Nuns of a local origin included: the Sisters of Christian Unity (L'Union chr√©tienne), founded in 1696 (mother-house at Mende, school at Saint-Etienne-de-Vall√©e Fran√ßaise); the United Sisters of the Holy Family, founded at Palhers in 1750, transferred to Mende in 1824; the Sisters of Christian Doctrine (mother-house at Meyrueis) founded in 1837. The religious congregations in 1900 directed in the diocese fifteen infant schools, one orphan asylum for boys, four orphan asylums for girls, nine hospitals and almshouses, twelve religious houses for the care of those ill at home, and one psychiatric hospital. In 1905 at the end of the r√©gime of the Concordat, the diocese had 128,866 inhabitants, 26 parishes, 191 succursal churches,\\"succursus dicitur ecclesia quae alteri potiori auxilio est in administrandis plebei Christianae sacramentis.\\" C. du Fresne Du Cange, Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis, editio nova, Tomus septimus R-S (Niort: L. Favre 1886) p. 645 column 3, succursus (2). and 135 vicarages, supported by the state. =Saints of the diocese= The following saints are specially venerated in the diocese: St. Ilpide, martyr (third century); the preacher St. Veran, Bishop of Cavaillon, a native of G√©vaudan (sixth century); St. Lupentius, abbot of the basilica of St. Privatus, beheaded by order of Brunehaut whom he reproached for the irregularities of her life (sixth century); the nun St. Enimie, daughter of Clotaire II and sister of Dagobert (seventh century), foundress of a monastery of Benedictine nuns in the present St. Enimie. =Pilgrimages of the diocese= The principal pilgrimages of the diocese are: at Mende itself, Notre Dame de Mende where the statue of the Black Virgin was brought, perhaps in 1213, by the Crusaders of G√©vaudan, and the hermitage of Saint Privatus; Notre Dame de la Carce, the origin of the city of Marv√©jols; Notre Dame de Qu√©zac, a pilgrimage dating from 1052 and where Urban V founded a chapter-house of eight canons, and Our Lady All- powerful, at Langogne.

It has the closest beaches to Mexico City, and much of its economy is based on tourism, as it is only a four- or five-hour drive from the capital. It is the northern end of a tourist corridor along the Gulf of Mexico called the \\"Emerald Coast,\\" which extends down to the city of Veracruz. Tecolutla's biggest attraction is its natural settings of wetlands with estuaries, canals and mangroves associated with the river. The town is known for the \\"Tecolutla Monster,\\"‚Äîprobably a dead whale‚Äîthat was washed ashore in 1969. Its remains are kept at the Marine Museum. The name Tecolutla means \\"place of the tecolotes or owls.\\" Tourism The \\"lovers\\" intertwined trees Docks along a lagoon in Tecolutla The most important and growing economic activity in the zone is tourism. Tecolutla has the closest beaches to Mexico City. The town has about 15 km of beaches which face directly onto the Gulf of Mexico. (The municipality has a total of 40 km.) These beaches generally have gentle waves and warm water, except during storms called \\"nortes.\\" These are strong cold fronts that come down from the north along Mexico's Atlantic coast between December and February and can cause sudden drops in temperature and winds. This fickle weather keeps Tecolutla and many other Gulf coast communities from becoming major resort areas like Cancun. The oldest hotel is the Hotel Tecolutla, built in 1949, which has been preserved in its period. It used to be the only sizable building in town, but since the turn of the 21st century, numerous hotels have been developed. They generally cater to budget travelers from Mexico City, also attracting travelers from Xalapa, the state capital. This tourism is mainly concentrated during peak seasons, such as Christmas and Easter holidays, and special events such as the annual fishing tournament. During the rest of the year, it is fairly empty. The beaches of the town of Tecolutla divide into North and South beaches, each with their own hotel zones, restaurants, and camping areas. Both offer boat rides and bicycle paths. At the South Beach, where breakwaters protect the mouth of the Tecolutla River, there are also beachside cabins. Docks serve boat rides up the river, as well as fishing expeditions on the river and in the Gulf. A type of boat often used to navigate around the estuaries is called a panguita, which looks like a very long canoe. Cultural attractions include the Hueytepec archeological zone, the Parish of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe, the old lighthouse, the Hotel Tecolutla, the Municipal Palace and the Marine Museum, which contains an exposition of river and ocean products. This museum, located on Matamoros Street, is a space containing more than 300 aquatic species both alive and preserved. View of beach near the river The town also hosts a number of events. From April to September each year, the beach known as Vida Milenaria is reserved for sea turtles returning here to breed. This project is led by Fernando Manzano, better known here as \\"Pap√° Tortuga\\" (Daddy Turtle). This group hatches and frees between five and six thousand baby marine turtles each year. The returning turtles lay about this number of eggs which volunteers collect and protect. Tourist are invited to help free the baby turtles when they hatch. The annual fishing competition in May draws many visitors locally, from Mexico and even beyond. There are events for shad, sea bass and tarpon and take place both on the sea and on the Tecolutla River. This is one of the few times of the year the resort is packed. Another annual event is the Coconut Festival in February, when local restaurants and hotels get together to make \\"the world's largest coconut custard in the world.\\" In 2008, the dessert measured 2.15 by two meters, taking about 6,000 coconuts and two tons of sugar. After it is presented and measured, locals and tourists are invited to have some free. One notable nearby attraction is the El Taj√≠n archeological site, built by the same people who have inhabited this municipality, the Totonacs. Tecolutla is the closest beach to this site, which is about 40 km away. This was the most important ceremonial center in the area and it still host celebrations each year at the spring equinox. Geography and climate View from the kiosk in the main plaza However, Tecolutla's biggest attraction is its geography and climate. Situated on the Veracruz coast, Tecolutla has estuaries, canals and mangroves. These estuaries are at the mouth of the Tecolutla River which flows through the states of Puebla and Veracruz, with an extension of 7,950.05 km. It is surrounded by the Sierra de Huachinango to the east and the Sierra de Zocapoaxtla to the south. The river is fed by summer rains in the lower elevation and by year-round rains in the higher elevations. The river passes by a number of cities and towns such as Cuetzalan, Zacapoaxtla, Zapotitl√°n, Huauchinango, Taj√≠n, Tecuantepec, El Espinal, Papantla, Guti√©rrez Zamora, Cazones, Coatzintla, Chumatlan, Poza Rica, then finally to Tecolutla at its mouth. These estuaries have abundant vegetation and aquatic, and semi-aquatic wildlife such as crabs, lobsters, red snapper, shad, white and black herons and in the mangroves, two species of alligator. There are three estuaries that are visited most. The first is called Del Silencio, which has about five km of navigable waters and filled with mangroves. The name comes from the relative lack of sound, except for the buzzing of insects, and water dripping from trees. The second is called De la Cruz, with very clear waters, 25 km of navigable waters in which sea bass can be fished in season. The third is called Del Narajo and is the largest with 40 km of navigable waters and is bordered by ranches and orange groves. There is also an abundance of wild birds such as ibis, cormorants, parrots, guinea fowl, eagles, falcons, storks and others. The municipality has 40 km of beaches. For ten km north along the coast from Tecolutla are the most important beaches: Santa Mar√≠a del Mar and Barra Boca de Lima, which have warm waters with some motion. At Barra Boca de Lima is the Largartos Estuary. A bit further away (32 km) is Barra Tenixtepec, which is suitable for aquatic sports. Tecolutla is the beginning of a small tourist corridor which includes beaches such as La Guadalupe, La Vigueta, Playa Oriente, Monte Gordo, Casitas and Maracaibo. This area is known as the Costa Esmeralda because of the green ocean near the beaches, and many contain three and four star hotels, bungalows and trailer parks. History Tecolutla started as a pre-Hispanic settlement that had been dominated by a number of other peoples. The Tecolutla River was visited by Juan de Guijalva in 1518, three years before the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Colonial period for this area began in 1522, with the first Spanish settling here. This caused violent confrontations between the Spanish and the local people at first but eventually led a mixing and the native and the European, in culture, flora, fauna and economic activities. The old pagan ritual centers here were abandoned and have become archeological zones. In 1787, a major conflict over agricultural resources broke out when the native peoples and two Spaniards, Juan de Vidal and Joaquin Suarez over ownership of lands in Tecolutla and surrounding areas bordering the Tecolutla River. Much of this land had been inhabited by native peoples with no formal title. In 1810, the Mexican War of Independence began, with Serafin Olarte leading local efforts. In 1813, the ports of Tecolutla and Nautla are taken by insurgents and used to bring in arms. In 1814, the insurgents were driven out by the royalist army under Juan Navajero. In 1824, the state of Veracruz was created and Tecolutla became a community under the jurisdiction of the Papantla province. In 1825, the commercial port was constructed, which was blocked by the French during the Pastry War in 1838. In 1847, the U.S. frigate, Gemanten, anchored itself in Tecolutla as part of the initial phases of the invasion of Mexico during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1857, sixty Italian families settled here as part of an agreement between the Mexican and Italian governments to promote immigration to Mexico. In 1866, Tecolutla was occupied by imperial forces under Maximilian five days after they took Papantla. The municipality was created in 1879, combining the parishes of Tecolutla, De Cristo and Boca de Lima, and the community of Tecolutla was elevated to the status of town in 1882. In 1942, two ships, the Tuxpan and the Choapas, were torpedoed while in the port of Tecolutla. Major flooding of the Tecolutla in October 1999 cause widespread damage in the town, including washing away a number of homes and businesses. Most of this damage has now been repaired and many reconstructed roads and bridges are better than before. Tecolutla suffered another natural disaster August 27, 2007, when the eye of Hurricane Dean came ashore here. The intensity of the winds and rain led Civil Protection to issue a red alert for the region. The storm knocked out power as rivers and streams overflowed, closing down much of the infrastructure such as banks, roads and gas stations. It also forced 15,000 people into shelters in the tourist areas of this part of Veracruz state. The Tecolutla \\"Monster\\" Skull of the \\"monster\\" at the community marine museum Vertebrae and ribs from the \\"monster\\" In the Marine Museum there are bones and photographs from 3 or even 4 mixed, uncompleted sperm whales of the species Physeter macrocephalus (Linneus, 1758). These evidences are presented as a single animal called the Tecolutla monster. This legend becomes from an unreported stranding of a cetacean and its appearance after being cut off, burned, rotten and transported to Tecolutla's beach. At first, it was falsely identified as a narwhal, but other people thought that the carcass was from a fin whale (Balaenoptera sp.), or another whale. However, the lack of an immediate and certain identification of the animal, and the loss of the original material, makes the cetacean unidentifiable. Few fin whale specimens are found in the Gulf of Mexico. But the stranding of whales have been recorded on Mexico's Atlantic coast. A whale arrived as far south as Quintana Roo (extreme southern Mexico). In Tecolutla itself, a sperm whale body washed up in 1976 and a pilot whale body in 1991. The descriptions of the dead creature vary because of imagination and ignorance, therefore the popular name is \\"monster\\". Some people found the animal looks like a giant worm, or with fibers hanging like a mane, or with either \\"wool\\" or armor plating, or both, or with a gigantic beak or bone-like fang sticking out of its head; the weight of the carcass was estimated between 24 and 35 tons, measuring 22 m long and 2 m wide. It was also rumored that an unknown Biology Institute of California wanted to buy the creature, also believing it to be prehistoric. The carcass arrived to the Palmar Susana's beach between Tecolutla and Nautla. It was found by locals who kept its existence secret at first. It took 14 hours to get the animal out of the water and to raise it onto shore. It was thought that money could be made from the \\"ivory\\" of its bones and they began to cut it apart on the beach. Eventually, they informed the municipal president of Tecolutla, C√©sar Guerrero, that it was a crashed plane. A volunteer rescue party was organized but what they found was an enormous head, with the rest of the creature partially buried. It was decided to bring the carcass to the town of Tecolutla, using a truck with a fifteen-meter platform borrowed from Mexican state oil company (PEMEX). It was placed on beach in front of the lighthouse, and photographs were taken. Word of the discovery and mystery of the washed-up creature spread and many people came to see the carcass. It was recommended to bury the creature, which was decomposing rapidly, but the mayor of Tecolutla refused, and kept it as a tourist attraction in spite of the odor. The Marine Museum which was reopened in 1997 after being closed for a number of years. Besides the bones of the \\"monster\\", there are also paintings of the monster in the museum. Despite this, few nowadays in Tecolutla know about the monster. Most witnesses from the time have moved away or have died. There are no local newspapers in Tecolutla and the nearest publication in Poza Rica did not keep papers from the time period. The city government does not have records, and only a few photographs survive. The municipality The municipality of Tecolutla is located in the north of Veracruz state in a region known as Totonacapan. Most of the municipality's borders are defined by the Tecolutla River and the Gulf of Mexico. The municipality contains 375 communities(inegi) and has a surface area of 471.31km2 and an average altitude of ten meters above sea level. It borders the municipalities of Papantla, Mart√≠nez de la Torre, and Guti√©rrez Zamora with the Gulf of Mexico to the east. The climate is hot with average rainfall for Mexico with an average temperature of 23.6¬∞C. The area is suited to fast-growing trees with soft wood such as guarumbo, chancarro, jonote, guanacaxtle and sangrado. Much of the municipality is rural, with agriculture and livestock as the economic basis. Important crops grown here include corn, green chiles, beans, \\"platano roatan\\" (a species of banana), vanilla, sugar cane, tobacco, pineapple, oranges, limes, grapefruit, mandarin oranges and coconuts. Livestock raising includes dairy and beef cattle, pigs, sheep, fowl and bees. Second is fishing with only a fraction of the municipality's land developed. Fishing here is developed by way of cooperations, harvesting common bass (mojarra), crabs, shrimp, oyster, shad and sea bass. One native crop is the growing of vanilla beans. They have been grown here since far into pre-Hispanic times and they were sent to the Aztecs as tribute. Harvest time is November and December and one can see the beans drying in the sun. The developed areas, basically the town of Tecolutla, also rely on tourism, mostly in the way of hotels and other lodges as well as restaurants. The population of the municipality is 24, 258 with only 4,523 living in the town proper. There is still a definite Totonac presence here. About 6% of thepopulation speaks Totonac. These people can be spotted by their distinctive dress. The men wear white, wide-leg trousers, gathered to a tight cuff above the ankle and a loose white shirt, gathered from a yoke, which sometimes has a small cape at the back. The women wear embroidered blouses and lacy skirts, both in white. Over the skirt, they wear a brightly colored half- apron. They also wear a brightly colored scarf similar to a quechquemitl. This is tied at the back of the neck, draped over the chest and then tucked into the apron.

It is endemic to eastern Australia. The species is named after Count Peroffsky (1794-1857), benefactor of the St. Petersburg Botanical Garden. Description Leaf detail. This cycad is up to seven metres tall but more usually reaches about four metres. The trunk is up to eighty centimetres in diameter and is covered by the persistent remains of leaf bases. The crown is formed from numerous leaves up to three metres long, each bearing about two hundred narrow, glossy, dark green leaflets, somewhat lax, spreading and softly coriaceous. Each has seven to thirteen parallel veins which helps to distinguish this species from other members of the genus.The Cycad Pages The cylindrical cones are some of the largest of all cycad cones, rivaled only by Encephalartos transvenosus.Jones, David L. Cycads of the World. (1993) Reed Books. The male cones can reach seventy five centimetres long and the female cones ninety centimetres, weighing up to forty five kilograms. The seeds are large and numerous and have red sarcotesta. All parts of the plant, especially the seeds, are toxic to both livestock and humans; if ingested, the seeds can cause severe gastrointestinal irritation and abdominal cramps, vomiting and nausea, diarrhoea, and potentially also liver damage and muscular paralysis.Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service: Burrawang palm (Lepidozamia peroffskyana) Distribution and habitat L. peroffskyana cone This species is found in southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales, occurring between Gympie, north of Brisbane and the Manning River near Forster.

Hepker and Kilian also wrote the score for Rendition, the Gavin Hood film starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep amongst others. Hepker and Kilian also co- composed the score for \\"The Bird Can‚Äôt Fly\\" by Dutch director Threes Anna. Hepker wrote the music for the AIDs documentary \\"Into the Light\\" which featured the voice of Kenyan artist Ayub Ogada. In the 1990s Hepker toured extensively as pianist/keyboardist with Shirley Bassey, Johnny Clegg and many talented South African artists including Vusi Mahlasela, Vicky Sampson, MarcAlex and Yvonne Chaka Chaka. A classically trained pianist (taught by Adolph Hallis) and multi-instrumentalist, Hepker lived and worked in South Africa as a musical director and composer - doing jingles, musicals and TV shows when not off touring the world. He was a successful Musical Director of stage productions of Joseph and his Technicolor Dreamcoat for PACT at the State Theatre in Pretoria and The Theatre on the Track in Kyalami, where he also co-devised and musically directed Heaven Can't Wait and California Dreamin' . In the mid 1990s he had a pop duo called 'zelig' (with dyna-mite vocalist Gabriel). Paul moved to Hollywood in 1997, where he now writes for film, TV and stage.

Early life and education Kurzban was born in Poughkeepsie, New York on September 29, 1969. He received his undergraduate degree in psychology from Cornell University in 1991. Interest in Disney productions throughout his youth led him to take a job at Euro Disney in 1992. He entered graduate school in 1993 and completed a Ph.D. in psychology at UCSB in 1998. He continued his training with postdoctoral work in the department of anthropology at UCLA, and the division of humanities and social sciences at Caltech. He also spent two years at the Economic Science Laboratory of the University of Arizona studying with Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith. Career Kurzban's research focuses on evolutionary approaches to understanding human social behavior. Robert Kurzban was trained by two pioneers in the field of evolutionary psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, and his research focuses on evolutionary approaches to understanding human social behavior. He takes an adaptationist view of human psychology, studying the adaptive function, or, survival value, in the adoption of traits by humans. His work is aimed at understanding the functions of psychological mechanisms occurring in human social life. He uses methods drawn from social psychology, cognitive psychology, and especially experimental economics. His early work investigated the social category described as \\"race\\" and it was directed at a hypothesis being proposed at the time, that people \\"automatically\\" encode the race of people they observe. Kurzban argued that because humans evolved in a world in which they rarely, if ever, encountered people of significantly different physical appearance from themselves, it was unlikely that the human brain evolved with a mechanism to encode what is currently referred to as \\"race\\". A series of experiments showed that with a relatively minor manipulation in the laboratory, the extent to which people categorized others by \\"race\\" could be reduced. He also has done research on cooperation, morality, and mate choice (including speed dating). Evolutionary psychology has come under attack from a number of critics. Kurzban has been active in defending the discipline from prominent detractors and also has worked to clarify the principle of cognitive modularity, which plays an important role in the discipline. In 2009, he gave a plenary address at the annual meeting of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in Fullerton, California.

A Democrat, he served as the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas for ten terms, from 1947 to 1967. As a United States Navy officer in World War II, he received the U.S. military's highest decoration‚Äîthe Medal of Honor‚Äîfor rescuing the crews of several downed airplanes. Biography Gordon was born in Morrilton, the seat of Conway County in central Arkansas, to Edward Gordon and the former Ada Ruth Bearden. After attending Morrilton public schools through the 10th grade, he graduated from Columbia Military Academy, in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1933, where he was salutatorian. Gordon then went on to college at Arkansas Polytechnic College in Russellville. While enrolled in Arkansas Polytechnical College, he enlisted in Battery D, 206th Coast Artillery, Arkansas Army National Guard. Following graduation, he attend law school at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. While attending law school Gordon joined Sigma Nu Fraternity and served as chapter president. He graduated with a Juris Doctor degree in 1939. Gordon practiced law in his hometown of Morrilton before joining the Navy in May 1941. After qualifying as a naval aviator, he was sent to the southwest Pacific Ocean, where he would serve more than two years. He joined Patrol Squadron 34, nicknamed the \\"Black Cats\\", a PBY Catalina patrol and rescue squadron based at Samarai Advanced Seaplane Base in Milne Bay, New Guinea. By February 15, 1944, he was a lieutenant, junior grade, in command of a Catalina, Bureau Number 08139, which he nicknamed Arkansas Traveler. On that day, Gordon rescued 15 survivors of several downed aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor . He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant, and served in the Navy until 1945, when he was released from active duty. After the war, Gordon formed a business partnership with his brother, Edward Gordon, Jr., and returned to the practice of law in Morrilton. His political career began in 1946, when he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas under Governor Benjamin Travis Laney. He took office in January 1947 and was re-elected to nine more two-year terms, finally leaving office in January 1967. During his tenure he served under four different Governors: Laney (1945‚Äì1949), Sid McMath (1949‚Äì1953), Francis Cherry (1953‚Äì1955), and Orval Faubus (1955‚Äì1967). Gordon did not seek reelection in 1966, when the Democratic nominee, James Pilkinton of Hope, narrowly lost the general election to Maurice L. Britt, the first Republican to hold the state's second highest office since Reconstruction. Like Gordon, Britt was also a military hero. The Arkansas Aviation Historical Society selected Gordon in 1980 as one of five initial inductees in the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame. Medal of Honor mission On February 15, the Fifth Air Force attacked Kavieng on the island of New Ireland. The mission consisted of four squadrons of A-20 Havocs from the 3rd Bombardment Group that attacked shipping in the harbor, and seven squadrons of B-25's from the 38th and 345th Groups that bombed facilities along the harbor front. Accurate antiaircraft fire shot down eight of the low-level strafers. Gordon's PBY Catalina, Arkansas Traveler, was on station near Witu, escorted by four P-47 Thunderbolts of the 348th Fighter Group. In one of the \\"most striking rescues of the war,\\" he made four separate landings and take-offs under Japanese fire. On his first landing, endangered by waves that were breaking 16 to 18 feet high, he searched for the crew of a downed A-20 without locating survivors. The aircraft was severely stressed and took on water from numerous burst seams. After taking off, Gordon was directed twice to pick up nine men of two B-25s that had ditched, forced to shut down one or both engines to effect the rescues, while two other B-25s strafed the Japanese gun positions to suppress their fire. After the PBY started back to base and its fighter escorts had departed, low on fuel, one of the B-25s spotted two rafts and called back the rescue aircraft. Despite heavy seas and a damaged aircraft, Lt.(j.g.) Gordon executed another landing only 600 yards from shore, overflying Japanese gun positions at low level to land, and picked up an additional six airmen. His final takeoff with 24 men aboard was with a dangerously overloaded aircraft, but he managed to keep the Catalina's nose up until he reached flying speed without nosing over in the rough seas. Gordon received the Medal of Honor in September 1944, and his crew of eight each received the Silver Star. Medal of Honor citation Lieutenant Gordon's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For extraordinary heroism above and beyond the call of duty as commander of > a Catalina patrol plane in rescuing personnel of the U.S. Army 5th Air Force > shot down in combat over Kavieng Harbor in the Bismarck Sea, February 15, > 1944. On air alert in the vicinity of Vitu Islands, Lt. (then Lt. j.g.) > Gordon unhesitatingly responded to a report of the crash and flew boldly > into the harbor, defying close-range fire from enemy shore guns to make 3 > separate landings in full view of the Japanese and pick up 9 men, several of > them injured.

Plants in this genus are terrestrial, lithophytic or epiphytic herbs with a wide range of forms. The flowers are usually resupinate and small to medium sized, yellow, yellow-green or purplish with spreading sepals and petals. The labellum is usually larger than the sepals and petals and is lobed, sometimes with a toothed or wavy margin and one or two calli at its base. Description Orchids in the genus Liparis are terrestrial, lithophytic or epiphytic herbs, usually with one to a few leaves which may be linear to egg-shaped, thin or leathery and sometimes pleated. The flowers are small to medium sized, resupinate and arranged on a flowering stem with small bracts. The flowers are usually dull yellow, yellow-green or purplish and often have an unpleasant odour. The sepals and petals turn downwards and the dorsal sepal is free but the lateral sepals are sometimes fused for at least part of their length. The petals are free from each other and often different in size and shape from the sepals. The labellum is usually larger than both the sepals and petals, often lobed with a toothed or wavy edge and one or two calli at its base. There are two pairs of waxy, oval pollinia, each with a viscidium. Taxonomy and naming The genus Liparis was first formally described in 1817 by Louis Claude Richard and the description was published in Die Orchideis Europaeis Annotationes. The name Liparis is from the Ancient Greek word liparos meaning \\"oily\\", \\"greasy\\", \\"sleek\\" or \\"shiny\\", referring to the smooth leaves. Distribution Species of Liparis occur on every continent except Antarctica. They are found in tropical Asia, subtropical and tropical parts of the Americas, Africa, New Guinea and Australia.

This monument is inspired by the painting Horizontes of antioquian artist Francisco Antonio Cano, that depicts a couple of peasants who point to unknown lands in the horizon, where they hope to colonize. The monument represents the strong will of the first inhabitants of the area who arrived to this selvatic location to start a settlement with their families, looking for news options of survival and escaping the civil wars that affected the northern areas of the country during the 19th century. It is a 28-meter high bronze sculpture and was dedicated in 1978. Its current location is in the main square of Armenia.

Name and description The red \\"rubra\\" variety; rare in the wild, is the most common variety in cultivation The name \\"optica\\" means \\"eye-like\\" and refers to the rounded windows at the top of the leaves. In habitat, these two leaves emerge just above the surface of the ground. The well-known and widely cultivated \\"rubra\\" variety is a bright purple/red colour. While most specimens of Lithops optica do not have this colour, the \\"rubra\\" variety is by far the most commonly cultivated. Distribution This species occurs in the coastal areas around L√ºderitz, Namibia. This is a very arid \\"mist-belt\\" area, with winter rainfall but extremely dry conditions. It is therefore one of the few species of Lithops which is adapted to a winter rainfall climate. Its natural habitat is sandy soil in rocky areas. It is threatened by habitat loss. Cultivation Like all Lithops, it requires extremely well-drained soil. Like all Lithops it also grows in annual cycles, as the leaf-pairs flower, and then each produces a new leaf-pair that replaces the old one (which shrivels away). The principal rule of watering is that Lithops should be kept dry from when they finish flowering, up until the old leaf-pairs are fully replaced.

Seed is known for his involvement in helping several British celebrities, members of the Royal Family and politicians decide whether or not to convert to Catholicism.  Early life  Michael Seed was born as Steven Wayne Godwin in Manchester, 1957, to a young woman called Marie, and baptised into the Catholic Church as an infant. He was adopted in 1958 by Joseph and Lillian Seed. During his early childhood he and Lillian were subjected to abuse at the hands of his adoptive father, resulting in a number of suicide attempts by his mother. Seed was subjected to relentless bullying during his school years, alongside the constant abuse he faced at home. Following the suicide of his mother in 1966 and the death of his father in 1968, he was raised by his maternal grandmother. In 1970 Seed became a pupil at Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, where he remained for four years. His 2007 autobiography, Nobody's Child, later became an important source for the Independent Inquiry into Childhood Sexual Abuse investigating the abuse of pupils there at this time. Seed, who was himself abused by one of the teachers, described the level of sexual abuse at Knowl View as \\"beyond horror\\".  Vocation  In his youth, Seed was involved in several different Christian denominations, including Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, the Salvation Army and the Baptist Union. Eventually, at the age of 18, Seed joined the Society of African Missions in 1976 and spent a year at the novitiate in Cork (city) in Ireland. After the novitiate he went to the SMA's house in New Barnet in north London and attended the now-defunct Missionary Institute in Mill Hill along with members of several religious congregations which prepare men for a lifetime of service to the poor of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Seed struck up a relationship with the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement (the Society of the Atonement) who ran a library close to Westminster Cathedral and eventually left his missionary society and joined the Franciscans, taking his first vows in 1982. He was ordained a priest on 18 January 1986 and, in 1988, Cardinal Basil Hume assigned him the post of Secretary for Ecumenical Affairs at Westminster Cathedral. Whilst at Westminster Cathedral, Seed assisted numerous people, including MPs Ann Widdecombe, John Gummer as well as The Duchess of Kent, in their decision to enter the Catholic Church. He celebrated Masses for the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his family, prior to Blair's conversion to Catholicism in December 2007. He also has many connections with celebrity figures such as Charles Kennedy, and Terry Wogan .Guardian Newspaper 7 April 2006 In 2003 Seed was painted by artist Christian Furr who has done a portrait of the Queen. Activities In 1991 Seed appeared on an After Dark television discussion programme about sexaholics. He was later quoted saying: \\"I went on a programme called After Dark on Channel 4 once with a prostitute, a psychiatrist and a gay man. Afterwards they all started coming to see me.\\"The Daily Mail, 23 May 2006 In 2007, it was rumoured that Seed was in trouble with Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor; allegedly, the Cardinal was upset that Seed had introduced wealthy businessmen to government officials in an attempt to secure financing for Labour's flagship academies. Some speculated that Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor saw this move by Seed as unwarranted support of specific Labour policies. The Cardinal was also reported as being annoyed at Seed's statement that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, would become a Catholic upon leaving Downing Street. As noted above, Blair did indeed become a Catholic shortly after leaving office. However, Michael Seed only vacated his long standing position as Ecumenical Advisor on the retirement of Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor in 2008 when he was succeeded by Cardinal Vincent Nichols as the Archbishop of Westminster. Catholic peer Lord Alton said: \\"I hope that any decision taken about his future will ensure that his wonderful gifts are used in the most productive way. Fr Michael is hugely respected at Westminster where he has quietly undertaken very considerable pastoral work.\\" Evening Standard Catherine Pepinster, editor of Catholic newspaper The Tablet, added: \\"Many Catholics are dismayed by the departure of Fr Seed. He has been a fixture of Catholic life in London for many years and has done much to raise the church's profile.\\" In 2004, Pope John Paul II awarded him a cross of honour for his work. Michael Seed has written several books including his autobiography \\"Nobody's Child\\" in 2008 which has had excellent reviews and has been described as a \\"blazing testament to one human's raw courage, and his remarkable ability to finally triumph over the horrors of a stolen childhood.\\" Other books include \\"Thinking of Becoming a Catholic\\" (2007) and \\"I Will See You in Heaven\\" (1996), \\"Will I See You in Heaven\\" (1999), and \\"Letters from the Heart\\" (2000). One of his first books, \\"I Will See You in Heaven, Where Animals Don't Bite\\" (1991) is a collection of letters about heaven by various famous people with a foreword by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Cardinal Basil Hume was one of the book's contributors and enjoyed a very close relationship with Michael Seed who helped him raise funds for the homeless centre The Passage which is still going strong. One of these fund raising events arranged by Michael Seed was the annual \\"A Night Under The Stars\\". On 15 July 2009, Seed launched the second volume of his autobiography, Sinners and Saints, at Stringfellows lapdancing club in London's West End. The book received mixed reviews: The Telegraph \\"enjoyed the strange tale of carnality and cardinals\\". Church Times referred to it as an \\"unpriestly book\\" and \\"careless talk\\" with A.N. Wilson of The Observer bluntly stating that \\"He has now left Westminster Cathedral but he will surely not have left the public stage. Where two or three Hello!-style celebs are gathered together, Father Michael Seed will surely be there in their midst, managing to be both clumsily sycophantic and intrusive.\\" Regarding the alleged claim, by Seed, that Alan Clark became a Catholic on his death bed, Wilson asks \\"Which of the two ‚Äì the dead Clark or God ‚Äì leaked the story of his deathbed conversion to a newspaper we shall never know.\\" Others, such as Peter Stanford, writing in The Independent newspaper point out that if Seed were \\"...indiscreet, the queue of people wanting to sit where I am now would quickly disappear.\\" Indeed, even regarding his celebration of the Mass in Downing Street Stanford writes: \\"Father Seed is eager to portray this special treatment not as a privilege, but as a kind of torture. \\"Mrs Blair\\" ‚Äì he never uses their first names ‚Äì \\"absolutely hated it. She hated not being able to go to Mass with everyone else.\\" In a 2007 article in the Telegraph an anonymous friend is quoted as saying, \\"I've seen him after he has drunk far too much white wine in Soho. And I've seen his deeply spiritual side. He really does care. He is an extraordinary, special chap. A party in my garden once attracted the attention of the noise abatement people. He charmed them to death - they thought he was in fancy dress - and they gave up and went away. He's always up to adventures and mishaps.\\" In 2011, it was reported that, due to financial irregularities, Fr. Seed had been suspended by the Society of the Atonement. As of September 2020, he did not appear in the Society's list of friars.

He served as Chief of Staff for the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee for much of the war. Biography Chilton was born in Loudoun County, Virginia, to a prominent family. He was the son of William and Sarah (Powell) Chilton. He secured an appointment to the United States Military Academy and graduated 48th out of 57 cadets in the Class of 1837. Brevetted as a second lieutenant, he was assigned to the 1st Regiment of Dragoons for western frontier duty. On September 25, 1845, he married Laura Ann Thomson Mason (1829‚Äì1911) in New York City. The couple would have three children‚ÄîLaura Mason, Emily Virginia, and Robert Lee Chilton. He served in Kansas, Texas and the Indian Territory. While fighting in a series of skirmishes with Osage Indians he also served as acting Quartermaster. Promoted to captain in 1846 Chilton fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, winning the brevet rank of major for gallantry in action at the Battle of Buena Vista. Under severe Mexican fire, he picked up the wounded Colonel Jefferson Davis and carried him to safety. He was assigned to administrative duty as a Paymaster with the rank of major in 1854; serving in various posts in Washington, D.C., New York City, Detroit, Michigan, and San Antonio, Texas. Chilton was in Texas when he received word of the bombardment of Fort Sumter. He resigned his commission in the U.S. Army on April 29, 1861, and traveled home to Virginia. He enrolled in the Confederate service as an adjutant general with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He served on the staff of fellow Virginian Robert E. Lee, rising to chief of staff. He did not pen the famous Lost Order during the Maryland Campaign. The identity of the writer of the lost order that McClellan received from the field is yet to be identified. (See \\"Special Order 191-Ruse of War\\") Although nominated for brigadier general in October 1862 and despite firm support from General Lee, Chilton's appointment was not officially confirmed by the Confederate Congress until February 16, 1864, most likely due to repeated clashes with the Confederate Senate and with fellow officers, most notably John B. Magruder. Following the Gettysburg Campaign, he served as inspector general for the Army of Northern Virginia for the rest of the war, with his headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. He rarely led troops in the field, with the exception of a successful attack in May 1864 when he led a small force of Virginia troops in routing Federal troops from the Army of the James that were raiding the important Richmond & Petersburg Railroad. Following the cessation of hostilities in early 1865, Chilton returned to civilian life. He moved to Columbus, Georgia, where he became president of a local manufacturing company. He died of apoplexy in Columbus in 1879. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Honors The Major Robert H.

Well-read in the economics, history and mission of the American labor movement, he was a forceful and articulate spokesman for organized labor and was often invited to testify before House and Senate committees on legislation affecting working people. During his twelve years as IAM President, he substantially expanded the union's human rights, community services, job safety, public relations and organizing programs. Early life \\"Wimpy,\\" as he was known, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Joseph \\"Joe Winnie\\" Winpisinger, a journeyman printer with The Plain Dealer, and Edith (Knodel) Winpisinger. He was President of his freshman class at John Marshall High School on Cleveland's West Side, but he left highschool before graduating. He enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve on October 14, 1942. Testing by the Navy revealed leadership potential, and he was assigned to the Navy V-12 Program, designed to provide a college-level education to potential junior officers. He left the program after several months and was transferred to the USS LST 310 where he served as a motor mechanics mate. He saw action as a crew member of the LST 310 in the invasion of Sicily and the D-Day invasion at Normandy, where the ship landed troops on Easy Green beach. Discharged from the Naval Reserve on July 15, 1947, Winpisinger returned to Cleveland where he worked as a \\"gypsy mechanic\\", repairing automobile transmissions at local service stations. He married Pearl Foster (born January 15, 1927, in Cleveland, Ohio) on July 16, 1946. Union career He secured a job as a mechanic at Lake Buick, a dealership on Lavern Avenue on Cleveland's West Side, and on July 15, 1947, obligated to Local Lodge 1363 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Within six months he was elected shop steward by his fellow union members. He was elected Recording Secretary of Local Lodge 1363 in 1948, and President of the Lodge in 1949. Union officials quickly recognized Winpisinger's talent and appointed him to the National Field Staff, as a Special Representative, in 1951, and assigned him to organizing tasks in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. IAM President Al Hayes promoted him to a position in Washington, D.C. in 1955 to work on a joint organizing program with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. That assignment ended in 1957, when the Teamsters were expelled from the AFL‚ÄìCIO. Winpisinger was then assigned to a variety of jobs throughout the union, including servicing members in the automotive, airline and brewery industries. He negotiated the union's first collective bargaining agreement with Continental Airlines in 1961, and was appointed Automotive Coordinator in 1965, overseeing the contracts of more than 100,000 auto mechanics. He was appointed co-chair of the IAM Pension Fund in May, 1965. He was elected General Vice President for Transportation on August 1, 1967, giving him a seat on the union's Executive Council. He was promoted to the position of Resident Vice President (Chief of Staff to the International President) in 1972. Winpisinger became International President of the IAM on July 1, 1977. He held his first staff meeting at one minute past midnight, demonstrating to the staff that \\"A new day has dawned at the IAM.\\" As President of the IAM, Winpisinger secured a seat on the Executive Board of the AFL‚ÄìCIO, where he clashed frequently with the organization's president, George Meany. Winpisinger called for Meany to step down, saying: \\"The best thing that could happen to the American Labor Movement would be for George Meany to drop dead.\\" In his three terms as IAM President, Winpisinger was described in many ways - flamboyant, aggressive, radical, blunt and outspoken. In the first few months of his term as president he displayed those characteristics when he publicly called for the retirement or resignation of then president of the AFL‚ÄìCIO, George Meany, because, in Winpisinger's estimation, an 83-year-old labor leader was too old to lead a workforce with an average age in its thirties. Winpisinger also gained national recognition when during the energy crisis of 1981. His union filed a lawsuit against the OPEC oil cartel, charging them with artificial price fixing in the price of petroleum. That, in turn, Winpisinger pointed out, had a negative impact on the American economy, causing production interruptions and layoffs, denying his members their right to work. And, he concluded, if the United States government wouldn't do anything about it, his union, as a representative of American workers, would. Because of his unique leadership style, Winpisinger was sought out by the media. In 1979, he was the subject of a Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) 60 Minutes television feature proclaiming, \\"Wimpy, a New Breed of Labor Leader.\\" A lifelong auto racing fan, Winpisinger was instrumental in the creation of Machinists Union Racing, which operated from 1981 to 1990 under the leadership of IAM national automotive coordinater Andy Kenopensky. Philosophically he was considered to be to the left of many of his colleagues in organized labor. He was especially concerned about labor's poor public image and saw a need for more imaginative leadership in communicating the labor movement's mission and accomplishments. According to Winpisinger that mission was to serve the nation's oppressed and underprivileged. Winpisinger was active in many efforts promoting cooperation between labor, management and government. He served as a member of the AFL‚ÄìCIO Executive Council; a member of the Finance Committee of the Democratic National Committee; co-chair of the Collective Bargaining and Group Relations Institute; a trustee of the National Planning Association; President of the Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition; a member of the Board of Governors of the National Space Institute; a board member of the Americans for Democratic Action; a board member of the Democratic Socialists of America; a member of the Executive Committee of the International Metalworkers' Federation; and an Executive Board member of International Guiding Eyes. Winpisinger and his wife, Pearl, lived in Silver Spring, Maryland, where they raised their five children. After his retirement, they moved to Columbia, Maryland, where they lived until his death. He died of cancer on December 11, the day after his 73rd birthday, at the Howard County Memorial Hospital in Columbia, Maryland. He left 5 children and 8 grandchildren Honors Winpisinger was awarded honorary degrees from several universities, including a Doctor of Laws from Wilmington College, Wilmington, Ohio. In 1981 the IAMAW opened up the William W. Winpisinger Education and Technology Center at Placid Harbor in Hollywood, Maryland. Winpisinger showed his readiness to push the boundaries of what many considered appropriate behavior for trade union leaders in one other important area. He visited the Soviet Union three times, twice during his tenure as IAM president (1983 and 1986) and again in 1989, just after his retirement. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and engaged in at least one face to face meeting and question and answer session with Soviet factory workers. He was positive and hopeful about the changes taking place in the Soviet Union and critical of others, including other union leaders, who made negative comments about the USSR but never visited.Fred Gaboury in Labor Today, June 22, 1989, a publication of the National Center for Trade Union Action and Democracy.

It is found in Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Uganda. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. The timber is extremely hard and used for railroad ties, groynes and bridge planking. Lophira alata used as the pavement of wooden footbridge in Wroc≈Çaw (Poland) Description The trunk of Lophira alata is usually straight, without buttress roots, but sometimes with a swollen base, and is usually clear of branches up to about . The bark is typically red-brown in colour, up to two centimetres thick, and has a bright yellow layer underneath. Young trees under four metres in height have greenish-grey bark, which becomes pink or light brown as the tree matures. Inside, the living sapwood is pale pink or whitish in colour, while the inner heartwood is dark red-brown to chocolate brown, with conspicuous white deposits of silica. The leaves of L. alata are up to long and are tough, fairly narrow and elongated, with a rounded or slightly indented tip, and tend to occur in clusters at the ends of the twigs.Azob√© Retrieved 2011-08-24 Biology Lophira alata sheds all its leaves during a short period of one to two weeks, usually in December, and the re-growth of bright red young leaves, often simultaneously on all L. alata trees in an area, can set the canopy ablaze with colour. The flowers of L. alata are white, fairly large, strong- smelling, and grouped in loose, branched, terminal inflorescences. Flowering occurs in adult trees with trunks over 50 centimetres in diameter, and takes place from the time the new leaves appear. L. alata is monoecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on the same tree, and the flowers are insect-pollinated. Fruiting takes place between January and March, the fruits becoming mature around March to April, although fruits do not always appear every year. The fruits, which are wind-dispersed, contain a single, oil-rich seed in a conical capsule, which is brown when mature and is surrounded by two unequally-sized membranous ‚Äòwings‚Äô, one up to six centimetres long and the other twice that size. Although L. alata needs full sunlight to grow, seedlings can persist for some time in the shady undergrowth and resume growth if breaks in the canopy occur. Uses The timber, known as azobe, is strong and resistant making it useful for demanding constructions outdoors. The timber also has better electrical properties than other wood making it possible to use it in poles for electric fences without separate isolators. The colour is reddish brown and the wood is abrasive, dulling tools rapidly. Sniffing the bark is used as a traditional treatment for headache. The leaves of Lophira alata afforded two new biflavonoids, lophirone L (1) and lophirone M (2), and the known luteolin and lithospermoside. Both biflavonoids were obtained in small quantities, and their structures show some new and unusual biflavonoid diversity.J Nat Prod. 2006 Aug;69(8):1206-8.

Likewise, two chalcone tetramers were isolated as inhibitors of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-activation induced by a tumor promoter, teleocidin B-4, from Lophira alata. One of them was identified as lophirachalcone. The other, named alatachalcone, was new, and the structure was determined by spectral properties. Both compounds also showed potent inhibitory activities against teleocidin B-4-induced inflammation on mouse ear. In an initiation- promotion experiment on mouse skin, alatachalcone (16 nmol) significantly inhibited tumor promotion caused by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 1.6 nmol).Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 1992 May;56(5):769-72.

It is endemic to Mexico in the outskirts of Quer√©taro. This species contains zero to trace amounts of mescaline; pellotine, whose psychoactive effects are comparatively minimal, is the principal alkaloid. The species name diffusa refers to the flat tubercles that are outspread without the plant having prominent ribs. Description The plants are yellow-green, usually lacking well-defined ribs and furrows. The podaria are rarely elevated, but are broad and flat. The tufts of hair are usually spread unequally on the prominent podaria. The flowers are commonly whitish to yellowish-white. Distribution Its natural habitat is semi-deserts on slopes and river beds, and under the shade of various shrubs and nurse plants. It is considered vulnerable due to a very small distribution range, small population of less than 3,000 individuals, and illegal collecting. It is collected illegally by people seeking peyote, and as an ornamental plant.

Originally recovered from the Downtonian of the Welsh borderlands, Tortilicaulis has since been recovered in the famous Ludlow Lane locality. Whilst it is generally accepted that Tortilicaulis was moss-like, it has not yet been recovered in a sufficiently good state of preservation to allow the detailed study necessary to firmly assign it to a taxonomic group. Fossils consist of an elongate apical sporangium (spore-forming organ), which may be branched, with spiralled walls attached to an undivided stalk that is also twisted. Unusually for plants of its time, spores of Tortilicaulis were covered all over with small granules. The initial suspicions of its describer, Dianne Edwards, were that it was a bryophyte, and comparisons have been made with several groups. A potential association with the moss Takakia is supported by features of the sporangia, such as the elongate shape, unusual twisting, and terminal position of the sporangia. As the sporangia of Tortilicaulis are branched, cladistic analysis suggests that the genus may instead belong to the Horneophytopsida, a class of the polysporangiophytes, which unlike bryophytes, have branched stems bearing sporangia. Its precise nature and hence classification remains unclear., p. 165 For the cladogram, see the Horneophytopsida article.
